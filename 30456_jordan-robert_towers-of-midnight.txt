robert jordan towers of midnight brian sanderson it soon became obvious even within the stedding that the pattern was growing frail the sky darkened our dead appeared standing in rings outside the borders of the stedding looking in most troublingly trees fell ill and no song would heal them it was in this time of sorrows that i stepped up to the great stump at first i was forbidden but my mother covril demanded i have my chance i do not know what sparked her change of heart as she herself had argued quite decisively for the opposing side my hands shook i would be the last speaker and most seemed to have already made up their minds to open the book of translation they considered me an afterthought and i knew that unless i spoke true humanity would be left alone to face the shadow in that moment my nervousness fled i felt only a stillness a calm sense of purpose i opened my mouth and i began to speak from the dragon reborn by loial son of arent son of halan of stedding shangtai prologue distinctions mandarbs hooves beat a familiar rhythm on broken ground as lan mandragoran rode toward his death the dry air made his throat rough and the earth was sprinkled white with crystals of salt that precipitated from below distant red rock formations loomed to the north where sickness stained them blight marks a creeping dark lichen he continued riding east parallel to the blight this was still saldaea where his wife had deposited him only narrowly keeping her promise to take him to the borderlands it had stretched before him for a long time this road hed turned away from it twenty years ago agreeing to follow moiraine but hed always known he would return this was what it meant to bear the name of his fathers the sword on his hip and the hadori on his head this rocky section of northern saldaea was known as the proska flats it was a grim place to ride not a plant grew on it the wind blew from the north carrying with it a foul stench like that of a deep sweltering mire bloated with corpses the sky overhead stormed dark brooding that woman lan thought shaking his head how quickly nynaeve had learned to talk and think like an aes sedai riding to his death didnt pain him but knowing she feared for him that did hurt very badly he hadnt seen another person in days the saldaeans had fortifications to the south but the land here was scarred with broken ravines that made it difficult for trollocs to assault they preferred attacking near maradon that was no reason to relax however one should never relax this close to the blight he noted a hilltop that would be a good place for a scouts post he made certain to watch it for any sign of movement he rode around a depression in the ground just in case it held waiting ambushers he kept his hand on his bow once he traveled a little farther eastward hed cut down into saldaea and cross kandor on its good roadways thensome gravel rolled down a hillside nearby lan carefully slid an arrow from the quiver tied to mandarbs saddle where had the sound come from to the right he decided southward the hillside there someone was approaching from behind it lan did not stop mandarb if the hoofbeats changed it would give warning he quietly raised the bow feeling the sweat of his fingers inside his fawnhide gloves he nocked the arrow and pulled carefully raising it to his cheek breathing in its scent goose feathers resin a figure walked around the southern hillside the man froze an old shaggymaned packhorse walking around beside him and continuing on ahead it stopped only when the rope at its neck grew taut the man wore a laced tan shirt and dusty breeches he had a sword at his waist and his arms were thick and strong but he didnt look threatening in fact he seemed faintly familiar lord mandragoran the man said hastening forward pulling his horse after ive found you at last i assumed youd be traveling the kremer road lan lowered his bow and stopped mandarb do i know you i brought supplies my lord the man had black hair and tanned skin borderlander stock probably he continued forward overeager yanking on the overloaded packhorses rope with a thickfingered hand i figured that you wouldnt have enough food tentsfour of them just in casesome water too feed for the horses and who are you lan barked and how do you know who i am the man drew up sharply im bulen my lord from kandor from kandor lan remembered a gangly young messenger boy with surprise he saw the resemblance bulen that was twenty years ago man i know lord mandragoran but when word spread in the palace that the golden crane was raised i knew what i had to do ive learned the sword well my lord ive come to ride with you and the word of my travel has spread to aesdaishar yes my lord elnynaeve she came to us you see told us what youd done others are gathering but i left first knew youd need supplies burn that woman lan thought and shed made him swear that he would accept those who wished to ride with him well if she could play games with the truth then so could he lan had said hed take anyone who wished to ride with him this man was not mounted therefore lan could refuse him a petty distinction but twenty years with aes sedai had taught him a few things about how to watch ones words go back to aesdaishar lan said tell them that my wife was wrong and i have not raised the golden crane but i dont need you son away with you lans heels nudged mandarb into a walk and he passed the man standing on the road for a few moments lan thought that his order would be obeyed though the evasion of his oath pricked at his conscience my father was malkieri bulen said from behind lan continued on he died when i was five bulen called he married a kandori woman they both fell to bandits i dont remember much of them only something my father told me that someday we would fight for the golden crane all i have of him is this lan couldnt help but look back as mandarb continued to walk away bulen held up a thin strap of leather the hadori worn on the head of a malkieri sworn to fight the shadow i would wear the hadori of my father bulen called voice growing louder but i have nobody to ask if i may that is the tradition is it not someone has to give me the right to don it well i would fight the shadow all my days he looked down at the hadori then back up again and yelled i would stand against the darkness allan mandragoran will you tell me i cannot go to the dragon reborn lan called to him or to your queens army either of them will take you and you you will ride all the way to the seven towers without supplies ill forage pardon me my lord but have you seen the land these days the blight creeps farther and farther south nothing grows even in oncefertile lands game is scarce lan hesitated he reined mandarb in all those years ago bulen called walking forward his packhorse walking behind him i hardly knew who you were though i know you lost someone dear to you among us ive spent years cursing myself for not serving you better i swore that i would stand with you someday he walked up beside lan i ask you because i have no father may i wear the hadori and fight at your side allan mandragoran my king lan breathed out slowly stilling his emotions nynaeve when next i see you but he would not see her again he tried not to dwell upon that he had made an oath aes sedai wiggled around their promises but did that give him the same right no a man was his honor he could not deny bulen we ride anonymously lan said we do not raise the golden crane you tell nobody who i am yes my lord bulen said then wear that hadori with pride lan said too few keep to the old ways and yes you may join me lan nudged mandarb into motion bulen following on foot and the one became two perrin slammed his hammer against the redhot length of iron sparks sprayed into the air like incandescent insects sweat beaded on his face some people found the clang of metal against metal grating not perrin that sound was soothing he raised the hammer and slammed it down sparks flying chips of light that bounced off his leather vest and his apron with each strike the walls of the roomsturdy leatherleaf wood fuzzed responding to the beats of metal on metal he was dreaming though he wasnt in the wolf dream he knew this though he didnt know how he knew the windows were dark the only light was that of the deep red fire burning on his right two bars of iron simmered in the coals waiting their turn at the forge perrin slammed the hammer down again this was peace this was home he was making something important so very important it was a piece of something larger the first step to creating something was to figure out its parts master luhhan had taught perrin that on his first day at the forge you couldnt make a spade without understanding how the handle fit to the blade you couldnt make a hinge without knowing how the two leaves moved with the pin you couldnt even make a nail without knowing its parts head shaft point understand the pieces perrin a wolf lay in the corner of the room it was large and grizzled fur the color of a pale gray river stone and scarred from a lifetime of battles and hunts the wolf laid its head on its paws watching perrin that was natural of course there was a wolf in the corner why wouldnt there be it was hopper perrin worked enjoying the deep burning heat of the forge the feel of the sweat trailing down his arms the scent of the fire he shaped the length of iron one blow for every second beat of his heart the metal never grew cool but instead retained its malleable redyellow what am i making perrin picked up the length of glowing iron with his tongs the air warped around it pound pound pound hopper sent communicating in images and scents like a pup jumping at butterflies hopper didnt see the point of reshaping metal and found it amusing that men did such things to a wolf a thing was what it was why go through so much effort to change it into something else perrin set the length of iron aside it cooled immediately fading from yellow to orange to crimson to a dull black perrin had pounded it into a misshapen nugget perhaps the size of two fists master luhhan would be ashamed to see such shoddy work perrin needed to discover what he was making soon before his master returned no that was wrong the dream shook and the walls grew misty im not an apprentice perrin raised a thickgloved hand to his head im not in the two rivers any longer im a man a married man perrin grabbed the lump of unshaped iron with his tongs thrusting it down on the anvil it flared to life with heat everything is still wrong perrin smashed his hammer down it should all be better now but it isnt it seems worse somehow he continued pounding he hated those rumors that the men in camp whispered about him perrin had been sick and berelain had cared for him that was the end of it but still those whispers continued he slammed his hammer down over and over sparks flew in the air like splashes of water far too many to come from one length of iron he gave one final strike then breathed in and out the lump hadnt changed perrin growled and grabbed the tongs setting the lump aside and taking a fresh bar from the coals he had to finish this piece it was so important but what was he making he started pounding i need to spend time with faile to figure things out remove the awkwardness between us but theres no time those lightblinded fools around him couldnt take care of themselves nobody in the two rivers ever needed a lord before he worked for a time then held up the second chunk of iron it cooled turning into a misshapen flattened length about as long as his forearm another shoddy piece he set it aside if you are unhappy hopper sent take your she and leave if you do not wish to lead the pack another will the wolfs sending came as images of running across open fields stalks of grain brushing along his snout an open sky a cool breeze a thrill and lust for adventure the scents of new rain of wild pastures perrin reached his tongs into the coals for the final bar of iron it burned a distant dangerous yellow i cant leave he held the bar up toward the wolf it would mean giving in to being a wolf it would mean losing myself i wont do that he held the nearmolten steel between them and hopper watched it yellow pinpricks of light reflecting in the wolfs eyes this dream was so odd in the past perrins ordinary dreams and the wolf dream had been separate what did this blending mean perrin was afraid hed come to a precarious truce with the wolf inside of him growing too close to the wolves was dangerous but that hadnt prevented him turning to them when seeking faile anything for faile in doing so perrin had nearly gone mad and had even tried to kill hopper perrin wasnt nearly as in control as hed assumed the wolf within him could still reign hopper yawned letting his tongue loll he smelled of sweet amusement this is not funny perrin set the final bar aside without working on it it cooled taking on the shape of a thin rectangle not unlike the beginnings of a hinge problems are not amusing young bull hopper agreed but you are climbing back and forth over the same wall come let us run wolves lived in the moment though they remembered the past and seemed to have an odd sense for the future they didnt worry about either not as men did wolves ran free chasing the winds to join them would be to ignore pain sorrow and frustration to be free that freedom would cost perrin too much hed lose faile would lose his very self he didnt want to be a wolf he wanted to be a man is there a way to reverse what has happened to me reverse hopper cocked his head to go backward was not a way of wolves can i perrin struggled to explain can i run so far that the wolves cannot hear me hopper seemed confused no confused did not convey the pained sendings that came from hopper nothingness the scent of rotting meat wolves howling in agony being cut off was not a thing hopper could conceive perrins mind grew mzzy why had he stopped forging he had to finish master luhhan would be disappointed those lumps were terrible he should hide them create something else show he was capable he could forge couldnt he a hissing came from beside him perrin turned surprised to see that one of the quenching barrels beside the hearth was boiling of course he thought the first pieces i finished i dropped them in there suddenly anxious perrin grabbed his tongs and reached into the turbulent water steam engulfing his face he found something at the bottom and brought it out with his tongs a chunk of whitehot metal the glow faded the chunk was actually a small steel figurine in the shape of a tall thin man with a sword tied to his back each line on the figure was detailed the ruffles of the shirt the leather bands on the hilt of the tiny sword but the face was distorted the mouth open in a twisted scream aram perrin thought his name was aram perrin couldnt show this to master luhhan why had he created such a thing the figurines mouth opened farther screaming soundlessly perrin cried out dropping it from the tongs and jumping back the figurine fell to the wood floor and shattered why do you think so much about that one hopper yawned a widejawed wolf yawn tongue curling it is common that a young pup challenges the pack leader he was foolish and you defeated him no perrin whispered it is not common for humans not for friends the wall of the forge suddenly melted away becoming smoke it felt natural for that to happen outside perrin saw an open daylit street a city with brokenwindowed shops maiden perrin said a smoky translucent image of himself stood outside the image wore no coat his bare arms bulged with muscles he kept his beard short but it made him look older more intense did perrin really look that imposing a squat fortress of a man with golden eyes that seemed to glow carrying a gleaming halfmoon axe as large as a mans head there was something wrong about that axe perrin stepped out of the smithy passing through the shadowy version of himself when he did he became that image axe heavy in his hand work clothes vanishing and battle gear replacing it he took off running yes this was maiden there were aiel in the streets hed lived this battle though he was much calmer this time before hed been lost in the thrill of fighting and of seeking faile he stopped in the street this is wrong i carried my hammer into maiden i threw the axe away a horn or a hoof young bull does it matter which one you use to hunt hopper was sitting in the sunlit street beside him yes it matters it does to me and yet you use them the same way a pair of shaido aiel appeared around a corner they were watching something to the left something perrin couldnt see he ran to attack them he sheared through the chin of one then swung the spike on the axe into the chest of the other it was a brutal terrible attack and all three of them ended on the ground it took several stabs from the spike to kill the second shaido perrin stood up he did remember killing those two aiel though he had done it with hammer and knife he didnt regret their deaths sometimes a man needed to fight and that was that death was terrible but that didnt stop it from being necessary in fact it had been wonderful to clash with the aiel hed felt like a wolf on the hunt when perrin fought he came close to becoming someone else and that was dangerous he looked accusingly at hopper who lounged on a street corner why are you making me dream this making you hopper asked this is not my dream young bull do you see my jaws on your neck forcing you to think it perrins axe streamed with blood he knew what was coming next he turned from behind aram approached murder in his eyes half of the former tinkers face was coated in blood and it dripped from his chin staining his redstriped coat aram swung his sword for perrins neck the steel hissing in the air perrin stepped back he refused to fight the boy again the shadowy version of himself split off leaving the real perrin in his blacksmiths clothing the shadow exchanged blows with aram the prophet explained it to me youre really shadowspawn have to rescue the lady faile from you the shadowy perrin changed suddenly into a wolf it leaped fur nearly as dark as that of a shadowbrother and ripped out arams throat no it didnt happen like that it is a dream hopper sent but i didnt kill him perrin protested some aiel shot him with arrows right before right before aram would have killed perrin the horn the hoof or the tooth hopper sent turning and ambling toward a building its wall vanished revealing master luhhans smithy inside does it matter the dead are dead twolegs do not come here not usually once they die i do not know where it is that they go perrin looked down at arams body i should have taken that fool sword from him the moment he picked it up i should have sent him back to his family does not a cub deserve his fangs hopper asked genuinely confused why would you pull them it is a thing of men perrin said things of twolegs of men always it is a thing of men to you what of things of wolves i am not a wolf hopper entered the forge and perrin reluctantly followed the barrel was still boiling the wall returned and perrin was once again wearing his leather vest and apron holding his tongs he stepped over and pulled out another figurine this one was in the shape of tod alcaar as it cooled perrin found that the face wasnt distorted like arams though the lower half of the figurine was unformed still a block of metal the figurine continued to glow faintly reddish after perrin set it down on the floor he thrust his tongs back into the water and pulled free a figure of jori congar then one of azi althone perrin went to the bubbling barrel time and time again pulling out figurine after figurine after the way of dreams fetching them all took both a brief second and what seemed like hours when he finished hundreds of figurines stood on the floor facing him watching each steel figure was lit with a tiny fire inside as if waiting to feel the forgers hammer but figurines like this wouldnt be forged theyd be cast what does it mean perrin sat down on a stool mean hopper opened his mouth in a wolf laugh it means there are many little men on the floor none of which you can eat your kind is too fond of rocks and what is inside of them the figurines seemed accusing around them lay the broken shards of aram those pieces seemed to be growing larger the shattered hands began working clawing on the ground the shards all became little hands climbing toward perrin reaching for him perrin gasped leaping to his feet he heard laughter in the distance ringing closer shaking the building hopper jumped slamming into him and then perrin started awake he was back in his tent in the field where theyd been camped for a few days now theyd run across a bubble of evil the week before that had caused angry red oily serpents to wiggle from the ground all through camp several hundred were sick from their bites aes sedai healing had been enough to keep most of them alive but not restore them completely faile slept beside perrin peaceful outside one of his men tapped a post to count off the hour three taps still hours until dawn perrins heart pounded softly and he raised a hand to his bare chest he halfexpected an army of tiny metal hands to crawl out from beneath his bedroll eventually he forced his eyes closed and tried to relax this time sleep was very elusive graendal sipped at her wine which glistened in a goblet trimmed with a web of silver around the sides the goblet had been crafted with drops of blood caught in a ring pattern within the crystal frozen forever tiny bubbles of brilliant red we should be doing something arangar said lounging on the chaise and eyeing one of graendals pets with a predatory hunger as he passed i dont know how you stand it staying so far from important events like some scholar holed up in a dusty corner graendal arched an eyebrow a scholar in some dusty corner natrins barrow was modest compared to some palaces she had known during the previous age but it was hardly a hovel the furnishings were fine the walls bearing an arching pattern of thick dark hardwoods the marble of the floor sparkling with inlaid chips of motherofpearl and gold arangar was just trying to provoke her graendal put the irritation out of her mind the fire burned low in the hearth but the pair of doors leading out onto a fortified walkway three stories in the airwere open letting in a crisp mountain breeze she rarely left a window or door open to the outside but today she liked the contrast warmth from one side a cool breeze from the other life was about feeling touches on your skin both passionate and icy anything other than the normal the average the lukewarm are you listening to me arangar asked i always listen graendal said setting aside her goblet as she sat on her own chaise she wore a golden enveloping dress sheer but buttoned to the neck what marvelous fashions these domani had ideal for teasing while revealing i loathe being so removed from things arangar continued this age is exciting primitive people can be so interesting the voluptuous ivoryskinned woman arched her back stretching arms toward the wall were missing all of the excitement excitement is best viewed from a distance graendal said i would think youd understand that arangar fell silent the great lord had not been pleased with her for losing control of egwene alvere well arangar said standing if that is your thought on it i will seek more interesting evening sport her voice was cool perhaps their alliance was wearing thin in that case it was time for reinforcement graendal opened herself and accepted the great lords dominance of her feeling the thrilling ecstasy of his power his passion his very substance it was so much more intoxicating than the one power this raging torrent of fire it threatened to overwhelm and consume her and despite being filled with the true power she could channel only a thin trickle of it a gift to her from moridin no from the great lord best not to begin associating those two in her mind for now moridin was naeblis for now only graendal wove a ribbon of air working with the true power was similar yet not identical to working with the one power a weave of the true power would often function in a slightly different way or have an unanticipated side effect and there were some weaves that could only be crafted by the true power the great lords essence forced the pattern straining it and leaving it scarred even something the creator had designed to be eternal could be unraveled using the dark ones energies it bespoke an eternal truth something as close to being sacred as graendal was willing to accept whatever the creator could build the dark one could destroy she snaked her ribbon of air through the room toward arangar the other chosen had stepped out onto the balcony graendal forbade the creation of gateways inside lest they damage her pets or her furnishings graendal lifted the ribbon of air up to arangars cheek and caressed it delicately arangar froze she turned suspicious but it took only a moment for her eyes to open wide she wouldnt have felt the goose bumps on her arms to indicate graendal was channeling the true power gave no hint no sign male or female no one could see or sense the weavesnot unless he or she had been granted the privilege of channeling the true power what the woman asked how moridin is naeblis graendal said yes but once the great lords favor in this regard was not confined to the naeblis she continued to caress arangars cheek and the woman flushed arangar like the other chosen lusted for the true power while fearing it at the same timedangerous pleasurable seductive when graendal withdrew her line of air arangar stepped back into the room and returned to her chaise then sent one of graendals pets to fetch her toy aes sedai lust still burned arangars cheeks likely she would use delana to distract herself arangar seemed to find it amusing to force the homely aes sedai into subservience delana arrived moments later she always remained nearby the shienaran woman was palehaired and stout with thick limbs graendals lips turned down such an unpretty thing not like arangar herself shed have made an ideal pet maybe someday graendal would have the chance to make her into one arangar and delana began to exchange affections on the chaise arangar was insatiable a fact graendal had exploited on numerous occasions the lure of the true power being only the latest of course graendal enjoyed pleasures herself but she made certain that people thought she was far more selfindulgent than she was if you knew what people expected you to be you could use those expectations itgraendal froze as an alarm went off in her ears the sound of crashing waves beating against one another arangar continued her pleasures she couldnt hear the sound the weave was very specific placed where her servants could trip it to give her warning graendal climbed to her feet strolling around the side of the room giving no indication of urgency at the door she sent a few of her pets in to help distract arangar best to discover the scope of the problem before involving her graendal walked down a hallway hung with golden chandeliers and ornamented with mirrors she was halfway down a stairwell when garumandthe captain of her palace guardcame bustling up he was saldaean a distant cousin of the queen and wore a thick mustache on his lean handsome face compulsion had made him utterly loyal of course great lady he said panting a man has been captured approaching the palace my men recognize him as a minor lord from bandar eban a member of house ramshalan graendal frowned then waved for garumand to follow as she made her way to one of her audience chambersa small windowless room decorated in crimson she wove a ward against eavesdropping then sent garumand to bring the intruder soon he returned with some guards and a domani man dressed in bright greens and blues a beauty mark shaped like a bell on his cheek his neat short beard was tied with tiny bells and they jingled as the guards shoved him forward he brushed off his arms glaring at the soldiers and straightened his ruffled shirt am i to understand that i have been delivered to he cut off with a choking sound as graendal wrapped him in weaves of air and dug into his mind he stuttered eyes growing unfocused i am piqor ramshalan he said in a monotone i have been sent by the dragon reborn to seek an alliance with the merchant family residing in this fortification as i am smarter and more clever than althor he needs me to build alliances for him he is particularly afraid of those living in this palace which i find ridiculous since it is distant and unimportant obviously the dragon reborn is a weak man i believe that by gaining his confidence i can be chosen as the next king of arad doman i wish for you to make an alliance with me not with him and will promise you favors once i am king i d graendal waved a hand and he cut off in midword she folded her arms hairs bristling as she shivered the dragon reborn had found her he had sent a distraction for her he thought he could manipulate her she instantly wove a gateway to one of her most secure hiding places cool air wafted in from an area of the world where it was morning not early evening best to be careful best to flee and yet she hesitated he must know pain he must know frustration he must know anguish bring these to him you will be rewarded arangar had fled from her place among aes sedai foolishly allowing herself to be sensed channeling saidin she still bore punishment for her failure if graendal left nowdiscarding a chance to twist althor about himselfwould she be similarly punished what is this arangars voice asked outside let me through you fools graendal what are you doing graendal hissed softly then closed the gateway and composed herself she nodded for arangar to be allowed into the room the lithe woman stepped up to the doorway eyeingand assessingramshalan graendal shouldnt have sent the pets to her the move had likely made her suspicious althor has found me graendal said curtly he sent this one to make an alliance with me but did not tell him who i was althor likely wants me to think that this man stumbled upon me accidentally arangar pursed her lips so youll flee run from the center of excitement again this from you i was surrounded by enemies flight was my only option it sounded like a practiced line words like those were a challenge arangar would serve her perhaps does that aes sedai of yours know compulsion arangar shrugged shes been trained in it shes passably skilled fetch her arangar raised an eyebrow but nodded in deference disappearing to run the errand herselfprobably to gain time to think graendal sent a servant for one of her dove cages they arrived with the bird before arangar was back and graendal carefully wove the true poweronce again thrilling in the rush of holding itand crafted a complex weave of spirit could she remember how to do this it had been so long she overlaid the weave on the birds mind her vision seemed to snap in a moment she could see two images in front of herthe world as she saw it and a shadowed version of what the bird saw if she focused she could turn her attention to one or the other it made her mind hurt the vision of a bird was entirely different from that of a human being she could see a much larger field and the colors were so vivid as to be nearly blinding but the view was blurry and she had trouble judging distance she tucked the birds sight into the back of her head a dove would be unobtrusive but using one was more difficult than a raven or a rat the dark ones own favored eyes the weave worked better on those than it did other animals though most vermin that watched for the dark one had to report back before he knew what theyd seen why that was she was not certainthe intricacies of the true powers special weaves never had made much sense to her not as much as they had to aginor at least arangar returned with her aes sedai who was looking increasingly timid these days she curtsied low to graendal then remained in a subservient posture graendal carefully removed her compulsion from ramshalan leaving him dazed and disoriented what is it you wish me to do great one delana asked glancing at arangar and then back at graendal compulsion graendal said as intricate and as complex as you can make it what do you wish it to do great lady leave him able to act like himself graendal said but remove all memory of events here replace them with a memory of talking to a merchant family and securing their alliance add a few other random requirements on him whatever occurs to you delana frowned but she had learned not to question the chosen graendal folded her arms and tapped one finger as she watched the aes sedai work she felt increasingly nervous althor knew where she was would he attack no he wouldnt harm women that particular failing was an important one it meant she had time to respond didnt she how had he managed to trace her to this palace she had covered herself perfectly the only minions shed let out of her sight were under compulsion so heavy that it would kill them to remove it could it be that the aes sedai he kept with himnynaeve the woman gifted in healing had been able to undermine and read graendals weaves graendal needed time and she needed to discover what althor knew if nynaeve almeara had the skill needed to read compulsions that was dangerous graendal needed to lay him a false trail delay himhence her requirement that delana create a thick compulsion with strange provisions in it bring him agony graendal could do that you next she said to arangar once delana had finished something convoluted i want althor and his aes sedai to find the touch of a man on the mind that would confuse them further arangar shrugged but did as asked laying down a thick and complex compulsion on the unfortunate ramshalans mind he was somewhat pretty did althor assume shed want him for one of her pets did he even remember enough of being lews therin to know that about her her reports on how much of his old life he remembered were contradictory but he seemed to be recalling more and more that was what worried her lews therin could have tracked her to this palace perhaps shed never expected that althor would be able to do the same arangar finished now graendal said releasing her weaves of air and speaking to ramshalan return and tell the dragon reborn of your success here ramshalan blinked shaking his head i yes my lady yes i believe the ties we made today will be extremely beneficial to both of us he smiled weakminded fool perhaps we should dine and drink to our success lady basene it has been a wearying trip to see you and i go graendal said coldly very well you will be rewarded when i am king her guards led him away and he began whistling with a selfsatisfied air graendal sat down and closed her eyes several of her soldiers stepped over to guard her their boots soft on the thick rug she looked through the doves eyes accustoming herself to its strange way of seeing at her order a servant picked it up and carried it to a window in the hallway outside the room the bird hopped onto the windowsill graendal gave it a soft nudge to go forward she wasnt practiced enough to take control completely flying was far more difficult than it looked the dove flapped out of the window the sun was lowering behind the mountains outlining them in angry red and orange and the lake below fell into a deep shadowy blueblack the view was thrilling but nauseating as the dove soared up into the air and landed on one of the towers ramshalan eventually walked out of the gates below graendal nudged the dove and it leaped off the tower plunging toward the ground graendal gritted her teeth at the stomachchurning descent the palace stoneworks becoming a blur the dove leveled out and flapped after ramshalan he seemed to be grumbling to himself though she could make out only rudimentary sounds through the doves unfamiliar earholes she followed him for some time through the darkening woods an owl would have been better but she didnt have one captive she chided herself for that the dove flew from branch to branch the forest floor was a messy tangle of underbrush and fallen pine needles she found that distinctly unpleasant there was light up ahead it was faint but the doves eyes could easily pick out light and shadow motion and stillness she nudged it to investigate leaving ramshalan the light was coming from a gateway in the middle of a clear patch spilling forth a warm glow there were figures standing before it one of them was althor graendal felt instant panic he was here looking down over the ridge toward her darkness within she hadnt known for certain if hed be here in person or if ramshalan would travel through a gateway to give his report what game was althor playing she landed her dove on a branch arangar was complaining and asking graendal what she was seeing shed seen the dove and would know what graendal was up to graendal concentrated harder the dragon reborn the man who had once been lews therin telamon he knew where she was he had once hated her deeply how much did he remember did he recall her murder of yanet althors tame aiel brought ramshalan forward and nynaeve inspected him yes that nynaeve did seem to be able to read compulsion she knew what to look for at least she would have to die althor relied upon her her death would bring him pain and after her althors darkhaired lover graendal nudged the dove down onto a lower branch what would althor do graendals instincts said he wouldnt dare move not until he unraveled her plot he acted the same now as he had during her age he liked to plan to spend time building to a crescendo of an assault she frowned what was he saying she strained trying to make sense of the sounds cursed birds earholesthe voices sounded like croaks callandor why was he talking about callandor and a box something burst alight in his hand the access key graendal gasped hed brought that with him it was nearly as bad as balefire suddenly she understood shed been played cold terrified she released the dove and snapped her eyes open she was still sitting in the small windowless room arangar leaning beside the doorway with arms folded althor had sent ramshalan in expecting him to be captured expecting him to have compulsion placed on him ramshalans only purpose was to give althor confirmation that graendal was in the tower light how clever hes become she released the true power and embraced lesswonderful saidar quickly she was so unsettled that her embrace nearly failed she was sweating go she had to go she opened a new gateway arangar turned staring through the walls in the direction of althor so much power what is he doing arangar she and delana had made the weaves of compulsion althor must think graendal dead if he destroyed the place and those compulsions remained althor would know that hed missed and that graendal lived graendal formed two shields and slammed them into place one for arangar one for delana the women gasped graendal tied off the weaves and bound the two in air graendal arangar said voice panicked what are you it was coming graendal leaped for the gateway rolling through it tumbling and ripping her dress on a branch a blinding light rose behind her she struggled to dismiss the gateway and caught one glimpse of the horrified arangar before everything behind was consumed in beautiful pure whiteness the gateway vanished leaving graendal in darkness she lay heart beating at a terrible speed nearly blinded by the glare shed made the quickest gateway she could one that led only a short distance away she lay in the dirty underbrush atop a ridge behind the palace a wave of wrongness washed over her a warping in the air the pattern itself rippling a balescream it was calleda moment when creation itself howled in pain she breathed in and out trembling but she had to see she had to know she rose to her feet left ankle twisted she hobbled to the treeline and looked down natrins barrowthe entire palacewas gone burned out of the pattern she couldnt see althor on his distant ridge but she knew where he was you she growled you have become far more dangerous than i assumed hundreds of beautiful men and women the finest shed gathered gone her stronghold dozens of items of power her greatest ally among the chosen gone this was a disaster no she thought live shed anticipated him if only by a few moments now he would think she was dead she was suddenly the safest shed been since escaping the dark ones prison except of course that shed just caused the death of one of the chosen the great lord would not be pleased she limped away from the ridge already planning her next move this would have to be handled very very carefully galad damodred lord captain commander of the children of the light yanked his booted foot free of the ankledeep mud with a slurping sound bitemes buzzed in the muggy air the stench of mud and stagnant water threatened to gag him with each breath as he led his horse to drier ground on the path behind him trudged a long twisting column four men wide each one as muddied sweaty and weary as he was they were on the border of ghealdan and altara in a swampy wetland where the oaks and spicewoods had given way to laurels and spidery cypress their gnarled roots spread like spindly fingers the stinking air was hotdespite the shade and cloud coverand thick it was like breathing in a foul soup galad steamed beneath his breastplate and mail his conical helmet hanging from his saddle his skin itching from the grime and salty sweat miserable though it was this route was the best way asunawa would not anticipate it galad wiped his brow with the back of his hand and tried to walk with head high for the benefit of those who followed him seven thousand men children who had chosen him rather than the seanchan invaders dull green moss hung from the branches drooping like shreds of flesh from rotting corpses here and there the sickly grays and greens were relieved by a bright burst of tiny pink or violet flowers clustering around trickling streams their sudden color was unexpected as if someone had sprinkled drops of paint on the ground it was strange to find beauty in this place could he find the light in his own situation as well he feared it would not be so easy he tugged stout forward he could hear worried conversations from behind punctuated by the occasional curse this place with its stench and biting insects would try the best of men those who followed galad were unnerved by the place the world was becoming a world where the sky was constantly clouded black where good men died to strange twistings of the pattern and where valdathe lord captain commander before galad had turned out to be a murderer and a rapist galad shook his head the last battle would soon come a clinking of chain mail announced someone moving up the line galad glanced over his shoulder as dain bornhald arrived saluted and fell into place beside him damodred dain said softly their boots squishing in mud perhaps we should turn back backward leads only to the past galad said scanning the pathway ahead i have thought about this much child bornhald this sky the wasting of the land the way the dead walk there is no longer time to find allies and fight against the seanchan we must march to the last battle but this swamp bornhald said glancing to the side as a large serpent slid through the underbrush our maps say we should have been out of it by now then surely we are near the edge perhaps dain said a trail of sweat running from his brow down the side of his lean face which twitched fortunately hed run out of brandy a few days back unless the map is in error galad didnt respond oncegood maps were proving faulty these days open fields would turn to broken hills villages would vanish pastures would be arable one day then suddenly overgrown with vines and fungus the swamp could indeed have spread the men are exhausted bornhald said theyre good menyou know they are but they are starting to complain he winced as if anticipating a reprimand from galad perhaps once he would have given one the children should bear their afflictions with pride however memories of lessons morgase had taught lessons he hadnt understood in his youthwere nagging at him lead by example require strength but first show it galad nodded they were nearing a dry clearing gather the men i will speak to those at the front have my words recorded then passed to those behind bornhald looked perplexed but did as commanded galad stepped off to the side climbing up a small hill he placed his hand on the hilt of his sword inspecting his men as the companies at the front gathered around they stood with slouched postures legs muddied hands flailed at bitemes or scratched at collars we are children of the light galad announced once they were gathered these are the darkest days of men days when hope is weak days when death reigns but it is on the deepest nights when light is most glorious during the day a brilliant beacon can appear weak but when all other lights fail it will guide we are that beacon this mire is an affliction but we are the children of the light and our afflictions are our strength we are hunted by those who should love us and other pathways lead to our graves and so we will go forward for those we must protect for the last battle for the light where is the victory of this swamp i refuse to feel its bite for i am proud proud to live in these days proud to be part of what is to come all the lives that came before us in this age looked forward to our day the day when men will be tested let others bemoan their fate let others cry and wail we will not for we will face this test with heads held high and we will let it prove us strong not a long speech he did not wish to extend their time in the swamp overly much still it seemed to do its duty the mens backs straightened and they nodded men who had been chosen to do so wrote down the words and moved back to read them to those who had not been able to hear when the troop continued forward the mens footsteps no longer dragged their postures were no longer slumped galad remained on his hillside taking a few reports letting the men see him as they passed when the last of the seven thousand had gone by galad noted a small group waiting at the base of the hill child jaret byar stood with them looking up at galad sunken eyes alight with zeal he was gaunt with a narrow face child byar galad said walking down from the hillside it was a good speech my lord captain commander byar said fervently the last battle yes it is time to go to it it is our burden galad said and our duty we will ride northward byar said men will come to us and we will grow an enormous force of the children tens of thousands hundreds of thousands we will wash over the land maybe we will have enough men to cast down the white tower and the witches rather than needing to ally with them galad shook his head we will need the aes sedai child byar the shadow will have dreadlords myrddraal forsaken yes i suppose byar seemed reluctant well hed seemed reluctant about the idea before but he had agreed to it our road is difficult child byar but the children of the light will be leaders at the last battle valdas misdeeds had tarnished the entire order more than that galad was increasingly convinced that asunawa had played a large role in the mistreatment and death of his stepmother that meant the high inquisitor himself was corrupt doing what was right was the most important thing in life it required any sacrifice at this time the right thing to do was flee galad could not face asunawa the high inquisitor was backed by the seanchan besides the last battle was more important galad stepped swiftly walking through the muck back toward the front of the line of children they traveled light with few pack animals and his men wore their armortheir mounts were laden with food and supplies at the front galad found trom speaking with a few men who wore leathers and brown cloaks not white tabards and steel caps their scouts trom nodded to him in respect the lord captain was one of galads most trusted men scouts say theres a small issue ahead my lord captain commander trom said what issue it would be best to show it to you directly sir said child barlett the leader of the scouts galad nodded him forward ahead the swampy forest seemed to be thinning thank the lightdid that mean they were nearly free no as galad arrived he found several other scouts looking out at a dead forest most trees in the swamp bore leaves though sickly ones but those ahead were skeletal and ashen as if burned there was some kind of sickly white lichen or moss growing over everything the tree trunks looked emaciated water flooded this area a wide but shallow river with a very slow current it had swallowed the bases of many of the trees and fallen tree limbs broke the dirty brown water like arms reaching toward the sky there are corpses my lord captain commander one of the scouts said gesturing upriver floating down looks like the remnants of a distant battle is this river on our maps galad asked one by one the scouts shook their heads galad set his jaw can this be forded its shallow my lord captain commander child barlett said but well have to watch for hidden depths galad reached out to a tree beside him and broke free a long branch the wood snapping loudly i will go first have the men remove their armor and cloaks the orders went down the line and galad took off his armor and wrapped it in his cloak then tied it to his back he hiked up his trousers as far as he could then stepped down the gentle bank and plowed forward into the murky water the sharply cold spring runoff made him tense his boots sank inches into the sandy bottom filling with water stirring up swirls of mud stout made a louder splash as he stepped into the water behind it wasnt too difficult to walk in the water only came up to his knees he used his stick to find the best footing those skeletal dying trees were unnerving they didnt seem to be rotting and now that he was closer he could better see the ashgray fuzz among the lichen that coated their trunks and branches the children behind splashed loudly as more and more of them entered the wide stream nearby bulbous forms floated down the river to catch upon rocks some were the corpses of men but many were larger mules he realized catching a better look at a snout dozens of them theyd been dead for some time judging by the bloat likely a village upstream had been attacked for its food this wasnt the first group of dead theyd found he reached the other side of the river then climbed out as he unrolled his trouser legs and donned his armor and cloak he felt his shoulder aching from the blows valda had given him his thigh still stung too he turned and continued down the game trail northward leading the way as other children reached the bank he longed to ride stout but he dared not though they were out of the river the ground was still damp uneven and pocked with hidden sinkholes if he rode he could easily cost stout a broken leg and himself a broken crown so he and his men walked surrounded by those gray trees sweating in the miserable heat he longed for a good bath eventually trom jogged up the line to him all men are across safely he checked the sky burn those clouds i can never tell what time it is four hours past midday galad said youre certain yes werent we to stop at midday to discuss our next step that meeting was to have taken place once they got through the swamp for now we have few choices galad said i will lead the men northward to andor the children have met hostility there i have some secluded land up in the northwest i will not be turned away there regardless of who controls the throne light send that elayne held the lion throne light send that she had escaped the tangles of the aes sedai though he feared the worst there were many who would use her as a pawn althor not the least of them she was headstrong and that could make her easy to manipulate well need supplies trom said forage is difficult and more and more villages are empty galad nodded a legitimate concern its a good plan though trom said then lowered his voice ill admit damodred i worried that youd refuse leadership i could not to abandon the children now after killing their leader would be wrong trom smiled its as simple as that to you isnt it it should be as simple as that to anyone galad had to rise to the station he had been given he had no other option the last battle comes and the children of the light will fight even if we have to make alliances with the dragon reborn himself we will fight for some time galad hadnt been certain about althor certainly the dragon reborn would have to fight at the last battle but was that man althor or was he a puppet of the tower and not the true dragon reborn that sky was too dark the land too broken althor must be the dragon reborn that didnt mean of course that he wasnt also a puppet of the aes sedai soon they passed beyond the skeletal gray trees reaching ones that were more ordinary these still had yellowed leaves too many dead branches but that was better than the fuzz about an hour later galad noted child barlett returning the scout was a lean man scarred on one cheek galad held up a hand as the man approached what word barlett saluted with arm to chest the swamp dries out and the trees thin in about one mile my lord captain commander the field beyond is open and empty the way clear to the north light be thanked galad thought he nodded to barlett and the man hurried back through the trees galad glanced back at the line of men they were muddied sweaty and fatigued but still they were a grand sight their armor replaced their faces determined they had followed him through this pit of a swamp they were good men pass the word to the other lords captain trom galad said have them send word to their legions well be out of this in under an hour the older man smiled looking as relieved as galad felt galad continued onward jaw set against the pain of his leg the cut was well bound and there was little danger of further damage it was painful but pain could be dealt with finally free of this bog he would need to plot their next course carefully staying away from any towns major roads or estates held by influential lords he ran through the maps in his headmaps memorized before his tenth nameday he was thus engaged when the yellow canopy thinned clouded sunlight peeking between branches soon he caught sight of barlett waiting at the edge of the line of trees the forest ended abruptly almost as neat as a line on a map galad sighed in relief relishing the thought of being out in the open again he stepped from the trees only then did an enormous force of troops begin to appear climbing over a rise directly to his right armor clanged horses whinnying as thousands of soldiers lined up atop the rise some were children in their plate and mail with conical helms shined to perfection their pristine tabards and cloaks shone sunbursts glittering at the breasts lances raised in ranks the larger number were foot soldiers not wearing the white of the children but instead simple brown leathers amadicians likely provided by the seanchan many had bows galad stumbled back hand going to his sword but he knew immediately that he had been trapped not a few of the children wore clothing adorned with the crook of the hand of the lightthe questioners if ordinary children were a flame to burn away evil the questioners were a raging bonfire galad did a quick count three to four thousand children and at least another six to eight thousand foot half of those with bows ten thousand fresh troops his heart sank trom bornhald and byar hastened out of the forest behind galad along with a group of other children trom cursed softly so galad said turning to the scout barlett you are a traitor you are the traitor child damodred the scout replied face hard yes galad said i suppose it could be perceived that way this march through the swamp had been suggested by his scouts galad could see now it had been a delaying tactic a way for asunawa to get ahead of galad the march had also left galads men tired while asunawas force was fresh and ready for battle a sword scraped in its sheath galad immediately raised a hand without turning peace child byar byar would have been the one to reach for his weapon probably to strike down barlett perhaps something of this could be salvaged galad made his decision swiftly child byar and child bornhald you are with me trom you and the other lords captain bring our men out in ranks onto the field a large cluster of men near the front of asunawas force was riding forward down the hillside many wore the crook of the questioners they could have sprung their ambush and killed galads group quickly instead they sent down a group to parley that was a good sign galad mounted suppressing a wince for his wounded leg byar and bornhald mounted as well and they followed him onto the field hoofbeats muffled by the thick yellowed grass asunawa himself was among the group approaching he had thick graying eyebrows and was so thin as to appear a doll made of sticks with fabric stretched across them to imitate skin asunawa was not smiling he rarely did galad pulled his horse up before the high inquisitor asunawa was surrounded by a small guard of his questioners but was also accompanied by five lords captain each of whom galad had met withor served underduring his short time in the children asunawa leaned forward in his saddle sunken eyes narrowing your rebels form ranks tell them to stand down or my archers will loose surely you would not ignore the rules of formal engagement galad said you would draw arrows upon men as they form ranks where is your honor darkfriends deserve no honor asunawa snapped nor do they deserve pity you name us darkfriends then galad asked turning his mount slightly ah seven thousand children who were under valdas command men your soldiers have served with eaten with known and fought beside men you yourself watched over not two months ago asunawa hesitated naming seven thousand of the children as darkfriends would be ridiculousit would mean that two out of three remaining children had gone to the shadow no asunawa said perhaps they are simply misguided even a good man can stray down shadowed paths if his leaders are darkfriends i am no darkfriend galad met asunawas eyes submit to my questioning and prove it the lord captain commander submits himself to no one galad said under the light i order you to stand down asunawa laughed child we hold a knife to your throat this is your chance to surrender golever galad said looking at the lord captain at asunawas left golever was a lanky bearded man as hard as they camebut he was also fair tell me do the children of the light surrender golever shook his head we do not the light will prove us victorious and if we face superior odds galad asked we fight on if we are tired and sore the light will protect us golever said and if it is our time to die then so be it let us take as many enemies with us as we may galad turned back to asunawa you see that i am in a predicament to fight is to let you name us darkfriends but to surrender is to deny our oaths by my honor as the lord captain commander i can accept neither option asunawas expression darkened you are not the lord captain commander he is dead by my hand galad said unsheathing his weapon holding it forward so that the herons gleamed in the light and i hold his sword do you deny that you yourself watched me face valda in fair combat as prescribed by law as by the law perhaps asunawa said but i would not call that fight fair you drew on the powers of shadow i saw you standing in darkness despite the daylight and i saw the dragons fang sprout on your forehead valda never had a chance harnesh galad said turning to the lord captain to the right of asunawa he was a short man bald missing one ear from fighting dragonsworn tell me is the shadow stronger than the light of course not the man said spitting to the side if the lord captain commanders cause had been honorable would he have fallen to me in a battle under the light if i were a darkfriend could i have slain the lord captain commander himself harnesh didnt answer but galad could almost see the thoughts in his head the shadow might display strength at times but the light always revealed and destroyed it it was possible for the lord captain commander to fall to a darkfriendit was possible for any man to fall but in a duel before the other children a duel for honor under the light sometimes the shadow displays cunning and strength asunawa cut in before galad could continue to question at times good men die you all know what valda did galad said my mother is dead is there an argument against my right to challenge him you have no rights as a darkfriend i will parley no more with you murderer asunawa waved a hand and several of his questioners drew swords immediately galads companions did the same behind he could hear his weary forces hastily closing their ranks what will happen to us asunawa if child fights child galad asked softly i will not surrender and i would not attack you but perhaps we can reunite not as enemies but as brothers separated for a time i will never associate with darkfriends asunawa said though he sounded hesitant he watched galads men asunawa would win a battle but if galads men stood their ground it would be a costly victory both sides would lose thousands i will submit to you galad said on certain terms no bornhald said from behind but galad raised a hand silencing him what terms would those be asunawa asked you swearbefore the light and the lords captain here with youthat you will not harm question or otherwise condemn the men who followed me they were only doing what they thought was right asunawas eyes narrowed his lips forming a straight line that includes my companions here galad said nodding to byar and bornhald every man asunawa they must never know questioning you cannot hinder the hand of the light in such a way this would give them free rein to seek the shadow and is it only fear of questioning that keeps us in the light asunawa galad asked are not the children valiant and true asunawa fell silent galad closed his eyes feeling the weight of leadership each moment he stalled increased the bargaining position for his men he opened his eyes the last battle comes asunawa we havent time for squabbling the dragon reborn walks the land heresy asunawa said yes galad said and truth as well asunawa ground his teeth but seemed to be considering the offer galad bornhald said softly dont do this we can fight the light will protect us if we fight we will kill good men child bornhald galad said without turning each stroke of our swords will be a blow for the dark one the children are the only true foundation that this world has left we are needed if my life is what is demanded to bring unity then so be it you would do the same i believe he met asunawas eyes take him asunawa snapped looking dissatisfied and tell the legions to stand down inform them that i have taken the false lord captain commander into custody and will question him to determine the extent of his crimes he hesitated but also pass the word that those who followed him are not to be punished or questioned asunawa spun his horse and rode away galad turned his sword and handed it out to bornhald return to our men tell them what happened here and do not let them fight or try to rescue me that is an order bornhald met his eyes then slowly took the sword at last he saluted yes my lord captain commander as soon as they turned to ride away rough hands grabbed galad and pulled him from stouts saddle he hit the ground with a grunt his bad shoulder throwing a spike of agony across his chest he tried to climb to his feet but several questioners dismounted and knocked him down again one forced galad to the ground a boot on his back and galad heard the metallic rasp of a knife being unsheathed they cut his armor and clothing free you will not wear the uniform of a child of the light darkfriend a questioner said in his ear i am not a darkfriend galad said face pressed to the grassy earth i will never speak that lie i walk in the light that earned him a kick to the side then another and another he curled up grunting but the blows continued to fall finally the darkness took him the creature that had once been padan fain walked down the side of a hill the brown weeds grew in broken patches like the scrub on the chin of a beggar the sky was black a tempest he liked that though he hated the one who caused it hatred it was the proof that he still lived the one emotion left the only emotion it was all that there could be consuming thrilling beautiful warming violent hatred wonderful it was the storm that gave him strength the purpose that drove him althor would die by his hand and perhaps after that the dark one wonderful the creature that had been padan fain fingered his beautiful dagger feeling the ridges of the designs in the fine golden wire that wrapped its hilt a large ruby capped the end of its hilt and he carried the weapon unsheathed in his right hand so that the blade extended between his first two fingers the sides of those fingers had been cut a dozen times over blood dripped from the tip of the dagger down onto the weeds crimson spots to cheer him red below black above perfect did his hatred cause that storm it must be so yes the drops of blood fell alongside spots of darkness that appeared on dead leaves and stems as he moved farther north into the blight he was mad that was good when you accepted madness into yourself embraced it and drank it in as if it were sunlight or water or the air itselfit became another part of you like a hand or an eye you could see by madness you could hold things with madness it was wonderful liberating he was finally free the creature that had been mordeth reached the bottom of the hill and did not look back at the large purplish mass that hed left atop it worms were very messy to kill the right way but some things needed to be done the right way it was the principle of the thing mist had begun to trail him creeping up from the ground was that mist his madness or was it his hatred it was so familiar it twisted around his ankles and licked at his heels something peeked around a hillside nearby then ducked back worms died loudly worms did everything loudly a pack of worms could destroy an entire legion when you heard them you went the other way quickly but then it could be advantageous to send scouts to go judge the direction of the pack lest you continue on and run across it again elsewhere so the creature that had been padan fain was not surprised when he rounded the hillside and found a nervous group of trollocs there a myrddraal guiding them he smiled my friends it had been too long it took a moment for their brutish brains to come to the obvious but falseconclusion if a man was wandering around then worms couldnt be near those would have srnelled his blood and come for him worms preferred humans over trollocs that made sense the creature that had been mordeth had tasted both and trolloc flesh had little to recommend it the trollocs tore forward in a mismatched pack feathers beaks claws teeth tusks the creature that had been fain stood still mist licking his unshod feet how wonderful at the very back of the group the myrddraal hesitated its eyeless gaze fixed on him perhaps it sensed that something was terribly terribly wrong and right of course you couldnt be one without the other that wouldnt make sense the creature that had been mordethhe would need a new name soonsmiled deeply the myrddraal turned to run away the mist struck it rolled over the trollocs moving quickly like the tentacles of a leviathan in the aryth ocean lengths of it snapped forward through trolloc chests one long rope whipped above their heads then shot forward in a blur taking the fade in the neck the trollocs screamed dropping spasming their hair fell out in patches and their skin began to boil blisters and cysts when those popped they left craterlike pocks in the shadowspawn skin like bubbles on the surface of metal that cooled too quickly the creature that had been padan fain opened his mouth in glee closing his eyes to the tumultuous black sky and raising his face lips parted enjoying his feast after it passed he sighed holding his dagger tighter cutting his flesh red below black above red and black red and black so much red and black wonderful he walked on through the blight the corrupted trollocs climbed to their feet behind him lurching into motion spittle dropping from their lips their eyes had grown sluggish and dull but when he desired it they would respond with a frenzied battle lust that would surpass what they had known in life he left the myrddraal it would not rise as rumors said they did his touch now brought instant death to one of its kind pity he had a few nails he might have otherwise put to good use perhaps he should get some gloves but if he did he couldnt cut his hand what a problem no matter onward the time had come to kill althor it saddened him that the hunt must end but there was no longer a reason for a hunt you didnt hunt something when you knew exactly where it was going to be you merely showed up to meet it like an old friend a dear beloved old friend that you were going to stab through the eye open up at the gut and consume by handfuls while drinking his blood that was the proper way to treat friends it was an honor malenarin rai shuffled through supply reports that blasted shutter on the window behind his desk snapped and blew open again letting in the damp heat of the blight despite ten years serving as commander of heeth tower he hadnt grown accustomed to the heat in the highlands damp muggy the air often full of rotting scents the whistling wind rattled the wooden shutter he rose walking over to pull it shut then twisted a bit of twine around its handle to keep it closed he walked back to his desk looking over the roster of newly arrived soldiers each name had a specialty beside itup here every soldier had to fill two or more duties skill at binding wounds swift feet for running messages a keen eye with a bow the ability to make the same old mush taste like new mush malenarin always asked specifically for men in the last group any cook who could make soldiers eager to come to mess was worth his weight in gold malenarin set aside his current report weighing it down with the leadfilled trolloc horn he kept for the purpose the next sheet in his stack was a letter from a man named barriga a merchant who was bringing his caravan to the tower to trade malenarin smiled he was a soldier first but he wore the three silver chains across his chest that marked him as a master merchant while his tower received many of its supplies directly from the queen no kandori commander was denied the opportunity to barter with merchants if he was lucky hed be able to get this outlander merchant drunk at the bargaining table malenarin had forced more than one merchant into a year of military service as penance for entering bargains he could not keep a year of training with the queens forces often did plump foreign merchants a great deal of good he set that sheet beneath the trolloc horn then hesitated as he saw the last item for his attention at the bottom of the stack it was a reminder from his steward keemlin his eldest son was approaching his fourteenth nameday as if malenarin could forget about that he needed no reminder he smiled setting the trolloc horn on the note in case that shutter broke open again hed slain the trolloc who had borne that horn himself then he walked over to the side of his office and opened his battered oak trunk among the other effects inside was a clothwrapped sword the brown scabbard kept well oiled and maintained but faded with time his fathers sword in three days he would give it to keemlin a boy became a man on his fourteenth nameday the day he was given his first sword and became responsible for himself keemlin had worked hard to learn his forms under the harshest trainers malenarin could provide soon his son would become a man how quickly the years passed taking a proud breath malenarin closed the trunk then rose and left his office for his daily rounds the tower housed two hundred and fifty soldiers a bastion of defense that watched the blight to have a duty was to have pridejust as to bear a burden was to gain strength watching the blight was his duty and his strength and it was particularly important these days with the strange storm to the north and with the queen and much of the kandori army having marched to seek the dragon reborn he pulled the door to his office closed then threw the hidden latch that barred it on the other side it was one of several such doors in the hallway an enemy storming the tower wouldnt know which one opened onto the stairwell upward in this way a small office could function as part of the tower defense he walked to the stairwell these top levels were not accessible from the ground levelthe entire bottom forty feet of the tower was a trap an enemy who entered at the ground floor and climbed up three flights of garrison quarters would discover no way up to the fourth floor the only way to go to the fourth level was to climb a narrow collapsible ramp on the outside of the tower that led from the second level up to the fourth running on it left attackers fully exposed to arrows from above then once some of them were up but others not the kandori would collapse the ramp dividing the enemy force and leaving those above to be killed as they tried to find the interior stairwells malenarin climbed at a brisk pace periodic slits to the sides of the steps looked down on the stairs beneath and would allow archers to fire on invaders when he was about halfway to the top he heard hasty footfalls coming down a second later jargensergeant of the watchrounded the bend like most kandori jargen wore a forked beard his black hair was dusted with gray jargen had joined the blightwatch the day after his fourteenth nameday he wore a cord looped around the shoulder of his brown uniform it bore a knot for each trolloc hed killed there had to be approaching fifty knots in the thing by now jargen saluted with arm to breast then lowered his hand to rest on his sword a sign of respect for his commander in many countries holding the weapon like that would be an insult but southerners were known to be peevish and illtempered couldnt they see that it was an honor to hold your sword and imply you found your commander a worthy threat my lord jargen said voice gruff a flash from rena tower what malenarin asked the two fell into step trotting up the stairwell it was distinct sir jargen said saw it myself i did only a flash but it was there did they send a correction they may have by now i ran to fetch you first if there had been more news jargen would have shared it so malenarin did not waste breath pressing him shortly they stepped up onto the top of the tower which held an enormous mechanism of mirrors and lamps with the apparatus the tower could send messages to the east or westwhere other towers lined the blightor southward along a line of towers that ran to the aesdaishar palace in chachin the vast undulating kandori highlands spread out from his tower some of the southern hills were still lightly laced with morning fog that land to the south free of this unnatural heat would soon grow green and kandori herdsmen would climb to the high pastures to graze their sheep northward lay the blight malenarin had read of days when the blight had barely been visible from this tower now it ran nearly to the base of the stonework rena tower was northwest as well its commanderlord niach of house okatomowas a distant cousin and a good friend he would not have sent a flash without reason and would send a retraction if it had been an accident any further word malenarin asked the soldiers on watch shook their heads jargen tapped his foot and malenarin folded his arms to wait for a correction nothing came rena tower stood within the blight these days as it was farther north than heeth tower its position within the blight was normally not an issue even the most fearsome creatures of the blight knew not to attack a kandori tower no correction came not a glimmer send a message to rena malenarin said ask if their flash was a mistake then ask farmay tower if they have noticed anything strange jargen set the men to work but gave malenarin a flat glance as if to ask you think i havent done that already that meant messages had been sent but there was no word back wind blew across the tower top creaking the steel of the mirror apparatus as his men sent another series of flashes that wind was humid far too hot malenarin glanced upward toward where that same black storm boiled and rolled it seemed to have settled down that struck him as very discomforting flash a message backward malenarin said toward the inland towers tell them what we saw tell them to be ready in case of trouble the men set to work sergeant malenarin said who is next on the messenger roster the tower force included a small group of boys who were excellent riders lightweight they could go on fast horses should a commander decide to bypass the mirrors mirror light was fast but it could be seen by ones enemies besides if the line of towers was brokenor if the apparatus was damagedthey would need a means to get word to the capital next on the roster jargen said checking a list nailed to the inside of the door onto the rooftop it would be keemlin my lord keemlin his keemlin malenarin glanced to the northwest toward the silent tower that had flashed so ominously bring me word if there is a hint of response from the other towers malenarin said to the soldiers jargen come with me the two of them hurried down the stairs we need to send a messenger southward malenarin said then hesitated no no we need to send several messengers double up just in case the towers fall he began moving again the two of them left the stairwell and entered malenarins office he grabbed his best quill off the rack on his wall that blasted shutter was blowing and rattling again the papers on his desk rustled as he pulled out a fresh sheet of paper rena and farmay not responding to flash messages possibly overrun or severely hampered be advised heeth will stand he folded the paper holding it up to jargen the man took it with a leathery hand read it over then grunted two copies then three malenarin said mobilize the archers and send them to the roof tell them danger may come from above if he wasnt merely jumping at shadowsif the towers to either side of heeth had fallen so quicklythen so could those to the south and if hed been the one making an assault hed have done anything he could to sneak around and take out one of the southern towers first that was the best way to make sure no messages got back to the capital jargen saluted fist to chest then withdrew the message would be sent immediately three times on legs of horseflesh once on legs of light malenarin let himself feel a hint of relief that his son was one of those riding to safety there was no dishonor in that the messages needed to be delivered and keemlin was next on the roster malenarin glanced out his window it faced north toward the blight every commanders office did that the bubbling storm with its silvery clouds sometimes they looked like straight geometric shapes he had listened well to passing merchants troubled times were coming the queen would not have gone south to seek a false dragon no matter how cunning or influential he might be she believed it was time for tarmon gaidon and looking out into that storm malenarin thought he could see to the very edge of time itself an edge that was not far distant in fact it seemed to be growing darker and there was a darkness beneath it on the ground northward that darkness was advancing malenarin dashed out of the room racing up the steps to the roof where the wind swept against men pushing and moving mirrors was the message sent to the south he demanded yes sir lieutenant landalin said hed been roused to take command of the towers top no reply yet malenarin glanced down and picked out three riders breaking away from the tower at full speed the messengers were off they would stop at barklan if it wasnt being attacked the captain there would send them on southward just in case and if barklan didnt stand the boys would continue on all the way to the capital if needed malenarin turned back to the storm that advancing darkness had him on edge it was coming raise the hoardings he ordered landalin bring up the store hitchings and empty the cellars have the loaders gather all of the arrows and set up stations for resupplying the archers and put archers at every choke point kill slit and window start the firepots and have men ready to drop the outer ramps prepare for a siege as landalin barked orders men rushed away malenarin heard boots scrape stone behind him and he glanced over his shoulder was that jargen back again no it was a youth of nearly fourteen summers too young for a beard his dark hair disheveled his face streaming with sweat caused presumablyby a run up seven levels of the tower keemlin malenarin felt a stab of fear instantly replaced with anger soldier you were to ride with a message keemlin bit his lip well sir he said tian four places down from me he is five maybe ten pounds lighter than i it makes a big difference sir he rides a lot faster and i figured this would be an important message so i asked for him to be sent in my place malenarin frowned soldiers moved around them rushing down the stairs or gathering with bows at the rim of the tower the wind howled outside and thunder began to sound softlyyet insistently keemlin met his eyes tians mother lady yabeth has lost four sons to the blight he said softly enough that only malenarin could hear tians the only one she has left if one of us has a shot at getting out sir i figured it should be him malenarin held his sons eyes the boy understood what was coming light help him but he understood and hed sent another away in his place kralle malenarin barked glancing toward one of the soldiers passing by yes my lord commander run down to my office malenarin said there is a sword in my oaken trunk fetch it for me the man saluted obeying father keemlin said my nameday isnt for three days malenarin waited with arms behind his back his most important task at the moment was to be seen in command to reassure his troops kralle returned with the sword its worn scabbard bore the image of the oak set aflame the symbol of house rai father keemlin repeated i this weapon is offered to a boy when he becomes a man malenarin said it seems it is too late in coming son for i see a man standing before me he held the weapon forward in his right hand around the tower top soldiers turned toward him the archers with bows ready the soldiers who operated the mirrors the duty watchmen as borderlanders each and every one of them would have been given his sword on his fourteenth nameday each one had felt the catch in the chest the wonderful feeling of coming of age it had happened to each of them but that did not make this occasion any less special keemlin went down on one knee why do you draw your sword malenarin asked voice loud so that every man atop the tower would hear in defense of my honor my family or my homeland keemlin replied how long do you fight until my last breath joins the northern winds when do you stop watching never keemlin whispered speak it louder never once this sword is drawn you become a warrior always with it near you in preparation to fight the shadow will you draw this blade and join us as a man keemlin looked up then took the hilt in a firm grip and pulled the weapon free rise as a man my son malenarin declared keemlin stood holding the weapon aloft the bright blade reflecting the diffuse sunlight the men atop the tower cheered it was no shame to find tears in ones eyes at such a moment malenarin blinked them free then knelt down buckling the sword belt at his sons waist the men continued to cheer and yell and he knew it was not only for his son they yelled in defiance of the shadow for a moment their voices rang louder than the thunder malenarin stood laying a hand on his sons shoulder as the boy slid his sword into its sheath together they turned to face the oncoming shadow there one of the archers said pointing upward theres something in the clouds draghkar another one said the unnatural clouds were close now and the shade they cast could no longer hide the undulating horde of trollocs beneath something flew out from the sky but a dozen of his archers let loose the creature screamed and fell dark wings flapping awkwardly jargen pushed his way through to malenarin my lord jargen said shooting a glance at keemlin the boy should be below not a boy any longer malenarin said with pride a man what is your report all is prepared jargen glanced over the wall eyeing the oncoming trollocs as evenly as if he were inspecting a stable of horses they will not find this tree an easy one to fell malenarin nodded keemlin s shoulder was tense that sea of trollocs seemed endless against this foe the tower would eventually fall the trollocs would keep coming wave after wave but every man atop that tower knew his duty theyd kill shadowspawn as long as they could hoping to buy enough time for the messages to do some good malenarin was a man of the borderlands same as his father same as his son beside him they knew their task you held until you were relieved thats all there was to it chapter apples first the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long past a wind rose above the misty peaks of imfaral the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was a beginning crisp and light the wind danced across fields of new mountain grass stiff with frost that frost lingered past first light sheltered by the omnipresent clouds that hung like a death mask high above it had been weeks since those clouds had budged and the wan yellowed grass showed it the wind churned morning mist moving southward chilling a small pride of torm they reclined on a flat lichenstained granite shelf waiting to bask in morning sunlight that would not arrive the wind poured over the shelf racing down a hillside of scraggly mura trees with ropelike bark and green tufts of thick needlelike leaves atop them at the base of the foothills the wind turned eastward passing an open plain kept free of trees and scrub by the soldiers axe the killing field surrounded thirteen fortresses tall and cut entirely from unpolished black marble their blocks left roughhewn to give them a primal feeling f unformed strength these were towers meant for war by tradition they were unoccupied how long that would lasthow long tradition itself would be remembered in a continent in chaosremained to be seen the wind continued eastward and soon it was playing with the masts of halfburned ships at the docks of takisrom out into the sleeping bay it passed the attackers enormous greatships with sails painted blood red they sailed southward their grisly work done the wind blew onto land again past smoldering towns and villages open plains filled with troops and docks fat with warships smoke war calls and banners flew above dying grass and beneath a dockmasters gloomy sky men did not whisper that this might be the end of times they yelled it the fields of peace were aflame the tower of ravens was broken as prophesied and a murderer openly ruled in seandar this was a time to lift ones sword and choose a side then spill blood to give a final color to the dying land the wind howled eastward over the famed emerald cliffs and coursed out over the ocean behind smoke seemed to rise from the entire continent of seanchan for hours the wind blewmaking what would have been called tradewinds in another agetwisting between whitecaps and dark mysterious waves eventually the wind encountered another continent this one quiet like a man holding his breath before the headsmans axe fell by the time the wind reached the enormous brokenpeaked mountain known as dragonmount it had lost much of its strength it passed around the base of the mountain then through a large orchard of apple trees lit by earlyafternoon sunlight the oncegreen leaves had faded to yellow the wind passed by a low wooden fence tied at its joints with tan linen twine two figures stood there a youth and a somber man in his later years the older man wore a pair of worn brown trousers and a loose white shirt with wooden buttons his face was so furrowed with wrinkles that it seemed kin to the bark of the trees almen bunt didnt know a lot about orchards oh he had planted a few trees back on his farm in andor who didnt have a tree or two to fill in space on the dinner table hed planted a pair of walnut trees on the day hed married adrinne it had felt good to have her trees there outside his window after shed died running an orchard was something else entirely there were nearly three hundred trees in this field it was his sisters orchard he was visiting while his sons managed his farm near carysford in his shirt pocket almen carried a letter from his sons a desperate letter pleading for help but he couldnt go to them he was needed here besides it was a good time for him to be out of andor he was a queens man there had been times recently when being a queens man could get someone into as much trouble as having one too many cows in his pasture what do we do almen adim asked those trees they well it aint supposed to happen like this the boy of thirteen had golden hair from his fathers side almen rubbed his chin scratching at a patch of whiskers hed missed during shaving hahn adims older brother approached them the lad had carved almen a set of wooden teeth as an arrival gift earlier in the spring wondrous things held together by wires with gaps for the few remaining teeth he had but if he chewed too hard theyd go all out of shape the rows of trees were straight and perfectly spaced graegeralmen s brotherinlawalways had been meticulous but he was dead now which was why almen had come the neat rows of trees continued on for spans and spans carefully pruned fertilized and watered and during the night every single one of them had shed their fruit tiny apples barely as large as a mans thumb thousands of them theyd shriveled during the night then fallen an entire crop gone i dont know what to say lads almen finally admitted you at a loss for words hahn said adims brother had darker coloring like his mother and was tall for his fifteen years uncle you usually have as much to say as a gleeman whos been at the brandy for half the night hahn liked to maintain a strong front for his brother now that he was the man of the family but sometimes it was good to be worried and almen was worried very worried we barely have a weeks grain left adim said softly and what weve got we got by promises on the crop nobody will give us anything now nobody has anything the orchard was one of the largest producers in the region half the men in the village worked it during one stage or another they were depending on it they needed it with so much food going bad with their stores used up during the unnatural winter and then there was the incident that had killed graeger the man had walked around a corner over in negin bridge and vanished when people went looking all they found was a twisted leafless tree with a graywhite trunk that smelled of sulphur the dragons fang had been scrawled on a few doors that night people were more and more nervous once almen would have named them all fools jumping at shadows and seeing bloody trollocs under every cobblestone now well now he wasnt so sure he glanced eastward toward tar valon could the witches be to blame for the failed crop he hated being so close to their nest but alysa needed the help theyd chopped down that tree and burned it you could still smell brimstone in the square uncle hahn said sounding uncomfortable what what do we do i what did they do burn me but we should all go to caemlyn im sure the new queen has everything cleared up there by now we can get me settled right by the law who ever heard of such a thing gaining a price on your head for speaking out in favor of the queen he realized he was rambling the boys kept looking at him no almen continued burn me boys but thats wrong we cant go we need to keep on working this isnt any worse than when i lost my entire millet field to a late frost twenty years back well get through this right as light we will the trees themselves looked fine not an insect bite on them leaves a little yellowed but still good sure the spring buds had come late and the apples had grown slowly but they had been growing hahn almen found himself saying you know your fathers felling axe has those chips on it why dont you go about getting it sharpened adim go fetch uso and moor and their carts well sort through those fallen apples and see if any arent rotted too badly maybe the pigs will take them at least they still had two but thered been no piglets this spring the youths hesitated go on now almen said no use dallying because weve had a setback the lads hastened off obedient idle hands made idle minds some work would keep them from thinking about what was to come there was no helping that for him he leaned down on the fence feeling the rough grooves of the unsanded planks under his arms that wind tugged at the tails of his shirt again adrinne had always forced him to tuck it in but now that she was gone he well he never had liked wearing it that way he tucked the shirt in anyway the air smelled wrong somehow stale like the air inside a city flies were starting to buzz around the shriveled bits that had once been apples almen had lived a long time hed never kept count adrinne had done that for him it wasnt important he knew hed seen a lot of years and that was that hed seen insects attack a crop hed seen plants lost to flood to drought or to negligence but in all his years hed never seen anything like this this was something evil the village was already starving they didnt talk about it not when the children or youths were around the adults quietly gave what they had to the young and to women who were nursing but the cows were going dry the stores spoiling the crops dying the letter in his pocket said his own farm had been set upon by passing mercenaries they hadnt harmed anyone but theyd taken every scrap of food his sons survived only by digging halfgrown potatoes from the crop and boiling them they found nineteen out of every twenty rotting in the ground inexplicably full of worms despite green growth above dozens of nearby villages were suffering the same way no food to be had tar valon itself was having trouble feeding its people staring down those neat perfect rows of useless apple trees almen felt the crushing weight of it of trying to remain positive of seeing all his sister had worked for fail and rot these apples they were supposed to have saved the village and his sons his stomach rumbled it did that a lot lately this is it then isnt it he thought eyes toward the tooyellow grass below the fight just ended almen slumped down feeling a weight on his shoulders adrinne he thought there had been a time when hed been quick to laugh quick to talk now he felt worn like a post that had been sanded and sanded and sanded until only a sliver was left maybe it was time to let go he felt something on his neck warmth he hesitated then turned weary eyes toward the sky sunlight bathed his face he gaped it seemed so long since hed seen pure sunlight it shone down through a large break in the clouds comforting like the warmth of an oven baking a loaf of adrinnes thick sourdough bread almen stood raising a hand to shade his eyes he took a deep long breath and smelled apple blossoms he spun with a start the apple trees were flowering that was plain ridiculous he rubbed his eyes but that didnt dispel the image they were blooming all of them white flowers breaking out between the leaves the flies buzzed into the air and zipped away on the wind the dark bits of apple on the ground melted away like wax before a flame in seconds there was nothing left of them not even juice the ground had absorbed them what was happening apple trees didnt blossom twice was he going mad footsteps sounded softly on the path that ran past the orchard almen spun to find a tall young man walking down out of the foothills he had deep red hair and he wore ragged clothing a brown cloak with loose sleeves and a simple white linen shirt beneath the trousers were finer black with a delicate embroidery of gold at the cuff ho stranger almen said raising a hand not knowing what else to say not even sure if hed seen what he thought hed seen did you did you get lost up in the foothills the man stopped turning sharply he seemed surprised to find almen there with a start almen realized the mans left arm ended in a stump the stranger looked about then breathed in deeply no im not lost finally it feels like a great long time since ive understood the path before me almen scratched the side of his face burn him there was another patch hed missed shaving his hand had been shaking so much that he might as well have skipped the razor entirely not lost son that pathway only leads up the slopes of dragonmount the areas been hunted clean if you were hoping to find some game theres nothing back there of use i wouldnt say that the stranger said glancing over his shoulder there are always things of use around if you look closely enough you cant stare at them too long to learn but not be overwhelmed that is the balance almen folded his arms the mans words it seemed they were having two different conversations perhaps the lad wasnt right in the head there was something about the man though the way he stood the way those eyes of his stared with such calm intensity almen felt like standing up and dusting off his shirt to make himself more presentable do i know you almen asked something about the young man was familiar yes the lad said then he nodded toward the orchard gather your people and collect those apples theyll be needed in the days to come the apples almen said turning but he froze the trees were burgeoning with new ripe red apples the blossoms hed seen earlier had fallen free and blanketed the ground in white like snow those apples seemed to shine not just dozens of them on each tree but hundreds more than a tree should hold each one perfectly ripe i am going mad almen said turning back to the man its not you who is mad friend the stranger said but the entire world gather those apples quickly my presence will hold him off for a time i think and whatever you take now should be safe from his touch that voice those eyes like gray gemstones cut and set in his face i do know you almen said remembering an odd pair of youths he had given a lift in his cart years ago light youre him arent you the one theyre talking about the man looked back at almen meeting those eyes almen felt a strange sense of peace it is likely the man said men are often speaking of me he smiled then turned and continued on his way down the path wait almen said raising a hand toward the man who could only be the dragon reborn where are you going the man looked back with a faint grimace to do something ive been putting off i doubt she will be pleased by what i tell her almen lowered his hand watching as the stranger strode away down a pathway between two fenced orchards trees laden with bloodred apples almen thoughtfor a momenthe could see something around the man a lightness to the air warped and bent almen watched the man until he vanished then dashed toward alysas house the old pain in his hip was gone and he felt as if he could run a dozen leagues halfway to the house he met adim and the two workers coming to the orchard they regarded him with concerned eyes as he pulled to a halt unable to speak almen turned and pointed back at the orchards the apples were red specks dotting the green like freckles whats that uso asked rubbing his long face moor squinted then began running toward the orchard gather everyone almen said winded everyone from the village from the villages nearby people passing on shymans road everyone get them here to gather and pick pick what adim asked with a frown apples almen said what else bloody grows on apple trees listen we need every one of those apples picked before the day ends you hear me go spread the word theres a harvest after all they ran off to look of course it was hard to blame them for that almen continued on and as he did he noticed for the first time that the grass around him seemed greener healthier he looked eastward almen felt a pull inside of him something was tugging him softly in the direction the stranger had gone apples first he thought then well then hed see chapter questions of leadership thunder rumbled above soft and menacing like the growl of a distant beast perrin turned his eyes toward the sky a few days ago the pervasive cloud cover had turned black darkening like the advent of a horrible storm but rain had come only in spurts another rumble shook the air there was no lightning perrin patted stayer on the neck the horse smelled skittishprickly sweaty the horse wasnt the only one that scent hung above his enormous force of troops and refugees as they tramped across the muddy ground that force created a thunder of its own footsteps hoofbeats wagon wheels turning men and women calling they had nearly reached the jehannah road originally perrin had planned to cross that and continue on northward toward andor but hed lost a great deal of time to the sickness that had struck his campboth ashaman had nearly died then this thick mud had slowed them even further all told it had been over a month since theyd left maiden and theyd traveled only as far as perrin had originally hoped to go in a week perrin put his hand into his coat pocket feeling at the small blacksmiths puzzle there theyd found it in maiden and hed taken to riddling with it so far he hadnt figured out how to get the pieces apart it was as complex a puzzle as hed ever seen there was no sign of master gill or the people perrin had sent on ahead with supplies grady had managed a few small gateways ahead to send scouts to find them but they had returned without news perrin was beginning to worry about them my lord a man asked he stood beside perrins horse turne was a lanky fellow with curly red hair and a beard he tied off with leather cords he carried a warriors axe in a loop at his belt a wicked thing with a spike at the back we cant pay you much perrin said your men dont have horses no my lord turne said glancing at his dozen companions jarr had one we ate it a few weeks back turne smelled unwashed and dirty and above those scents was an odd staleness had the mans emotions gone numb if you dont mind my lord wages can wait if you have food well that will be enough for now should turn them away perrin thought we already have too many mouths to feed light he was supposed to be getting rid of people but these fellows looked handy with their weapons and if he turned them away theyd no doubt turn to pillaging go walk down the line perrin said find a man named tam althor hes a sturdy fellow dressed like a farmer anyone should be able to point you in his direction tell him you spoke to perrin and i said to take you on for meals the dirty men relaxed and their lanky leader actually smelled grateful grateful sellswordsmaybe banditsgrateful to be taken on only for meals that was the state of the world tell me my lord turne said as his group began to hike down the line of refugees do you really have food we do perrin said i just said so and it doesnt spoil after a night left alone course it doesnt perrin said sternly not if you keep it right some of their grain might have weevils in it but it was edible the man seemed to find that incredible as if perrin had said his wagons would soon sprout wings and fly off for the mountains go on now perrin said and make sure to tell your men that we run a tight camp no fighting no stealing if i get a whiff of you making trouble youll be out on your ears yes my lord turne said then hastened off to join his men he smelled sincere tam wasnt going to be pleased to have another batch of mercenaries to watch over but the shaido were still out there somewhere most of them seemed to have turned eastward but with how slowly perrins force had been traveling he was worried the aiel might change their minds and come back for him he nudged stayer forward flanked by a pair of two rivers men now that aram was gone the two rivers men hadunfortunatelytaken it upon themselves to provide perrin with bodyguards todays annoyances were wil alseen and reed soalen perrin had tried chewing out the men about it but they insisted and he had bigger worries to bother him not the least of which were his strange dreams haunting visions of working the forges and being unable to create anything of worth put them out of your mind he told himself riding up the long column alseen and soalen keeping up you have nightmares enough while awake deal with those first the meadow around him was open though the grass was yellowing and he noticed with displeasure several large swaths of dead wildflowers rotting the spring rains had turned most areas like this into mud traps moving so many refugees was slow even discounting the bubble of evil and the mud everything took longer than he expected including getting out of maiden the force kicked up mud as it marched most of the refugees trousers and skirts were covered with it and the air was thick with its sticky scent perrin neared the front of their line passing riders in red breastplates lances held high their helms like rimmed pots the winged guard of mayene lord gallenne rode at their front redplumed helm held at his side his bearing was formal enough that you might think he was riding in a parade but his single eye was keen as he scanned the countryside he was a good soldier there were a lot of good soldiers in this force though sometimes it was tough as bending a horseshoe to keep their hands from one anothers throats lord perrin a voice shouted arganda first captain of ghealdan pushed through the mayener lines riding a tall roan gelding his troops rode in a wide column beside the mayenersever since alliandres return arganda had been set on equal treatment hed complained that the winged guard often rode in front rather than spur further arguments perrin had ordered their columns to ride side by side was that another batch of mercenaries arganda demanded pulling his horse up beside perrin a small band perrin said probably once the guard of some local citys lord deserters arganda spat to the side you should have sent for me my queen would want them strung up dont forget that were in ghealdan now your queen is my leigewoman perrin said as they reached the front of the column were not stringing anyone up unless we have proof of their crimes once everyone is safely back where they belong you can start sorting through the sellswords and see if you can charge any of them until then theyre just hungry men looking for someone to follow arganda smelled frustrated perrin had gained a few weeks of goodwill from him and gallenne following the successful assault on maiden but old divisions were resurfacing in the endless mud under a sky full of tumbling thunderheads dont worry yourself perrin said i have men watching over the newcomers he also had them watching the refugees some were so docile that they would hardly go to the privy without being instructed to do so others kept looking over their shoulders as if expecting shaido to spring from the distant line of oaks and sweetgum trees at any moment people who smelled that terrified could be trouble and the various factions of his camp already walked as if trudging through itchweed you may send someone to talk to the newcomers arganda perrin said talk only find out where theyre from learn whether they did serve a lord see if they can add anything to the maps they didnt have any good maps of the area and had been forced to have the ghealdanin men arganda includeddraw some from memory arganda rode off and perrin moved to the front of the column being in charge did have its nice moments up here the smells of unwashed bodies and pungent mud werent nearly so strong ahead he could finally see the jehannah road like a long strap of leather cutting through the highland plains running in a northwestern direction perrin rode lost in thought for a time eventually they reached the roadway the mud didnt look as bad on the road as it had in the meadows though if it were like any other road perrin had traveled on it would have its mires and washedout sections as he reached it he noticed gaul approaching the aiel had been off scouting ahead and as perrins horse stepped up onto the road he noticed that someone was riding behind gaul up toward them it was fennel one of the farriers that perrin had sent ahead with master gill and the others perrin felt a wash of relief to see him but it was followed by worry where were the others lord perrin the man said riding up gaul stepped to the side fennel was a wideshouldered man and carried a longhandled workmans axe strapped to his back he smelled of relief praise the light i thought youd never get here your man says the rescue worked it did fennel perrin said frowning where are the others they went on ahead my lord fennel said bowing from horseback i volunteered to stay behind for when you caught up we needed to explain you see explain the rest turned toward lugard fennel explained along the road what perrin said frustrated i gave them orders to continue northward my lord fennel said looking abashed we met travelers coming from that way said that mud made the roads to the north almost completely impassable for wagons or carts master gill decided that heading to caemlyn through lugard would be the best way to follow your orders sorry my lord thats why one of us had to stay behind light no wonder the scouts hadnt found gill and the others theyd gone in the wrong direction well after slogging through mud for weeks himselfsometimes having to stop and wait out stormsperrin couldnt blame them for deciding to take the road that didnt stop him from feeling frustrated how far behind are we perrin asked ive been here five days my lord so gill and the others had been slowed too well that was something at least go get yourself something to eat fennel perrin said and thank you for staying behind to let me know what happened it was a brave thing you did waiting alone for so long somebody had to do it my lord he hesitated most feared you hadnt well that things had gone wrong my lord you see we figured youd be faster than us since we had those carts but from the look of things here you decided to bring the entire town with you it wasnt far from the truth unfortunately he waved fennel on i found him about an hour along the road gaul said softly beside a hill that would make an excellent camp well watered with a good view of the surrounding area perrin nodded theyd have to decide what to dowait until grady and neald could make large gateways follow along after master gill and the others on foot or send most people northward and send only a few toward lugard regardless of the decision it would be good to camp for the day and sort through things pass the word to the others if you will perrin said to gaul well hike down the road to the place you found then discuss what to do next and ask some of the maidens if theyd scout along the road in the other direction to make sure were not going to be surprised by anyone moving up the road behind us gaul nodded and moved off to pass the word perrin remained sitting atop stayer thinking he had half a mind to send arganda and auiandre off to the northwest right now setting on a path to jehannah but the maidens had picked out some shaido scouts watching his army those were probably there to make sure perrin wasnt a threat but they made him uneasy these were dangerous times it was best to keep auiandre and her people with him for now both for her safety and his own at least until grady and neald recovered the snakebites from the bubble of evil had affected the two of them and masurithe only one of the aes sedai who had been bittenworse than the others still grady was starting to look hale again soon hed be able to make a gateway large enough to move the army through then perrin could send auiandre and the two rivers men home he himself could travel back to rand pretend to make upmost people would still think that he and rand had parted ways angrilyand then finally be rid of berelain and her winged guard everything could go back to the way it should be light send it all went that easily he shook his head dispelling the swirling colors and visions that appeared to his eyes whenever he thought of rand nearby berelain and her force were marching out onto the road looking very pleased to reach some solid footing the beautiful darkhaired woman wore a fine green dress and a belt of firedrops her neckline was discomfortingly low hed started relying on her during failes absence once shed stopped treating him like a prize boar to be hunted and skinned faile was back now and it appeared his truce with berelain was over as usual annoura rode near her though she didnt spend the time chatting with berelain as she once had perrin never had figured out why shed been meeting with the prophet probably never would considering what had happened to masema a day out of maiden perrins scouts had run across a group of corpses that had been killed with arrows and robbed of their shoes belts and any valuables though ravens had gotten the eyes perrin had smelled masemas scent through the rot the prophet was dead killed by bandits well perhaps that was a fitting end for him but perrin still felt hed failed rand had wanted masema brought to him the colors swirled again either way it was time for perrin to return to rand the colors swirled showing rand standing in front of a building with a burned front staring westward perrin banished the image his duty was done the prophet seen to alliandres allegiance secure only perrin felt as if something were still very wrong he fingered the blacksmiths puzzle in his pocket to understand something you have to figure out its parts he smelled faile before she reached him heard her horse on the soft earth so gill turned toward lugard she asked stopping beside him he nodded that may have been wise perhaps we should turn that way too were those more sellswords who joined us yes we must have picked up five thousand people these last few weeks she said thoughtfully perhaps more odd in this desolate landscape she was beautiful with her raven hair and strong featuresa good saldaean nose set between two tilted eyes she was dressed for riding in deep wine red he loved her dearly and praised the light that hed gotten her back why did he feel so awkward around her now youre troubled my husband she noted she understood him so well it was almost as if she could read scents it seemed to be a thing of women though berelain could do it too weve gathered too many people he said with a grunt i should start turning them away i suspect theyd find their way back to our force anyway why should they i could leave orders you cant give orders to the pattern itself my husband she glanced over at the column of people as they moved onto the road what do he cut off catching her meaning you think this is me being taveren every stop along our trip youve gained more followers faile said despite our losses against the aiel we came out of maiden with a stronger force than when we started havent you found it odd that so many of the former gaishain are taking to tarns training with weapons they were beaten down so long perrin said they want to stop that from happening again and so coopers learn the sword faile said and find they have a talent for it masons who never thought of fighting back against the shaido now train with the quarterstaff sellswords and armsmen flock to us its coincidence coincidence she sounded amused with a taveren at the armys head she was right and as he fell silent he could smell her satisfaction at winning the argument he didnt think of it as an argument but shed see it as one if anything shed be mad that he hadnt raised his voice this is all going to end in a few days faile he said once we have gateways again ill send these people to their proper places im not gathering an army im helping some refugees to get home the last thing he needed was more people calling him my lord and bowing and scraping we shall see she said faile he sighed and lowered his voice a mans got to see a thing for what it is no sense in calling a buckle a hinge or calling a nail a horseshoe ive told you im not a good leader i proved that thats not how i see it he gripped the blacksmiths puzzle in his pocket theyd discussed this during the weeks since maiden but she refused to see sense the camp was a mess while you were gone faile ive told you how arganda and the maidens nearly killed one another and arammasema corrupted him right under my nose the aes sedai played at games i cant guess and the two rivers men you see how they look at me with shame in their eyes failes scent spiked with anger when he said that and she turned sharply toward berelain its not her fault perrin said if id been able to think of it id have stopped the rumors dead but i didnt now ive got to sleep in the bed i made for myself light what is a man if his own neighbors dont think well of him im no lord faile and thats that ive proven it soundly odd she said but ive been speaking to the others and they tell a different story they say that you kept arganda contained and put out flareups in camp then theres the alliance with the seanchan the more i learn of that the more impressed i am you acted decisively in a time of great uncertainty you focused everyones efforts and you accomplished the impossible in taking maiden those are the actions of a leader faile he said suppressing a growl why wouldnt she listen when shed been a captive nothing had mattered to him but recovering her nothing it didnt matter who had needed his help or what orders hed been given tarmon gaidon itself could have started and hed have ignored it in order to find faile he realied now how dangerous his actions had been trouble was hed take those same actions again he didnt regret what hed done not for a moment a leader couldnt be like that he never should have let them raise that wolfhead banner in the first place now that hed completed his tasks now that faile was back it was time to put all of that foolishness behind him perrin was a blacksmith it didnt matter what faile dressed him in or what titles people gave him you couldnt make a drawknife into a horseshoe by painting it or by calling it something different he turned to the side where jori congar rode before the column that blasted red wolfhead banner flapping proudly from a pole taller than a cavalrymans lance perrin opened his mouth to shout for him to take it down but faile spoke suddenly yes indeed she said musingly ive been thinking on this for the last few weeks andodd though it seemsi believe my captivity may have been precisely what we needed both of us what perrin turned to her smelling her thoughtfulness she believed what shed said now faile said we need to speak of scouts returning he said perhaps more abruptly than he intended aiel up ahead faile glanced as he pointed but of course she couldnt see anything yet she knew of his eyes though she was one of the few who did the call went up as others noticed the three figures in cadinsor approaching alongside the road the ones perrin had sent to scout two maidens hurried for the wise ones and one loped up to perrin there is something beside the road perrin aybara the woman said she smelled concerned that was a dangerous sign it is something that you will wish to see galad woke to the sound of a tent flap rustling sharp pains burned at his side where he had been repeatedly kicked they matched the duller aches on his shoulder left arm and thigh where hed been wounded by valda his pounding headache was almost strong enough to drown out all else he groaned rolling onto his back all was dark around him but pinprick lights shone in the sky stars it had been overcast for so long no something was wrong about them his head pulsed with pain and he blinked tears from the corner of his eyes those stars looked so faint so distant they made no familiar patterns where could asunawa have taken him that the very stars were different as his mind cleared he began to make out his surroundings this was a heavy sleeping tent constructed to be dark during the daylight hours the lights above werent stars at all but sunlight through the occasional pinholes of wear in the canvas he was still naked and with tentative fingers he determined that there was dried blood on his face it had come from a long gash in his forehead if he didnt wash it soon infection was likely he lay on his back breathing in and out with care if he took in too much air at once his side screamed galad did not fear death or pain he had made the right choices it was unfortunate that hed needed to leave the questioners in charge they were controlled by the seanchan however there had been no other option not after hed walked into asunawas hands galad felt no anger at the scouts who had betrayed him the questioners were a valid source of authority in the children and their lies had no doubt been convincing no the one he was angry at was asunawa who took what was true and muddied it there were many who did that in the world but the children should be different soon the questioners would come for him and then the true price for saving his men would be exacted with their hooks and knives he had been aware of that price when hed made his decision in a way he had won for he had manipulated the situation best the other way to ensure his victory was to hold to the truth under their questioning to deny being a darkfriend with his final breath it would be difficult but it would be right he forced himself to sit up expectingand weatheringthe dizziness and nausea he felt around his legs were chained together and that chain was locked to a spike that had been driven deep into the earth piercing the rough canvas tent bottom he tried yanking it free just in case he pulled so hard that his muscles failed him and he nearly passed out once he had recovered he crawled to the side of the tent his chains gave him enough room to reach the flaps he took one of the cloth tiesused to hold the flaps up when they were openedand spat on it then methodically he wiped the grime and blood from his face the cleaning gave him a goal kept him moving and stopped him from thinking about the pain he carefully scrubbed the crusted blood from his cheek and nose it was difficult his mouth was dry he bit down on his tongue to get saliva the strips were not canvas but a lighter material they smelled of dust he spat on a fresh section then worked the spittle into the cloth the wound to his head the dirt on his face these things were marks of victory for the questioners he would not leave them he would go into their tortures with a clean face he heard shouts outside men preparing to break down the camp would that delay their questioning he doubted it striking camp could take hours galad continued cleaning soiling the lengths of both straps using the work as a kind of ritual a rhythmic pattern to give him a focus for meditation his headache withdrew the pains of his body becoming less significant he would not run even if he could escape fleeing would invalidate his bargain with asunawa but he would face his enemies with selfrespect as he finished he heard voices outside the tent they were coming for him he scrabbled quietly back to the stake in the ground taking a deep breath despite the pain he rolled onto his knees then he took the top of the iron spike in his left hand and pushed heaving himself to his feet he wobbled then steadied himself standing up all the way his pains were nothing now he had felt insect bites that were worse he put his feet wide in a warriors stance his hands held before himself with his wrists crossed he opened his eyes back straight staring at the tent flaps it wasnt the cloak the uniform the heraldry or the sword that made a man it was the way he held himself the flaps rustled then drew open the outside light was brilliant to galad s eyes but he did not blink he did not flinch silhouettes moved against an overcast sky they hesitated backlit he could tell they were surprised to see him standing there light one exclaimed damodred how is it that youre awake unexpectedly the voice was familiar trom galad asked his voice ragged men spilled into the room as his eyes adjusted galad made out stocky trom along with bornhald and byar trom fumbled with a set of keys stop galad said i gave orders to you three bornhald there is blood on your cloak i commanded you not to try to free me your men obeyed your orders damodred a new voice said galad looked up to see three men entering the room berab golever tall and bearded alaabar harnesh his bald shadowed head missing its left ear brandel vordarian a blond hulk of a man from galads native andor all three were lords captain all three had stood with asunawa what is this galad asked them harnesh opened a sack and dumped something bulbous to the ground in front of galad a head asunawas all three men drew swords and knelt before him the points of their weapons stabbing the canvas trom unlocked the manacles at galads feet i see galad said you have turned your swords on fellow children what would you have had us do brandel asked looking up from his kneeling position galad shook his head i do not know perhaps you are right i should not chide you on this choice it may have been the only one you could have made but why did you change your minds we have lost two lords captain commander in under half a year harnesh said in a gruff voice the fortress of the light has become a playground for the seanchan the world is in chaos and yet golever said asunawa marched us all the way out here to have us battle our fellow children it was not right damodred we all saw how you presented yourself we all saw how you stopped us from killing one another faced with that and with the high inquisitor naming as darkfriend a man we all know to be honorable well how could we not turn against him galad nodded you accept me as lord captain commander the three men bowed their heads all the lords captain are for you golever said we were forced to kill a third of those who wore the red shepherds crook of the hand of the light some others united with us some tried to flee the amadicians did not interfere and many have said theyd rather join with us than return to the seanchan we have the other amadiciansand the questioners who tried to runheld at swordpoint let free those who wish to leave galad said they may return to their families and their masters by the time they reach the seanchan we will be beyond their grasp the men nodded i accept your allegiance galad said gather the other lords captain and fetch me supply reports strike camp we march for andor none of them asked whether he needed rest though trom did look worried galad accepted the white robe a child brought to him and then sat in a hastily supplied chair as anotherchild candeiar a man expert in wounds entered to inspect his injuries galad didnt feel wise or strong enough to bear the title he did but the children had made their decision the light would protect them for it chapter the arnyrlins anger egwene floated in blackness she was without form lacking shape or body the thoughts imaginings worries hopes and ideas of all the world extended into eternity around her this was the place between dreams and the waking world a blackness pinpricked with thousands upon thousands of distinct lights each more focused and intense than the stars of the skies they were dreams and she could look in on them but did not the ones she wanted to see were warded and most of the others were mysteries to her there was one dream she longed to slip into she restrained herself though her feelings for gawyn were still strong her opinion of him was muddled recently getting lost in his dreams would not help she turned about looking through the expanse recently shed started coming here to float and think the dreams of all the people heresome from her world some from shadows of itreminded her why she fought she must never forget that there was an entire world outside the white towers walls the purpose of aes sedai was to serve that world time passed as she lay bathed in the light of dreams eventually she willed herself to move and located a dream she recognizedthough she wasnt certain how she did it the dream swept up toward her filling her vision she pressed her will against the dream and sent a thought into it nynaeve it is time to stop avoiding me there is work to be done and i have news for you meet me in two nights in the hall of the tower if you do not come i will be forced to take measures your dalliance threatens us all the dream seemed to shudder and egwene pulled back as it vanished shed already spoken to elayne those two were loose threads they needed to be truly raised to the shawl with the oaths administered beyond that egwene needed information from nynaeve hopefully the threat mixed with a promise of news would bring her and that news was important the white tower finally unified the amyrlin seat secure elaida captured by the seanchan pinprick dreams streaked around egwene she considered trying to contact the wise ones but decided against it how should she deal with them the first thing was to keep them from thinking they were being dealt with her plan for them was not yet firm she let herself slip back into her body content to spend the rest of the night with her own dreams here she couldnt keep thoughts of gawyn from visiting her nor did she want to she stepped into her dream and into his embrace they stood in a small stonewalled room shaped like her study in the tower yet decorated like the common room of her fathers inn gawyn was dressed in sturdy two rivers woolens and did not wear his sword a more simple life it could not be hers but she could dream everything shook the room of past and present seemed to shatter shredding into swirling smoke egwene stepped back gasping as gawyn ripped apart as if made of sand all was dust around her and thirteen black towers rose in the distance beneath a tarlike sky one fell and then another crashing to the ground as they did the ones that remained grew taller and taller the ground shook as several more towers fell another tower shook and cracked collapsing most of the way to the groundbut then it recovered and grew tallest of all at the end of the quake six towers remained looming above her egwene had fallen to the ground which had become soft earth covered in withered leaves the vision changed she was looking down at a nest in it a group of fledgling eagles screeched toward the sky for their mother one of the eaglets uncoiled and it wasnt an eagle at all but a serpent it began to strike at the fledglings one at a time swallowing them whole the eaglets simply continued to stare into the sky pretending that the serpent was their sibling as it devoured them the vision changed she saw an enormous sphere made of the finest crystal it sparkled in the light of twentythree enormous stars shining down on it where it sat on a dark hilltop there were cracks in it and it was being held together by ropes there was rand walking up the hillside holding a woodsmans axe he reached the top and hefted the axe then swung at the ropes one at a rime chopping them free the last one parted and the sphere began to break apart the beautiful globe falling in pieces rand shook his head egwene gasped came awake and sat upright she was in her rooms in the white tower the bedchamber was nearly emptyshed had elaidas things removed but hadnt completely furnished it again she had only a washstand a rug of thickwoven brown fibers and a bed with posts and drapes the window shutters were closed morning sunlight peeked through she breathed in and out rarely did dreams unsettle her as much as this one had calming herself she reached down to the side of her bed picking up the leatherbound book she kept there to record her dreams the middle of the three this night was the clearest to her she felt the meaning of it interpreting it as she sometimes could the serpent was one of the forsaken hidden in the white tower pretending to be aes sedai egwene had suspected this was the caseverin had said she believed it so mesaana was still in the white tower but how did she imitate an aes sedai every sister had resworn the oaths apparently mesaana could defeat the oath rod as egwene carefully recorded the dreams she thought about the towers looming threatening to destroy her and she knew some of the meaning there too if egwene did not find mesaana and stop her something terrible would happen it could mean the fall of the white tower perhaps the victory of the dark one dreams were not foretellingsthey didnt show what would happen but what could light she thought finishing her record as if i didnt have enough to worry about egwene rose to call her maids but a knock at the door interrupted her curious she walked across the thick rugwearing only her nightgown and opened the door enough to see silviana standing in the antechamber squarefeatured and dressed in red she had her hair up in its typical bun and her red keepers stole over her shoulders mother the woman said her voice tense i apologize for waking you i wasnt asleep egwene said what is it what has happened hes here mother at the white tower who the dragon reborn hes asking to see you well this is a pot of fishermans stew made only with the heads siuan said as she stalked through a hallway of the white tower how did he get through the city without anyone seeing him high captain chubain winced as well he should siuan thought the ravenhaired man wore the uniform of the tower guard a white tabard over his mail emblazoned with the flame of tar valon he walked with a hand on his sword there had been some talk that he might be replaced as high captain now that bryne was in tar valon but egwene had followed siuans advice not to do so bryne didnt want to be high captain and he would be needed as a field general for the last battle bryne was out with his men finding quarters and food for fifty thousand troops was proving to be near impossible shed sent him word and could feel him getting closer stern block of wood though the man was siuan felt that his stability would have been nice to have near her right now the dragon reborn inside tar valon its not really that surprising he got so far siuan saerin said the oliveskinned brown had been with siuan when theyd seen the captain racing by palefaced saerin had white at her temples some measure of age as an aes sedai and had a scar on one cheek the origin of which siuan hadnt been able to pry out of her there are hundreds of refugees pouring into the city each day saerin continued and any man with half an inclination to fight is being sent for recruitment into the tower guard its no wonder nobody stopped althor chubain nodded he was at the sunset gate before anyone questioned him and then he just well he just said he was the dragon reborn and that he wanted to see the amyrlin didnt yell it out or anything said it calm as spring rain the hallways of the tower were busy though most of the women didnt seem to know what they were to do darting this way and that like fish in a net stop that siuan thought hes come into our seat of power hes the one caught in the net what is his game do you think saerin asked burn me if i know siuan replied hes bound to be mostly insane by now maybe hes frightened and has come to turn himself in i doubt that as do i siuan said grudgingly during these last few days shed foundto her amazementthat she liked saerin as amyrlin siuan hadnt had time for friendships it had been too important to play the ajahs off one another shed thought saerin obstinate and frustrating now that they werent butting heads so often she found those attributes appealing maybe he heard that elaida was gone siuan said and thought that he would be safe here with an old friend on the amyrlin seat that doesnt match what ive read of the boy saerin replied reports call him mistrustful and erratic with a demanding temper and an insistence on avoiding aes sedai that was what siuan had heard as well though it had been two years since shed seen the boy in fact the last time hed stood before her shed been the amyrlin and hed been a simple sheepherder most of what she knew of him since then had come through the blue ajahs eyesandears it took a great deal of skill to separate speculation from truth but most agreed about althor temperamental distrustful arrogant light burn elaida siuan thought if not for her wed have had him safely in aes sedai care long ago they climbed down three spiraling ramps and entered another of the white towers whitewalled hallways moving toward the hall of the tower if the amyrlin was going to receive the dragon reborn then shed do it there two twisting turns laterpast mirrored standlamps and stately tapestriesthey entered one last hallway and froze the floor tiles here were the color of blood that wasnt right the ones here should have been white and yellow these glistened as if wet chubain inhaled sharply hand going to his sword hilt saerin raised an eyebrow siuan was tempted to barrel onward but these places where the dark one had touched the world could be dangerous she might find herself sinking through the floor or being attacked by the tapestries the two aes sedai turned and walked the other way chubain lingered for a moment then hurried after it was easy to read the tension in his face first the seanchan and now the dragon reborn himself come to assault the tower on his watch as they passed through the hallways they met other sisters flowing in the same direction most of them wore their shawls one might have argued that was because of the news of the day but the truth was that many still held to their distrust of other ajahs another reason to curse elaida egwene had been working hard to reforge the tower but one couldnt mend years worth of broken nets in one month they finally arrived at the hall of the tower sisters clustered in the wide hallway outside divided by ajah chubain hurried to speak with his guards at the door and saerin entered the hall proper where she could wait with the other sitters siuan remained standing with the dozens outside things were changing egwene had a new keeper to replace sheriarn the choice of silviana made a great deal of sensethe woman was known to have a level head for a red and choosing her had helped forge the two halves of the tower back together but siuan had harbored a small hope that she herself would be chosen now egwene had so many demands on her timeand was becoming so capable on her ownthat she was relying on siuan less and less that was a good thing but it was also infuriating the familiar hallways the scent of freshly washed stone the echoing of footsteps when last shed been in this place shed commanded it no longer she had no mind to climb her way into prominence again the last battle was upon them she didnt want to spend her time dealing with the squabbles of the blue ajah as they reintegrated into the tower she wanted to do what shed set out to do all those years before with moiraine shepherd the dragon reborn to the last battle through the bond she felt bryne arrive before he spoke now theres a concerned face he said piercing the hallways dozens of hushed conversations as he walked up behind her siuan turned to him he was stately and remarkably calmparticularly for a man who had been betrayed by morgase trakand then sucked into aes sedai politics then told he was going to be leading his troops on the front lines of the last battle but that was bryne serene to a fault he soothed her worries just by being there you came faster than id assumed youd be able to she said and i do not have a concerned face gareth bryne im aes sedai my very nature is to be in control of myself and my surroundings yes he said and yet the more time i spend around the aes sedai the more i wonder about that are they in control of their emotions or do those emotions just never change if one is always concerned one will always look the same she eyed him fool man he smiled turning to look through the hallway full of aes sedai and warders i was already returning to the tower with a report when your messenger found me thank you youre welcome she said gruffly theyre nervous he said i dont think ive ever seen the aes sedai like this well can you blame us she snapped he looked at her then raised a hand to her shoulder his strong callused fingers brushed her neck what is wrong she took a deep breath glancing to the side as egwene finally arrived walking toward the hall in conversation with silviana as usual the somber gawyn trakand lurked behind like a distant shadow unacknowledged by egwene not bonded as her warder yet not cast from the tower either hed spent the nights since the reunification guarding egwenes doors despite the fact that it angered her as egwene neared the entrance to the hall sisters stepped back and made way some reluctantly others reverently shed brought the tower to its knees from the inside while being beaten every day and doused with so much forkroot she could barely light a candle with the power so young yet what was age to aes sedai i always thought i would be the one in there siuan said softly just for bryne that i would receive him guide him i was the one who was to be sitting in that chair brynes grip tightened siuan i oh dont be like that she growled looking at him i dont regret a thing he frowned its for the best siuan said though it twisted her insides in knots to admit it for all her tyranny and foolishness it is good that elaida removed me because that is what led us to egwene shell do better than i could have its hard to swallowi did well as amyrlin but i couldnt do that lead by presence instead of force uniting instead of dividing and so im glad that egwene is receiving him bryne smiled and he squeezed her shoulder fondly what she asked im proud of you she rolled her eyes bah that sentimentality of yours is going to drown me one of these days you cant hide your goodness from me siuan sanche i see your heart you are such a buffoon regardless you brought us here siuan whatever heights that girl climbs to shell do it because you carved the steps for her yes then handed the chisel to elaida siuan glanced toward egwene who stood inside the doorway into the hall the young amyrlin glanced over the women gathered outside and nodded in greeting to siuan maybe even a little in respect shes what we need now bryne said but youre what we needed then you did well siuan she knows it and the tower knows it that felt very good to hear well did you see him when you came in yes bryne said hes standing below watched over by at least a hundred warders and twentysix sisterstwo full circles undoubtedly hes shielded but all twentysix women seemed in a near panic nobody dares touch him or bind him so long as hes shielded it shouldnt matter did he look frightened haughty angry none of that well what did he look like then honestly siuan he looked like an aes sedai siuan snapped her jaw closed was he taunting her again no the general seemed serious but what did he mean egwene entered the hall and then a whitedressed novice went scuttling away tailed by two of chubains soldiers egwene had sent for the dragon bryne remained with his hand on siuans shoulder standing just behind her in the hallway siuan forced herself to be calm eventually she saw motion at the end of the hallway around her sisters began to glow as they embraced the source siuan resisted that mark of insecurity soon a procession approached warders walking in a square around a tall figure in a worn brown cloak twentysix aes sedai following behind the figure inside glowed to her eyes she had the talent of seeing taveren and althor was one of the most powerful of those to ever live she forced herself to ignore the glow looking at althor himself it appeared that the boy had become a man all hints of youthful softness were gone replaced with hard lines hed lost the unconsciously slumped posture that many young men adapted particularly the tall ones instead he embraced his height as a man should walking with command siuan had seen false dragons during her time as amyrlin odd how much this man should look like them it wasshe froze as he met her eyes there was something indefinable about them a weight an age as though the man behind them was seeing through the light of a thousand lives compounded in one his face did look like that of an aes sedai those eyes at least had agelessness the dragon reborn raised his right handhis left arm was folded behind his backand halted the procession if you please he said to the warders stepping through them the warders shocked let him pass the dragons soft voice made them step away they should have known better althor walked up to siuan and she steeled herself he was unarmed and shielded he couldnt harm her still bryne stepped up to her side and lowered his hand to his sword peace gareth bryne althor said i will do no harm youve let her bond you i assume curious elayne will be interested to hear of that and siuan sanche youve changed since we last met change comes to all of us as the wheel turns an aes sedai answer for certain althor smiled a relaxed soft smile that surprised her i wonder if i will ever grow accustomed to those you once took an arrow for me did i thank you for that i didnt do it intentionally as i recall she said dryly you have my thanks nonetheless he turned toward the door to the hall of the tower what kind of amyrlin is she why ask me he couldnt know of the closeness between siuan and egwene shes an incredible one siuan said one of the greatest weve had for all the fact that shes only held the seat a short time he smiled again i should have expected nothing less strange but i feel that seeing her again will hurt though that is one wound that has well and truly healed i can still remember the pain of it i suppose light but this man was making a muddle of her expectations the white tower was a place that should have unnerved any man who could channel dragon reborn or not yet he didnt seem worried in the least she opened her mouth but was cut off as an aes sedai pushed through the group tiana the woman pulled something out of her sleeve and proffered it to rand a small letter with a red seal this is for you she said her voice sounded tense and her fingers trembled though the tremble was so faint that most would have missed it siuan had learned to look for signs of emotion in aes sedai however althor raised an eyebrow then reached over and took it what is it i promised to deliver it tiana said i would have said no but i never thought youd actually come to i mean she cut herself off closing her mouth then she withdrew into the crowd althor slipped the note into his pocket without reading it do your best to calm egwene when i am done he said to siuan then he took a deep breath and strode forward ignoring his guards they hastened after him the warders looking sheepish but nobody dared touch him as he strode between the doors and into the hall of the tower hairs bristled on egwenes arms as rand came into the room unaccompanied aes sedai outside crowded around the doorway trying to look as if they were not gawking silviana glanced at egwene should this meeting be sealed to the hall no egwene thought they need to see me confront him light but i dont feel ready for this there was no helping it she steeled herself repeating in her head the same words shed been going over all morning this was not rand althor friend of her childhood the man shed assumed that shed one day marry rand althor she could be lenient with but leniency here could bring about the end of the world no this man was the dragon reborn the most dangerous man ever to draw breath tall much more confident than she ever remembered him being he wore simple clothing he walked directly into the center of the hall his warder guards remaining outside he stopped in the center of the flame on the floor surrounded by sitters in their seats egwene rand said voice echoing in the chamber he nodded to her as if in respect you have done your part i see the amyrlins stole fits you well from what she had heard of rand recently she had not anticipated such calm in him perhaps it was the calm of the criminal who had finally given himself up was that how she thought of him as a criminal he had done acts that certainly seemed criminal he had destroyed he had conquered when shed last spent any length of time with rand they had traveled through the aiel waste he had become a hard man during those months and she saw that hardness in him still but there was something else something deeper what has happened to you she found herself asking as she leaned forward on the amyrlin seat i was broken rand said hands behind his back and then remarkably i was reforged i think he almost had me egwene it was cadsuane who set me to fixing it though she did so by accident still i shall have to lift her exile i suspect he spoke differently there was a formality to his words that she didnt recognize in another man she would have assumed a cultured educated background but rand didnt have that could tutors have trained him so quickly why have you come before the amyrlin seat she asked have you come to make a petition or have you come to surrender yourself to the white towers guidance he studied her hands still behind his back just behind him thirteen sisters quietly filed into the hall the glow of saidar around them as they maintained his shield rand didnt seem to care about that he studied the room looking at the various sitters his eyes lingered on the seats of reds two of which were empty pevara and javindhra hadnt yet returned from their unknown mission only barasinenewly chosen to replace duharawas in attendance to her credit she met rands eyes evenly ive hated you before rand said turning back to egwene ive felt a lot of emotions in recent months it seems that from the very moment moiraine came to the two rivers ive been struggling to avoid aes sedai strings of control and yet i allowed other stringsmore dangerous stringsto wrap around me unseen it occurs to me that ive been trying too hard i worried that if i listened to you youd control me it wasnt a desire for independence that drove me but a fear of irrelevance a fear that the acts i accomplished would be yours and not my own he hesitated i should have wished for such a convenient set of backs upon which to heap the blame for my crimes egwene frowned the dragon reborn had come to the white tower to engage in idle philosophy perhaps he had gone mad rand egwene said softening her tone im going to have some sisters talk to you to decide if there is anything wrong with you please try to understand once they knew more about his state they could decide what to do with him the dragon reborn did need freedom to do as the prophecies said he would but could they simply let him roam away now that they had him rand smiled oh i do understand egwene and i am sorry to deny you but i have too much to do people starve because of me others live in terror of what i have done a friend rides to his death without allies there is so little time to do what i must rand egwene said we have to make sure he nodded as if in understanding this is the part i regret i did not wish to come into your center of power which you have achieved so well and defy you but it cannot be helped you must know what my plans are so that you can prepare the last time i tried to seal the bore i was forced to do it without the help of the women that was part of what led to disaster though they may have been wise to deny me their strength well blame must be spread evenly but i will not make the same mistakes a second time i believe that saidin and saidar must both be used i dont have the answers yet egwene leaned forward studying him there didnt seem to be madness in his eyes she knew those eyes she knew rand light she thought im wrong i cant think of him only as the dragon reborn im here for a reason hes here for a reason to me he must be rand because rand can be trusted while the dragon reborn must be feared which are you she whispered unconsciously he heard i am both egwene i remember him lews therin i can see his entire life every desperate moment i see it like a dream but a clear dream my own dream its part of me the words were those of a madman but they were spoken evenly she looked at him and remembered the youth that he had been the earnest young man not solemn like perrin but not wild like mat solid straightforward the type of man you could trust with anything even the fate of the world in one months time rand said im going to travel to shayol ghul and break the last remaining seals on the dark ones prison i want your help break the seals she saw the image from her dream rand hacking at the ropes that bound the crystalline globe rand no she said im going to need you all of you he continued i hope to the light that this time you will give me your support i want you to meet with me on the day before i go to shayol ghul and then well then we will discuss my terms your terms egwene demanded you will see he said turning as if to leave rand althor she said rising you will not turn your back on the amyrlin seat he froze then turned back toward her you cant break the seals egwene said that would risk letting the dark one free a risk we must take clear away the rubble the bore must be opened fully again before it can be sealed we must talk about this she said plan that is why i came to you to let you plan he seemed amused light she sat back down angry that bullheadedness of his was just like that of his father there are things we must speak of rand not just this but other thingsthe sisters your men have bonded not the least among them we can speak of that when we next meet she frowned at him and so here we come to it rand said he bowed to hera shallow bow almost more a tip of the head egwene alvere watcher of the seals flame of tar valon may i have your permission to withdraw he asked it so politely she couldnt tell if he was mocking her or not she met his eyes dont make me do anything i would regret his expression seemed to say could she really confine him here after what shed said to elaida about him needing to be free i will not let you break the seals she said that is madness then meet with me at the place known as the field of merrilor just to the north we will talk before i go to shayol ghul for now i do not want to defy you egwene but i must go neither of them looked away the others in the room seemed not to breathe the chamber was still enough for egwene to hear the faint breeze making the rose window groan in its lead very well egwene said but this is not ended rand there are no endings egwene he replied then nodded to her and turned to walk from the hall light he was missing his left hand how had that happened the sisters and warders reluctantly parted for him egwene raised a hand to her head feeling dizzy light silviana said how could you think during that mother what egwene looked about the hall many of the sitters were slumping visibly in their seats something gripped my heart barasine said raising a hand to her breast squeezing it tight i didnt dare speak i tried to speak yukiri said my mouth wouldnt move taveren saerin said but an effect as strong as that i felt that it would crush me from the inside how did you resist it mother silviana asked egwene frowned she hadnt felt that way perhaps because she thought of him as rand we need to discuss his words the hall of the tower will reconvene in one hours time for discussion that conversation would be sealed to the hall and someone follow to make sure he really leaves gareth bryne is doing so chubain said from outside the sitters pulled themselves to their feet shaken silviana leaned down youre right mother he cant be allowed to break the seals but what are we to do if you wont hold him captive i doubt we could have held him egwene said theres something about him i i had the sense he could have broken that shield without a struggle then how how do we stop him we need allies egwene said she took a deep breath he might be persuaded by people that he trusts or he might be forced to change his mind if confronted by a large enough group united to stop him it was now more vital that she speak with elayne and nynaeve chapter the pattern groans what is it perrin asked trying to ignore the sharp scent of rotting meat he couldnt see any corpses but by his nose the ground should be littered with them he stood with an advance group at the side of the jehannah road looking northward across a rolling plain with few trees the grass was brown and yellow as in other places but it grew darker farther away from the road as if infected with some disease ive seen this before seonid said the diminutive paleskinned aes sedai stooped at the edge of the road turning the leaf of a small weed over in her fingers she wore green wool fine but unornamented her only jewelry her great serpent ring thunder rumbled softly above six wise ones stood behind seonid arms folded faces unreadable perrin hadnt considered telling the wise onesor their two aes sedai apprenticesto stay behind he was probably lucky they let him accompany them yes nevarin said bracelets clattering as she knelt and took the leaf from seonid i visited the blight once as a girl my father felt it important for me to see this looks like what i saw there perrin had been to the blight only once but the look of those dark specks was indeed distinctive a redjay fluttered down to one of the distant trees and began picking at branches and leaves but found nothing of interest and took wing again the disturbing thing was the plants here seemed better than many theyd passed along the way covered with spots but alive even thriving light perrin thought taking the leaf as nevarin handed it to him it smelled of decay what kind of world is it where the blight is the good alternative mori circled the entire patch nevarin said nodding to a maiden standing nearby it grows darker near the center she could not see what was there perrin nudged stayer down off the road faile followed she didnt smell the least bit afraid though perrins two rivers armsmen hesitated lord perrin wil called its probably not dangerous perrin said animals still move in and out of it the blight was dangerous because of what lived there and if those beasts had somehow come southward they needed to know the aiel strode after him without a comment and since faile had joined him berelain had to as well annoura and gallenne trailing her blessedly alliandre had agreed to remain behind in charge of the camp and refugees while perrin was away the horses were already skittish and the surroundings didnt help their moods any perrin breathed through his mouth to dampen the stench of rot and death the ground was wet here tooif only those clouds would pass so they could get some good sunlight to dry the soiland the horses footing was treacherous so they took their time most of the meadow was covered in grass clover and small weeds and the farther they rode the more pervasive the dark spots became within minutes many of the plants were more brown than they were green or yellow eventually they came to a small dale nestled amid three hillsides perrin pulled stayer to a halt the others bunched up around him there was a strange village here the buildings were huts built from an odd type of wood like large reeds and the roofs were thatchbut thatch built from enormous leaves as wide as two mans palms there were no plants here only a very sandy soil perrin slid free of the saddle and stooped down to feel it rubbing the gritty stuff between his fingers he looked at the others they smelled confused he cautiously led stayer forward into the center of the village the blight was radiating from this point but the village itself showed no touch of it maidens scattered forward veils in place sulin at their head they did a quick inspection of the huts signing to one another with quick gestures then returned nobody faile asked no sulin said cautiously lowering her veil this place is deserted who would build a village like this perrin asked in ghealdan of all places it wasnt built here masuri said perrin turned toward the slender aes sedai this village is not native to this area masuri said the wood is unlike anything ive seen before the pattern groans berelain said softly the dead walking the odd deaths in cities rooms vanish and food spoils perrin scratched his chin remembering a day when his axe had tried to kill him if entire villages were vanishing and appearing in other places if the blight was growing out of rifts where the pattern was fraying light how bad were things becoming burn the village he said turning use the one power scour as many of the tainted plants as you can maybe we can keep it from spreading well move the army to that camp an hour away and will stay there tomorrow if you need more time for once neither the wise ones nor the aes sedai voiced so much as a sniff of complaint at the direct order hunt with us brother perrin found himself in the wolf dream he vaguely remembered sitting drowsily by the dwindling light of an open lamp a single flame shivering on its tip waiting to hear a report from those dealing with the strange village he had been reading a copy of the travels of jain farstrider that gaul had found among the salvage from maiden now perrin lay on his back in the middle of a large field with grass as tall as a mans waist he gazed up grass brushing his cheeks and arms as it shivered in the wind in the sky that same storm brewed here as in the waking world more violent here staring up at ithis vision framed by the stalks of brown and green grass and stems of wild millethe could almost feel the storm growing closer as if it was crawling down out of the sky to engulf him young bull come come hunt the voice was that of a wolf perrin by instinct knew that she was called oak dancer named for the way she had scampered between saplings as a whelp there were others too whisperer morninglight sparks boundless a good dozen wolves called to him some living wolves who slept others the spirits of wolves who had died they called to him with a mixture of scents and images and sounds the smell of a spring buck pocking the earth with its leaps fallen leaves crumbling beneath running wolves the growls of victory the thrill of a pack running together the invitations awakened something deep within him the wolf he tried to keep locked away but a wolf could not be locked up for long it either escaped or it died it would not stand captivity he longed to leap to his feet and send his joyous acceptance losing himself in the pack he was young bull and he was welcome here no perrin said sitting up holding his head i will not lose myself in you hopper sat in the grass to his right the large gray wolf regarded perrin golden eyes unblinking reflecting flashes of lighting from above the grass came up to hoppers neck perrin lowered a hand from his head the air was heavy full of humidity and it smelled of rain above the scent of the weather and that of the dry field he could smell hoppers patience you are invited young bull hopper sent i cant hunt with you perrin explained hopper we spoke of this im losing myself when i go into battle i become enraged like a wolf like a wolf hopper sent young bull you are a wolf and a man come hunt i told you i cant i will not let this consume me he thought of a young man with golden eyes locked in a cage all humanity gone from him his name had been noamperrin had seen him in a village called jarra light perrin thought thats not far from here or at least not far from where his body slumbered in the real world jarra was in ghealdan an odd coincidence with a ta veren nearby there are no coincidences he frowned rising and scanning the landscape moiraine had told perrin there was nothing human left inside of noam that was what awaited a wolfbrother if he let himself be completely consumed by the wolf i must learn to control this or i must banish the wolf from me perrin said there is no time left for compromise hopper hopper smelled dissatisfied he didnt like what hed called a human tendency to wish to control things come hopper sent standing up in the grass hunt come learn hopper sent frustrated the last hunt comes hoppers sendings included the image of a young pup making his first kill that and a worry for the futurea normally unwolflike attribute the last hunt brought change perrin hesitated in a previous visit to the wolf dream perrin had demanded that hopper train him to master the place very inappropriate for a young wolfa kind of challenge to the elders senioritybut this was a response hopper had come to teach but he would do it as a wolf taught im sorry perrin said i will hunt with youbut i must not lose myself these things you think hopper sent displeased how can you think such images of nothing the response was accompanied by images of blanknessan empty sky a den with nobody in it a barren field you are young bull you will always be young bull how can you lose young bull look down and you will see his paws beneath bite and his teeth will kill there is no losing this it is a thing of humans the same empty words over and over hopper sent perrin took a deep breath sucking in and releasing the toowet air very well he said hammer and knife appearing in his hands lets go you hunt game with your hooves an image of a bull ignoring its horns and trying to leap onto the back of a deer and stomp it to the ground youre right perrin was suddenly holding a good two rivers longbow he wasnt as good a shot as jondyn barran or rand but he could hold his own hopper sent a bull spitting at a deer perrin growled sending back a wolfs claws shooting from its paws and striking a deer at a distance but this only seemed to amuse hopper further despite his annoyance perrin had to admit that it was a rather ridiculous image the wolf sent the image to the others causing them to howl in amusement though most of them seemed to prefer the bull jumping up and down on the deer perrin growled chasing after hopper toward the distant woods where the other wolves waited as he ran the grasses seemed to grow more dense they held him back like snarled forest undergrowth hopper soon outpaced him run young bull im trying perrin sent back not as you have before perrin continued to push his way through the grass this strange place this wonderful world where wolves ran could be intoxicating and dangerous hopper had warned perrin of that more than once dangers for tomorrow ignore them for now hopper sent growing more distant worry is for twolegs i cant ignore my problems perrin thought back yet you often do hopper sent it struck truemore true perhaps than the wolf knew perrin burst into a clearing and pulled to a halt there lying on the ground were the three chunks of metal hed forged in his earlier dream the large lump the size of two fists the flattened rod the thin rectangle the rectangle glowed faintly yellowred singeing the short grass around it the lumps vanished immediately though the simmering rectangle left a burned spot perrin looked up searching for the wolves ahead of him in the sky above the trees ahead a large hole of blackness opened up he could not tell how far it was away and it seemed to dominate all he could see while being distant at the same time mat stood there he was fighting against himself a dozen different men wearing his face all dressed in different types of fine clothing mat spun his spear and never saw the shadowy figure creeping behind him bearing a bloody knife mat perrin cried but he knew it was meaningless this thing he was seeing it was some kind of dream or vision of the future it had been some time since hed seen one of these hed almost begun to think they would stop coming he turned away and another darkness opened in the sky he saw sheep suddenly running in a flock toward the woods wolves chased them and a terrible beast waited in the woods unseen he was there in that dream he sensed but who was he chasing and why something looked wrong with those wolves a third darkness to the side faile grady elyas gaul all walked toward a cliff followed by thousands of others the vision closed hopper suddenly shot back through the air landing beside perrin skidding to a stop the wolf wouldnt have seen the holes they had never appeared to his eyes instead he regarded the burned patch with disdain and sent the image of perrin unkempt and blearyeyed his beard and hair untrimmed and his clothing disheveled perrin remembered the time it had been during the early days of failes captivity had he really looked that bad light but he seemed ragged almost like a beggar or like noam stop trying to confuse me perrin said i became that way because i was dedicated to finding faile not because i was giving in to the wolves the newest pups always blame the elders of the pack hopper bounded through the grasses again what did that mean the scents and images confused him growling perrin charged forward leaving the clearing and reentering the grasses once again the stalks resisted him it was like fighting against a current hopper shot on ahead burn you wait for me perrin yelled if we wait we lose the prey run young bull perrin gritted his teeth hopper was a speck in the distance now almost to the trees perrin wanted to think on those visions but there wasnt time if he lost hopper he knew that he would not see him again this night fine he thought with resignation the land lurched around him grasses speeding by in a flash it was as if perrin had leaped a hundred paces in one step he stepped again shooting forward he left a faint blur behind him the grasses parted for him the wind blew in his face with a comfortable roar that primal wolf inside of him sparked to wakefulness perrin reached the woods and slowed each step now took him a jump of only about ten feet the other wolves were there and they formed up and ran with him excited two feet young bull oak dancer asked she was a youthful female her pelt so light as to be almost white with a streak of black running along her right side he didnt answer though he did allow himself to run with them through the trees what had seemed like a small stand had become an expansive forest perrin moved past trunks and ferns barely feeling the ground beneath his feet this was the way to run powerful energetic he loped over fallen logs his jumps taking him so high that his hair brushed the bottoms of the branches he landed smoothly the forest was his it belonged to him and he understood it his worries began to melt away he allowed himself to accept things as they were not as what he feared they might become these wolves were his brothers and sisters a running wolf in the real world was a masterwork of balance and control herewhere the rules of nature bent to their will they were far more wolves bounded to the sides and leaped off trees nothing holding them to the ground some actually took to the branches soaring from limb to limb it was exhilarating had he ever felt so alive so much a part of the world around him yet master of it at the same time the rough regal leatherleafs were interspersed with yew and the occasional ornamented spicewood in full bloom he threw himself into the air as he passed one of these the wind of his passing pulling a storm of crimson blossoms from the branches they surged around him in a swirling blur caught in the currents cradling him in their sweet scent the wolves began to howl to men one howl was like another to perrin each was distinct these were the howls of pleasure the initiation of a hunt wait this is what i feared i cannot let myself be trapped i am a man not a wolf at that moment however he caught scent of a stag a mighty animal worthy prey it had passed this way recently perrin tried to restrain himself but anticipation proved too strong he tore off down the game trail after the scent the wolves including hopper did not race ahead of him they ran with him their scents pleased as they let him take the lead he was the herald the point the tip of the attack the hunt roared behind him it was as if he led the crashing waves of the ocean itself but he was also holding them back i cannot make them slow for me perrin thought and then he was on all fours his bow tossed aside and forgotten his hands and legs becoming paws those behind him howled anew at the glory of it young bull had truly joined them the stag was ahead young bull picked it out through the trees it was a brilliant white with a rack of at least twentysix points the winter felt worn away and it was enormous larger than a horse the stag turned looking sharply at the pack it met perrins eyes and he smelled its alarm then with a powerful surge of its hind legsflanks taut with muscles the stag leaped off the trail young bull howled his challenge racing through the underbrush in pursuit the great white stag bounded on each leap taking it twenty paces it never hit a branch or lost its footing despite the treacherous forest floor coated with slick moss young bull followed with precision placing his paws where hooves had fallen just moments before matching each stride exactly he could hear the stag panting could see the sweat foaming on its coat could smell its fear but no young bull would not accept the inferior victory of running his prey to exhaustion he would taste the blood of the throat pumping full force from a healthy heart he would best his prey in its prime he began to vary his leaps not following the stags exact path he needed to be ahead not follow the stags scent grew more alarmed that drove young bull to greater speed the stag bolted to the right and young bull leaped hitting an upright tree trunk with all four paws and pushing himself sideways to change directions his turn gained him a fraction of a heartbeat soon he was bounding a single breath behind the stag each leap bringing him within inches of its hooves he howled and his brothers and sisters replied from just behind this hunt was all of them as one but young bull led his howl became a growl of triumph as the stag turned again the chance had come young bull leaped over a log and seized the stags neck in his jaws he could taste the sweat the fur the warm blood beneath pooling around his fangs his weight threw the stag to the ground as they rolled young bull kept his grip forcing the stag to the forest floor its skin laced scarlet with blood the wolves howled in victory and he let go for a moment intending to bite at the front of the neck and kill there was nothing else the forest was gone the howls faded there was only the kill the sweet kill a form crashed into him throwing him back into the brush young bull shook his head dazed snarling another wolf had stopped him hopper why the stag bounded to its feet and then bounded off through the forest again young bull howled in fury and rage preparing to run after it again hopper leaped throwing his weight against young bull if it dies here it dies the last death hopper sent this hunt is done young bull we will hunt another time young bull nearly turned to attack hopper but no he had tried that once and it had been a mistake he was not a wolf heperrin lay on the ground tasting blood that was not his own exhaling deeply his face dripping with sweat he pushed himself to his knees then sat down panting shaking from that beautiful terrifying hunt the other wolves sat down but they did not speak hopper lay beside perrin setting his grizzled head on aged paws that perrin finally said is what i fear no you do not fear it hopper sent youre telling me what i feel you do not smell afraid hopper sent perrin lay back staring up at the branches above twigs and leaves crumpling beneath him his heart thumped from the chase i worry about it then worry is not the same as fear hopper sent why say one and feel the other worry worry worry it is all that you do no i also kill if youre going to teach me to master the wolf dream its going to happen like this yes perrin looked to the side the stags blood had spilled on a dry log darkness seeping into the wood learning this way would push him to the very edge of becoming a wolf but he had been avoiding this issue for too long making horseshoes in the forge while leaving the most difficult and demanding pieces alone untouched he relied on the powers of scent hed been given reaching out to wolves when he needed thembut otherwise hed ignored them you couldnt make a thing until you understood its parts he wouldnt know how to deal withor rejectthe wolf inside him until he understood the wolf dream very well perrin said so be it galad cantered stout through the camp on all sides children erected tents and dug firepits preparing for the night his men marched almost until nightfall each day then arose early in the morning the sooner they reached andor the better those lightcursed swamps were behind them now they traveled over open grasslands perhaps it would have been faster to cut east and catch one of the great highways to the north but that wouldnt be safe best to stay away from the movements of the dragon reborns armies and the seanchan the light would shine upon the children but more than one valiant hero had died within that light if there was no danger of death there could be no bravery but galad would rather have the light shine on him while he continued to draw breath they had camped near the jehannah road and would cross it on the morrow to continue north he had sent a patrol to watch the road he wanted to know what kind of traffic the highway was drawing and he was in particular need of supplies galad continued on his rounds through camp accompanied by a handful of mounted attendants ignoring the aches of his various wounds the camp was orderly and neat the tents were grouped by legion then set up forming concentric rings with no straight pathways that was intended to confuse and slow attackers a section of the camp lay empty near the middle a hole in the formation where the questioners had once set up their tents he had ordered the ouestioners spread out two assigned to each company if the questioners were not set apart from the others perhaps they would feel more kinship with the other children galad made a note to himself to draw up a new camp layout eliminating that hole galad and his companions continued through the camp he rode to be seen and men saluted as he passed he remembered well the words that gareth bryne had once said most of the time a generals most important function was not to make decisions but to remind men that someone would make decisions my lord captain commander said one of his companions brandel vordarian he was an older man eldest of the lords captain who served under galad i wish you would reconsider sending this missive vordarian rode directly beside galad with trom on his other side lords captain golever and harnesh rode behind within earshot and bornhald followed acting as galad s bodyguard for the day the letter must be sent galad said it seems foolhardy my lord captain commander vordarian continued cleanshaven with silver washing his golden hair the andoran was an enormous square of a man galad was vaguely familiar with vordarians family minor nobles who had been involved in his mothers court only a fool refused to listen to advice from those older and wiser than himself but only a fool took all of the advice given him perhaps foolhardy galad replied but it is the right thing to do the letter was addressed to the remaining questioners and children under the control of the seanchan there would be some who had not come with asunawa in the letter galad explained what had happened and commanded them to report to him as soon as possible it was unlikely any would come but the others had a right to know what had happened lord vordarian sighed then made way as harnesh rode up beside galad the bald man scratched absently at the scar tissue where his left ear had been enough about this letter vordarian the way you go on about it tries my patience from galads observation there were many things that tried the murandians patience you have other matters you wish to discuss i assume galad nodded to a pair of children cutting logs who stopped their work to salute him you told child bornhald child byar and others that you plan to ally us with the witches of tar valon galad nodded i understand that the notion might be troubling but if you consider you will see that it is the only right decision but the witches are evil perhaps galad said once he might have denied that but listening to the other children and considering what those at tar valon had done to his sister was making him think he might be too soft on the aes sedai however lord harnesh if they are evil they are insignificant when compared to the dark one the last battle comes do you deny this harnesh and the others looked up at the sky that dreary overcast had stretched for weeks now the day before another man had fallen to a strange illness where beetles had come from his mouth as he coughed their food stores were diminishing as more and more was found spoiled no i do not deny it harnesh muttered then you should rejoice galad said for the way is clear we must fight at the last battle our leadership there may show the way of light to many who have spurned us but if it does not we will fight regardless for it is our duty do you deny this lord captain again no but the witches my lord captain commander galad shook his head i can think of no way around it we need allies look about you lord harnesh how many children do we have even with recent recruits we are under twenty thousand our fortress has been taken we are without succor or allegiance and the great nations of the world revile us no dont deny it you know that it is true galad met the eyes of those around him and one by one they nodded the questioners are at fault harnesh muttered part of the blame is theirs galad agreed but it is also because those who would do evil look with disgust and resentment upon those who stand for what is right the others nodded we must tread carefully galad said in the past the boldnessand perhaps overeagernessof the children has alienated those who should have been our allies my mother always said that a victory of diplomacy did not come when everyone got what they wantedthat made everyone assume theyd gotten the better of her which encouraged more extravagant demands the trick is not to satisfy everyone but to leave everyone feeling they reached the best possible result they must be satisfied enough to do as you wish yet dissatisfied enough to know that you bested them and what does this have to do with us golever said from behind we follow no queen or king yes galad said and that frightens monarchs i grew up in the court of andor i know how my mother regarded the children in every dealing with them she either grew frustrated or decided that she had to suppress them absolutely we cannot afford either reaction the monarchs of these lands must respect us not hate us darkfriends harnesh muttered my mother was no darkfriend galad said quietly harnesh flushed excepting her of course you speak like a questioner galad said suspecting everyone who opposes us of being a darkfriend many of them are influenced by the shadow but i doubt that it is conscious that is where the hand of the light went wrong the questioners often could not tell the difference between a hardened darkfriend a person who was being influenced by darkfriends and a person who simply disagreed with the children so what do we do vordarian asked we bow to the whims of monarchs i dont yet know what to do galad confessed i will think on it the right course will come to me we cannot become lapdogs to kings and queens and yet think of what we could achieve inside of a nations boundaries if we could act without needing an entire legion to intimidate that nations ruler the others nodded at this thoughtful my lord captain commander a voice called galad turned to see byar on his white stallion cantering toward them the horse had belonged to asunawa galad had refused it preferring his own bay galad pulled his group to a halt as the gauntfaced byar neared his white tabard pristine byar wasnt the most likable of men in the camp but he had proven to be loyal byar was not however supposed to be in the camp i set you watching jehannah road child byar galad said firmly that duty was not to end for a good four hours yet byar saluted as he pulled up my lord captain commander we captured a suspicious group of travelers on the road what would you have us do with them you captured them galad asked i sent you to watch the road not take prisoners my lord captain commander byar said how are we to know the character of those passing unless we speak with them you wanted us to watch for darkfriends galad sighed i wanted you to watch for troop movements or merchants we could approach child byar these darkfriends have supplies byar said i think they might be merchants galad sighed nobody could deny byars dedicationhed ridden with galad to face valda when it could have meant the end of his career and yet there was such a thing as being too zealous the thin officer looked troubled well galad s instructions hadnt been precise enough he would have to remember that in the future particularly with byar peace galad said you did no wrong child byar how many of these prisoners are there dozens my lord captain commander byar looked relieved come he turned his mount to lead the way already cook fires were springing up in the pits the scent of burning tinder rising in the air galad caught slices of conversation as he rode past the soldiers what would the seanchan do with those children who had remained behind was it really the dragon reborn who had conquered illian and tear or some false dragon there was talk of a gigantic stone from the sky having struck the earth far to the north in andor destroying an entire city and leaving a crater the talk among the men revealed their worries they should have understood that worry served no useful function none could know the weaving of the wheel byars captives turned out to be a group of people with a surprisingly large number of heavily laden carts perhaps a hundred or more the people clustered together around their carts regarding the children with hostility galad frowned doing a quick inspection thats quite a caravan bornhald said softly at his side merchants no galad said softly thats travel furniturenotice the pegs on the sides so they can be carried in pieces sacks of barley for horses those are farriers tools wrapped in canvas at the back of that cart to the right see the hammers peeking out light bornhald whispered he saw it too these were the camp followers of an army of substantial size but where were the soldiers be ready to separate them galad told bornhald dismounting he walked up to the lead cart the man driving it had a thick figure and a ruddy face with hair that had been arranged in a very poor attempt at hiding his increasing baldness he nervously worked a brown felt hat in his hands a pair of gloves tucked into the belt of his stout jacket galad could see no weapons on him beside the cart stood two others much younger one was a bulky muscular type with the look of a fighterbut not a soldierwho could be some trouble a pretty woman clutched his arm biting her lower lip the man in the cart gave a start upon seeing galad ah galad thought so he knows enough to recognize morgases stepson so travelers galad said carefully my man says you told him that you are merchants yes good lord said the driver i know little of this area are you familiar with it not much sir the driver said wringing that hat in his hands we are actually far from home ourselves i am basel gill of caemlyn i have come south seeking business with a merchant in ebou dar but these seanchan invaders have left me unable to do my trade he seemed very nervous at least he hadnt lied about where he was from and what was this merchants name galad asked why falin deborsha my lord gill said are you familiar with ebou dar i have been there galad said calmly this is quite a caravan you have interesting collection of wares we have heard that there are armies mobilizing here in the south my lord i purchased many of these supplies from a mercenary troop who was disbanding and thought i could sell them down here perhaps your own army has need of camp furniture we have tents mobile smithy equipment everything that soldiers could use clever galad thought galad might have accepted the lie but the merchant had too many cooks washwomen and farriers with him and not nearly enough guards for so valuable a caravan i see galad said well it happens that i do have need of supplies particularly food alas my lord the man said our food cannot be spared anything else i will sell but the food i have promised by messenger to someone in lugard i will pay more i made a promise my good lord the man said i could not break it regardless of the price i see galad waved to bornhald the soldier gave commands and children in white tabards moved forward weapons out what what are you doing gill asked separating your people galad said well talk to each of them alone and see if their stories match i worry that you might have been unforthcoming with us after all what it seems like to me is that you are the camp followers of a large army if that is the case then i would very much like to know whose army it is not to mention where it is gills forehead started to sweat as galads soldiers efficiently separated the captives galad waited for a time watching gill eventually bornhald and byar came jogging up to him hands on their swords my lord captain commander bornhald said urgently galad turned away from gill yes we may have a situation here bornhald said his face was flushed with anger beside him byars eyes were wide almost frenzied some of the prisoners have talked its as you feared a large army is nearby theyve skirmished with aielthose fellows over there in the white robes are actually aiel themselves and byar spat to the side have you ever heard of a man called perrin goldeneyes no should i have yes bornhald said he killed my father chapter writings gawyn hastened down the hallways of the white tower booted feet thumping on a deep blue rug atop crimson and white floor tiles mirrored standlamps reflected light each like a sentry along the way sleete walked quickly beside him despite the lamps illumination sleetes face seemed halfshrouded in shadow perhaps it was the twoday stubble on his jawan oddity for a warderor the long hair clean but unshorn or maybe it was his features uneven like an unfinished drawing with sharp lines a cleft in his chin a hook to his oncebroken nose cheekbones that jutted out he had the lithe motions of a warder but with a more primal feel than most rather than the huntsman moving through the woods he was the silent shadowbound predator that prey never saw until the teeth were flashing they reached an intersection where several of chubains guards stood watch down one of the halls they had swords at their sides and wore white tabards emblazoned with the flame of tar valon one held up a hand im allowed in gawyn said the amyrlin the sisters arent done yet the guard replied hostile gawyn ground his teeth but there was nothing to be done about it he and sleete stepped back and waited untilfinallythree aes sedai walked out of a guarded room they looked troubled they strode away followed by a pair of soldiers carrying something wrapped in a white cloth the body finally the two guards reluctantly stepped aside and let gawyn and sleete pass they hurried down the hallway and entered a small reading room gawyn hesitated beside the door glancing back down the hallway he could see some accepted peeking around a corner whispering this murder made four sisters killed egwene had her hands full trying to keep the ajahs from turning back to their mistrust of one another shed warned everyone to be alert and told sisters not to go about alone the black ajah knew the white tower well their members having lived here for years with gateways they could slip into the hallways and commit murder at least that was the official explanation for the deaths gawyn wasnt so certain he ducked into the room sleete following chubain himself was there the handsome man glanced at gawyn lips turning down lord trakand captain gawyn replied surveying the room it was about three paces square with a single desk set against the far wall and an unlit coalburning brazier a bronze standlamp burned in the corner and a circular rug nearly filled nearly the entire floor that rug was stained with a dark liquid beneath the desk do you really think youll find anything the sisters did not trakand chubain asked folding his arms im looking for different things gawyn said going forward he knelt down to inspect the rug chubain sniffed then walked into the hallway the tower guard would watch over the area until servants had come to clean it gawyn had a few minutes sleete stepped up to one of the guards just inside the doorway they werent as antagonistic toward him as they tended to be toward gawyn he still hadnt figured out why they were like that with him she was alone sleete asked the man in his gravelly voice yes the guard said shaking his head shouldnt have ignored the amyrlins advice who was she kateri nepvue of the white ajah a sister for twenty years gawyn grunted as he continued to crawl across the floor inspecting the rug four sisters from four different ajahs two had supported egwene one had supported elaida and one had been neutral only recently returned all had been killed on different levels of the tower during different times of day it certainly did seem like the work of the black ajah they werent looking for specific targets just convennt ones but it felt wrong to him why not travel into the sisters quarters at night and kill them in their sleep why did nobody sense channeling from the places where the women were killed sleete inspected the door and lock with a careful eye when egwene had told gawyn he could visit the scenes of the murders if he wished hed asked if he could bring sleete with him in gawyns previous interactions with the warder sleete had proven himself to be not only meticulous but discreet gawyn continued looking egwene was nervous about something he was certain she wasnt being completely forthcoming about these murders he found no slits in the carpet or tiles no cuts in the furniture of the cramped room egwene claimed the murderers were coming in by gateway but hed found no evidence of that true he didnt know much about gateways yet and people could reportedly make them hang above the ground so they didnt cut anything but why would the black ajah care about that besides this room was so tiny it seemed to him it would have been very hard to get in without leaving some trace gawyn come here sleete said the shorter man was still kneeling beside the doorway gawyn joined him sleete threw the deadbolt a few times in its lock this door might have been forced he said softly see the scrape here on the deadbolt you can pop open this kind of lock by sliding a thin pick in and pushing it on the deadbolt then putting pressure on the handle it can be done very quietly why would the black ajah need to force a door gawyn asked maybe they traveled into the hallway then walked until they saw hght under a doorway sleete said why not then make a gateway to the other side channeling could have alerted the woman inside sleete said thats true gawyn said he looked toward the bloody patch the desk was set so that the occupants back would be to the doorway that arrangement made gawyns shoulder blades itch who would put a desk like that an aes sedai who thought she was completely safe and who wanted to be sitting away from the distractions outside aes sedai for all of their cunning sometimes seemed to have remarkably underdeveloped senses of selfpreservation or maybe they just didnt think like soldiers their warders dealt with that sort of thought did she have a warder no sleete said ive met her before she didnt have one he hesitated none of the sisters murdered had warders gawyn gave sleete a raised eyebrow makes sense sleete said whoever is doing the killing didnt want to alert warders but why kill with a knife gawyn said all four had been killed that way the black ajah doesnt have to obey the three oaths they could have used the power to kill much more direct much easier but that would also risk alerting the victim or those around sleete noted another good point but still something about these killings didnt seem to add up or maybe he was just stretching at nothing struggling to find something he could do to help a part of him thought that if he could aid egwene with this maybe she would soften toward him perhaps forgive him for rescuing her from the tower during the seanchan attack chubain entered a moment later i trust your lordship has had sufficient time he said stiffly the staff is here to clean insufferable man gawyn thought does he have to be so dismissive toward me i shouldno gawyn forced himself to keep his temper once that hadnt been nearly so hard why was chubain so hostile toward him gawyn found himself wondering how his mother would have handled such a man as this gawyn didnt often think of her as doing so brought his mind back to althor that murderer had been allowed to walk away from the white tower itself egwene had held him in her hand and had released him true althor was the dragon reborn but in his heart gawyn wanted to meet althor with sword in hand and ram steel through him dragon reborn or not althor would rip you apart with the one power he told himself youre being foolish gawyn trakand his hatred of althor continued to smolder anyway one of chubains guards came up speaking pointing at the door chubain looked annoyed they hadnt found the forced lock the tower guard was not a policing forcethe sisters had no need of that and were more effective at this kind ot investigation anyway but gawyn could tell that chubain wished he could stop the murders protecting the tower and its occupants was part of his duty so he and gawyn worked for the same cause but chubain acted as if this were a personal contest between them though his side did essentially meet defeat by brynes side in the tower division gawyn thought and as far as he knows im one of brynes favored men gawyn wasnt a warder yet he was a friend of the amyrlin he dined with bryne how would that look to chubain particularly now that gawyn had been given power to look in on the murders light gawyn thought as chubain shot him a hostile glace he thinks im trying to take his position he thinks i want to be high captain of the tower guard the concept was laughable gawyn could have been first prince of the swordshould have been first prince of the swordleader of andors armies and protector of the queen he was son to morgase trakand one of the most influential and powerful rulers andor had ever known he had no desire for this mans position that wouldnt be how it looked to chubain disgraced by the destructive seanchan attack he must feel that his position was in danger captain gawyn said may i speak with you in private chubain looked at gawyn suspiciously then nodded toward the hallway the two of them retreated nervous tower servants waited outside ready to clean the blood away chubain folded his arms and inspected gawyn what is it you wish of me my lord he often emphasized the rank calm gawyn thought he still felt the shame of how hed bullied his way into brynes camp he was better than that living with the younglings enduring the confusion and then the shame of the events surrounding the towers breaking had changed him he couldnt continue down that path captain gawyn said i appreciate you letting me inspect the room i didnt have much choice i realize that but you have my thanks nonetheless its important to me that the amyrlin see me helping if i find something the sisters miss it could mean a great deal for me yes chubain said eyes narrowing i suspect it could maybe shell finally have me as her warder chubain blinked her warder yes once it seemed certain that she would take me but now well if i can help you with this investigation perhaps it will cool her anger at me he raised a hand gripping chubains shoulder i will remember your aid you call me lord but my title is all but meaningless to me now all i want is to be egwenes warder to protect her chubain wrinkled his brow then he nodded and seemed to relax i heard you talking youre looking for marks of gateways why i dont think this is the work of the black ajah gawyn said i think it might be a gray man or some other kind of assassin a darkfriend among the palace staff perhaps i mean look at how the women are killed knives chubain nodded there were some signs of a struggle too the sisters doing the investigation mentioned that the books swept from the table they thought it was done by the woman flailing as she died curious gawyn said if i were a black sister id use the one power regardless of the fact that others might sense it women channel all the time in the tower this wouldnt be suspicious id immobilize my victim with weaves kill her with the power then escape before anyone thought oddly of it no struggle perhaps chubain said but the amyrlin seems confident that this is the work of black sisters ill talk to her and see why gawyn said for now perhaps you should suggest to those doing the investigation that it would be wise to interview the palace servants give this reasoning yes i think i might do that the man nodded seeming less threatened the two stepped aside chubain waving the servants to enter for their cleaning sleete came out looking thoughtful he held something up pinched between his fingers black silk he said theres no way of knowing if it came from the attacker chubain took the fibers odd a black sister wouldnt seem likely to proclaim herself by wearing black gawyn said a more ordinary assassin though might need the dark colors to hide chubain wrapped the fibers in a handkerchief and pocketed them ill take these to seaine sedai he looked impressed gawyn nodded to sleete and the two of them retreated the white tower is abuzz these days with returning sisters and new warders sleete said softly how would anyoneno matter how stealthy travel the upper levels wearing black without drawing attention gray men are supposed to be able to avoid notice gawyn said i think this is more proof i mean it seems odd that nobody has actually seen rhese black sisters were making a lot of assumptions sleete nodded eyeing a trio of novices who had gathered to gawk at the guards they saw sleete looking and chittered to one another before scampering away egwene knows more than shes saying gawyn said ill talk to her assuming shell see you sleete said gawyn grunted irritably they walked down a series of ramps to the level of the amyrlins study sleete remained with himhis aes sedai a green named hattori rarely had duties for him she still had her eyes on gawyn for a warder egwene was being so infuriating gawyn had half a mind to let hattori bond him no no not really he loved egwene though he was frustrated with her it had not been easy to decide to give up andornot to mention the younglingsfor her yet she still refused to bond him he reached her study and approached silviana the woman sat at her neat orderly keepers desk in the antechamber before egwenes study the woman inspected gawyn her eyes unreadable behind her aes sedai mask he suspected that she didnt like him the amyrlin is composing a letter of some import silviana said you may wait gawyn opened his mouth she asked not to be interrupted silviana said turning back to the paper she had been reading you may wait gawyn sighed but nodded as he did so sleete caught his eye and gestured that he was going why had he accompanied gawyn down here in the first place he was an odd man gawyn waved farewell and sleete vanished into the hallway the antechamber was a grand room with a deep red rug and wood trim on the stone walls he knew from experience that none of the chairs were comfortable but there was a single window gawyn stepped up to it for some air and rested his arm on the recessed stone staring out over the white tower grounds this high up the air felt crisper newer below he could see the new warder practice grounds the old ones were dug up where elaida had begun building her palace nobody was sure what egwene would end up doing with the construction the practice grounds were busy a bustle of figures sparring running fencing with the influx of refugees soldiers and sellswords there were many who presumed themselves warder material egwene had opened the grounds to any who wanted to train and try to prove themselves as she intended to push for as many women as were ready to be raised over the next few weeks gawyn had spent a few days training but the ghosts of men he had killed seemed more present down there the grounds were a part of his past life a time before everything had gone wrong other younglings had easilyand happilyreturned to that life already jisao rajar durrent and most of his other officers had been chosen as warders before long nothing would remain of his band except for gawyn himself the inner door clicked followed by hushed voices gawyn turned to find egwene dressed in green and yellow walking over to speak with silviana the keeper glanced at him and he thought he caught a trace of a frown on her face egwene saw him she kept her face aes sedai sereneshed grown good at that so quicklyand he found himself feeling awkward there was another death this morning he said quietly walking up to her technically egwene said it was last night i need to talk to you gawyn blurted egwene and silviana shared a look very well egwene said gliding back into her study gawyn followed not looking at the keeper the amyrlins study was one of the grandest rooms in the tower the walls were paneled with a pale striped wood carved to show fanciful scenes marvelously detailed the hearth was marble the floor made of deep red stone cut into diamond blocks egwenes large carved desk was set with two lamps they were in the shape of two women raising their hands to the air flames burning between each set of palms one wall had bookcases filled with books arrangedit seemedby color and size rather than by subject they were ornamental brought in to trim the amyrlins study until egwene could make her own selections what is it you find so necessary to discuss egwene said sitting down at her desk the murders gawyn said what about them gawyn shut the door burn me egwene do you have to show me the amyrlin every time we speak once in a while cant i see egwene i show you the amyrlin egwene said because you refuse to accept her once you do so perhaps we can move beyond that light youve learned to talk like one of them thats because i am one of them she said your choice of words betrays you the amyrlin cannot be served by those who refuse to see her authority i accept you gawyn said i do egwene but isnt it important to have people who know you for yourself and not the title so long as they know that there is a place for obedience her face softened you arent ready yet gawyn im sorry he set his jaw dont overreact he told himself very well then about the assassinations weve realized that none of the women killed had warders yes i was given a report on that egwene said regardless he said it brings my thoughts to a larger issue we dont have enough warders egwene frowned were preparing for the last battle egwene gawyn said and yet there are sisters without warders a lot of sisters some had one but never took another after he died others never wanted one in the first place i dont think you can afford this what would you have me do she said folding her arms command the women to take warders yes she laughed gawyn the amyrlin doesnt have that kind of power then get the hall to do it you dont know what youre saying the choosing and keeping of a warder is a very personal and intimate decision no woman should be forced to it well gawyn said refusing to be intimidated the choice to go to war is very personal and intimate as wellyet all across the land men are called into it sometimes feelings arent as important as survival warders keep sisters alive and every aes sedai is going to be of vital importance soon there will be legions upon legions of trollocs every sister on the field will be more valuable than a hundred soldiers and every sister healing will be able to save dozens of lives the aes sedai are assets that belong to humanity you cannot afford to let them go about unprotected egwene drew back perhaps at the fervor of his words then unexpectedly she nodded perhaps there is wisdom in those words gawyn bring it before the hall gawyn said at its core egwene a sister not bonding a warder is an act of selfishness that bond makes a man a better soldier and well need every edge we can find this will also help prevent the murders i will see what can be done egwene said could you let me see the reports the sisters are giving gawyn said about the murders i mean gawyn she said ive allowed you to be a part of the investigation because i thought it might be good to have a different set of eyes looking things over giving you their reports would just influence you to draw the same conclusions as they do at least tell me this he said have the sisters raised the worry that this might not be the work of the black ajah that the assassin might be a gray man or a darkfriend no they have not egwene said because we know that the assassin is not one of those two but the door last night it was forced and the women are killed with knives not the one power there are no signs of gateways or the killer has access to the one power egwene said speaking very carefully and perhaps they are not using gateways gawyn narrowed his eyes those sounded like the words of a woman stepping around her oath not to lie youre keeping secrets he said not just from me from the entire tower secrets are needed sometimes gawyn cant you trust me with them he hesitated im worried that the assassin will come for you egwene you dont have a warder undoubtedly she will come for me eventually she toyed with something on her desk it looked like a worn leather strap the type used to punish a criminal odd she please egwene he said whats going on she studied him then she sighed very well ive told this to the women doing the investigation perhaps i should tell you too one of the forsaken is in the white tower he lowered his hand to his sword what where you have her captive no egwene said shes the assassin you know this i know mesaana is here ive dreamed that it is true she hides among us now four aes sedai dead its her gawyn its the only thing that makes sense he bit off questions he knew very little of dreaming but knew she had the talent it was said to be like foretelling i havent told the entire tower egwene continued i worry that if they knew one of the sisters around them is secretly one of the forsaken it would divide us all again as under elaida wed all be suspicious of one another its bad enough now with them thinking black sisters are traveling in to commit murders but at least that doesnt make them suspicious of one another and maybe mesaana will think that im not aware it is her but there thats the secret you begged to know its not a black sister we hunt but one of the forsaken it was daunting to considerbut no more so than the dragon reborn walking the land light a forsaken in the tower seemed more plausible than egwene being the amyrlin seat well deal with it he said sounding far more confident than he felt i have sisters searching the histories of everyone in the tower egwene said and others are watching for suspicious words or actions well find her but i dont see how we can make the women any more secure without inciting an even more dangerous panic warders gawyn said firmly i will think on it gawyn for now there is something i need of you if it is within my power egwene he took a step toward her you know that is that so she asked dryly very well i want you to stop guarding my door at night what egwene no she shook her head you see your first reaction is to challenge me it is the duty of a warder to offer challenge in private where his aes sedai is concerned hammar had taught him that you are not my warder gawyn that brought him up short besides egwene said you could do little to stop one of the forsaken this battle will be fought by sisters and i am being very careful with the wards i set i want my quarters to look inviting if she tries to attack me perhaps i can surprise her with an ambush use yourself as bait gawyn was barely able to get the words out egwene this is madness no its desperation gawyn women i am responsible for are dying murdered in the night in a time when you yourself said we will need every woman for the first time fatigue showed through her mask a weariness of tone and a slight slump to her back she folded her hands in front of her suddenly seeming worn i have sisters researching everything we can find about mesaana egwene continued shes not a warrior gawyn shes an administrator a planner if i can confront her i can defeat her but we must find her first exposing myself is only one of my plansand you are right it is dangerous but my precautions have been extensive i dont like it at all your approval is not required she eyed him you will have to trust me i do trust you he said all i ask is that you show it for once gawyn gritted his teeth then he bowed to her and left the study tryingand failingto keep the door from shutting too hard when he pulled it closed silviana gave him a disapproving look as he passed her from there he headed for the training grounds despite his discomfort with them he needed a workout with the sword egwene let out a long sigh sitting back closing her eyes why was it so hard to keep her feelings in check when dealing with gawyn she never felt as poor an aes sedai as she did when speaking with him so many emotions swirled within her like different kinds of wine spilling and mixing together rage at his stubbornness burning desire for his arms confusion at her own inability to place one of those before the other gawyn had a way of boring through her skin and into her heart that passion of his was entrancing she worried that if she bonded him it would infect her was that how it worked what did it feel like to be bonded to sense anothers emotions she wanted that with him the connection that others had and it was important that she have people she could rely upon to contradict her in private people who knew her as egwene rather than the amyrlin but gawyn was too loose too untrusting yet she looked over her letter to the new king of tear explaining that rand was threatening to break the seals her plan to stop him would depend on her gathering support from people he trusted she had conflicting reports about darlin sisnera some said he was one of rands greatest supporters while others claimed he was one of rands greatest detractors she set the letter aside for the moment then wrote some thoughts on how to approach the hall on the warder issue gawyn made an excellent argument though he went too far and assumed too much making a plea for women who had no warders to choose one explaining all of the advantages and pointing out how it could save lives and help defeat the shadow that would be appropriate she poured herself some mint tea from the pot on the side of her desk oddly it hadnt been spoiling as often lately and this cup tasted quite good she hadnt told gawyn of the other reason shed asked him to leave her door at nights she had trouble sleeping knowing he was out there only a few feet away she worried shed slip and go to him silvianas strap had never been able to break her will but gawyn trakand he was coming dangerously close to doing so graendal anticipated the messengers arrival even here in her most secret of hiding places his arrival was not unexpected the chosen could not hide from the great lord the hiding place was not a palace a fine lodge or an ancient fortress it was a cavern on an island nobody cared about in an area of the aryth ocean that nobody ever visited so far as she knew there was nothing of note or interest anywhere near the accommodations were downright dreadful six of her lesser pets cared for the place which was merely three chambers shed covered over the entrance with stone and the only way in or out was by gateway fresh water came from a natural spring food from stores shed brought in previously and air through cracks it was dank and it was lowly in other words it was precisely the sort of place where nobody would expect to find her everyone knew that graendal could not stand a lack of luxury that was true but the best part about being predictable was that it allowed you to do the unexpected unfortunately none of that applied to the great lord graendal watched the open gateway before her as she relaxed on a chaise of yellow and blue silk the messenger was a man with flat features and deep tanned skin wearing black and red he didnt need to speakhis presence was the message one of her petsa beautiful blackhaired woman with large brown eyes who had once been a tairen high ladystared at the gateway she looked frightened graendal felt much the same way she closed the woodbound copy of alight in the snow in her hands and stood up wearing a dress of thin black silk with ribbons of streith running down it she stepped through the gateway careful to project an air of confidence moridin stood inside his black stone palace the room had no furniture only the hearth with a fire burning great lord a fire on such a warm day she maintained her composure and did not begin to sweat he turned toward her the black flecks of saa swimming across his eyes you know why i have summoned you not a question i do arangar is dead lost to usand after the great lord transmigrated her soul the last time one might think you are making a habit of this sort of thing graendal i live to serve naeblis she said confidence she had to seem confident he hesitated just briefly good surely you do not imply that arangar had turned traitor what graendal said no of course not then how is what you did a service graendal pasted a look of concerned confusion on her face why i was following the command i was given am i not here to receive an accolade far from it moridin said dryly your feigned confusion will not work on me woman it is not feigned graendal said preparing her lie while i did not expect the great lord to be pleased to lose one of the chosen the gain was obviously worth the cost what gain moridin snarled you allowed yourself to be caught unaware and foolishly lost the life of one of the chosen we should have been able to rely on you of all people to avoid stumbling over althor he didnt know that shed bound arangar and left her to die he thought this was a mistake good caught unaware she said sounding mortified i never moridin how could you think that id let him find me by accident you did this intentionally of course graendal said i practically had to lead him by the hand to natrins barrow lews therin never was good at seeing facts directly in front of his nose moridin dont you see how will lews therin react to what he has done destroying an entire fortress a miniature city of its own with hundreds of occupants killing innocents to reach his goal will that sit easily within him moridin hesitated no he had not considered that she smiled inwardly to him aithors actions would have made perfect sense they were the most logical and therefore most sensible means of accomplishing a goal but althor himself his mind was full of daydreams about honor and virtue this event would not sit easily within him and speaking of him as lews therin to moridin would reinforce that these actions would tear at althor rip at his soul lash his heart raw and bleeding he would have nightmares wear his guilt on his shoulders like the yoke of a heavily laden cart she could vaguely remember what it had been like taking those first few steps toward the shadow had she ever felt that foolish pain yes unfortunately not all of the chosen had semirhage had been corrupt to the bone from the start but others of them had taken different paths to the shadow including ishamael she could see the memories so distant in moridins eyes once shed not been sure who this man was but now she was the face was different but the soul the same yes he knew exactly what althor was feeling you told me to hurt him graendal said you told me to bring him anguish this was the best way arangar helped me though she did not flee when i suggested that one always has confronted her problems too aggressively but im certain the great lord can find other tools we took a risk and it was not without cost but the gain beyond that lews therin now thinks i am dead that is a large advantage she smiled not too much pleasure merely a little satisfaction moridin scowled then hesitated glancing to the side at nothing i am to leave you without punishment for now he finally said though he didnt sound pleased about it had that been a communication directly from the great lord as far as she knew all chosen in this age had to go to him in shayol ghul to receive their orders or at least suffer a visit from that horrid creature shaidar haran now the great lord appeared to be speaking to the naeblis directly interesting and worrisome it meant the end was very near there would not be much time left for posturing she would see herself naeblis and rule this world as her own once the last battle was done i think graendal said that i should you are to stay away from althor moridin said you are not to be punished but i dont see reason to praise you either yes althor may be hurt but you still bungled your plan costing us a useful tool of course graendal said smoothly i will serve as it pleases the great lord i was not going to suggest that i move against althor anyway he thinks me dead and so best to let him remain in his ignorance while i work elsewhere for now elsewhere graendal needed a victory a decisive one she sifted through the different plans shed devised selecting the most likely to succeed she couldnt move against altrior very well she would bring to the great lord something hed long desired perrin aybara graendal said she felt exposed having to reveal her intentions to moridin she preferred to keep her plots to herself however she doubted shed be able to escape this meeting without telling him i will bring you his head moridin turned toward the fire clasping his hands behind his back he watched the flames with a shock she felt sweat trickle down her brow what she was able to avoid heat and cold what was wrong she maintained her focus it just didnt work not here not near him that unsettled her deeply hes important graendal said the prophecies i know the prophecies moridin said softly he did not turn how would you do it my spies have located his army graendal said i have already set some plans in motion regarding him just in case i retain the group of shadowspawn given me to cause chaos and i have a trap prepared it will break althor ruin him if he loses aybara it will do more than that moridin said softly but you will never manage it his men have gateways he will escape you he will escape you moridin said softly the sweat trickled down her cheek then to her chin she wiped it casually but her brow continued to bead come moridin said striding from the hearth and toward the hallway outside graendal followed curious but afraid moridin led her to a nearby door set in the same black stone walls he pushed it open graendal followed him inside the narrow room was lined with shelves and on them were dozensperhaps hundredsof objects of power darkness within she thought where did he get so many moridin walked to the end of the room where he picked through objects on a shelf graendal entered awed is that a shocklance she asked pointing to a long thin bit of metal three binding rods a remakar those pieces of a sho it is unimportant he said selecting an item if i could just you are close to losing favor graendal he said turning and holding long spikelike piece of metal silvery and topped with a large metal head set with golden inlay i have found only two of these the other is being put to good use you may use this one a dreamspike she said eyes opening wide how badly shed wanted to have one of these you found two he tapped the top of the dreamspike and it vanished from his hand you will know where to find it yes she said growing hungry this was an object of great power useful in so many different ways moridin stepped forward seizing her eyes with his own graendal he said softly dangerously i know the key for this one it will not be used against me or others of the chosen the great lord will know if you do i do not wish your apparent habit to be indulged further not until aybara is dead i yes of course she felt cold suddenly how could she feel cold here and while still sweating aybara can walk the world of dreams moridin said i will lend you another tool the man with two souls but he is mine just as that spike is mine just as you are mine do you understand she nodded she couldnt help herself the room seemed to be growing darker that voice of his it sounded just faintly like that of the great lord let me tell you this however moridin said reaching forward with his right hand cupping her chin if you do succeed the great lord will be pleased very pleased that which has been granted you in sparseness will be heaped upon you in glory she licked her dry lips in front of her moridins expression grew distant moridin she asked hesitantly he ignored her releasing her chin and walking to the end of the room from a table he picked up a thick tome wrapped in pale tan skin he flipped to a certain page and studied it for a moment then he waved for her to approach she did so careful when she read what was on the page she found herself stunned darkness within what is this book she finally managed to force out where did these prophecies come from they have long been known to me moridin said softly still studying the book but not to many others not even the chosen the women and men who spoke these were isolated and held alone the light must never know of these words we know of their prophecies but they will never know all of ours but this she said rereading the passage this says aybara will die there can be many interpretations of any prophecy moridin said but yes this foretelling promises that aybara will die by our hand you will bring me the head of this wolf graendal and when you do anything you ask shall be yours he slapped the book closed but mark me fail and you will lose what you have gained and much more he opened a portal for her with a wave of the hand her faint ability to touch the true powerthat hadnt been removed from herallowed her to see twisted weaves stab the air and rend it ripping a hole in the fabric of the pattern the air shimmered there it would lead back to her hidden cavern she knew she went through without a word she didnt trust her voice to speak without shaking chapter questioning intentions morgase trakand once queen of andor served tea she moved from person to person in the large pavilion perrin had taken from maiden it had sides that could be rolled up and no tent floor large though the tent was there was barely enough room for all who had wanted to attend the meeting perrin and faile were there of course sitting on the ground next to them sat goldeneyed elyas and tam althor the simple farmer with the broad shoulders and the calm manners was this man really the father of the dragon reborn of course morgase had seen rand althor once and the boy hadnt looked much more than a farmer himself beside tam sat perrins dusty secretary sebban balwer how much did perrin know of his past jur grady was there also wearing his black coat with a silver sword pin on the collar his leathery farmers face was holloweyed and still pale from the sickness hed suffered recently nealdthe other ashamanwas not there he hadnt yet recovered from his snakebites all three aes sedai were there seonid and masuri sat with the wise ones and annoura sat beside berelain occasionally shooting glances at the six wise ones gallenne sat on berelains other side across from them sat alliandre and arganda the officers made morgase think of gareth bryne she hadnt seen him in a long while not since shed exiled him for reasons she still couldnt quite explain very little about that time in her life made sense to her now had she really been so infatuated with a man that shed banished aemlyn and ellorien anyway those days were gone now morgase picked her way carefully through the room and saw that peoples cups were kept full your work took longer than id expected perrin said you gave us a duty to attend to perrin aybara nevarin replied we accomplished it it took us as much time as needed to do it correctly surely you dont imply that we did otherwise the sandyhaired wise one sat directly in front of seonid and masuri give over nevarin perrin grunted as he unrolled a map before him on the ground it had been drawn by balwer using instructions from the ghealdanin i wasnt questioning you i was asking if there were any problems in the burning the village is gone nevarin said and every plant we found with a hint of blight has been burned to ash as well we did you wetlanders would have much trouble dealing with something as deadly as the blight i think faile said that you would be surprised morgase glanced at faile who locked eyes with the wise one faile sat like a queen once again dressed to her station in a fine dress of green and violet pleated down the sides and divided for riding oddly voiles sense of leadership seemed to have been enhanced by her time spent with the shaido morgase and faile had quickly gone back to being mistress and servant in fact morgases life here was strikingly similar to what it had been in the shaido camp true some things were different morgase wasnt likely to be strapped here for instance that didnt change the fact that for a timeshe and the other four women had been equals no longer morgase stopped beside lord gallenne and refilled his cup using the same skills shed cultivated in attending sevanna at times being a servant seemed to require more stealth than being a scout she wasnt to be seen wasnt to distract had her own servants acted this way around her well arganda said if anyone is wondering where weve gone the smoke from that fire is an easy indicator were far too many people to think of hiding seonid said recently she and masuri had begun being allowed to speak without reprimand from the wise ones though the green did still glance at the aiel women before speaking it galled morgase to see that sisters of the tower made apprentices to a bunch of wilders it was said to have been done at rand althors order but how would any maneven the dragon rebornbe capable of such a thing it discomforted her that the two aes sedai no longer seemed to resist their station a persons situation in life could change her dramatically gaebril then valda had taught morgase that lesson the aiel captivity had been merely another step in the process each of these experiences had moved her farther away from the queen she had been now she didnt long for fine things or her throne she just wanted some stability that it seemed was a commodity more precious than gold it doesnt matter perrin said tapping the map so were decided we chase after gill and the others on foot for now sending scouts by gateway to find them if possible hopefully well catch them before they reach lugard how long to the city would you say arganda depends on the mud the wiry soldier said theres a reason we call this time of year the swamping wise men dont travel during the spring melt wisdom is for those who have time for it perrin muttered counting off distance on the map with his fingers morgase moved to refill annouras cup pouring tea was more complicated than shed ever assumed she had to know whose cup to take aside and fill and whose to fill while they were holding it she had to know precisely how high to fill a cup so that it would not spill and how to pour the tea without rattling the porcelain or splashing she knew when to not be seen and when to make a slight production out of filling cups in case shed missed people forgotten them or misjudged their needs she carefully took perrins cup from beside him on the ground he liked to gesture when he spoke and could knock the cup from her hand if she was unwary all in all there was a remarkable art to serving teaan entire world that morgase the queen had never bothered to notice she refilled perrins cup and placed it back beside him perrin asked other questions about the mapnearby towns potential sources of resupply he had a lot of promise as a leader even if he was rather inexperienced a little advice from morgaseshe cut that thought off perrin aybara was a rebel the two rivers was part of andor and hed named himself lord of it flying that wolfhead banner at least the flag of manetheren had been taken down flying that had been nothing short of an open declaration of war morgase no longer bristled every time someone named him a lord but she also didnt intend to offer him any help not until she determined how to move him back beneath the cloak of the andoran monarchy besides morgase grudgingly admitted faile is sharp enough to give any advice i would have faile was actually a perfect complement to perrin where he was a blunt and leveled lance at charge she was a subtle cavalry bow the combination of the twowith failes connections to the saldaean thronewas what really worried morgase yes hed taken down the manetheren banner but hed ordered that wolfhead banner taken down before often forbidding something was the best way to ensure that it happened alliandre s cup was half empty morgase moved over to refill it like many highborn ladies alliandre always expected her cup to be full alliandre glanced at morgase and there was a faint glimmer of discomfort in those eyes alliandre felt uncertain what their relationship should be that was curious as alliandre had been so haughty during their captivity the person morgase had once been the queen wanted to sit alliandre down and give a lengthy explanation of how to better maintain her grandeur shed have to learn on her own morgase was no longer the person she had once been she wasnt sure what she was but she would learn how to do her duty as a ladys maid this was becoming a passion for her a way to prove to herself that she was still strong still of value in a way it was terrifying that she worried about that lord perrin alliandre said as morgase moved away is it true that youre planning on sending my people back to jehannah after you find gill and his group morgase continued past masurithe aes sedai liked her cup refilled only when she tapped on it lightly with her fingernail i do perrin replied we all know it wasnt completely your will to join us in the first place if we hadnt brought you along youd never have been captured by the shaido masema is dead time to let you return to governing your nation with all due respect my lord alliandre said why are you recruiting from among my countrymen if not to gather an army for future use im not trying to recruit perrin said just because i dont turn them away doesnt mean i intend to enlarge this army any further my lord alliandre said but surely it is wise to keep what you have she has a point perrin berelain added softly one need only look at the sky to know the last battle is imminent why send her force back im certain that the lord dragon will have need of every soldier from every land sworn to him he can send for them when he decides to perrin said stubbornly my lord alliandre said i did not swear to him i swore to you if ghealdan will march for tarmon gaidon it should do so beneath your banner perrin stood up startling several people in the tent was he leaving he walked to the open side of the tent without a word poking his head out wil come here he called a weave of the one power kept people outside from listening in morgase could see masuris weaves tied off and warding the tent their intricacy seemed to mock her own minuscule talent masuri tapped the side of her cup and morgase hastened to refill it the woman liked to sip tea when nervous perrin turned back into the tent followed by a handsome youth carrying a clothwrapped bundle unfurl it perrin said the young man did so looking apprehensive it bore the wolfhead emblem that was perrins sigil i didnt make this banner perrin said i never wanted it but upon advicei let it fly well the reasons for doing that are past id order the thing taken down but that never seems to work for long he looked to wil wil i want it passed through camp im giving a direct order i want each and every copy of this blasted banner burned you understand wil paled but do it perrin said alliandre youll swear to rand as soon as we find him you wont ride beneath my banner because i wont have a banner im a blacksmith and thats the end of it ive stomached this foolishness for too long perrin faile asked she looked surprised is this wise fool man he should have at least talked to his wife about this but men would be men they liked their secrets and their plans i dont know if its wise but it what im doing he said sitting down be off wil i want those banners burned by tonight no holdouts you understand wil stiffened then spun and strode from the tent without giving a reply the lad looked as if he felt betrayed oddly morgase found herself feeling a little of the same it was foolish this was what she wantedit was what perrin should do and yet the people were frightened with good reason that sky the things that were happening in the world well in a time like this perhaps a man could be excused for taking command you are a fool perrin aybara masuri said she had a blunt way about her son tarn addressed perrin the lads put a lot of stock in that banner too much perrin said perhaps but its good to have something to look to when you took down the other banner it was hard on them this will be worse it needs to be done perrin said the two rivers men have gotten too attached to it started talking like theyre going to stay with me instead of going back to their families where they belong when we get gateways working again tarn youll be taking them and going he looked at berelain i suppose i cant be rid of you and your men youll go back with me to rand i wasnt aware berelain said stiffly that you needed to be rid of us you seemed far less reluctant to accept my support when demanding the services of my winged guardsmen in rescuing your wife perrin took a deep breath i appreciate your help all of you we did a good thing in maiden and not just for faile and alliandre it was a thing that needed doing but burn me thats over now if you want to go on to follow rand im sure hell have you but my ashaman are exhausted and the tasks i was given are complete ive got these hooks inside of me pulling me back to rand before i can do that i need to be done with all of you husband faile said her words clipped might i suggest that we begin with the ones who want to be sent away yes aravine said the former gaishain sat near the back of the tent easy to overlook though she had become an important force in perrins camp administration she acted as something of an unofficial steward for him some of the refugees would be happy to return to their homes id rather move everyone if i can perrin said grady the ashaman shrugged his shoulders the gateways ive made for scouts havent taxed me too much and i think i could make some larger ones im still a little weak but i am mostly over the sickness neald will need more time though my lord balwer coughed softly i have some figures of curious note moving as many people as you now have through gateways will take hours maybe days it wont be a quick endeavor as when we approached maiden thats going to be rough my lord grady said i dont think i could hold one open such a long time not if you want me strong enough to be in fighting shape just in case perrin settled back down inspecting the map again berelains cup was empty morgase hurried over to fill it all right then perrin said well start sending some smaller groups of refugees away but those who want to leave first also faile said perhaps it is time to send messengers to contact the lord dragon he might be willing to send more ashaman perrin nodded yes last we knew seonid said he was in cairhien the largest number of the refugees are from there so we could begin by sending some of them home along with scouts to meet with the lord dragon hes not there perrin said how do you know edarra set down her cup morgase crept around the perimeter of the tent and snatched it for refilling eldest of the wise ones and perhaps foremost among themit was hard to tell with wise onesedarra looked strikingly young for her reported age morgases own tiny ability in the one power was enough to tell her that this woman was strong probably the strongest in the room i perrin seemed to flounder had he a source of information he wasnt sharing rand has a habit of being where you dont expect him i doubt hes remained in cairhien but seonid is rightits the best place to start looking my lord balwer said i worry about what we might ahem blunder into if we are not careful fleets of refugees returning through gateways unexpectedly we have been out of touch for some time perhaps in addition to contacting the dragon we could send scouts to gather information perrin nodded i could approve that balwer settled back looking pleased though that man was strikingly good at hiding his emotions why did he want so badly to send someone to cairhien ill admit grady said im worried about moving all of these people even once neald is well its going to be exhausting to hold gateways open long enough to get them all through perrin aybara edarra said there may be a way to fix this problem how these apprentices have been speaking of something a circle it is called if we linked together the ashaman and some of us then perhaps we could give them the strength to create larger gateways perrin scratched at his beard grady ive never linked in a circle before my lord but if we could figure it outwell bigger gateways would move more people through faster that could help a lot all right perrin said turning back to the wise one what would it cost me for you to try this you have worked too long with aes sedai perrin aybara edarra said with a sniff not everything must be done at a cost this will benefit us all i have been contemplating suggesting it for some time perrin frowned how long have you known that this might work long enough burn you woman why didnt you bring it to me earlier then you seem hardly interested in your position as chief most of the time edarra said coldly respect is a thing earned and not demanded perrin aybara morgase held her breath at that insolent comment many a lord would snap at someone for that tone perrin froze but then nodded as if that were the expected answer your ashaman were sick when i first thought of this edarra continued it would not have worked before this is the appropriate time to raise the question therefore i have done so she insults aes sedai with one breath morgase thought then acts just like one with the next still being a captive in maiden had helped morgase begin to understand aiel ways everyone claimed the aiel were incomprehensible but she gave talk like that little credence aiel were people like any other they had odd traditions and cultural quirks but so did everyone else a queen had to be able to understand all of the people within her realm and all of her realms potential enemies very well perrin said grady dont fatigue yourself too much but start working with them see if you can manage forming a circle yes my lord grady said the ashaman always seemed somewhat distant might be good to involve neald in this he gets dizzy when he stands but hes been itching to do something with the power this might be a way for him to get back into practice all right perrin said we have not finished talking of the scouts we are sending to cairhien seonid said i would like to be with the group perrin scratched his bearded chin i suppose take your warders two maidens and pel aydaer be unobtrusive if you can also camaille nolaisen will go faile said of course she would add one cha faile to the group balwer cleared his throat my lord we are in dire need of paper and new pen nibs not to mention some other delicate materials surely that can wait perrin frowned no faile said slowly no husband i think this is a good suggestion we should send one person to collect supplies balwer would you go and fetch the things yourself if my lady wishes it the secretary said i have ached to visit this school the dragon has opened in cairhien they would have the supplies we need i suppose you can go then perrin said but nobody else light any more and we might as well send the whole burning army through balwer nodded looking satisfied that one was obviously spying for perrin now would he tell aybara who she really was had he done so already perrin didnt act as if he knew she gathered up more cups the meeting was beginning to break up of course balwer would offer to spy for aybara she should have approached the dusty man earlier to see what the price would be to keep his silence mistakes like that could cost a queen her throne she froze hand halfway to a cup youre not a queen any longer you have to stop thinking like one during the first weeks following her silent abdication shed hoped to find a way to return to andor so she could be a resource for elayne however the more shed considered it the more shed realized that she had to stay away everyone in andor had to assume that morgase was dead each queen had to make her own way and elayne might seem a puppet to her own mother if morgase returned beyond that morgase had made many enemies before leaving why had she done such things her memory of those times was cloudy but her return would only rip open old wounds she continued gathering up cups perhaps she should have done the noble thing and killed herself if enemies of the throne discovered who she was they could use her against elayne the same way that the whitecloaks would have but for now she was not a threat besides she was confident that elayne would not risk andors safety even to save her mother perrin bade farewell to the attendees and gave some basic instructions for the evening camp morgase knelt down using a rag to wipe dirt from the side of a teacup that had rolled over niall had told her that gaebril was dead and althor held caemlyn that would have prompted elayne to return wouldnt it was she queen had the houses supported her or had they acted against her because of what morgase had done the scouting party might bring news that morgase hungered for she would have to find a way into any meeting discussing their reports perhaps by offering to serve the tea the better she grew at her job as failes maid the closer shed be able to get to important events as the wise ones made their way from the tent morgase caught sight of someone outside tallanvor dutiful as always tall broad of shoulder he wore his sword at his waist and a look of pointed concern in his eyes hed followed her practically nonstop since maiden and while shed complained of it out of principle she didnt mind after two months apart he wanted to take every opportunity to be together looking into those beautiful young eyes of his she could not entertain the notion of suicide even for the good of andor she felt a fool for that hadnt she let her heart lead her into enough trouble already maiden had changed her though shed missed tallanvor dearly and then hed come for her when he shouldnt have risked himself so he was more devoted to her than to andor itself and for some reason that was exactly what she needed she began to make her way toward him balancing eight cups in the crook of her arm while carrying the saucers in her hand maighdin perrin said as she passed out of the tent she hesitated turning back everyone but perrin and his wife had withdrawn come back here please perrin said and tallanvor you might as well come in i can see you lurking out there honestly its not as if anyone was going to swoop down and steal her away while she was inside a tent full of wise ones and aes sedai morgase raised an eyebrow from what shed seen perrin himself had followed faile around lately nearly as much tallanvor shot her a smile as he entered he took some of the cups from her arm then both of them presented themselves before perrin tallanvor bowed formally which gave morgase a stab of annoyance he was still a member of the queens guardthe only loyal member as far as she knew he shouldnt be bowing to this rural upstart i was given a suggestion back when you first joined us perrin said gruffly well i think its about time i took it lately you two are like youths from different villages mooning over one another in the hour before sunday ends its high time you were married we could have alliandre do it or maybe i could do you have some tradition you follow morgase blinked in surprise curse lini for putting that idea in perrins head morgase felt a sudden panic though tallanvor glanced at her questioningly go change into something nicer if you want perrin said gather any you want to witness and be back here in an hour then well get this silliness over with she felt her face grow hot with anger silliness how dare he and in such a way sending her off like a child as if her emotionher lovewas merely an inconvenience to him he was rolling up his map but then failes hand placed on his arm caused him to look up and notice that his orders had not been followed well perrin asked no morgase said she kept her gaze on perrin she didnt want to see the inevitable disappointment and rejection in tallanvors face what perrin asked no perrin aybara morgase said i will not be back here in an hour to be married but if you want tea served or your tent cleaned or something packed then call for me if you wish your clothing washed i will oblige but i am your servant perrin aybara not your subject i am loyal to the queen of andor you have no authority to give me this sort of command i why the queen herself wouldnt demand this forcing two people to marry because youre tired of the way they look at one another like two hounds you intend to breed then sell the pups i didnt mean it that way you said it nonetheless besides how can you be sure of the young mans intentions have you spoken to him asked him interviewed him as a lord should in a matter like this but maighdin perrin said he does care for you you should have seen the way he acted when you were taken light woman but its obvious matters of the heart are never obvious pulling herself up to her full height she almost felt a queen again if i choose to marry a man i will make that decision on my own for a man who claims he doesnt like being in charge you certainly do like giving commands how can you be sure that i want this young mans affections do you know my heart to the side tallanvor stiffened then he bowed formally to perrin and strode from the tent he was an emotional one well he needed to know that she would not be shoved around not anymore first gaebril then valda and now perrin aybara tallanvor would be illserved if he were to receive a woman who married him because she was told to do so morgase measured perrin who was blushing she softened her tone youre young at this yet so ill give you advice there are some things a lord should be involved in but others he should always leave untouched youll learn the difference as you practice but kindly refrain from making demands like this one until youve at least counseled with your wife with that she curtsiedstill carrying the teacupsand withdrew she shouldnt have spoken to him so well he shouldnt have made a command like that it seemed she had some spark left in her after all she hadnt felt that firm or certain of herself since well since before gaebrils arrival in caemlyn though she would have to find tallanvor and soothe his pride she returned the cups to the nearby washing station then went through the camp looking for tallanvor around her servants and workers were busy at their duties many of the former gaishain still acted as if they were among the shaido bowing and scraping whenever someone so much as looked at them those from cairhien were the worst theyd been held longest and aiel were very good at teaching lessons there were of course a few real aiel gaishain what an odd custom from what morgase had been able to determine some of the gaishain here had been taken by the shaido then had been liberated in maiden they retained the white and so that meant they were now acting as slaves to their own relatives and friends any people could be understood but she admitted perhaps the aiel would take longer than others take for instance that group of maidens loping through camp why did they have to force everyone out of their way there was nomorgase hesitated those maidens were heading straight for perrins tent they looked like they had news her curiosity getting the better of her morgase followed the maidens left two guards by the front tent flaps but the ward against eavesdropping had been removed morgase rounded the tent trying to look as if she was doing anything other than eavesdropping feeling a stab of shame for leaving tallanvor to his pain whitecloaks perrin aybara sulins stout voice reported from inside there is a large force of them on the road directly in front of us chapter lighter than a feather the air felt calmer at night though the thunder still warned lan that not all was well in his weeks traveling with bulen that storm above seemed to have grown darker after riding southward they continued on to the east they were somewhere near the border between kandor and saldaea on the plain of lances towering weathered hillssteepsided like fortressesrose around them perhaps theyd missed the border there often was no marker on these back roads and the mountains cared not which nation tried to claim them master andra bulen said from behind lan had purchased a horse for him to ride a dusty white mare he still led his packhorse scouter bulen caught up to him lan insisted upon being called andra one follower was bad enough if nobody knew who he was they couldnt ask to come with him he had bulen to thankinadvertentlyfor the warning of what nynaeve had done for that he owed the man a debt bulen did like to talk though master andra bulen continued if i may suggest we could turn south at the berndt crossroads yes i know a waypoint inn in that direction that serves the very best quail we could turn eastward again on the road to south mettler a much easier path my cousin has a farm along that roadcousin on my mothers side master andraand we could we continue this way lan said but south mettler is a much better roadway and therefore much better traveled too bulen bulen sighed but fell silent the hadori looked good around his head and he had proven surprisingly capable with the sword as talented a student as lan had seen in a while it was darknight came early here because of those mountains compared to the areas near the blight it also felt chilly unfortunately the land here was fairly well populated indeed about an hour past the crossroads they arrived at an inn windows still glowing with light bulen looked toward it longingly but lan continued on he had them traveling at night mostly the better to keep from being seen a trio of men sat in front of the inn smoking their pipes in the darkness the pungent smoke wound in the air past the inns windows lan didnt give them much consideration untilas a groupthey broke off their smoking they unhooked horses from the fence at the side of the inn wonderful lan thought highwaymen watching the night road for weary travelers well three men shouldnt prove too dangerous they rode behind lan at a trot they wouldnt attack until they were farther from the inn lan reached to loosen his sword in its sheath my lord bulen said urgently looking over his shoulder two of those men are wearing the hadori lan spun around cloak whipping behind him the three men approached and did not stop they split around him and bulen lan watched them pass andere he called what do you think youre doing one of the threea lean dangerouslooking manglanced over his shoulder his long hair held back with the hadori it had been years since lan had seen andere he looked as if hed given up his kandori uniform finally he was wearing a deep black cloak and hunting leathers underneath ah lan andere said the three men pulling up to stop i didnt notice you there im sure you didnt lan said flatly and you nazar you put your hadori away when you were a lad now you don one i may do as i wish nazar said he was getting oldhe must be past his seventieth yearbut he carried a sword on his saddle his hair had gone white the third man rakim wasnt malkieri he had the tilted eyes of a saldaean and he shrugged at lan looking a little embarrassed lan raised his fingers to his forehead closing his eyes as the three rode ahead what foolish game were they playing no matter lan thought opening his eyes bulen started to say something but lan quieted him with a glare he turned southward off the road cutting down a small worn trail before long he heard muffled hoofbeats from behind lan spun as he saw the three men riding behind him lan pulled mandarb to a halt teeth gritted im not raising the golden crane we didnt say you were nazar said the three parted around him again riding past lan kicked mandarb forward riding up to them then stop following me last i checked we were ahead of you andere said you turned this way after me lan accused you dont own the roads lan mandragoran andere said he glanced at lan face shadowed in the night if you havent noticed im no longer the boy the hero of salmarna berated so long ago ive become a soldier and soldiers are needed so i will ride this way if i please i command you to turn and go back lan said find a different path eastward rakim laughed his voice still hoarse after all these years youre not my captain any longer lan why would i obey your orders the others chuckled wed obey a king of course nazar said yes andere said if he gave us commands perhaps we would but i dont see a king here unless im mistaken there can be no king of a fallen people lan said no king without a kingdom and yet you ride nazar said flicking his reins ride to your death in a land you claim is no kingdom it is my destiny the three shrugged then pulled ahead of him dont be fools lan said voice soft as he pulled mandarb to a halt this path leads to death death is lighter than a feather lan mandragoran rakim called over is shoulder if we ride only to death then the trail will be easier than id thought lan gritted his teeth but what was he to do beat all three of them senseless and leave them beside the road he nudged mandarb forward the two had become five galad continued his morning meal noting that child byar had come to speak with him the meal was simple fare porridge with a handful of raisins stirred in a simple meal for every soldier kept them all from envy some lords captain commander had dined far better than their men that would not do for galad not when so many in the world starved child byar waited inside the flaps of galads tent awaiting recognition the gaunt sunkencheeked man wore his white cloak a tabard over mail underneath galad eventually set aside his spoon and nodded to byar the soldier strode up to the table and waited still at attention there were no elaborate furnishings to galads tent his swordvaldas swordlay on the plain table behind his wooden bowl slightly drawn the herons on the blade peeked out from beneath the scabbard and the polished steel reflected byars form speak galad said i have more news about the army my lord captain commander byar said they are near where the captives said they would be a few days from us galad nodded they fly the flag of ghealdan alongside the flag of mayene that flame of zeal glinted in byars eyes and the wolfhead though reports say they took that down late yesterday goldeneyes is there our scouts are sure of it did he really kill bornhalds father yes my lord captain commander i have a familiarity with this creature he and his troops come from a place called the two rivers the two rivers galad said curious how often i seem to hear of that place these days is that not where althor is from so it is said byar replied galad rubbed his chin they grow good tabac there child byar but i have not heard of them growing armies it is a dark place my lord captain commander child bornhald and i spent some time there last year it is festering with darkfriends galad sighed you sound like a questioner my lord captain commander byar earnestly continued my lord please believe me i am not simply speculating this is different galad frowned then he gestured toward the other stool beside his table byar took it explain yourself galad said and tell me everything you know of this perrin goldeneyes perrin could remember a time when simple breakfasts of bread and cheese had satisfied him that was no longer the case perhaps it was due to his relationship with the wolves or maybe his tastes had changed over time these days he craved meat especially in the morning he couldnt always have it and that was fine but generally he didnt have to ask that was the case this day hed risen washed his face and found a servant entering with a large chop of ham steaming and succulent no beans no vegetables no gravy just the ham rubbed with salt and seared over the fire with a pair of boiled eggs the serving woman set them on his table then withdrew perrin wiped his hands crossing the rug of his tent and taking in the hams scent part of him felt he should turn it away but he couldnt not when it was right there he sat down took up fork and knife and dug in i still dont see how you can eat that for breakfast faile noted leaving the washing chamber of their tent wiping her hands on a cloth their large tent had several curtained divisions to it she wore one of her unobtrusive gray dresses perfect because it didnt distract from her beauty it was accented by a sturdy black beltshe had sent away all of her golden belts no matter how fine hed suggested finding her one that was more to her liking and shed looked sick its food perrin said i can see she said with a snort looking herself over in the mirror what did you think i assumed it was a rock i meant perrin said between bites that food is food why should i care what i eat for breakfast and what i eat for a different meal because its strange she said clasping on a cord holding a small blue stone she regarded herself in the mirror then turned the loose sleeves of her saldaeancut dress swishing she paused beside his plate grimacing im having breakfast with auiandre send for me if there is news he nodded swallowing why should a person have meat at midday but refuse it for breakfast it didnt make sense hed decided to remain camped beside the jehannah road what else was he to do with an army of whitecloaks directly ahead between him and lugard his scouts needed time to assess the danger hed spent much time thinking about the strange visions hed seen the wolves chasing sheep toward a beast and faile walking toward a cliff he hadnt been able to make sense of them but could they have something to do with the whitecloaks their appearance bothered him more than he wanted to admit but he harbored a tiny hope that they would prove insignificant and not slow him too much perrin aybara a voice called from outside his tent do you give me leave to enter come in gaul he called my shade is yours the tall aiel strode in thank you perrin aybara he said glancing at the ham quite a feast do you celebrate nothing besides breakfast a mighty victory gaul said laughing perrin shook his head aiel humor hed stopped trying to make sense of it gaul settled himself on the ground and perrin sighed inwardly before picking up his plate and moving to sit on the rug across from gaul perrin placed the meal in his lap and continued to eat you need not sit on the floor because of me gaul said im not doing it because i need to gaul gaul nodded perrin cut off another bite this would be so much easier if he grabbed the whole thing in his fingers and started ripping off chunks eating was simpler for wolves utensils what was the point thoughts like that gave him pause he was not a wolf and didnt want to think like one maybe he should start having fruit for a proper breakfast as faile said he frowned then turned back to his meat we fought trollocs in the two rivers byar said lowering his voice galads porridge cooled forgotten on the table several dozen men in our camp can confirm it i killed several of the beasts with my own sword trollocs in the two rivers galad said thats hundreds of leagues from the borderlands they were there nonetheless byar said lord captain commander niall must have suspected it we were sent to the place on his orders you know that pedron niall would not have simply jumped at nothing yes i agree but the two rivers it is full of darkfriends byar said bornhald told you of goldeneyes in the two rivers this perrin aybara was raising the flag of ancient manetheren and gathering an army from among the farmers trained soldiers may scoff at farmers pressed into service but get enough of them together and they can be a danger some are skilled with the staff or the bow i am aware galad said flatly recalling a particularly embarrassing lesson hed once been given that man this perrin aybara byar continued hes shadowspawn as plain as day they call him goldeneyes because his eyes are golden no shade that any person has ever known we were certain that aybara was bringing the trollocs in using them to force the people of the two rivers to join his army he eventually ran us out of the place now hes here before us a coincidence or something more byar was obviously thinking along the same lines my lord captain commander perhaps i should have mentioned this earlier but the two rivers wasnt my first experience with this creature aybara he killed two of the children on a forgotten road in andor some two years ago i was traveling with bornhalds father we met aybara in a campsite off a main road he was running with wolves like a wildman he killed two men before we could subdue him then escaped into the night after we had him captured my lord he was to be hanged there are others who can confirm this galad asked child oratar can and child bornhald can confirm what we saw in the two rivers goldeneyes was at falme too for what he did there alone he should be brought to justice it is clear the light has delivered him to us youre certain our people are among the whitecloaks perrin asked i could not see faces gaul said but elyas macheras eyes are very keen he says hes certain he saw basel gill perrin nodded elyas golden eyes would be as good as perrins own sulin and her scouts have similar reports gaul said accepting a cup of ale poured from perrins pitcher the whitecloak army has a large number of carts much like the ones we sent ahead she discovered this early in the morning but asked me to pass these words to you once you awoke as she knows that wetlanders are temperamental when disturbed in the morning gaul obviously had no idea that he might be giving offense perrin was a wetlander wetlanders were temperamental at least in the opinion of the aiel so gaul was stating an accepted fact perrin shook his head trying one of the eggs overcooked but edible did sulin spot anyone she recognized no though she saw some gaishain gaul said however sulin is a maiden so perhaps we should send someone to confirm what she said someone who wont demand the opportunity to wash our smallclothes trouble with bain and chiad perrin asked gaul grimaced i swear those women will drive the mind from me what man should be expected to suffer such things almost better to have sightblinder himself as a gaishain than those two perrin chuckled regardless the captives look unharmed and healthy there is more to the report one of the maidens saw a flag flying over the camp that looked distinctive so she copied it down for your secretary sebban balwer he says that it means the lord captain commander himself rides with this army perrin looked down at the last chunk of ham that was not good news hed never met the lord captain commander but he bad met one of the whitecloak lords captain once that had been the night when hopper had died a night that had haunted perrin for two years that had been the night when he had killed for the first time what more do you need byar leaned in close sunken eyes alight with zeal we have witnesses who saw this man murder two of our own do we let him march by as if innocent no galad said no by the light if what you say is true then we cannot turn our backs on this man our duty is to bring justice to the wronged byar smiled looking eager the prisoners revealed that the queen of ghealdan has sworn fealty to him that could present a problem or an opportunity perhaps ghealdan is precisely what the children need a new home a place to rebuild you speak of andor my lord captain commander but how long will they suffer us you speak of the last battle but it could be months away what if we were to free an entire nation from the grip of a terrible darkfriend surely the queenor her successorwould feel indebted to us assuming we can defeat this aybara we can our forces are smaller than his but many of his soldiers are farmers farmers you just pointed out can be dangerous galad said they should not be underestimated yes but i know we can defeat them they can be dangerous yes but they will break before the might of the children this time finally goldeneyes wont be able to hide behind his little village fortifications or his ragtag allies no more excuses was this part of being taveren could perrin not escape that night years ago he set his plate aside feeling sick are you well perrin aybara gaul said just thinking the whitecloaks would not leave him alone and the patternburn itwas going to keep looping them into his path until he dealt with them how large is their army perrin asked there are twenty thousand soldiers among them gaul replied there are several thousand others who have likely never held a spear servants and camp followers gaul kept the amusement from his voice but perrin could smell it on him among the aiel nearly every manall but blacksmithswould pick up a spear if they were attacked the fact that many wetlanders were incapable of defending themselves either befuddled or infuriated the aiel their force is large gaul continued but ours is larger and they have no algaidsiswai nor ashaman nor channelers of any type if sebban balwers word is not in error he seems to know much of these whitecloaks hes right whitecloaks hate aes sedai and think anyone who can use the one power is a darkfriend we move against him then byar asked galad stood we have no choice the light has delivered him into our hands but we need more information perhaps i should go to this aybara and let him know that we hold his allies and then ask his army to meet with us on the field of battle id rather draw him out to make use of my cavalry what do you want perrin aybara gaul asked what did he want he wished he could answer that send more scouts perrin said find us a better place to camp well want to offer parley but there s no way under the light im leaving gill and the others in the hands of the whitecioaks well give the children chance to return our people if they dont well then well see chapter the sevenstriped lass mat sat on a worn stool his arms leaning against a dark wooden bar counter the air smelled goodof ale smoke and of the washcloth that had recently wiped the counter he liked that there was something calming about a good rowdy tavern that was also kept clean well clean as was reasonable anyway nobody liked a tavern that was too clean that made a place feel new like a coat that had never been worn or a pipe that had never been smoked mat flipped a folded letter between two fingers of his right hand that letter on thick paper was sealed with a glob of bloodred wax he had been carrying it only a short time but it was already a source of as much aggravation to him as any woman well maybe not an aes sedai but most any other woman that was saying a lot he stopped spinning the letter and tapped it on the counter burn verin for doing this to him she held him by his oath like a fish caught on a hook well master crimson asked the tavernkeeper that was the name he was using these days best to be safe you want a refill or not the tavernkeeper leaned down before him crossing her arms melli craeb was a pretty woman with a round face and auburn hair that curled quite fetchingly mat would have given her his best smilethere was not a woman he had met who did not melt for his best smilebut he was a married man now he could not go breaking hearts it would not be right though leaning as she did showed some ample bosom she was a short woman but she kept the area behind the bar raised yes a nice bosom indeed he figured she would be good for a bit of kissing perhaps tucked into one of the booths at the back of the tavern of course mat did not look at women anymore not like that he did not think about her for him to kiss maybe for talmanes he was so stiff a good kiss and cuddle would do him good well melli asked what would you do if you were me melli his empty mug sat beside him a few suds clinging to the rim order another round she said immediately for the entire bar it would be downright charitable of you people like a charitable fellow i meant about the letter you promised not to open it she said well not exactly i promised that if i opened it id do exactly what it said inside gave an oath did you he nodded she snatched it from his fingers causing him to yelp he reached to take it back but she pulled away turning it over in her fingers mat suppressed an urge to reach for it again he had played more than a few games of takeaway and had no urge to look the buffoon a woman liked nothing more than to make a man squirm and if you let her do it she would only keep going still he began to sweat now melli i could open it for you she said leaning back against the other side of the bar looking over the letter nearby a man called for another mug of ale but she waved him down the rednosed man looked as if he had had enough anyway mellis tavern was popular enough that she had a halfdozen serving girls taking care of the patrons one would get to him eventually i could open it she continued to mat and could tell you whats inside bloody ashes if she did that he would have to do what it said whatever it bloody said all he had to do was wait a few weeks and he would be free he could wait that long really he could it wouldnt do mat said sitting up with a jerk as she reached her thumb between two sides of the letter as if to rip it id still have to do what it said melli dont you do that now be careful she smiled at him her tavern the sevenstriped lass was one of the best in western caemlyn ale with a robust flavor games of dice when you wanted them and not a rat to be seen they probably did not want to risk running afoul of melli light but the woman could shame the whiskers off a mans cheeks without much trying you never did tell me who it was from melli said turning the letter over shes a lover isnt she got you tied up in her strings she had the second part right enough but a lover verin it was ridiculous enough to make mat laugh kissing verin would have been about as much fun as kissing a lion of the two he would have chosen the lion it would have been much less likely to try to bite him i gave my oath melli mat said trying not to show his nervousness dont you go opening that now i didnt give any oath she said maybe ill read it and then not tell you what it says just give you hints now and then as encouragement she eyed him full lips smiling yes she was a pretty one not as pretty as tuon though with her beautiful skin and large eyes but melli was still pretty particularly those lips of hers being married meant he could not stare at those lips but he did give her his best smile it was called for this time though it could break her heart he could not let her open that letter its the same thing melli mat said winningly if you open that letter and i dont do what it says my oath is as good as dishwater he sighed realizing there was one way to get the letter back the woman who gave it to me was aes sedai melli you dont want to anger an aes sedai do you aes sedai melli suddenly looked eager ive always fancied going up to tar valon to see if theyll let me join them she looked at the letter as if more curious about its contents light the woman was daft mat had taken her for the sensible type he should have known better he began to sweat more could he reach the letter she was holding it close she set it down on the bar before him she left one finger on the letter directly in the middle of the wax seal youll introduce me to this aes sedai when you next meet her if i see her while im in caemlyn mat said i promise it can i trust you to keep your word he gave her an exasperated look what was this whole bloody conversation about melli she laughed turning and leaving the letter on the bar going to help the gaptoothed man who was still calling for more ale mat snatched the letter tucking it carefully into his coat pocket bloody woman the only way for him to stay free of aes sedai plots was to never open this letter well not exactly free mat had plenty of aes sedai plotting around him he had them coming out of his ears but only a man with sawdust for brains would ask for another mat sighed turning on his stool a varied crowd clogged the sevenstriped lass caemlyn was fuller than a lionfish at a shipwreck these days practically bursting at the seams that kept the taverns busy in the corner some farmers in workcoats fraying at the collars played at dice mat had played a few rounds with them earlier and had paid for his drink with their coins but he hated gambling for coppers the blufffaced man in the corner was still drinkingmust be fourteen mugs sitting empty beside him nowhis companions cheering him onward a group of nobles sat off from the rest and he would have asked them for a nice game of dice but the expressions on their faces could have frightened away bears they had probably been on the wrong side of the succession war mat wore a black coat with lace at the cuffs only a little lace and no embroidery reluctantly he had left his widebrimmed hat back in camp and he had grown a few days scrub on his chin that itched like he had fleas and he looked a bloody fool but the scrub made him harder to recognize with every footpad in the city having a picture of him it was best to be safe he wished being taveren would help him for once but it was best not to count on that being taveren had not been good for anything he could tell he kept his scarf tucked low and his coat buttoned the high collar up nearly to his chin he had already died once he was fairly certain and was not eager to try again a pretty serving girl walked by slender and widehipped with long dark hair she let hang free he moved to the side allowing his empty mug to look lonely and obvious on the counter and she walked over with a smile to refill it he grinned at her and tipped a copper he was a married man and could not afford to charm her but he could keep an eye out for his friends thorn might like her a girl might make him stop moping about so much at least mat watched the girls face for a time to be certain he would recognize her again mat sipped at his ale one hand feeling at the letter in his pocket he did not speculate at what was in it do that and he would be only one step from ripping it open he was a little like a mouse staring at a trap with moldy cheese in it he did not want that cheese it could rot for all he cared the letter would probably instruct him to do something dangerous and embarrassing aes sedai had a fondness for making men look like fools light he hoped that she had not left instructions for him to help someone in trouble if that were the case surely she would have seen to it herself he sighed and took another pull on his ale in the corner the drinking man finally toppled over sixteen mugs not bad mat set aside his own drink left a few coins as payment then nodded farewell to melli he collected his winnings on the wager regarding the drinking man from a longfingered fellow in the corner mat had bet on seventeen mugs which was close enough to win some then he was on his way taking his walking stick from the stand by the door the bouncer berg eyed him berg had a face ugly enough to make his own mother wince the shoulderthumper did not like mat and from the way berg looked at melli that was probably because he figured mat was trying to make eyes at his woman never mind that mat had explained he was married and did not do that sort of thing any longer some men would be jealous no matter what they were told the streets of caemlyn were busy even at this late hour the paving stones were damp from a recent shower though those clouds had passed by andremarkablyleft the sky open to the air he moved northward along the street heading for another tavern he knew one where men diced for silver and gold mat was not about any specific task tonight just listening for rumors getting a feel for caemlyn a lot had changed since he had been here last as he walked he could not help looking over his shoulder those bloody pictures had him unnerved many of the people on the street seemed suspicious a few murandians passed looking so drunk that he could have lit their breath on fire mat kept his distance after what had happened to him in hinderstap he figured he could not be too careful light he had heard stories of paving stones attacking people if a man could not trust the rocks under his feet what could he trust he eventually reached the tavern he wanted a cheery place called the dead mans breath it had two toughs out front holding cudgels they patted against enormous palms lots of extra tavern toughs were being hired these days mat would have to watch himself not win too much tavernkeepers did not like a man winning too much as it could bring a fight unless the man spent his winnings on food and drink then he could win all he liked thank you very much the inside of this tavern was darker than the sevenstriped lass had been the men here hunched low over drinks or games and there was not much food being served just strong drinks the wooden bar had nails whose heads jutted out a fingernail or so high and jabbed you in the arms mat figured they were working to pull themselves free and run for the door the tavernkeeper bernherd was a greasyhaired tairen with a mouth so small it looked like he had swallowed his lips by mistake he smelled of radishes and mat had never seen him smile not even when tipped most tavernkeepers would smile at the dark one himself for a tip mat hated gambling and drinking in a place where you had to keep one hand on your coin purse but he had a mind to win some real money tonight and there were dice games going and coins clinking so he felt somewhat at home the lace on his coat did get glances why had he taken to wearing that anyway best have lopin pull it off his cuffs when he got back to the camp well not all of it some of it maybe mat found a game at the back being played by three men and a woman in breeches she had short golden hair and nice eyes mat noticed those purely for thorns sake she had a full bosom anyway and lately mat had a mind for women who were more slender through the chest in minutes mat was dicing with them and that calmed him a measure he kept his coin pouch in sight though laying it on the floor in front of him before long the pile of coins beside it grew mostly silvers you hear about what happened over at farriers green one of the men asked his fellows as mat tossed it was a terrible thing the speaker was a tall fellow with a pinchedup face that looked like it had been closed in a door a few times he called himself chaser mat figured that was because the women ran away from him after they got a look at that face and he had to run after them what clare asked she was the goldenhaired woman mat gave her a smile he did not dice against women much as most claimed to find dicing improper never mind that they never complained when a man bought them something nice with what he had won anyway dicing with women was not fair since one of his smiles could set their hearts fluttering and they would get all weak in the knees but mat did not smile at girls that way anymore besides she had not responded to any of his smiles anyway jowdry chaser said as mat shook his dice they found him dead this morning throat ripped clean out body was drained of blood like a wineskin full of holes mat was so startled that he threw the dice but did not watch them roll what he demanded what did you say here now chaser said looking toward mat its just someone we knew owed me two crowns he did drained of blood mat said are you sure did you see the body what chaser said grimacing bloody ashes man whats wrong with you chaser clare said will you look at that the lean man glanced down as did mat the dice he had tossedall three of themhad landed still and were balanced on their corners light he had tossed coins so they fell on their sides before but he had never done anything like this right there all of a sudden the dice started rattling inside his head he almost jumped clear to the ceiling blood and bloody ashes those dice in his head never meant anything good they only stopped when something changed something that usually meant bad news for poor matrim cauthon i aint never chaser said well call that a loss mat said tossing a few coins down and scooping up the rest of his winnings what do you know about jowdry clare demanded she was reaching for her waist mat would have bet gold against coppers on her having a knife there the way she glared at him nothing mat said nothing and too much at the same time excuse me he hastily crossed the tavern as he did he noticed one of the thickarmed toughs from the door standing and talking to bernherd the tavernkeeper pointing at a piece of paper in his hands mat could not see what was on it but he could guess his own face he cursed and ducked out onto the street he took the first alley he saw breaking into a run the forsaken hunting him a picture of his face in the pocket of every footpad in the city and a corpse killed and drained of its blood that could only mean one thing the gholam was in caemlyn it seemed impossible that it could have gotten here this quickly of course mat had seen it squeeze through a hole not two handspans wide the thing did not seem to have a right sense of what was possible and what was not possible blood and bloody ashes he thought ducking his head he needed to collect thorn and get back to the bands camp outside of the city he hastened down the dark rainslicked street paving stones reflected the lit oil lamps ahead elayne kept the queens walk well illuminated at night he had sent word to her but had not gotten a reply how was that for gratitude by his count he had saved her life twice once should have been enough to reduce her to tears and kisses but he had not seen even a peck on the cheek not that he wanted one not from royalty best to avoid them youre married to a bloody high lady of the seamhan he thought daughter of the empress herself there was no avoiding royalty now not for him at least tuon was pretty and good at playing stones and very keen of wit good for talking to even if she was flaming frustrating most of the no no thinking of tuon right now anyway he had received no reply from elayne he would need to be more firm it was not just aludra and her dragons now the bloody gholam was in the city he stepped out onto a large busy street hands pushed into the pockets of his coat in his haste he had left his walking staff back in the dead mans breath he grumbled to himself he was supposed to be spending his days relaxing his nights dicing in fine inns and his mornings sleeping late while waiting for verins thirtyday requirement to run out now this he had a score to settle with that gholam the innocents it had slaughtered while lurking around ebou dar were bad enough and mat had not forgotten nalesean and the five redarms who had been murdered either bloody ashes it had had enough to answer for already then it had taken tylin mat removed a hand from his pocket feeling at the foxhead medallion restingas alwaysagainst his chest he was tired of running from that monster a plan started to form in his mind accompanied by the rattling of dice he tried to banish the image of the queen lying in bonds mat himself had tied her head ripped free there would have been so much blood the gholam lived on fresh blood mat shivered shoving his hand back into his pocket as he approached the city gate despite the darkness he could pick out signs of the battle that had been fought here an arrowhead embedded into the doorway of a building to his left a dark patch on the wall of a guardhouse staining the wood beneath the window a man had died there perhaps while firing a crossbow out and had slumped down over the windows ledge bleeding his lifeblood down the wood that siege was over now and a new queenthe right queenheld the throne for once there had been a battle and he had missed it remembering that lightened his mood somewhat an entire war had been fought over the lion throne and not one arrow blade or spear had entered the conflict seeking matrim cauthons heart he turned right along the inside of the city wall there were a lot of inns here there were always inns near city gates not the nicest ones but almost always the most profitable ones light spilled from doorways and windows painting the road golden in atches dark forms crowded the alleyways except where the inns had hired men to keep the poor away caemlyn was strained the flood of refugees the recent fighting the other matters stories abounded of the dead walking of food spoiling of whitewashed walls suddenly going grimy the inn where thorn had chosen to perform was a steeproofed brickfronted structure with a sign that showed two apples one eaten down to the core that made it stark white the other was stark redcolorsof the andoran flag the two apples was one of the nicer establishments in the area mat could hear the music from outside he entered and saw thorn sitting atop a small dais on the far side of the common room playing his flute and wearing his patchwork gleemans cloak his eyes were closed as he played his mustache drooping long and white on either side of the instrument it was a haunting tune the marriage of cinny wade mat had learned it as always choose the right horse and still was not used to it being performed as slowly as thom did a small collection of coins was scattered on the floor in front of thom the inn allowed him to play for tips mat stopped near the doorway and leaned back to listen nobody spoke in the common room though it was stuffed so full mat could have made half a company of soldiers just with the men inside every eye was on thom mat had been all around the world now walking a great deal of it on his own two feet he had nearly lost his skin in a dozen different cities and had stayed in inns far and near he had heard gleemen performers and bards thom made the entire lot seem like children with sticks banging on pots the flute was a simple instrument a lot of nobles would rather hear the harp instead one man in ebou dar had told mat the harp was more elevated mat figured he would have gone slackjawed and saucereyed if he had heard thom play the gleeman made the flute sound like an extension of his own soul soft trills minor scales and powerfully bold long holds such a lamenting melody who was thom sorrowing for the crowd watched caemlyn was one of the greatest cities in the world but still the variety seemed incredible crusty illianers sat beside smooth domani crafty cairhienin stout tairens and a sprinkling of borderlanders caemlyn was seen as one of the few places where one could be safe from both the seanchan and the dragon there was a bit of food too thorn finished the piece and moved on to another without opening hjs eyes mat sighed hating to break up thorns performance unfortunately it was time to be moving on back to camp they had to talk about the i gholam and mat needed to find a way to get through to elayne maybe thorn would go talk to her for him mat nodded to the innkeepera stately darkhaired woman named bromas she nodded to mat hoop earrings catching the light she was a little older than his normal tastebut then tylin had been her age he would keep her in mind for one of his men of course maybe vanin mat reached the stage then began to scoop up the coins he would let thorn finish andmats hand jerked his arm was suddenly pinned by the cuff to the stage a knife sticking through the cloth the thin length of metal quivered mat glanced up to find thorn still playing though the gleeman had cracked an eye before throwing the knife thorn raised his hand back up and continued playing a smile showing on his puckered lips mat grumbled and yanked his cuff free waiting as thorn finished this tune which was not as doleful as the other when the lanky gleeman lowered the flute the room burst into applause mat favored the gleeman with a scowl burn you thorn this is one of my favorite coats be glad i did not aim for the hand thorn noted wiping down the flute nodding to the cheering and applause of the inns patrons they called for him to continue but he shook a regretful head and replaced his flute in its case i almost wish you would have mat said raising his cuff and sticking a finger through the holes blood would not have shown that much on the black but the stitching will be obvious just because you wear more patches than cloak doesnt mean i want to imitate you and you complain that youre not a lord thorn said leaning down to collect his earnings im not mat said and never mind what tuon said burn you im no bloody nobleman ever heard of a farmer complaining that his coat stitches would show you dont have to be a lord to want to dress with some sense mat grumbled thorn laughed slapping him on the back and hopping down im sorry mat i moved by instinct didnt realize it was you until i saw the face attached to the arm by then the knife was already out of my fingers mat sighed thorn he said grimly an old friend is in town one who leaves folks dead with their throats ripped clean out thorn nodded looking troubled i heard about it from some guardsmen during my break and were stuck here in the city unless you decide im not opening the letter mat said verin could have left instructions for me to crawl all the way to falme on my hands and id bloody have to do it i know you hate the delay but that letter could make a much worse delay thorn nodded reluctantly lets get back to camp mat said the bands camp was a league outside of caemlyn thorn and mat had not ridden inwalkers were less conspicuous and mat would not bring horses into the city until he found a stable that he trusted the price of good horses was getting ridiculous he had hoped to leave that behind once he left seanchan lands but elaynes armies were buying up every good horse they could find and most of the notsogood ones too beyond that he had heard that horses had a way of disappearing these days meat was meat and people were close to starving even in caemlyn it made mats skin crawl but it was the truth he and thorn spent the walk back talking about the gbolam deciding very little other than to make everyone alert and have mat start sleeping in a different tent every night mat glanced over his shoulder as the two of them crested a hilltop caemlyn was ablaze with the light of torches and lamps illumination hung over the city like a fog grand spires and towers lit by the glow the old memories inside him remembered this cityremembered assaulting it before andor was even a nation caemlyn had never made for an easy fight he did not envy the houses that had tried to seize it from elayne thorn stepped up beside him it seems like forever since we left here last doesnt it mat burn me but it does mat said what ever convinced us to go hunting those fool girls next time they can save themselves thorn eyed him arent we about to do the same thing when we go to the tower of ghenjei its different we cant leave her with them those snakes and foxes im not complaining mat thorn said im just thoughtful thorn seemed thoughtful a lot lately moping around caressing that worn letter from moiraine it was only a letter come on mat said turning back along the road you were telling me about getting in to see the queen thorn joined him on the dark roadway im not surprised she hasnt replied to you mat shes probably got her hands full word is that trollocs have invaded the borderlands in force and andor is still fractured from the succession elayne do you have any good news thorn mat said tell me some if you do ive a mind for it i wish that the queens blessing were still open gill always had tidbits to share good news mat prodded again all right well the tower of ghenjei is right where domon said i have word from three other ships captains its past an open plain several hundred miles northwest of whitebridge mat nodded rubbing his chin he felt like he could remember something of the tower a silvery structure unnatural in the distance a trip on a boat water lapping at the sides bayle domons thick illianer accent those images were vague to mat his memories of the time were full of more holes than one of jori congars alibis bayle domon had been able to tell them where to find the tower but mat wanted confirmation the way domon bowed and scraped for leilwin made mat itch neither showed mat much affection for all the fact that he had saved them not that he had wanted any affection from leilwin kissing her would be about as fun as kissing a stoneoaks bark you think domons description will be enough for someone to make us one of those gateways there mat asked i dont know thorn said though thats a secondary problem i should think where are we going to find someone to make a gateway verin has vanished ill find a way if you dont well end up spending weeks traveling to the place thorn said i dont like ill find us a gateway mat said firmly maybe verin will come back and release me from this bloody oath best that one stays away thorn said i dont trust her theres something off about that one shes aes sedai mat said theres something off about them all like dice where the pips dont add upbut for an aes sedai i kind of like verin and im a good judge of character you know that thorn raised an eyebrow mat scowled back either way thorn said we should probably start sending guards with you when you visit the city guards wont help against the gholam no but what of the thugs who jumped you on your way back to camp three nights back mat shivered at least those were just good honest thieves they only wanted my purse nice and natural not a one had a picture of me in their pockets and its not like they were twisted by the dark ones power to go crazy at sunset or anything still thorn said mat made no argument burn him but he probably should be bringing soldiers with him a few redarms anyway the camp was just ahead one of elaynes clerks a man named norry had granted the band permission to camp in caemlyns proximity they had to agree to allow no more than a hundred men to go into the city on a given day and had to camp at least a league from the walls out of the way of any villages and not on anyones farmland talking to that clerk meant elayne knew mat was here she had to but she had sent no greetings no acknowledgment that she owed mat her skin at a bend in the road thorns lantern showed a group of redarms lounging by the side gufrin sergeant of a squad stood and saluted he was a sturdy broadshouldered man not terribly bright but keen eyed lord mat he said any news gufrin mat asked the sergeant frowned to himself well he said i think theres something you might want to know light the man spoke more slowly than a drunk seanchan the aes sedai came back to camp today while you was away my lord all three of them mat asked yes my lord mat sighed if there had been any hope of this day turning out to be anything other than sour that washed it away he had hoped they would stay inside the city for a few more days he and thorn continued leaving the road and heading down a path through a field of blackwasp nettles and knifegrass the weeds crunched as they walked thorns lantern lighting the brown stalks on one hand it was good to be back in andor again it almost felt like home with those nds of leatherleaf trees and sourgum however coming back to find it looking so dead was disheartening what to do about elayne women were troublesome aes sedai were worse queens were the worst of the lot and she was all bloody three how was he going to get her to give him her foundries he had taken verins offer in part because he thought it would get him to andor quicker and therefore to start work on aludras dragons ahead the bands camp sat on a small series of hills entrenched around the largest of them at the center mats force had met up with estean and the others that had gone ahead to andor and the band was well and truly whole again fires burned there was no trouble finding dead wood for fires these days smoke lingered in the air and mat heard men chatting and calling it was not too late yet and mat did not enforce a curfew if he could not relax at least his men could it might be the last chance they got before the last battle trollocs in the borderlands mat thought we need those dragons soon mat returned salutes from a few guard posts and parted with thorn meaning to go find a bed and sleep on his problems for the night as he did he noted a few changes he could make to the camp the way the hillsides were arranged a light cavalry charge could come galloping through the corridor between them only someone very bold would try such a tactic but he had done just that during the battle of marisin valley back in old coremanda well not mat himself but someone in those old memories more and more he simply accepted those memories as his own he had not asked for themno matter what those bloody foxes claimedbut he had paid for them with the scar around his neck they had been useful on more than one occasion he finally reached his tent intending to get fresh smallclothes before finding a different tent for the night when he heard a womans voice calling to him matrim cauthon bloody ashes he had almost made it he turned reluctantly teslyn baradon was not a pretty woman though she might have made a passable paperbark tree with those bony fingers those narrow shoulders and that gaunt face she wore a red dress and over the weeks her eyes had lost most of the nervous skittishness she had shown since spending time as a damane she had a glare so practiced she could have won a staring contest with a post matrim cauthon she said stepping up to him i do be needing to speak with you well seems that youre doing so already mat said dropping his hand from his tent flap he had a slight fondness for teslyn against his better judgment but he was not about to invite her in no more than he would invite a fox into his henhouse regardless of how kindly he thought of the fox in question so i do be she replied youve heard the news of the white tower news mat said no ive heard no news rumors though ive a brainful of those some say the white tower has been reunified which is what youre probably talking about but ive also heard just as many claiming that it is still at war and that the amyrlin fought the last battle in rands place and that the aes sedai have decided to raise an army of soldiers by giving birth to them and that flying monsters attacked the white tower that last one is probably just stories of raken drifting up from the south but i think the one about aes sedai raising an army of babies holds some water teslyn regarded him with a flat stare he did not look away good thing mats father had always said he was more stubborn than a flaming tree stump remarkably teslyn sighed her face softening you be of course rightly skeptical but we cannot ignore the news even edesina who foolishly sided with the rebels does wish to return we do plan to go in the morning as it is your habit to sleep late i wanted to come to you tonight in order to give you my thanks your what my thanks master cauthon teslyn said dryly this trip did not be easy upon any of us there have been moments of tension i do not say that i agree with each decision you made that do not remove the fact that without you i would still be in seanchan hands she shivered i pretend during my more confident moments that i would have resisted them and eventually escaped on my own it do be important to maintain some illusions with yourself would you not say mat rubbed his chin maybe teslyn maybe indeed remarkably she held out her hand to him remember should you ever come to the white tower you do have women there who are in your debt matrim cauthon i do not forget he took the hand it felt as bony as it looked but it was warmer than he had expected some aes sedai had ice running in their veins that was for certain but others were not so bad she nodded to him a respectful nod almost a bow mat released her and feeling as unsettled as if someone had kicked his legs out from underneath him she turned to walk back toward her own tent youll be needing horses he said if you wait to leave until i get up in the morning ill give you some and some provisions wouldnt do for you to starve before you get to tar valon and from what weve seen lately the villages youll pass wont have anything to spare you told joline i counted my horses again mat said those dice were still rattling in his head burn them i did another count of the bands horses turns out we have some to spare you may take them i did not come to you tonight to manipulate you into giving me horses teslyn said i do be sincere so i figured mat said turning lifting up the flap to his tent thats why i made the offer he stepped into the tent there he froze that scent blood chapter blood in the air mat ducked immediately that instinct saved his life as something swung through the air above his head mat rolled to the side his hand hitting something wet as it touched the floor murder he bellowed murder in the camp bloody murder something moved toward him the tent was completely black but he could hear it mat stumbled but luck was with him as again something swished near him mat hit the ground and rolled flinging his hand to the side he had left there he came up beside his sleeping pallet his hand grasping at the long wooden haft there he threw himself backward to his feet hauling the ashandarei up then spun and slashednot at the form moving through the tent toward him but at the wall the fabric cut easily and mat leaped out clutching his longbladed spear in one hand with his other hand he reached for the leather strap at his neck his fingernails ripping at his skin in his haste he pulled the foxhead medallion off and turned in the brush outside the tent a weak light came from a nearby lantern on a post at an intersection of camp pathways by it mat made out the figure sliding out the rip in the tent a figure he had feared to see the gholam looked like a man slender with sandy hair and unremarkable features the only thing distinct about the thing was the scar on its cheek it was supposed to look harmless supposed to be forgettable if most people saw this thing in a crowd they would ignore it right up to the point where it ripped their throat out mat backed away his tent was near a hillside and he backed up to it pulling the foxhead medallion up and wrapping it tightly by its leather strap to the side of his ashandarei s blade it was far from a perfect fit but he had practiced this the medallion was the only thing he knew that could hurt the gholam he worked swiftly still yelling for help soldiers would be no use against this thing but the gholam had said before that it had been ordered to avoid too much notice attention might frighten it away it did hesitate glancing toward the camp then it turned back to mat stepping forward its movements were as fluid as silk rippling in the wind you should be proud it whispered the one who now controls me wants you more than anyone else i am to ignore all others until i have tasted your blood in its left hand the creature carried a long dagger its right hand dripped blood mat felt a freezing chill who had it killed who else had been murdered in matrim cauthon s stead the image of tylin flashed in his mind again he had not seen her corpse the scene was left to his imagination unfortunately mat had a pretty good imagination that image in his head smelling the blood on the air he did the most foolish thing he could have he attacked screaming in the open darkness mat spun forward swinging the ashandarei the creature was so fast it seemed to flow out of the way of his weapon it rounded him like a circling wolf footsteps barely making a sound in the dried weeds it struck its form a blur and only a backward jump by reflex saved mat he scrambled through the weeds swinging the ashandarei it seemed wary of the medallion light without that mat would be dead and bleeding on the ground it came at him again like liquid darkness mat swung wildly and clipped the gholam more by luck than anything else the medallion made a searing hiss as it touched the beasts hand the scent of burned flesh rose in the air and the gholam scrambled back you didnt have to kill her burn you mat yelled at it you could have left her you didnt want her you wanted me the thing merely grinned its mouth an awful black teeth twisted a bird must fly a man must breathe i must kill it stalked forward and mat knew he was in trouble the cries of alarm were loud now it had only been a few moments but a few more and help would arrive only a few more moments ive been told to kill them all the gholam said softly to bring you out the man with the mustache the aged one who interfered last time the little darkskinned woman who holds your affection all of them unless i take you now burn that gholam how did the thing know about tuon how it was impossible he was so startled that he barely had time to raise the ashandarei as the gholam leaped for him mat cursed twisting to the side but too late the creatures knife flashed in the air then the weapon jerked and ripped sideways from its fingers mat started then felt something wrap around him and jerk him backward out of the reach of the gholams swipe weaves of air teslyn she stood in front of his tent her face a mask of concentration you wont be able to touch it directly with weaves mat screamed as her air deposited him a short distance from the gholam if she had been able to bloody raise him up high enough he would have been fine with that but he had never seen an aes sedai lift someone more than a pace or so in the air he scrambled to the side the gholam charging after him then something large flew between them causing the gholam to dodge fluidly the objecta chaircrashed into the hillside beside them the gholam spun as a large bench smashed into it throwing it backward mat steadied himself looking at teslyn who was reaching into his tent with invisible weaves of air clever woman he thought weaves could not touch the gholam but something thrown by them could that would not stop it mat had seen the creature pluck out a knife that had been rammed into its chest it had shown the indifference a man would show at plucking a burr from his clothing but now soldiers were leaping over pathways carrying pikes or swords and shields the entire camp was being lit up the gholam gave mat a glare then dashed off toward the darkness outside of camp mat spun then froze as he saw two redarms set pikes against the oncoming gholam gorderan and fergin both men who had survived the time in ebou dar no mat yelled let it too late the gholam indifferently slid between the pikes grabbing each mans throat in a hand then crushing its fingers together with a spin it ripped free their flesh dropping both men then it was off into the darkness burn you mat thought starting to dash after it ill gut you andhe froze blood in the air from inside his tent he had nearly forgotten that olver mat scrambled back to the tent it was dark within though the scent of blood once again assaulted him light teslyn can you a globe of light appeared behind him the light of her globe was enough to illuminate a terrible scene inside lopin mats serving man lay dead his blood darkening the tent floor in a large black pool two other menriddem and will reeve redarms who had been guarding his doorwere heaped onto his sleeping pallet he should have noticed that they were missing from their post fool mat felt a stab of sorrow for the dead lopin who had only recently shown that he was recovered from naleseans death light burn him he had been a good man not even a soldier just a serving man content to have someone to take care of mat now felt terrible for having complained about him without lopins help mat would not have been able to escape ebou dar and the four redarms two of whom had survived ebou dar and the gholams previous attack i should have sent word mat thought should have put the entire camp on alert would that have done any good the gholam had proven itself practically unstoppable mat had the suspicion that it could cut down the entire band in getting to him if it needed to only its masters command that it avoid attention prevented it from doing so he did not see any sign of olver though the boy should have been sleeping on his pallet in the corner lopins blood had pooled nearby and olvers blanket was soaking it up from the bottom mat took a deep breath and began searching through the shambles overturning blankets and looking behind travel furniture worried at what he might find more soldiers arrived cursing the camp was coming alert horns of warning blowing lanterns being lit armor clanking olver mat said to the soldiers gathering at his doorway he had searched the entire bloody tent has anyone seen him i think he was with noal said slone maddow a wideeared redarm they mat shoved his way out of the tent then ran through camp toward noals tent he arrived just as the whitehaired man was stepping out looking about in alarm olver mat asked reaching the older man hes safe mat noal said grimacing im sorryi didnt mean to alarm you we were playing snakes and foxes and the boy fell asleep on v floor i pulled a blanket over him hes been staying up so late waiting for you these nights that i figured it was best not to wake him i should have sent word youre sorry mat said grabbing noal in an embrace you bloody wonderful man you saved his life an hour later mat sat with thorn and noal inside thorns small tent a dozen redarms guarded the place and olver had been sent to sleep in teslyns tent the boy did not know how close he had come to being killed hopefully he never would mat wore his medallion again though he needed to find a new leather strap the ashandarei had cut the other one up pretty bad he would need to find a better way to tie it on there thorn mat said softly the creature threatened you and you too noal it didnt mention olver but it did mention tuon how would the thing know about her thom asked scratching at his head the guards found another corpse outside of the camp derry derry was a soldier who had gone missing a few days back and mat had presumed him to have deserted it happened sometimes though desertion was irregular in the band hed been dead a few days it took him that long ago noal said frowning noals shoulders were stooped and he had a nose the shape of a large bent pepper growing right out the middle of his face he had always looked worn to mat his hands were so gnarled they seemed to be all knuckles it must have interrogated him mat said found out people i spent time with where my tent was is the thing capable of that thom said it seemed more like a hound to me hunting you out it knew where to find me in tylins palace mat said even after i was gone it went to her rooms so either it asked someone or it was observing well never know if derry was tortured or if he just ran across the gholam while it was sneaking about the camp and spying but the thing is clever it wouldnt actually go after tuon would it threatening his friends was probably just a way to unhinge mat after all the thing had shown tonight that it still had orders to avoid too much attention that didnt console mat much if that monster hurt tuon there was only one way to make sure that didnt happen so what do we do noal asked were going to hunt it mat said softly and were going to kill the bloody thing noal and thorn fell silent i wont have this thing chasing us all the way to the tower of ghenjei mat said but can it be killed mat thom asked anything can be killed mat said teslyn proved that she could still hurt it using the one power if she was clever well have to do something similar what noal asked i dont know yet mat said i want you two to continue your preparations get us ready so that we can leave for the tower of ghenjei as soon as my oath to verin will let us burn me i still need to talk to elayne i want aludras dragons started ill have to write her another letter stronger this time for now were going to make some changes im going to start sleeping in the city a different inn each night well let the band know it so if the gholam listens it will find out there will be no need for it to attack the men you two will need to move to the city too until this is done until it is dead or i am the question is what to do about olver the thing didnt mention him but he saw understanding in thorns and noals eyes mat had left tylin behind and she was dead now he was not going to do the same to olver well have to take the boy with us thom said either that or send him away i heard the aes sedai talking earlier noal said rubbing his face with a bony finger theyre planning to leave maybe send him with them mat grimaced the way olver leered at women the aes sedai would have him strung up by his toes in a day flat mat was surprised it had not happened already if he ever found out which of the redarms was teaching the boy to act that way around women i doubt wed be able to get him to go mat said hed be out of their sight and back here their first night away thom nodded in agreement well have to take him with us mat said have him stay at the inns inside the city maybe that matrim cauthon the shrill call came from outside thorns tent mat sighed then nodded to the other two and stood up he stepped out of the tent to find that joline and her warders had bullied their way hrough the redarms and had nearly yanked open the tent flaps to come stalking in his appearance drew her up short several of the redarms looked abashed at having let her through but the men could not be blamed bloody aes sedai would bloody do what they bloody pleased the woman herself was everything that teslyn was not slender and pretty she wore a white dress with a deep neckline she often smiled though that smile became thinlipped when she turned it on mat and she had large brown eyes the type of eyes that could suck a man in and try to drown him pretty as she was mat did not think of her as a match for one of his friends he would never wish joline upon someone he liked in fact he was too gentlemanly to wish her on most of his enemies best she stayed with fen and blaeric her warders who were madmen in mats opinion both were borderlandersone shienaran the other saldaean fens tilted eyes were hard he always seemed to be looking for someone to murder each conversation with him was an interview to see if you fit the criteria blaerics topknot was growing in and getting longer but it was still too short mat would have mentioned that it looked remarkably like a badgers tail glued to his head except that he did not feel like being murdered today it had already been a bloody awful evening joline folded her arms beneath her breasts it appears that your reports of this creature that is chasing you were accurate she sounded skeptical he had lost five good men and she sounded skeptical bloody aes sedai and he asked you know something about gholam not a thing she said regardless i need to return to the white tower i will be leaving tomorrow she looked hesitant i would like to ask if you would lend me some horses for the trip whatever you can spare i will not be picky nobody in town would sell you any eh mat said with a grunt her face became even more serene well all right mat said at least you asked nicely this time though i can see how hard it was for you ive promised some to teslyn already you have some too it will be worth it to have you bloody women out of my hair thank you she said her voice controlled however a word of advice considering the company you often keep you might want to learn to control your language considering the company i keep all too often mat said its bloodv amazing i dont swear more off with you joline i need to write a lettei to her royal bloody majesty queen elayne the prim joline sniffed are you going to swear at her too of course i am mat muttered turning to go back to thorns tent how else is she going to trust that its really from me chapter after the taint i agree with those counts elyas said walking at perrins side grady walked on the other side thoughtful in his black coat montem alsan and azi althoneperrins two guards for the daytrailed behind it was still early in the morning perrin was ostensibly checking on guard posts but he really just wanted to be walking theyd moved the camp to an elevated meadow along the jehannah road it had a good water supply and was near enough to the road to control it but far enough back to be defensible on one side of the meadow an ancient statue lay before a patch of trees the statue had fallen on its side long ago and most of it was now buried but an arm rose from the earth holding the hilt of a sword the blade was thrust into the ground i shouldnt have sent gill and the others ahead perrin said that let them be snatched up by the first passing force you couldnt have anticipated this elyas said nor could you have anticipated being delayed where would you have left them shaido were coming up behind and if our battle at maiden hadnt gone well gill and the others would have been trapped between two groups of enemy aiel perrin growled to himself his booted feet stuck a little in the sodden ground he hated the scent of that trampled stagnant mud mixed with rotting dead plants it wasnt nearly as bad as the blight disease but it seemed to him the whole land was only a few steps away from that they approached a guard post two menhu barran and darl coplin stood watch here there would be additional scouts of course two rivers men in trees maidens patrolling the ground but perrin had learned that a few men given posts around the camp lent everyone inside a sense of order the guards saluted him though darls salute was sloppy they gave off an odd mixture of scentsregret frustration disappointment and embarrassment that last one was faint but still there perrins supposed dalliance with berelain was still recent in their minds and failes return seemed to increase their discomfort in the two rivers one did not easily live down a reputation for infidelity perrin nodded to them then continued on he didnt do much formal inspecting if the men knew he would walk by sometime each day theyd keep themselves in order for the most part last night he had needed to prod sleeping berin thane awake with his boot and he was always careful to watch for the scent of strong drink among them he wouldnt put it past jori congar to sneak a nip or two while on guard all right perrin said the whitecloaks have our people and our supplies he grimaced thinking of the grain purchased in so habor going to fill whitecloak bellies could we sneak in and free them i dont see the need for sneaking grady said from behind pardon my lord but you seem to be making this a larger problem than it is perrin looked back at the leathery man theyre whitecloaks grady theyre always a large problem they wont have anyone who can channel the one power grady shrugged hands clasped behind his back as he walked with the black coat the pin and the increasingly soldierlike attitude he was looking less and less like a farmer neald is feeling better he and i could pound those children down until they give us what we want perrin nodded he hated the idea of letting the ashaman loose with impunity the scent of burned flesh in the air the earth ripped apart and broken the scents of dumais wells however he couldnt afford another distraction like maiden if there were no other choice hed give the order not yet though there are no coincidences with taveren the wolves the whitecloaks things he had been outrunning for some time were returning to hunt him hed pushed the children out of the two rivers many of the men who had been with him then now followed him here perhaps it will come to that perrin said to grady still walking but maybe not weve got a larger force than they do and with that blasted wolfhead banner finally taken down they may not realize who we are we fly the banner of the queen of ghealdan and theyre passing through alliandres territory likely they saw the supplies in our peoples carts and decided to protect them some discussion perhaps a little intimidation may be enough to persuade them to return our people elyas nodded and grady seemed to agree though perrin wasnt convinced by his own words the whitecloaks had haunted him since his early days out of the two rivers dealing with them had never been simple it felt like the time had come time to make an end to his troubles with them one way or another he continued his rounds arriving at the aiel section of the camp he nodded at a pair of maidens lounging on guard with relaxed alertness they didnt stand up or salutewhich suited him finethough they did nod hed apparently gained great ji in their eyes by the way hed planned then accomplished the attack on the shaido the aiel maintained their own guard posts and he had no reason to inspect them but he included them in his rounds anyway it seemed that if he was going to visit the other sections of camp he should do it here too grady stopped suddenly and spun toward the wise ones tents what perrin asked urgently scanning the camp he couldnt see anything unusual grady smiled i think theyve managed it he started into the aiel camp ignoring the glares several maidens gave him they might very well have tossed him out ashaman or no if perrin hadnt been there neald perrin thought hes been working with the aes sedai to figure out circles if grady had seen something in the weaves perrin followed and soon they reached a ring of wise one tents in the center of the aiel camp the area between them driedperhaps by weavesand the ground packed down neald edarra and masuri sat there fager neald was a young murandian with a mustache that curled to points he wore no pins on the collar of his black coat though hed likely be promoted as soon as the group returned from their excursion hed grown in power since theyd begun he was still pale from the snakebites hed taken but looked much better than he had only a few days back he was smiling staring at the air in front of him and he smelled exuberant a large gateway split the air perrin grunted it appeared to lead back to a place where theyd camped several weeks agoan open field of no real note its working grady said kneeling down beside neald its beautiful jur neald said softly his voice bore no hint of the bravado he often displayed i can feelsaidar its like im more complete now youre channeling it perrin asked no i dont need to i can use it use it how grady asked eager i its hard to explain the weaves are saidin but i seem to be able to strengthen them with saidar so long as i can make a gateway on my own it appears that i can increase the powerand sizewith what the women lend me light its wonderful we should have done this months ago perrin glanced at the two women masuri and edarra neither seemed as exultant as neald masuri looked a little sick and she smelled of fear edarra smelled curious and wary grady had mentioned that creating a circle this way seemed to require the men to gain control over the women well send the scouting group through to cairhien soon then perrin said fingering the blacksmiths puzzle in his pocket grady arrange with the aiel about that mission set up the gateways as they ask yes my lord grady said rubbing his leathery face i should probably learn this technique rather than continuing on rounds though theres something ill be wanting to talk to you about first if youve the time if you wish perrin said stepping away from the group to the side several of the other wise ones came forward and told neald it was their turn to try the circle with him they didnt act at all as if neald were in charge and he was quick to obey hed been walking lightly around the aiel since hed said something a little too frisky to a maiden and ended up playing maidens kiss what is this about grady perrin asked once they were a little way off well neald and i are both well enough to make gateways it seems grady said i was wondering if i might he seemed hesitant well if i might have leave to slip over to the black tower for an afternoon to see my family thats right perrin thought hes got a wife and a son the ashaman didnt often talk about them actually he didnt often talk about much i dont know grady perrin said glancing up at the darkly clouded sky we have whitecloaks ahead and theres still no telling for sure if those shaido will loop around and try to ambush us im loath to be without you until i know were someplace safe it neednt be for long my lord grady said earnestly perrin sometimes forgot how young the man was only six or seven years older than himself grady seemed so much older in that black coat with his sundarkened face well find a time perrin said soon i dont want to upset anything until we have word of whats been happening since we left information could be potent balwer had taught him that grady nodded looking placated though perrin hadnt given him anything definite light even the ashaman were starting to smell like people ho saw him as their lord theyd been so aloof when this all began you never worried about this before grady perrin said has something changed everything grady said softly perrin got a whiff of his scent hopeful it changed a few weeks back but of course you dont know nobody knows fager and i werent certain at first and we werent sure if we should tell anyone for fear of sounding delusional know what my lord the taint its gone perrin frowned was this madness speaking but grady didnt smell mad it happened on that day grady said when we saw something to the north my lord i know it sounds unbelievable but it is true seems the sort of thing rand might have been about perrin said and the colors swirled in front of him he banished them if you say it ill trust you grady but what does this have to do with the black tower and your family you want to go see if other ashaman agree oh theyll agree grady said its well my lord im a simple man sora shes always been the thinker i do what needs doing and thats that well joining the black tower that was something that needed doing i knew what was going to happen when i was tested i knew it was in me it was in my father you see we dont talk about it but it was there reds found him young right after i was born when i joined the lord dragon i knew what would happen to me a few more years and id be gone might as well spend them fighting the lord dragon told me i was a soldier and a soldier cant leave his duty so i havent asked to go back before now you needed me thats changed my lord the taint is gone im not going to go mad that means well i always had a reason to fight but now ive got a reason to live too looking into the mans eyes perrin understood what must it have been like knowing that youd eventually go mad and need to be executed likely by your friends who would call it a mercy that was what perrin had sensed in the ashaman all along the reason they held themselves apart often seeming so somber everyone else fought for life the ashaman theyd fought to die thats how rand feels perrin thought watching the colors swirl again and his friend appear he was riding his large black horse through a city with muddy streets speaking with nynaeve who rode beside him perrin shook his head and banished the image well get you home grady he promised youll have some time with her before the end comes grady nodded glancing at the sky as a low rumble of thunder came from the north i just want to talk to her you know and i need to see little gadren again i wont recognize the lad im sure hes a handsome child grady grady laughed it felt odd but good to hear that from the man handsome gadren no my lord he might be big for his age but hes about as pretty as a stump still i love him something fierce he shook his head amused but i should be off learning this trick with neald thank you my lord perrin smiled watching him go as a maiden came hurrying into camp she reported to the wise ones but spoke loud enough to let perrin hear there is a stranger riding along the road toward camp he flies a flag of peace but he wears the clothing of these children of the light perrin nodded gathering his guards as he hastened toward the front of the camp tarn appeared and fell in beside him they arrived just as the whitecloak approached the first guard posts the man rode a brilliant white gelding and he carried a long pole with a white banner his white clothing mail with a tabard under the cloakbore a yellow sunburst on the breast perrin felt a sharp sinking feeling he recognized this man dain bornhald i come to speak with the criminal perrin aybara bornhald announced in a loud voice pulling to a stop im here bornhald perrin called stepping out bornhald looked at him it is you the light has delivered you to us unless it has also delivered you an army three or four times the size of the one you have now perrin called then i doubt very much that it will matter we have in our possession people who claim fealty to you aybara well you can let them ride on back to our camp and well be on our way the young whitecloak turned his mount to the side scowling we have unfinished business darkfriend no need for this to turn nasty bornhald perrin said the way i see it we can still each go our own way the children would rather die than leave justice undone dain said hen spat to the side but i will leave that for the lord captain comander to explain he wishes to see you for himself i have been ordered to me and tell you that he is waiting beside the road a short ride ahead he would like you to meet with him you think im going to walk into such an obvious trap perrin asked bornhald shrugged come or do not my lord captain commander is a man of honor and swears by oath you will return safelywhich is more than id have given a darkfriend you may bring your aes sedaiif you have them for safety with that bornhald turned his mount and galloped away perrin stood thoughtfully watching him retreat youre not really thinking of going are you son tarn asked id rather know for certain who im facing perrin said and we did ask for parley maybe bargain for our people back burn me tarn i have to at least try before attacking them tarn sighed but nodded he mentioned aes sedai perrin said but not ashaman ill bet he doesnt know much about them go have grady dress like a two rivers man and tell him to report to me along with gaul and sulin ask edarra if shell join us too but dont tell my wife about this we five will go on ahead and see if the whitecloaks will really meet with us peacefully if something goes wrong well have grady ready to get us out by gateway tarn nodded and hurried away perrin waited nervously until tam returned with gaul sulin and edarra grady came a few minutes later wearing a brown wool cloak and brown and green clothing borrowed from one of the two rivers men he carried a longbow but walked like a soldier with his back straight his eyes keen as he looked about him there was a particular air of danger to him that no common villager would bear hopefully it wouldnt spoil the disguise the six of them broke away from camp and blessedly faile didnt seem to have heard what was happening perrin would bring her if there was a longer parley or discussion but he intended this trip to be quick and he needed to be able to move without worrying about her they went on foot and found the whitecloaks a short distance ahead down the road there looked to be only about a dozen of them standing near a small tent that had been set up beside the road they were upwind which relaxed perrin a little he caught scents of anger and disgust but it didnt feel like a trap to him as he and the others neared someone stepped from the small tent wearing white the tall man had fine features and short dark hair most women would probably call him handsome he smelled better than the other whitecloaks they had a wild scent to them like that of a rabid animal this leader of theirs smelled calm and not sickly at all perrin glanced toward his companions i do not like this perrin aybara edarra said looking from side to side these children have a sense of wrongness about them archers could hit us from those trees tarn said with a grunt nodding to a stand in the distance grady youre holding the power perrin asked of course be ready just in case perrin said then stepped forward toward the small group of whitecloaks their leader studied perrin with hands clasped behind his back golden eyes the man said so it is true youre the lord captain commander perrin asked i am what will it take for you to release the people of mine youre holding my men tell me they tried such an exchange once the whitecloak leader said and that you deceived them and betrayed them they had kidnapped innocents perrin said and demanded my life in return well i took my people back dont force me to do the same thing here the whitecloak leader narrowed his eyes he smelled thoughtful i will do what is right goldeneyes the cost is irrelevant my men tell me you murdered several children a few years back and have never known justice for it that you lead trollocs to attack villages your men are not very reliable perrin said with a growl i want a more formal parley where we can sit down and discuss not something improvised like this i doubt that will be needed the whitecloak leader said i am not here to bargain i merely wanted to see you for myself you wish your people freed meet my army on the field of battle do this and i will release the captives regardless of the outcome they are obviously not soldiers i will let them go and if i refuse perrin asked then it will not bode well for their health perrin ground his teeth your force will face ours under the light the whitecloak leader said those are our terms perrin glanced to the side grady met his eyes and there was an obvious question in them he could take the whitecloak leader captive right here with barely a thought perrin was tempted but they had come under the whitecloaks oath f safety he would not break the peace instead he turned and led his people back toward his camp galad watched aybara withdraw those golden eyes were unsettling he had discounted byars insistence that this man was not merely a darkfriend but shadowspawn however looking into those eyes galad was no longer certain he could dismiss those claims to the side bornhald let out a breath i cant believe you wanted to do this what if he had brought aes sedai we couldnt have stopped the one power they would not have harmed me galad said and besides if aybara had the ability to assassinate me here with the one power he could have done the same to me in my camp but if he is as you and child byar say then he worries greatly about his image he didnt lead trollocs against the two rivers directly he pretended to defend them such a man would act with subtlety galad had been safe hed wanted to see aybara himself and he was glad he had those eyes they were almost a condemnation by themselves and aybara had reacted to the mention of the murdered whitecloaks stiffening beyond that there was the talk his people gave of him in alliance with the seanchan and having with him men who could channel yes this aybara was a dangerous man galad had been worried about committing his forces to fighting here but the light would see them through it better to defeat this aybara now than to wait and face him at the last battle as quickly as that he made his decision the right decision they would fight come galad said waving to his men lets get back to camp chapter an unexpected letter they cant possibly think ill sign this elayne said tossing the sheaf of papers onto the floor beside her chair its unlikely that they do dyelin said her golden hair was pristine her firm face controlled her slim body poised the woman was perfect it was unfair that she should look so pristine while elayne felt like a sow fattened up and ripe for the slaughter the hearth in elaynes sitting room crackled warmly wine sat in a pitcher on one of the walls sideboards but of course she wasnt allowed any of that if one more person tried to offer her bloody goats milk birgitte lounged near the far wall golden braid hanging over her right shoulder contrasting with her whitecollared red coat and skyblue trousers shed poured herself a cup of tea and smiled over it amused by elaynes annoyance elayne could feel the emotion through the bond they were the only ones in the room elayne had retired to the sitting room after accepting the proposal from elloriens messenger explaining that she would like to consider the offer in private well shed consider it consider it trash for that was all it was this is an insult she said sweeping her hand toward the pages do you intend to keep them imprisoned forever elayne dyelin asked raising an eyebrow they cant afford to pay a ransom not after what they spent funding their succession bid that leaves you with a decision they can rot elayne said folding her arms they raised armies gainst me and besieged caemlyn yes dyelin said flatly i believe i was there elayne cursed softly to herself then stood up and began to pace birgitte eyed her they both knew that melfane had suggested that elayne avoid taxing herself elayne met the warders eyes stubbornly then continued her pacing burn her and burn that bloody midwife walking wasnt taxing ellorien was one of the last vocal holdouts to elaynes rule and was the most problematicsave perhaps for jarid sarand these months marked the beginning of a long period of testing for elayne how would she stand on certain issues how easily would she be pushed how much did she take after her mother they should know that she wouldnt be easily intimidated but the unfortunate truth was that she stood atop a precarious perch made of teacups stacked high each of those cups was an andoran house some had supported her willingly others grudgingly very few of them were as sturdy as she would have liked the captive nobles are a resource elayne said they should be viewed as such dyelin nodded the noblewoman had a way of goading elayne forcing her to stretch for the answers they both knew she needed to find a resource is meaningless unless eventually expended dyelin noted she held a cup of wine blasted woman yes elayne said but to sell a resource short would be to establish a reputation for carelessness unless you sell something just before its value plummets dyelin said many a merchant has been called foolish for trading ice peppers at a discount only to be called wise when prices fall even further and these captives you see their value falling soon their houses have been compromised dyelin said the stronger your position becomes elayne the less valuable these political captives grow you shouldnt squander the advantage but neither should you lock it away until nobody cares anymore you could execute them birgitte said they both stared at her what birgitte said its what they deserve and it would establish a hard fisted reputation its not right elayne said they should not be killed for supporting someone else for the throne there can be no treason where there is no queen so our soldiers can die but the nobles bloody walk away birgitte asked then she raised a hand before elayne could protest spare the lecture elayne i understand i dont agree but i understand its always been this way elayne returned to her pacing she did stop however to stomp on elloriens proposal as she passed it that earned her an eye roll from birgitte but it felt good the proposal was a list of empty promises that concluded with a demand that elayne release the captives for the good of andor ellorien claimed that since the captives had no funds the crown should pardon them and release them to help rebuild truth be told elayne had been considering doing so but now if she released them the three would see ellorien as their savior any gratitude that elayne could have gained would instead be given to her rival blood and bloody ashes the windfinders are beginning to ask after the land you promised them dyelin noted already the older woman nodded the request still troubles me why do they want a sliver of land like that they earned it elayne said perhaps though this does mean that youre the first queen in five generations to cede a portion of andorno matter how smallto a foreign entity elayne took a deep breath and oddly found herself calmer blasted mood swings hadnt melfane promised those would grow less pronounced as the pregnancy progressed yet at times she still felt her emotions bouncing around like a ball in a childrens game elayne composed herself and sat i cannot allow this the houses are all looking for opportunities to shoulder their way into power you would be doing the same in their place i warrant dyelin said not if i knew that the last battle was approaching elayne snapped we need to do something to direct the nobles toward more important matters something to unify them behind me or at least convince them that im not to be toyed with and you have a means of achieving this dyelin asked yes elayne said glancing eastward its time to seize cairhien birgitte choked quietly on her tea dyelin merely raised an eyebrow a bold move bold birgitte asked wiping her chin its bloody insane elayne you barely have your fingers on andor that makes the timing even better elayne said we have momenbesides if we move for cairhien now it will show that i mean to be more than a simpering puff of a queen i doubt anyone expects that of you birgitte said if they do they obably took one too many knocks to the head during the fighting shes right however uncouth the presentation dyelin agreed she lanced at birgitte and elayne could feel a stab of dislike through birgittes bond light what would it take to make the two of them get along nobody doubts your strength as a queen elayne that wont stop the others from seizing what power they can they know theyre unlikely to be able to get it later i dont have fifteen years to stabilize my rule like mother elayne said look we all know what rand kept saying about me taking the sun throne a steward rules there now waiting for me and after what happened to colavaere nobody dares disobey rands edicts by taking that throne dyelin said you risk looking as if youre letting althor hand it to you so elayne said i had to take andor on my own but there is nothing wrong with me accepting his gift of cairhien his aiel were the ones to liberate it wed be doing the cairhienin a favor by preventing a messy succession my claim to the throne is strong at least as strong as anyone elses and those loyal to rand will fall behind me and do you not risk overextending yourself possibly elayne said but i think its worth the risk in one step i could become one of the most powerful monarchs since artur hawkwing further argument was cut off by a polite knock at the door elayne glanced at dyelin and the womans thoughtful expression meant she was considering what elayne had said well elayne would strike for the sun throne with or without dyelins approval the woman was becoming increasingly useful to elayne as an advisorlight be praised that dyelin hadnt wanted the throne herselfbut a queen could not let herself fall into the trap of relying on any one person too much birgitte answered the door letting in the storklike master norry he was dressed in red and white his long face characteristically somber he carried his leather folder under one arm and elayne suppressed a groan i thought we were finished for the day i thought so as well your majesty he said but several new matters have arisen i thought that they might be um interesting to you what do you mean well your majesty norry said you know that i am not particularly fond of certain types of work but in light of recent additions to my staff i have seen reason to expand my attentions youre taking about hark arent you birgitte said hows the worthless piece of grime doing norry glanced at her he is er grimy i should say he looked back at elayne but he is rather adept once given proper motivation please forgive me if i have taken liberties but after the encounters recentlyand the guests to your dungeons they providedi thought it wise what are you talking about master norry elayne asked mistress basaheen your majesty norry said the first instruction i gave our good master hark was to watch the aes sedai s place of residencea certain inn known as the greeting hall elayne sat upright feeling a burst of excitement duhara basaheen had repeatedly attempted to gain audience with elayne by bullying the various members of the palace staff they all knew now however that she was not to be admitted aes sedai or not she was a representative of elaida and elayne intended to have nothing to do with her you had her watched elayne said eagerly please tell me you discovered something i can use to banish that insufferable woman then i am under no condemnation master norry asked carefully still as dry and unexcited as ever he was yet inexperienced when it came to spying light no elayne said i should have ordered it done myself youve saved me from that oversight master norry if what youve discovered is good enough news i might just be likely to kiss you that prompted a reaction his eyes widened in horror it was enough to make elayne laugh and birgitte chuckled as well dyelin didnt seem pleased well she could go suck on a goats foot for all elayne cared er well norry said that wouldnt be necessary your majesty i had thought that if there were darkfriends pretending to be aes sedai in the cityhe like the others had learned not to refer to falion and the others as aes sedai in elaynes presencewe might want to keep good watch on any who purported to be from the white tower elayne nodded eagerly my but norry could ramble im afraid i must disappoint your majesty norry said obviously noting elaynes excitement if you are hoping for proof that this woman is a darkfriend oh however norry said raising a slender finger i have reason to believe that duhara sedai may have had a hand in the document you seem to be treating with um unusual reverence he glanced at the pages p ne had tossed to the floor one bore the distinct outline of her shoe duhara has been meeting with ellorien elayne asked indeed she has master norry said the visits are growing more freent they are done with some measure of secrecy as well elayne glanced at dyelin why does duhara want my rivals freed dyelin looked troubled she couldnt be so foolish as to assume she can raise up a movement against you particularly using a group of broken bankrupt lords and ladies your majesty norry asked if i may offer a comment of course master norry perhaps the aes sedai is trying to curry favor with the lady ellorien we dont know for certain they conspired on this proposal it simply seemed likely judging from the frequency and timing of the aes sedais visits but she may not have reason to support your enemies so much as she has reason to be in the good graces of some of the citys nobility it was possible duhara wasnt likely to return to the white tower no matter how often elayne suggested that she do so to go back would be to present elaida with empty hands and a hostile andor no aes sedai would be so easily dissuaded however if she could return with the loyalty of some of the andoran nobility it would be something when duhara left her inn to visit elloriens home elayne said how did she dress though ellorien had briefly spoken of returning to her estates she hadnt left perhaps realizing that it wasnt politically useful as of yet she resided in her mansion in caemlyn at the moment in a cloak your majesty norry said with the hood drawn rich or poor i i dont know norry replied sounding embarrassed i could fetch master hark that wont be needed elayne said but tell me did she go alone no i believe she always had a rather large contingent of attendants with her elayne nodded she was willing to bet that while duhara wore a cloak and drawn hood she left her great serpent ring on and chose a distinctively rich cloak for the subterfuge along with taking attendants master norry elayne said i fear that youve been played your majesty dyelin was nodding she wanted to be seen visiting ellorien she didnt want the visits to be officialthat would put her too formally against your throne but she wanted you to know what she was doing shes blatantly mingling with my enemies elayne said its a warning she threatened me earlier saying that i would not appreciate being in opposition to her and elaida ah norry said deflated so my initiative wasnt so keen after all oh it was still valuable elayne said if you hadnt had her watched wed have missed thiswhich would have been embarrassing if someone is going to go out of her way to insult me then i at least want to be aware of it if only so that i know whom to behead later on norry paled figuratively master norry she said as much as shed like to do it and elaida too she dared send a watchdog to counsel elayne elayne shook her head hurry up egwene we need you in the tower the world needs you there she sighed turning back to norry you said there were several new matters that needed my attention indeed your majesty he said getting out his horrible leather folder he removed a page from itone he did not regard with nearly as much reverence as most he collected indeed he pinched this one between two fingers and held it aloft like a man picking up a dead animal found in the gutter you will recall your orders regarding mercenary bands yes she said grimacing she was getting thirsty gloomily she eyed the cup of warm goats milk on the table next to her chair news of battle brought bands of sellswords eager to offer their services unfortunately for most of the mercenaries the siege had been a short one news traveled fast but weary and hungry soldiers traveled slowly soldier bands continued to arrive at the city in a steady flow the men in them disappointed to find no need for their weapons elayne had begun by sending them away then shed realized the foolishness in this every man would be needed at tarmon gaidon and if andor could provide an extra five or ten thousand soldiers to the conflict she wanted to do so she didnt have the coin to pay them now but neither did she want to lose them so instead she had ordered master norry and captain guybon to give all of the mercenary bands the same instructions they were to allow no more than a certain number of soldiers into caemlyn at a time and they were to camp no closer than one league from the city this was to leave them with the idea that shed meet with them evenally and offer them work she just might do that now that she had de cided to take the sun throne of course the last sellswords shed hired had gone rotten on her more often than not against her better judgment she picked up the cup of milk and took sip birgitte nodded in satisfaction but elayne grimaced better to g thirsty well master norry said looking over the page in his fingers one of the mercenary captains has taken it upon himself to send you a very familiar letter i wouldnt have brought it to you but upon second reading it seems that it is something you should see the ruffians claims are outlandish but i would not like to have been the one to ignore them should they prove urn accurate curious elayne reached for the paper outlandish claims she didnt know any mercenary captains the scrawl on the page was uneven there were numerous crossed out words and some of the spelling was creative whoever this man was sheshe blinked in surprise as she reached the bottom of the letter then she read it again your royal bloody pain in my back were bloody waiting here to talk to you and were getting angry perturbed that means angry thom says that youre a queen now but i figure that changes nothing sense you acted like a queen all the time anyway dont forget that i carried hailed your pretty little backside out of a hole in tear but you acted like a queen then so i guess i dont know why im suprised now that you act like one when you really are a queen so im thinking i should treat you like a bloody queen and send you a bloody letter and all speaking with high talk and getting your attention i even used my ring as a signet like it was paper proper so here is my formal salutation so bloody stop turning me away so we can talk i need your bellfounders its bloody important mat ps salutation means greeting pps dont mind the scratched out words and bad spellings i was going to rewrite this letter but thom is laffing so hard at me that i want to be done pps dont mind me calling your backside pretty i hardly ever spent any time looking at it as ive an awareness that youd pull my eyes out if you saw me besides im married now so that all doesnt matter elayne couldnt decide whether to be outraged or exuberant mat was in andor and thorn was alive theyd escaped ebou dar had they found olver how had they gotten away from the seanchan so many emotions and questions welled up in her birgitte stood upright frowning feeling the emotions elayne what is it did the man insult you elayne found herself nodding tears forming in her eyes birgitte cursed striding over master norry looked taken aback as if regretting that hed brought the letter elayne burst into laughter birgitte froze elayne im all right elayne said wiping the tears from her eyes and forcing herself to take a deep breath oh light i needed that here read it birgitte snatched the letter and as she read her face lightened she chuckled you have a nice backside he should be talking mats got as fine a rump as comes on a man birgitte elayne said well its true the warder said handing back the letter i find his face far too pretty but that doesnt mean i cant judge a good backside when i see one light it will be good to have him back finally someone i can go drinking with who doesnt look at me as their bloody military superior contain yourself birgitte elayne said folding the letter up norry looked scandalized by the exchange dyelin said nothing it took a lot to faze that woman and shed heard worse from birgitte you did well master norry elayne said thank you for bringing this to my attention you do indeed know these mercenaries then he asked a hint of surprise sounding in his voice theyre not mercenaries actually im not certain what they are friends and allies i should hope why had mat brought the band of the red hand to andor were they loyal to rand could she make use of them mat was a scoundrel but he had a strangely good eye for tactics and warfare a soldier under his command would be worth ten of the sellsword riffraff shed been forced to hire recently my pardon your majesty for my mistake norry said i should have brought this to you sooner my informants told me that this group was ntly in the employ of the crown of murandy so i discounted their aders insistence that he wasnt a mercenary you did well master norry elayne said still feeling amused and nsulted it was odd how often one moved between those two emotions when matrim cauthon was involved light knows ive been busy enough but please if someone claims to know me personally at least bring it to birgittes attention yes your majesty arrange a meeting with master cauthon she said idly wishing she had time to write him back a letter as insulting as the one hed written her tell him he must bring thorn with him to keep him in line as you wish your majesty norry said with a characteristically stiff bow if i may withdraw she nodded in thanks and he left pulling the door closed elayne held mats letter idly between two fingers could she use mat somehow to help her with the troubles ellorien was making as shed used the borderlanders or was that too obvious why did he mention bellfounders do you think birgitte asked it could be something as simple as needing a new bell to ring the hour for his camp but you dont think its simple mats involved elayne said he has a way of complicating things and the way he wrote that line makes it smell like one of his schemes true and if he merely wanted a bell he could win himself enough to buy it after an hour dicing come now elayne said hes not that lucky birgitte snorted into her tea you need to pay better attention elayne that man could dice with the dark one and win elayne shook her head soldiers birgitte included could be such a superstitious lot make certain to have a few extra guardswomen on duty when mat comes he can be exuberant and i wouldnt want him to make a scene who is this man dyelin asked sounding confused one of the other two taveren who grew up with rand althor birgitte said gulping down her tea shed given up drinking while elayne was pregnant at least someone else had to suffer too mat is a particularly dynamic individual elayne said he can be very useful when properly harnessed when he is notwhich is most of the timehe can be an outright disaster but whatever else can be said about the man he and his band know how to fight youre going to use them arent you birgitte said eyeing her appreciatively of course elayne said and from what i remember mat saying he has a lot of cairhienin in the band they are native sons if i arrive with that section of the band as part of my army perhaps the transition will be easier so you really do intend to go through with this dyelin asked taking the sun throne now the world needs unity elayne said standing with cairhien i begin knitting us all together rand already controls illian and tear and has bonds to the aiel were all connected she glanced to the west where she could feel that knot of emotions that was rand the only thing she ever sensed from him these days was a cold anger buried deeply was he in arad doman elayne loved him but she didnt intend to see andor become merely another part of the dragons empire besides if rand were to die at shayol ghul who would rule that empire it could break up but she worried that someonedarlin perhapswould be strong enough to hold it together if so andor would stand alone between an aggressive seanchan empire to the southwest rands successor to the northwest and the southeast and the borderlanders united together in the north and northeast she could not let that happen the woman in her cringed to think of planning for rands death but the queen could not be so squeamish the world was changing i realize it will be difficult to administer two nations elayne said but i must hold cairhien for the good of both thrones she turned and met dyelins eyes and the older woman nodded slowly it seems you are committed i am elayne said but i feel im going to need reliable use of traveling if im going to manage it lets set up a meeting for me with sumeko and alise we need to discuss the future of the kin chapter an empty ink bottle min sat on a window ledge in the stone of tear enjoying the warmth the afternoon breeze was refreshing laden though it was with humidity and the scents of the city below the tairens had been calling the weather chilly which made min smile how would these folk respond to a good andoran winter with snow piled up at the sides of buildings and icicles hanging from the eaves all that could be said of the weather lately was that it was less sweltering than usual the warmth that min was enjoying however had nothing to do with the heat in the air sunlight shone upon the city in the stones courtyards defenders in their striped sleeves and breeches kept stopping and looking up toward the open sky the clouds still lurked on the horizon but they were broken around the city in an unnatural ring perfectly circular the warmth that min felt was not caused by the sunlight how can you just sit there nynaeve demanded min turned her head the window was wide open and the walls of the stone were thick min sat on the windowsill with her knees bent her bare oes touching the wall on the other side her boots and stockings lay on the floor beside a stack of books nynaeve paced the room the stone of tear had withstood sieges and storms wars and desolation but min wondered if it had ever survived any thing quite like nynaeve almeara in a pique the darkhaired aes sedai had spent the last three days stalking through the corridors like a crackling thunderhead intimidating defenders terrifying servants three days nynaeve said three days hes been gone the last battle looms and the dragon reborn is missing hes not missing min said softly rand knows where he is you do as well nynaeve said her voice curt im not leading you to him nynaeve and why not surely you cant he needs to be alone nynaeve cut off she walked over to the corner table and poured herself a cup of chilled tremalking black chilled tea that seemed so odd tea was meant to be warming during cold days min turned her eyes northward again into the distant cloudsmothered haze as far as she could determine through the bond she was looking directly at him was he in andor perhaps or in the borderlands shed been tempted to use the bond to seek him out at first when hed felt that awful anguish pain deeper than the wounds in his side agony anger and despair in those moments rand had seemed more dangerous than he ever had before not even that nightwhen hed knelt above her strangling her with one handhad he been as frightening and then she smiled and then had come the warmth it radiated from the bond like the comfort of a winter hearth something wonderful was happening something shed been awaiting without knowing it it will be all right nynaeve she said how can you say that the woman took a sip of her tea he didnt destroy ebou dar but that doesnt mean hes not dangerous you heard what he nearly did to tarn his own father min a man should not be condemned for what he nearly did nynaeve he stopped himself he didnt stop himself at natrins barrow that was necessary you didnt believe that at the time min took a deep breath nynaeve had been goading her into arguments lately she certainly had good reason to be tense her husband was riding toward his death the dragon reborna man she saw as her charge stillwas wandering alone and there was nothing nynaeve could do and if there was one thing nynaeve hated it was being powerless nynaeve min said if this lasts much longer ill lead you to him i promise the aes sedai narrowed her eyes much longer a few days in a few days he could level cairhien do you really think he would do that nynaeve min asked softly truly do i nynaeve gripped her cup of tea staring down at its contents once i would have laughed at the idea i knew rand althor and the boy still inside him the man hes become frightens me i always told him he needed to grow up and then and then he did she shivered visibly min started to reply but motion drew her attention two maidens surial and lerianguarded the open doorway to the hallway theyd turned to watch someone approach there were always maidens around min these days sarene nemdahl entered the small room a moment later mins quarters in the stone were not expansiveshe rarely used them instead staying with rand her sitting room had a thick blueandwhite rug and a small cherry desk but nothing else sarene wore her dark hair in its customary beaded braids framing her nearperfect face cadsuane sedai sarene said she has need of you is that so nynaeve said well perhaps cadsuane sedai can alanna is gone sarene continued unruffled vanished right from her chambers the defenders they didnt see her go and there was no sign of a gateway oh well lets go then nynaeve bustled out of the chamber and im telling you that i felt nothing corele said she smiled tapping the side of her nose i dont know how she got out unless you think she somehow invented flyingwhich i daresay wouldnt be outside reason considering some of what has occurred lately fool woman cadsuane thought leveling a flat stare at corele the womans flippancy was preferable to the selfimportance of some other aes aedai but today cadsuane hadnt the patience for it the yellow shrugged still smiling but said nothing further cadsuane placed hands on hips surveying the small chamber room for a trunk to hold clothing a cot for sleeping and a desk cadsuane would have expected aes sedai to demand more even in tear of course alanna didnt often rveal her intimate connection to the dragon most didnt know of it two other aes sedairafela cindal and bera harkinstood at the side of the room bera said shed felt alanna channeling but nothing demanding certainly not enough to create a gateway burn that woman cadsuane had thought alanna well in hand despite recent stubbornness shed obviously slipped out intentionally the clothing from the trunk was gone and the writing desk was mostly bare only an empty ink bottle remained she said nothing to you cadsuane said no cadsuane sedai bera replied we havent spoken more than passing words in weeks i well i did often hear weeping in her room what is all the fuss about a new voice said cadsuane glanced at the doorway as nynaeve arrived and met cadsuanes stare shes only one person and so far as i understand she was free to leave when she wished phaw cadsuane said the girl isnt only one person shes a tool an important one she reached over to the desk holding up a sheet of paper that theyd found in the room it had been folded with a bloodred seal of wax on one side do you recognize this nynaeve frowned no should i lying or truthful cadsuane hated not being able to trust the words of someone who called herself an aes sedai but nynaeve almeara had never held the oath rod those eyes looked genuinely confused nynaeve should be trustworthy she prided herself on her honesty unless that was a front unless she was black careful she thought youll end up as distrustful as the boy is nynaeve hadnt given alanna the note which eliminated her last good theory on its origin so what is it cadsuane sedai nynaeve demanded at least she used the honorific cadsuane nearly chided the girl for her tone but truth be told she felt as frustrated as nynaeve did there were times when such emotions were justified facing the end of the world with the dragon reborn completely out of control was one of them im not sure cadsuane said the letter was opened in hastethe paper was torn it was dropped on the floor and the note inside taken along with clothing and emergency items but why does it matter nynaeve asked behind her min slipped into the room two maidens taking up positions by the door had min yet figured out the real reason the aiel trailed her because nynaeve min said she is a pathway to him nynaeve sniffed shes been no more helpful than you min as persuasive as you can be nynaeve cadsuane said dryly the shadow has means to make people more forthcoming nynaeve blushed furiously then began muttering under her breath alanna could point the way to the dragon reborn if agents of the dark one had taken her there would be no hiding rand from them their traps had been deadly enough when theyd needed to coax and lure him into them weve been fools nynaeve said there should have been a hundred maidens guarding her the forsaken have known where to find him before cadsuane said though inwardly she agreed she should have seen alanna better watched and he has survived this is simply one more thing to be aware of she sighed can someone bring us some tea bera was actually the one who went to fetch it though cadsuane hadnt taken any care to cultivate influence with the woman well a reputation was worth something it appeared bera returned shortly cadsuane had stepped out into the hall to think she accepted the cup and braced herself for the teas bitter taste shed asked for it partially because she needed a moment to think and an emptyhanded woman often looked nervous she raised the cup to her lips what next ask the defenders at the gate of the stone last night alannaafter being proddedhad confirmed that althor was still in the same place up north andor perhaps for three days what was the fool boycadsuane froze the tea tasted good it was wonderful as a matter of fact perfectly sweetened with honey faint bitterness and a relaxing flavor it had been weeks perhaps months since cadsuane had tasted tea that wasnt spoiled min gasped turning sharply toward the northern quarter of the city the two maidens in the doorway were gone in a heartbeat dashing down the hallway cadsuanes suspicions were confirmed their careful watch of min had been less about protecting her and more about watching for signs of hes here min said softly chapter for what has been wrought min burst from the dragonwall gate on the eastern side of the stone and dashed across the courtyard what seemed like an entire clans worth of aiel flooded out behind her breaking around min like deer breaking around an oak they weaved between startled defenders and grooms moving with grace and speed toward the wall it was galling how easily they outpaced heryears ago shed prided herself on being able to beat any boy she knew in an honest footrace now well too many months spent picking through books perhaps she still outpaced the aes sedai who were bridled by their need to maintain proper decorum min had long ago tossed aside all sense of decorum for her towering sheepherder and so she ran thankful for her breeches and boots making for the gate and there he was she pulled up sharply looking through an open column of aiel in cadinsor toward the man himself standing and speaking with two defenders who were part of the wall guard he glanced at her as she grew close he could feel her coming as she felt him rand had found an old long brown cloak somewhere it had sleeves like a coat though it fell loose from the shoulders underneath it he had on a shirt and fine black trousers now that he was close the warmth through the bond seemed overwhelming couldnt the others see it it made her want to raise her arm and shade her eyes though there was nothing to actually see it was just the bond except the air did seem to distort around him was that a trick of the sunlight new viewings spun around his head she normally ignored those but she couldnt do so now an open cavern gaping like a mouth bloodstained rocks two dead men on the ground surrounded by ranks and ranks of trollocs a pipe with smoke curling from it rand met her gaze anddespite the bondshe was amazed at what she saw in him those gray gemstone eyes of his were deeper there were faint wrinkles around them had those been there before surely he was too young for that those eyes did not look young min felt a moment of panic as his eyes held hers was this the same man had the rand she loved been stolen away replaced with an ancient force of a man she could never know or understand had she lost him after all and then he smiled and the eyesdeep though they had become were his that smile was something shed been waiting a very long time to see again it was now much more confident than the one hed shown her during their early days together yet it was still vulnerable it let her see a part of him that others were never allowed that part was the youth somehow innocent still she ran up to him and seized him in an embrace you woolheaded fool three days what have you been doing for three days existing min he said wrapping his arms around her i wasnt aware that was such a difficult task it has been for me at times he fell silent and she was content to hold him yes this was the same man changedand for the betterbut still rand she clung to him she didnt care that people were gathering more and more of them let them watch finally she exhaled reluctantly pulling back rand alanna is gone she vanished earlier today yes i felt her go northward somewhere the borderlands perhaps arafel she could be used against you to find where you are he smiled light but it felt good to see that expression on his face again the shadow does not need her to find me min nor will it ever again all its eyes are fixed directly upon me and will be until i blind them what but rand its all right min the time when it could silence me quietlyand therefore winhas passed the confrontation is assured and the scream that begins the avalanche has been sounded he seemed afire with life the thrill of it was intoxicating he left an arm around herthe arm that ended in a stumpas he turned to regard the aiel i have toh though the courtyard behind them was in chaos the aiel stood quietly they were ready for this min thought the aiel werent hostile exactly but they didnt share the excitement of the defenders the tairens thought rand had returned to lead them to the last battle in the waste rhuarc said stepping forward there is an animal the meegerling it looks much like a rat but it is far more stupid if you place it near grain it will go straight toward it regardless of the danger no matter how many times it falls in a trench between itself and the food it will repeat the same action if you move it back to the start aiel children amuse themselves with the game he studied rand i had not thought you would be a meegerling rand althor i promise i will never leave you again rand said not of my own choice and not without informing andif they consentbringing maidens as a guard the aiel did not budge this will prevent you from earning more toh rhuarc said it will not change what has gone before and promises have been made before this is true rand said meeting rhuarcs eyes i will meet my toh then something passed between them something min didnt understand and the aiel parted looking more relaxed twenty maidens came forward to act as a guard around rand rhuarc retreated with the others joining a small group of wise ones who watched from the periphery rand min said it will be all right he said though there was a grim cast to his emotions this was one of the things i needed to fix one of many he took his arm from around her and scanned the courtyard feeling hesitant as if he were looking for something whatever it was he didnt see it so he began to stride toward king darlin who had just arrived in a hurry king darlin bowed hand on the pommel of his narrow sidesword my lord dragon are we to march finally walk with me darlin rand said in reply as he moved through the courtyard there is much to do who else is here narishma flinn excellent he nodded to the two blackcoated ashaman who arrived at a run your aes sedai ah there they come well that will be next kainea would you be so kind as to gather me some messengers one of the maidensa woman with oddly dark hair for an aielran as off to do as requested min frowned keeping pace with rand and darlin the two ashaman fell into step behind nynaeve and merise led the group of aes sedai they stopped when they saw rand approaching as if to let him be the one who came to meet them they pulled together in a clump fiddling with their clothing lookne more unsettled than aes sedai normally did rand crossed the bustling open courtyard walking into the shadow of the stones towering fortifications then stepped up to them rand althor nynaeve said folding her arms as he walked up to them you are an idiot rand finished sounding amused an arrogant fool an impulsive woolheaded boy in need of a sound earboxing er yes all true nynaeve he said i see it now perhaps ive finally gained a portion of wisdom i do think you need some new insults however the ones you use are wearing out like last years lace someone send for cadsuane i promise not to execute her the aes sedai seemed shocked by his brusque tone but min smiled his confidence had surged again following the confrontation with the aiel it was supremely satisfying to see him disarm aes sedai objections and condemnations dying on their lips merise sent a servant to fetch cadsuane narishma rand said turning i need you to visit that borderlander army that came looking for me im assuming its still in far madding tell the leaders there that i accept their terms and will come in a few days to meet with them my lord dragon narishma said is that prudent considering the nature of that place prudent prudence is for those who intend to live long lives narishma darlin i need the high lords and ladies lined up to receive me one of these arriving messengers should be sufficient for the task also post word that the white tower has been reunified and that egwene alvere is the amyrlin seat what merise said several of the other aes sedai gasped rand min said i doubt the amyrlin will be pleased to have you publicizing the division a valid point rand said darlin write a proclamation that egwene alvere has succeeded elaida aroihan as the amyrlin that should be enough to inform without revealing too much light knows i dont need to do anything else to make egwene angry with me else corele asked paling yes rand said offhandedly ive already been to the white tower to see her and they let you go corele asked i didnt allow them other options darlin kindly marshal our forces here i want them gathered by the evening flinn well need gateways large ones a circle might be needed tarwins gap nynaeve said eager rand glanced at her and hesitated min could feel his painsharp spiking realas he spoke not yet nynaeve ive poured hot oil into the white tower and it will be boiling soon time we dont have time i will get help to lan i vow it to you but right now i must prepare to face egwene face her nynaeve said stepping forward rand what have you done what needed to be done where is bashere he was out of the city with his men my lord dragon flinn said running their horses should be back soon good hes going with me to arad doman you too nynaeve min he looked at her and those unfathomable eyes seemed to draw her in i need you min you have me stupid looby callandor he said it plays a part in this you have to find out how i cannot seal the bore the way i tried last time im missing something something vital find it for me i will rand a cold shiver ran through her i promise i trust you he looked up as a figure in a deep hooded cloak walked out of one of the stones many guard posts cadsuane melaidhrin rand said i pardon you for past mistakes and i revoke your exile not that it was ever anything more than a minor inconvenience to you she sniffed lowering the hood if you believe that wearing a cloak in this heat is a minor inconvenience boy then you need a lesson in contrast i trust you see the error in your deed it strikes me as unsuitable that i should need forgiveness or a pardon in the first place well then rand said please accept my pardon alongside my apology you may say i have been under unusual stress as of late of all people cadsuane said sternly you cannot afford to let the pressure of life drive you on the contrary i am who i have become because of that pressure cadsuane metal cannot be shaped without the blows of the hammer but that is beside the point you tried to manipulate me and you failed horribly but in that failure you have shown me something which is i thought i was being forged into a sword rand said eyes growing distant but i was wrong im not a weapon i never have been then what are you min asked genuinely curious he merely smiled cadsuane sedai i have a task for you if you will accept it i expect that will depend on the task she said folding her arms i need you to locate someone someone who is missing someone i now suspect may be in the hands of wellmeaning allies you see ive been informed that the white tower is holding mattin stepaneos cadsuane frowned and you want him not at all i havent decided what to do about him yet so he can stay egwenes problem for the time no the person i want is probably somewhere in the caralain grass ill explain more when we are not in the open the high lords and ladies were gathering rand looked toward them though once again he scanned the courtyard as if looking for something something that made him feel anxious he turned back to the high lords and ladies min watched them skeptically aside from darlin shed never been impressed with them rand rested his hand on her shoulder the gathered nobles looked disheveled apparently summoned from naps or meals although they wore an assortment of fine silks and ruffles they looked oddly out of place in the stones courtyard where everyone else had a purpose shouldnt be so harsh on them min thought folding her arms but then she had watched their plotting and pandering frustrate rand besides shed never been fond of those who thought themselves more important than everyone else form a line rand said walking up to them the high lords and ladies looked at him confused a line rand said voice loud and firm now they did so arranging themselves with haste rand began to walk down the row starting with darlin looking each man or woman in the eye rands emotions were curious perhaps a touch angry what was he doing the courtyard grew still rand continued down the line looking at each of the nobles in turn not speaking min glanced to the side near the end of the line weiramon kept glancing at rand then looking away the tall man had thinning gray hair his beard oiled to a point rand eventually reached him meet my eyes weiramon rand said softly my lord dragon surely i am not worthy to do it weiramon did so with an odd difficulty he looked as if he was gritting his teeth his eyes watering so it is you rand said min could feel his disappointment rand looked to the side to where anaiyella stood last in line the pretty woman had pulled away from rand her head turned both of you my lord weiramon began i want you to deliver a message for me rand said to the others of your association tell them that they cannot hide among my allies any longer weiramon tried to bluster but rand took a step closer weiramons eyes opened wide and anaiyella cried out shading her face tell them rand continued voice soft but demanding that i am no longer blind why anaiyella said why are you letting us go because today is a day of reunion rand said not a day of death go the two stumbled away looking drained the others in the courtyard watched with surprise and confusion the aiel however began to beat their spears against their shields anaiyella and weiramon seemed to keep to the shadows of the courtyard as they ducked into the stone leeh rand said take two others watch them three maidens split from those watching over rand darting after the two former nobles min stepped up to rand taking his arm rand what was that what did you see in them the time for hiding is past min the shadow made its play for me and lost it is war not subterfuge that turns the day now so theyre darkfriends min asked frowning rand turned to her smiling they are no longer a threat i he cut off suddenly looking to the side min turned and grew chill tarn althor stood nearby he had just walked out of a nearby entrance into the stone pausing on a low set of steps leading down to the courtyard rands emotions grew apprehensive again and min realized what hed been searching for earlier tarn looked at his son falling still his hair was gray and his face lined yet he was solid in a way that few people were rand lifted his hand and the crowdaes sedai includedparted rand passed through them min following behind crossing to the steps up the stone rand climbed a few of those steps hesitant the courtyard fell silent even the gulls stopped calling rand stopped on the steps and min could feel his reluctance his hame his terror it seemed so strange randwho had faced forsaken without a tremorwas afraid of his father rand took the last few steps in two sudden strides and grabbed tarn in an embrace he stood one step down which brought them near an equal height in fact in that posture tarn almost seemed a giant and rand but a child who was clinging to him there holding to his father the dragon reborn began to weep the gathered aes sedai tairens and aiel watched solemnly none shuffled or turned away rand squeezed his eyes shut im sorry father he whispered min could barely hear im so sorry its all right son its all right ive done so much that is terrible nobody walks a difficult path without stumbling now and again it didnt break you when you fell thats the important part rand nodded they held each other for a time eventually rand pulled back then gestured to min standing at the base of the steps come father rand said there is someone i want to introduce to you tarn chuckled its been three days rand ive already met her yes but didnt introduce you i need to he waved to min and she raised an eyebrow folding her arms he looked at her pleadingly so she sighed and climbed up the steps father rand said resting his hand on mins back this is min farshaw and shes very special to me chapter a vow egwene walked up the side of a gentle slope the grass green at her feet the air cool and pleasant lazy butterflies floated from blossom to blossom like curious children peeking into cupboards egwene made her shoes vanish so she could feel the blades beneath her feet she took a deep breath smiling then looked up at the boiling black clouds angry violent silent despite flashes of amethyst lightning terrible storm above quiet placid meadow beneath a dichotomy of the world of dreams oddly telaranrbiod felt more unnatural to her now than it had during her first few visits using verins terangreal shed treated this place like a playground changing her clothes on a whim assuming that she was safe she hadnt understood telaranrbiod was about as safe as a bear trap painted a pretty color if the wise ones hadnt straightened her out she might not have lived to become amyrlin yes i think this is it the rolling green hills the stands of trees it was the first place shed come well over a year ago there was something meaningful about standing here having come so far and yet it seemed she would have to cover an equal distance before this was done and in far shorter a time when shed been captive in the tower she had reminded herselfrepeatedlythat she could focus on only one problem at a time the reunification of the white tower had to come first now however both problems and possible solutions seemed uncountable they overwhelmed her drowning her in all of the things she should he doing fortunately during the last few days several unexpected stores of grain had been discovered in the city in one case a forgotten warehouse owned by a man who had died over the winter the others were smaller a few sacks here and there remarkably none of them had borne any kind of rot she had two meetings this evening dealing with other problems her biggest difficulty was going to be the perceptions of the people she met with neither group would see her as what she had become she closed her eyes willing herself away when she opened her eyes she was standing in a large room deeply shadowed in the corners its columns rising like thick towers the heart of the stone of tear two wise ones sat on the floor at the center of the room amid a forest of columns above their light brown skirts and white blouses their faces were distinctly different bairs was wrinkled with age like leather left to cure in the sun for all her occasional sternness smile lines wove from her eyes and mouth amys face was silky smooth an effect of being able to channel her face was not ageless but she could have been aes sedai for the emotion she showed the two had their shawls at their waists their blouses unlaced egwene sat before them but left herself wearing wetlander clothing amys raised an eyebrow was she thinking that egwene should have changed or did she appreciate that egwene did not imitate something she was not it was difficult to tell the battle within the white tower is over egwene said the woman elaida aroihan amys asked taken by the seanchan egwene said i have been accepted as amyrlin by those who followed her my position is far from secureat times i feel balanced atop a stone that sits balanced atop another stone but the white tower is again whole amys clicked her tongue softly she raised her hand and a striped stolean amyrlins stoleappeared in it i suppose you should be wearing this then egwene let out a soft slow breath it was remarkable to her sometimes how much stock she put in the opinions of these women she took the stole putting it around her shoulders sorilea will dislike this news bair said shaking her head she still had a hope that you would leave those fools in the white tower and return to us please take care egwene said summoning herself a cup of tea i am not only one of those fools my friend but i am their leader queen of the fools you might say bair hesitated i have toh not for speaking the truth egwene assured her many of them are fools but are we not all fools at some point you did not abandon me to my failures when you found me walking telaranrbiod in like manner cannot abandon those of the white tower amys eyes narrowed you have grown much since we last met egwene alvere that sent a thrill through egwene i had much need to grow my life has been difficult of late when confronted by a collapsed roof bair said some will begin to haul away the refuse becoming stronger for the process others will go to visit their brothers hold and drink his water have you seen rand recently egwene asked the caracarn has embraced death amys said he has given up trying to be as strong as the stones and has instead achieved the strength of the wind bair nodded almost we will have to stop calling him a child she smiled almost egwene gave no hint of her shock shed expected them to be displeased with rand i wish you to know the respect i have for you you have much honor for taking me in as you did i think that the only reason i see farther than my sisters is because you taught me to walk with my back straight and head high it was a simple thing amys said obviously pleased one that any woman would have done there are few pleasures more satisfying than taking a cord someone else has knotted bair said then teasing it straight again however if the cord is not of good material then no untangling will save it you gave us fine material egwene alvere i wish that there were a way egwene said to train more sisters in the ways of the wise ones you could send them to us amys said particularly if they need punishing we wouldnt coddle them like the white tower egwene bristled the beatings shed taken had been coddling that was a fight she didnt want to join however the aiel would always assume wetlander ways to be soft and there was no changing that assumption i doubt the sisters would agree to that egwene said carefully but hat might work would be to send young womenthose still trainto study with you that was part of why my training was so effective i wasnt yet set in the ways of the aes sedai would they agree to this bair asked they might egwene said if we sent accepted novices would be onsidered too inexperienced sisters too dignified but accepted perhaps there would need to be a good reason that seems to benefit the white tower you should tell them to go bair said and expect them to obey have you not the most honor among them should they not listen to your counsel when it is wise does the clan always do as a chief demands egwene said of course not amys said but wetlanders are always fawning over kings and lords they seem to like being told what to do it makes them feel safe aes sedai are different egwene said the aes sedai keep implying that we should all be training in the white tower amys said her tone indicated what she thought of that idea they drone on as noisy as a blind chippabird that cannot tell if its day or night they need to see that we will never do such a thing tell them that youre sending women to us to study our ways so we can understand one another it is only the truth they neednt know that you also expect them to be strengthened by the experience that might work egwene was pleased the plan was only a few hairs off from what she eventually wanted to accomplish this is a topic to consider in easier days bair said i sense greater trouble in you than this egwene alvere there is a greater trouble she said rand althor has he told you what he declared when he visited the white tower he said he angered you amys said i find his actions odd he visits you after all his talk of the aes sedai locking him up and putting him in a box he was different when he came here egwene said he has embraced death bair said again nodding he becomes the caracarn truly he spoke powerfully egwene said but his words were those of madness he said he is going to break the seals on the dark ones prison amys and bair both froze you are certain of this bair asked yes this is disturbing news amys said we will consult with him on this thank you for bringing this to us i will be gathering those who resist him egwene relaxed until that moment she hadnt been certain which way the wise ones would go perhaps rand will listen to reason if enough voices are present he is not known for his willingness to listen to reason amys said with a sigh rising egwene and bair did so as well the wise ones blouses were laced in an instant the time is long past for the white tower to ignore the wise ones egwene said or for the wise ones to avoid the aes sedai we must work together hand in hand as sisters so long as it isnt some sunblinded ridiculous thought about the wise ones training in the tower bair said she smiled to show it was a joke but succeeded only in baring her teeth egwene smiled she did want the wise ones to train in the tower there were many methods of channeling that the aes sedai did better than the wise ones on the other hand the wise ones were better about working together andegwene admitted reluctantlywith leadership the two groups could learn much from one another she would find a way to tie them together somehow she fondly bade farewell to the two wise ones watching as they faded from telaranrhiod would that their counsel alone proved enough to turn rand from his insane plan but it was unlikely egwene took a breath in an instant she stood in the hall of the tower her feet planted directly on the flame of tar valon painted on the floor seven spirals of color wound out from her spinning toward the perimeter of the domed chamber nynaeve was not there egwene drew her lips to a line that woman egwene could bring the white tower to its knees turn a staunch member of the red ajah to her side earn the respect of the toughest wise ones but light help her if she needed the loyalty of her friends rand gawyn nynaeveall infuriating in their own ways she folded her arms to wait perhaps nynaeve would still come if not this wouldnt be the first time she had disappointed egwene a massive rose window dominated the far wall behind the amyrlin seat itself the flame at the center sparkled as if there were sunlight beyond though egwene knew those boiling black clouds covered all the sky of the world of dreams she turned from the window then froze there set into the glass below the flame of tar valon was a large segment in the shape of the dragons fang that wasnt part of the original window egwene stepped forward inspecting the glass there is a third constant besides the creator and the dark one verins meticulous voice said a memory from another time there is a world that lies ithin each of these others inside all of them at the same time or perhaps sur rounding them writers in the age of legends called it telaranrhiod did this window represent one of those another world where dragon and amyrlin ruled tar valon side by side thats an interesting window a voice said from behind her egwene started spinning nynaeve stood there wearing a dress of bright yellow trimmed with green across the high bodice and along the skirt she wore a red dot at the center of her forehead and had her hair woven into its characteristic braid egwene felt a surge of relief finally it had been months since shed seen nynaeve cursing inside for letting herself be surprised she smoothed her face and embraced the source weaving spirit a few inverted wards might help keep her from being startled again elayne was supposed to arrive a little later i didnt choose this pattern egwene said looking back at the rose window this is telaranrhiods interpretation but the window itself is real nynaeve asked unfortunately egwene said one of the holes the seanchan left when they attacked they attacked nynaeve asked yes egwene said something you would have known if youd ever responded to my summons nynaeve folded her arms and the two of them regarded one another across the room flame of tar valon centering the floor beneath them this would have to be handled very carefully nynaeve could be as prickly as the worst of thornbushes well nynaeve said sounding distinctly uncomfortable i know youre busy and light knows i have enough things to be doing tell me the news you think i need to know and ill be off nynaeve egwene said i didnt bring you here only to give you news nynaeve grasped her braid she knew she should be rebuked for the way shed avoided egwene actually egwene continued i wanted to ask your advice nynaeve blinked advice on what well egwene said strolling across the flame youre one of the few people i can think of who has been in a situation similar to mine amyrlin nynaeve asked flatly a leader egwene said passing nynaeve and nodding for her to walk beside her that everyone thinks is too young who rose to her position abruptly who knows she is the right woman for the job yet has only grudging acceptance from most of those near her yes nynaeve said walking with egwene eyes growing distant you i could say i know something of being in that situation how did you deal with it egwene asked it seems that everything i do i need to do myselfbecause if i dont they ignore me once im out of sight many assume that i give orders just to be seen making noise or they resent my position above them how did i deal with it when i was wisdom nynaeve asked egwene i dont know if i did i could barely keep myself from boxing jon thanes ears half the days and dont get me talking about cenn but eventually they respected you it was a matter of not letting them forget my station they couldnt be allowed to continue to think of me as a young girl establish your authority quickly be firm with the women in the tower egwene because theyll begin by seeing how far they can push you and once youve let them push you a handspan its harder than winter molasses to get back what youve lost all right egwene said and dont come up with idle work for them to do nynaeve said they passed out of the hall of the tower strolling through the hallways get them used to you giving orders but make those orders good ones make sure they dont bypass you id guess that it might be easy for them to start looking to the sitters or the ajah heads instead of you women in emonds field started going to the womens circle instead of me if you discover that the sitters are making decisions that should have come before the entire hall you have to make a big fuss about it trust me theyll grouse that youre making too much noise over small things but theyll think twice about doing something important without your attention egwene nodded it was good advice thoughof courseit came colored by nynaeves view of the world i think the biggest problem egwene said is that i have so few true supporters you have me and elayne do i egwene said stopping in the hallway and looking at nynaeve do i really have you nynaeve the former wisdom stopped beside her of course you do dont be silly and how will it seem egwene asked if those who know me best fuse my authority might it seem to the others that there is something hev do not know some weakness that only my friends have seen nynaeve froze suddenly her honesty melted into suspicion her eyes narrowing this wasnt about asking me for advice at all was it of course it was egwene said only a fool would ignore the advice of those who support her but how did it feel for you those first weeks when you became wisdom when all the women you were supposed to be leading looked at you only as the girl they had known terrible nynaeve said softly and were they wrong to do so yes because id become something more it wasnt me any longer it was my station egwene met the older womans eyes holding them and an understanding passed between them light nynaeve said you caught me quite soundly didnt you i need you nynaeve egwene said not just because youre so strong in the power not just because youre a clever determined woman not just because youre refreshingly untainted by tower politics and not just because youre one of the few who knew rand before this all began but because i need people i can trust implicitly if you can be one of those youll have me kneeling on the ground nynaeve said kissing your ring and would you have done it for another amyrlin not happily but youd have done it yes and do you honestly think there is another who would do a better job than i nynaeve hesitated then shook her head then why is it so bitter for you to serve the amyrlin not me nynaeve but the station nynaeves face looked as if shed drunk something very bitter this will not be easy for me i ve never known you to avoid a task because it was difficult nynaeve the station all right ill try then you might begin by calling me mother egwene held up a finger to cut off nynaeves objection to remind yourself nynaeve it neednt be permanent at least not in private but you must begin thinking of me as i amyrlin all right all right youve pricked me with enough thorns i already feel as if ive been drinking windsatters draught all day she hesitated then added mother she almost seemed to choke on the word egwene smiled encouragingly i wont treat you the way women did me after i was first named wisdom nynaeve promised light odd to be able to feel as they did well they were still fools ill do better youll see it mother it sounded a little less forced that time egwene broadened her smile there were few ways to motivate nynaeve better than a competition suddenly a tinkling bell rang in egwenes mind shed almost forgotten her wards i think elayne has arrived good nynaeve said sounding relieved lets go to her then she began striding back toward the hall then froze she glanced back if it pleases you mother i wonder if shell ever be able to say that without sounding awkward egwene thought well so long as shes trying an excellent suggestion she joined nynaeve upon arriving in the hall however they found it empty egwene folded her arms looking around maybe she went looking for us nynaeve said wed have seen her in the hallway egwene said besides elayne popped into the room she wore a regal white gown sparkling with diamonds as soon as she saw egwene she smiled broadly rushing over and taking her hands you did it egwene were whole again egwene smiled yes though the tower is still injured there is much to do you sound like nynaeve elayne glanced at nynaeve smiling thank you nynaeve said dryly oh dont be so silly elayne walked over and gave nynaeve a friendly hug im glad youre here id worried that you wouldnt come and egwene would have to hunt you down and pull your toes off one at a time the amyrlin nynaeve said has much better things to do isnt that right mother elayne started looking amazed she got a glimmer in her eye and hid a smile she assumed that nynaeve had been given a tonguelashing but of course egwene knew that wouldnt have worked with nynaeve it would be like trying to yank a burr out of your skin when its spines had gone in the wrong way elayne egwene said where did you go before we returned what do you mean she said when you first came here we were gone did you go somewhere looking for us elayne seemed perplexed i channeled into my terangreal went to sleep and you were here when i appeared then who set off the wards nynaeve asked troubled egwene reset the wards and thenthinking carefullyshe wove an inverted ward against eavesdropping but altered it to allow a little bit of sound through with another weave she projected that little bit far out around them someone who grew near would hear them as if whispering theyd edge closer but the sound would remain a whisper perhaps that would draw them closer inch by inch as they strained to hear nynaeve and elayne watched her make the weaves elayne looking awed though nynaeve nodded thoughtfully to herself sit please egwene said making herself a chair and sitting in it we have much to discuss elayne made herself a throne probably unconsciously and nynaeve made a seat copying the chairs of the sitters in the room egwene of course had moved the amyrlin seat nynaeve looked from one throne to another obviously dissatisfied maybe that was why shed resisted these meetings for so long egwene and elayne had risen so far it was time for some honey to take away the bitterness nynaeve egwene said id like it very much if you could return to the tower and teach more of the sisters in your new method of healing many are learning it but they could use more instruction and there are others who are reluctant to abandon the old ways stubborn goats nynaeve said show them cherries and theyll still eat the rotten apples if theyve been doing it long enough im not sure it would be prudent for me to come though er mother why is that rand nynaeve said someone has to keep an eye on him someone other than cadsuane at least her lips turned down at that womans name hes changed recently changed elayne said sounding concerned what do you mean have you seen him recently egwene asked no elayne said immediately too quickly it was undoubtedly the truthelayne wouldnt lie to herbut there were things she was hiding about rand egwene had suspected it for a time could she have bonded him he has changed nynaeve said and its a very good thing mother you dont know how bad he grew there were times when t was terrified of him now thats gone hes the same personhe even talks the same way as before quietly without anger before it was like the quiet of a knife being drawn and now its like the quiet of a breeze hes awakened elayne said suddenly hes warm now egwene frowned what does that mean i actually i dont know elayne blushed it came out sorry yes shed bonded him well that could be useful why didnt she wish to speak of it egwene would have to talk to her alone sometime nynaeve was studying elayne with narrowed eyes had she noticed as well her eyes flickered toward elaynes chest then down at her belly youre pregnant nynaeve accused suddenly pointing at elayne the andoran queen blushed that was right nynaeve wouldnt know of the pregnancy though egwene had heard from aviendha light nynaeve said i didnt think id let rand out of my sight long enough for that when did it happen elayne blushed nobody said that he nynaeve gave elayne a flat stare and the queen blushed further both knew nynaeves feelings about propriety in these mattersand in truth egwene agreed but elaynes private life was none of her business im happy for you elayne egwene said and for rand im not certain what i think of the timing you should know that rand is planning to break the remaining seals upon the dark ones prison and in so doing risk releasing him upon the world elayne pursed her lips well there are only three seals left and theyre crumbling so what if he is running that risk nynaeve said the dark one will be freed when the final seal crumbles best if it happens when rand is there to battle him yes but the seals thats foolhardy surely rand can face the dark one and defeat him and seal him away without taking that risk maybe youre right nynaeve said elayne looked troubled this was a more lukewarm reception than egwene had expected shed thought that the wise ones would resist her while nynaeve and elayne would immediately see the danger nynaeve has been around him too much egwene thought she was likely caught up by his taveren nature the pattern bent around him those near him would begin to see things his way would workunconsciouslyto see his will done that had to be the explanation normally nynaeve was so levelheaded about these sorts of things or well nynaeve wasnt exactly levelheaded really but generally did see the right way things needed to be done so long as that right way didnt involve her being wrong i need both of you to return to the tower egwene said elayne i know what youre going to sayand yes i realize that you are queen and that andors needs must be met but so long as you havent taken the oaths other aes sedai will think you undeserving shes right elayne nynaeve said you neednt visit for long enough time to be raised formally to an aes sedai and be accepted into the green ajah the nobles of andor wont know the difference but other aes sedai will true elayne said but the timing is awkward i dont know if i want to risk swearing the oaths while pregnant it might harm the children that gave nynaeve pause you may have a point egwene said i will have someone look into whether or not the oaths are dangerous in pregnancy but nynaeve i want you back here for certain it will leave rand completely unattended mother im afraid it is impossible to avoid egwene met nynaeves eyes i wont have you as an aes sedai free of the oaths no close your mouthi know you try to hold to the oaths but so long as you are free of the oath rod itself others will wonder if they could be free as well yes nynaeve said i suppose so you will return nynaeve clenched her jaw and seemed to be fighting an internal battle yes mother she said elayne opened her eyes wider in shock this is important nynaeve egwene said i doubt there is anything you alone could do to stop rand now we need to gather allies for a unified front all right nynaeve said what worries me is the testing egwene said the sitters have begun to argue thatwhile it was all right to raise you and the others in exileyou should still have to go through the testing now that the white tower is reunified they make very good arguments perhaps i can argue that your difficult challenges recently should earn you an exemption we dont have time to teach you two all of the weaves youd need elayne nodded nynaeve shrugged ill do the testing if im going to come back then i might as well do this properly egwene blinked in surprise nynaeve these are very complex weaves i havent had time to memorize all of them i swear that many are needlessly ornate simply to be difficult egwene had no intention of going through the testing herself and didnt need to the law was specific bv being made amyrlin she had become aes sedai things werent as clear in regards to nynaeve and the others that egwene had raised nynaeve shrugged again the hundred testing weaves arent so bad i could show them to you right here if you wanted me to when have you had time to learn those elayne exclaimed i havent spent the last few months mooning about and dreaming of rand althor securing the throne of andor is not mooning about nynaeve egwene cut in if you truly have the weaves memorized then being raised properly would help me a great deal it would look less like im favoring my friends the testing is supposed to be dangerous elayne said are you sure you have the weaves in hand ill be fine nynaeve said excellent egwene said ill expect you here in the morning so soon nynaeve said aghast the sooner you can hold that oath rod the sooner ill be able to stop worrying about you elayne well still have to do something about you the pregnancy elayne said its interfering with my ability to channel thats getting betteri could get here thankfullybut its still a problem explain to the hall it would be too dangerous for meand for the babesto undergo the testing while unable to channel consistently they might suggest you wait nynaeve said and lef me run around without the oaths elayne said though i would like to know if anyones taken the oaths while pregnant before just to be sure ill find what i can egwene said until then i have another task for you i am rather busy with ruling andor mother i know egwene said unfortunately theres nobody else i can ask i need more dream terangreal i might be able to manage elayne said assuming i can start channeling reliably what happened to the dream terangreal you had nynaeve asked egwene stolen egwene said by sheriamwho by the way was black ajah the two gasped and egwene realized that the revelation of the hundreds of black sisters was unknown to them she took a deep breath steel yourselves she said ive got a painful story for you before the seanchan attack verin came to at that moment the bell went off in her head again egwene willed herself to move the room blinked around her and she was suddenly standing outside in the hallway where her wards were set she came facetoface with talva a thin woman with a bun of golden hair she had once been of the yellow ajah but was one of the black sisters who had fled the tower weaves of fire sprang up around talva but egwene had already begun working on a shield she slammed it between the other woman and the source immediately weaving air to snare her a sound came from behind egwene didnt think she moved herself relying on practiced familiarity with telaranrhiod she appeared behind a woman who was letting loose a jet of fire alviarin egwene snarled beginning another shield as alviarins wave of fire hit the unfortunate talva causing her to scream as her flesh burned alviarin spun then yelped vanishing burn her egwene thought alviarin was at the very top of the list of people she wanted captured the hallway fell still talvas corpse blackened and smokingslumping to the ground shed never awaken die here and one died in the real world egwene shivered that murderous weave had been meant for her i relied too much on channeling she thought thought happens more quickly than weaves can be made i should have imagined ropes around alviarin no alviarin would still have been able to jump away from ropes egwene hadnt been thinking like a dreamer lately her mind had been on the aes sedai and their problems and weaves had come naturally to her but she couldnt let herself forget that in this place thought was more powerful than the one power egwene looked up as nynaeve barreled out of the hall elayne following more cautiously i sensed channeling nynaeve said she looked at the burned corpse light black sisters egwene said folding her arms it seems theyre making good use of those dream terangreal id guess theyre under orders to prowl the white tower at night perhaps looking for us perhaps looking for information to use against us egwene and the others had done that very thing during elaidas reign we shouldnt have met here nynaeve said next time well use a different place she hesitated if it suits you mother it might egwene said it might not well never defeat them unless we can find them walking into traps is hardly the best way to defeat them mother nynaeve said flatly depends on your preparation egwene said she frowned had she just seen a flutter of black cloth ducking around a corner egwene was there in a moment elaynes startled curse sounded down the hallway behind her my but the woman had a tongue on her the place was empty eerie almost too silent that was normal in telaranrhiod egwene remained full of the one power but moved back to the other two she had cleansed the white tower but an infestation remained hiding at its heart i will find you mesaana egwene thought then waved for the others to join her they moved to the hillside where shed been earlier a place where she could give a more detailed explanation of events theyd missed chapter use a pebble nynaeve hastened through the paved streets of tear the ashaman naeff at her side she could still feel that storm to the north distant but terrible unnatural and it was moving southward lan was up there light protect him she whispered what was that nynaeve sedai naeff asked nothing nynaeve was getting used to having the blackcoated men around she did not feel an uncomfortable chill when she looked at naeff that would be silly saidin had been cleansed with her own help no need to be uncomfortable even if the ashaman did sometimes stare off into nothing muttering to themselves like naeff who was looking into the shadow of a nearby building hand on his sword careful nynaeve sedai he said theres another myrddraal following us youre certain naeff the tall rectangularfaced man nodded he was talented with weaves particularly air which was unusual for a manand he was very polite to aes sedai unlike some of the other ashaman yes im certain he said i dont know why i can see them and others cannot i must have a talent for it they hide in shadows scouts of some sort i think they havent struck yet i think theyre wary because they know i can see them tie d taken to night walks through the stone of tear watching the mydraal that only he could see his madness wasnt getting worse but old injuries wouldnt go away hed always bear this scar poor man at least his madness wasnt as bad as some of the others nynaeve looked forward marching down the wide paved street i buildings passed on either side designed in tears haphazard way a large mansion with two small towers and a bronze gatelike door sat beside an inn of only modest size across from them was a row of homes with wrought iron worked into the doors and windows but a butchers shop had been built right in the middle of the line nynaeve and naeff were heading for the all summers neighborhood which was just inside the western wall it wasnt the richest section of tear but it was definitely prosperous of course in tear there was really only one division commoner or noble many of the nobles still considered commoners completely differentand wholly inferiorcreatures they passed some of those commoners men in loose breeches tied at the ankles colorful sashes at the waist women in highnecked dresses pale aprons hanging at the front wide straw hats with flat tops were common or cloth caps that hung to one side many people carried clogs on a string over their shoulders to use once they returned to the maule the people passing nynaeve now wore worried faces some glancing over their shoulders in fear a bubble of evil had hit the city in that direction light send that not too many were hurt for she didnt have much time to spare she had to return to the white tower it galled her to have to obey egwene but obey she would and leave as soon as rand returned hed gone somewhere this morning insufferable man at least hed taken maidens with him hed reportedly said he needed to fetch something nynaeve quickened her step naeff at her side until they were nearly running a gateway would have been faster but it wouldnt be safe she couldnt be certain they wouldnt slice into someone were growing too dependent on those gateways she thought our own feet hardly seem good enough anymore they turned a corner into a street where a group of nervous defenderswearing black coats and silvery breastplates black and gold sleeves puffing out at the sidesstood in a line they parted for her and naeff and while they looked relieved that shed arrived they still clutched their polearms nervously the city beyond them looked faintly blander than it should washed out the paving stones were a lighter shade of gray the walls of the buildings a fainter brown or gray than they should have been you have men inside searching for wounded nynaeve asked one of the defenders shook his head weve been keeping people out er lady aes sedai its not safe most tairens still werent accustomed to showing aes sedai respect until recently channeling had been outlawed in the city send your men ro search nynaeve said firmly the lord dragon ill be upset if your timidity costs lives start at the perimeter send for me if you find anyone i can help the guardsmen moved off nynaeve turned to naeff and he nodded she turned and took a step into the affected section of town when her foot hit the paving stone the stone turned to dust her food sank through the shattered paving stone and hit packed earth she looked down feeling a chill she continued forward and the stones fell to powder as she touched them she and naeff made their way to a nearby building leaving a trail of powdered rock behind the building was an inn with nice balconies on the second floor delicate ironwork patterns on the glass windows and a darkly stained porch the door was open and as she lifted her foot up to step onto the low porch the boards also turned to powder she froze looking down naeff stepped up beside her then knelt down pinching the dust between his fingers its soft he said quietly as fine a powder as ive ever touched the air smelled unnaturally fresh contrasting strangely with the silent street nynaeve took a deep breath then went into the inn she had to push forward walking with the wooden floor at her knees the boards disintegrating as she touched them the inside was dim the standlamps no longer burned people sat about the room frozen in midmotion most were nobles with fine clothing the men wearing beards oiled to a point one sat at a nearby tall table with longlegged chairs he had a mug of morning ale halfway to his lips he was motionless his mouth open to accept the drink naeffs face was grim although little seemed to surprise or unsettle ashaman as he took another step forward nynaeve lunged and grabbed his arm he frowned at her and she pointed down right in front of himbarely visible beneath the stillwhole floorboards right ahead of themthe ground fell away hed been about to step into the inns cellar light naeff said stepping back he knelt down then tapped the board in front of him it fell to dust showering down into the dark cellar below nynaeve wove spirit air and water to delve the man sitting at the chair her normally she would touch someone to delve them but she hesitated this time it would work without touch but would not be as effective for healing her delving found nothing no life no sense that he had ever alive his body wasnt even flesh with a sinking feeling she delved other people in the darkened room a serving maid carrying breakfast towari three andoran merchants a corpulent innkeeper who must have had trouble navigating between the closeset tables a woman in a rich dre sitting in the very back of the room primly reading a small book there was no life in any of them these werent corpses they were husks fingers trembling nynaeve reached out and brushed the shoulder of the man at the high table he immediately fell to powder dust showering downward in a puff the chair and floorboards underneath did not dissolve there is nobody here to save nynaeve said poor people naeff said light shelter their souls nynaeve often had trouble feeling pity for the tairen noblesof all the people she had met they seemed among the most arrogant but nobody deserved this besides a large number of commoners had been caught in this bubble as well she and naeff made their way out of the building nynaeves frustration mounting as she tugged on her braid she hated feeling helpless like with the poor guard who had started the fire back at the manor house in arad doman or the people who were struck down by strange diseases the dusty husks this day what was the good of learning to heal if she couldnt help people and now she had to leave go back to the white tower it felt like running away she turned to naeff wind she said nynaeve sedai give the building a gust of wind naeff she said i want to see what happens the ashaman did as she asked his invisible weaves blowing a jet of air the entire building burst shattering into dust that blew away like the white seeds of a dandelion naeff turned to her how wide did they say this bubble was she asked about two streets wide in all directions we need more wind she said beginning a weave create a gust as large as you can if there is anyone wounded in here well find them this way naeff nodded the two of them strode forward creating wind they shattered buildings causing them to burst and fall naeff was far more skilled at the process than she but nynaeve was stronger in the one power together they swept the crumbling buildings stones and husks before them in a dust storm it was exhausting work but they kept at it she hopedagainst reason that she might find someone to help buildings fell before her and naeff the dust caught in swirling air they pushed the dust in a circle moving inward like a woman sweeping the floor they passed people frozen on the streets in midstride oxen pulling a cart heartwrenchingly some children playing in an alley all fell to dust they found nobody alive eventually she and naeff had dissolved all f the broken part of the city and blown the dust into the center nynaeve looked at it kept swirling in place by a small cyclone naeff had woven curious nynaeve channeled a tongue of fire into the cyclone and the dust caught alight nynaeve gasped that dust went up like dried paper thrown into a fire creating a roaring tempest of flames she and naeff backed away but it was over in a flash it didnt leave any ash behind if we hadnt gathered it she thought watching the fire fade away someone might have dropped a candle on it a fire like that naeff stilled his winds the two of them stood in the center of an open circle of bare earth with periodic holes for cellars on the edges buildings had been sliced into rooms open to the air some structures having collapsed it was eerie to see this hollow area like a gougedout eye socket in an otherwise healthy face several groups of defenders stood at the perimeter she nodded to naeff and they walked to the largest group you didnt find anyone she demanded no lady aes sedai a man said er well we did find a few but they were dead already another man nodded a barrellike fellow whose uniform was very tight seems anyone who had even a toe inside of that ring fell dead found a few of them missing only a foot or part of their arm but they were dead anyway the man shuddered visibly nynaeve closed her eyes the entire world was falling apart and she was powerless to heal it she felt sick and angry maybe they caused it naeff said softly she opened her eyes to see him nodding toward the shadows of a building nearby the fades there are three of them there nynaeve sedai watching us naeff she said frustrated telling him the fades werent real didnt help i have to do something she thought help someone naeff stand still she took hold of his arm and delved him he looked at her surprised but didnt object she could see the madness like a dark network of veins digging into his mind it seemed to pulse like a small beating heart shed found similar corruption recently in other ashaman her skill with delving was improving her weaves more refined and she could find things once hidden to her she had no idea how to fix what was wrong though anything should be healable she told herself anything but death itself she concentrated weaving all five powers and carefully prodded at the madness remembering what had happened when shed removed the compulsion from graendals unfortunate servant naeff was better off with this madness than he would be if she damaged his mind further oddly the darkness did seem similar to compulsion was that what the taint had done bent the men who used the one power with the dark ones own compulsion she carefully wove a counterweave opposite the madness then laid it over naeffs mind the weave just faded away doing nothing she gritted her teeth that should have worked but as seemed so common lately it had failed no she thought no i cant just sit back she delved deeper the darkness had tiny thornlike projections stuck into naeffs mind she ignored the people gathering around her and inspected those thorns she carefully used weaves of spirit to pry one free it came out with some resistance and she quickly healed the spot where it had punctured naeffs flesh the brain seemed to pulse looking more healthy one by one she pried the others free she was forced to maintain her weaves holding the barbs back lest they plunge down again she began to sweat she was already tired from sweeping the area clean and no longer could spare concentration to keep the heat off her tear was so muggy she continued working preparing another counterweave once she had pried up each and every thorn she released her new weave the dark patch undulated and shook like something alive then it vanished nynaeve stumbled back drained near to exhaustion naeff blinked then looked around he raised a hand to his head light she thought did i hurt him i shouldnt have barreled into that i could havetheyre gone naeff said the fades i cant see them anymore he blinked why would fades be hiding in the shadows anyway if i could see them theyd have killed me and he looked at her focusingwhat did you do i i think i just healed your madness well shed done something to it what shed done hadnt been any standard healing and hadnt even used healing weaves but it had worked it seemed naeff smiled deeply seeming bewildered he took her hand with both of his then knelt before her growing tearyeyed for months i have felt as if i were always being watched as if i would be murdered the moment i turned back on the shadows now i thank you i need to go find nelavaire off with you then nynaeve said naeff left her in a dash running back toward the stone to search out his aes sedai i cant let myself begin to think that nothing i do matters thats what the dark one wants as she watched naeff hasten away she noticed that the clouds above were breaking rand had returned workers began clearing away the rubble of buildings that had half turned to dust and nynaeve ended up speaking soothingly to the worried tairens who began to cluster around the perimeter she didnt want there to be a panic she assured everyone that the danger was past and then she asked to meet with any families who had lost someone she was still doing thistalking softly with a thin worried woman when rand found her the woman was a commoner wearing a highnecked dress with three aprons and a straw hat her husband had worked in the inn nynaeve had entered the woman kept glancing at the hole in the ground that had been the cellar after a moment nynaeve noticed rand watching her and standing with his arms behind his back hand clasping his stump two maidens guarded him a pair of women named somma and kanara nynaeve finished speaking with the tairen but the womans tearful eyes wrenched her heart how would she react if she lost lan light protect him please please protect him she prayed she unhooked her coin pouch and sent the woman off with it perhaps that would help rand stepped up to nynaeve you care for my people thank you i care for any who need it nynaeve said as youve always done rand said along with caring for some who dont need it like you she said raising an eyebrow no ive always needed it that and more nynaeve hesitated that wasnt something shed ever expected him to admit why hadnt he gotten rid of that old cloak it was faded and dull this is my fault rand said nodding toward the hole in the city rand dont be a fool i dont know if anyone can avoid being a fool at times he said blame myself because of my delays weve been putting off the confront tion with him for too long what happened here today the buildin turned to dust yes nynaeve said their substance was removed everything crumbled the moment we touched it he would do this to the entire world rand said his voice growing soft he stirs the longer we waitholding on by our fingernailsthe more he destroys what remains we can delay no longer nynaeve frowned but rand if you let him free wont that make it even worse perhaps for a short burst rand said opening the bore will not free him immediately though it will give him more strength it must be done regardless think of our task as climbing a tall stone wall unfortunately we are delaying running laps before attempting the climb each step tires us for the fight to come we must face him while still strong that is why i must break the seals i nynaeve said i think i actually believe you she was surprised to realize it do you nynaeve he asked sounding oddly relieved do you really i do then try to convince egwene she will stop me if she can rand she has called me back to the tower ill need to go today rand looked saddened well i suspected that she might do that eventually he took nynaeve by the shoulder in an odd gesture dont let them ruin you nynaeve theyll try ruin me your passion is part of you rand said i tried to be like them though i wouldnt have admitted it cold always in control it nearly destroyed me that is strength to some but it is not the only type of strength perhaps you could learn to control yourself a little more but i like you as you are it makes you genuine i would not see you become another perfect aes sedai with a painted mask of a face and no care for the feelings and emotions of others to be aes sedai is to be calm nynaeve replied to be aes sedai is to be what you decide it is rand said his stump still held behind his back moiraine cared you could see it in her even when she was calm the best aes sedai ive known are the ones who other complain arent what an aes sedai should be nynaeve found herself nodding then was annoyed at herself she was taking advice from rand althor there was something different about rand now quiet intensity and careful words he was a man you could take advice from without feeling he speaking down to you like his father actually not that shed ever admit that to either one of them go to egwene rand said releasing her shoulder but when you can i would like it very much if you returned to me i will need your counsel gain at the very least i would like you by my side as i go to shayol ghul i cannot defeat him with saidin alone and if we are going to use callandor i will need two women i trust in the circle with me i have not decided upon the other aviendha or elayne perhaps but you for certain i will be there rand she felt oddly proud hold still for a moment i wont hurt you i promise he raised an eyebrow but did nothing as she delved him she was so tired but if she was going to leave him she needed to take this opportunity to heal his madness it seemed suddenly the most important thing she could do for him and for the world she delved staying away from the wounds at his side which were pits of darkness that seemed to try to suck in her energy she kept her attention on his mind where was theshe stiffened the darkness was enormous covering the entirety of his mind thousands upon thousands of the tiny black thorns pricked into his brain but beneath them was a brilliant white lacing of something a white radiance like liquid power light given form and life she gasped it coated each of the dark tines driving into his mind alongside them what did it mean she didnt have any idea how to begin working on this there were so many barbs how could he even think with that much darkness pressing against his brain and what had created the whiteness shed healed rand before and hadnt noticed it then of course shed never seen the darkness until recently her practice with delving was likely the reason she reluctantly withdrew im sorry she said i cant heal you many have tried on those woundsyou yourself included they are simply unhealable i dont think on them much these days not the wounds in your side nynaeve said the madness i you can heal madness i think i did so in naeff rand grinned widely you never cease to nynaeve do you realize that the most talented of healers during the age of legends had difficulty with diseases of the mind many believed it was not possible to heal madness with the one power ill heal the others she said narishma flinn at the least befor go all of the ashaman probably have at least a hint of this taint upon their minds i dont know if ill be able to get to the black tower or if i want to go there thank you rand said looking northward but no you shouldnt go to the black tower i will need to send someone there but it will be handled carefully somethings happening with them but i have so much to do he shook his head then looked to her that is one pit i cannot cross at the moment speak well of me to egwene i need her to be an ally nynaeve nodded thenfeeling foolishgave him a hug before hurrying off to seek out narishma and flinn a hug for the dragon reborn she was turning as silly as elayne she shook her head thinking that perhaps some time in the white tower would help her regain her levelheadedness the clouds had returned egwene stood at the very apex of the white tower on the flat circular roof holding to the waisthigh wall like a creeping funguslike insects in a swarmthe clouds had closed up above tar valon the sunlights visit had been welcome but brief the tea was back to tasting stale again the grain stores theyd discovered were running out and the next sacks to come in had been filled with weevils the land is one with the dragon she breathed in smelling the new air looking out over tar valon her tar valon saerin yukiri and seainethree of the sisters who had been the original hunters for the black ajah in the towerwaited patiently behind her they were among her most ardent supporters now and her most useful everyone expected egwene to favor the women who had been among those who split from elaida so being seen spending time with aes sedai who had stayed in the white tower was helpful what have you discovered egwene asked saerin shook her head joining egwene at the wall the scar on her cheek and the white at her temples made the oliveskinned and bluntfaced brown look like an aging general some of the information you requeste was uncertain even three thousand years ago mother whatever you can give me will help daughter egwene said so long as we do not depend on the facts entirely incomplete knowledge is better than complete ignorance saerin snorted softly but obviously recognized the quote from yasicca cellaech an ancient brown scholar and you two egwene asked yukiri and seaine were looking yukiri said seaine has a list of possibilities some are actually reasonable egwene raised an eyebrow asking a white for theories was always nteresting but not always useful they had a tendency to ignore what was plausible focusing on remote possibilities let us begin there then egwene said seaine well seaine said i will begin by saying that one of the forsaken undoubtedly has knowledge that we cant guess at so there may be no way to ascertain how she defeated the oath rod for instance there might be a way to disable it for a short time or perhaps there are special words that can be used to evade its effects the rod is a thing of the age of legends and though weve used it for millennia we dont really understand it no more than we do most terangreal very well egwene said but seaine said getting out a sheet of paper that taken into account i have three theories on how one might defeat swearing on the rod first it is possible that the woman has another oath rod others were once said to exist and its plausible that one rod could release you from the oaths of another mesaana could have been holding one secretly she could have taken the three oaths while holding our rod then somehow used the other to negate those oaths before swearing that she was not a darkfriend tenuous egwene said how would she have released herself without us knowing it requires channeling spirit i considered that seaine said not surprising yukiri said seaine eyed her then continued this is the reason mesaana would have needed a second oath rod she could have channeled spirit into it then inverted the weave leaving her linked to it it seems improbable egwene said improbable saerin replied it seems ridiculous i thought you said some of these were plausible yukiri this one is the least likely of the three seaine said the second method would be easier mesaana could have sent a lookalike wearing the mirror of mists some unfortunate sisteror novice or even some untrained woman who could channelunder heavy compulsion this woman could have been forced to take the oaths in mesaanas place then since this person wouldnt be a darkfriend she could speak truthfully that she wasnt egwene nodded thoughtfully that would have taken a lot of preparation from what ive been able to learn about her saerin said mesaan was good at preparation she excelled at it saerins task had been to discover whatever she could about mesaanas true nature they had all heard the storieswho didnt know the names of each of the forsaken and their most terrible deeds by heart but egwene put little faith in stories she wanted something more hardfast if she could get it you said there was a third possibility egwene asked yes seaine said we know that some weaves play with sound variations on vocal weaves are used to enhance a voice to project to a crowd and in the ward against eavesdroppingindeed theyre used in the various tricks used to listen in on what is being said nearby complex uses of the mirror of mists can change a persons voice with some practice doesine and i were able to fabricate a variation on a weave that would alter the words we spoke in effect we said one thing but the other person heard another thing entirely dangerous ground to walk seaine saerin said her voice gruff that is the kind of weave that could be used for ill purposes i couldnt use it to lie seaine said i tried the oaths holdso long as the weave was there i couldnt speak words that i knew another would hear as lies even if they were truth when they left my lips regardless it was an easy weave to develop tied off and inverted it hung in front of me and altered my words in a way id indicated theoretically if mesaana had this weave in force she could have taken up the oath rod and sworn whatever she wished i vow that i will lie whenever i feel like it for instance the oath rod would have bound her with that vow but the weaves would have changed the sounds in the air as they passed her lips wed have heard her saying the proper oaths egwene gritted her teeth shed assumed that defeating the oath rod would be difficult and yet here was a simple weave capable of the feat she should have knownnever use a boulder when a pebble will do as her mother had often said with this egwene said they could have been slipping darkfriends into ranks of the aes sedai for years unlikely saerin said none of the black sisters we captured knew of this wave if they had then theyd have tried to use it when we made hem reswear the oaths i suspect that if mesaana does know this trick she h kept it to herself the usefulness of it would vanish once too many people became aware of it still egwene said what do we do knowing of the weave we could probably find a way to check for itbut i doubt that the sisters would be willing to go through the reswearing process again and if it were to catch one of the forsaken yukiri asked it might be worth ruffling a few feathers to catch the fox hiding in the henhouse she wouldnt be caught egwene said besides we dont know if shes using one of these methods seaines logic suggests that it might be possiblewithout too much troubleto defeat the oath rod the actual method mesaana used is less important than the possibility of the act seaine glanced at yukiri none of the three had questioned egwenes knowledge that one of the forsaken was in the white tower but she knew theyd been skeptical well at least they now understood that it might be possible to defeat the oath rod i want you to continue your work egwene said you and the others were effective at capturing several black sisters and unearthing the ferrets this is much the same thing merely far far more dangerous well try mother yukiri said but one sister among hundreds one of the most crafty and evil creatures ever to have lived i doubt she will leave many clues our investigations into the murders have so far yielded very little in the way of results keep at it anyway egwene said saerin what have you to report tales rumors and whispers mother saerin said with a grimace you likely know the most famous stories regarding mesaanahow she ran the schools in lands conquered by the shadow during the war of power so far as i can tell those legends are quite true marsim of manetheren speaks of that in detail in her annals of the final nights and shes often a reliable source alrom gathered quite a full report of living through one of those schools and fragments of it have survived mesaana wished to be a researcher but was rejected the details are not clear she also governed the aes sedai who went to the shadow leading them in battle at times if alroms report is to be believed im not convinced it is i think it likely mesaanas leadership was more figurative egwene nodded slowly but what of her personality who is she saerin shook her head the forsaken are more monsters in the night than real personalities to most mother and much has been lost or misquoted from what i can tell among the forsaken you could think of her as the realistthe one who rather than sitting high on a throne steps in and gets her hands dirty elandria borndats seeing through the breaking insists that unlike moghedien and graendal mesaana was willing to take the reins directly she was never known as the most skilled or powerful of the forsaken but she was extremely capable elandria explains that she did what needed to be done when others would be scheming she would be carefully building up defenses and training new recruits saerin hesitated she well she sounds much like an amyrlin mother the shadows amyrlin light yukiri said little wonder she set up here the gray seemed very unsettled by that the only other thing i could find of relevance mother saerin said was a curious reference from the blue scholar lannis who indicated that mesaana was second only to demandred in sheer anger egwene frowned id assume that all of the forsaken are full of hate not hate saerin said anger lannis thought mesaana was angryat herself at the world at the other forsakenbecause she wasnt one of those at the forefront that could make her very dangerous egwene nodded slowly shes an organizer she thought an administrator who hates being relegated to that position was that why shed stayed in the tower after the black sisters had been found did she desire to bring some great accomplishment to the dark one verin had said that the forsaken shared one unifying trait their selfishness she tried to deliver a broken white tower egwene thought but that has failed she was probably part of the attempt to kidnap rand as well another fiasco and the women sent to destroy the black tower mesaana would need something grand to offset so many failures killing egwene would work that might send the white tower back into division gawyn had been mortified when shed said she might use herself as bait dared she do so she gripped the railing standing above the tower above the city that depended on her looking out on a world that needed her something had to be done mesaana had to be drawn out if what saerin said was true then the woman would be willing to fight directlyshe wouldnt hide and poke from the shadows egwenes task then was to tempt her with an opportunity one that didnt seem obvious one she couldnt resist come egwene said walking toward the ramp back down into the i have some preparations to make chapter shannahar faile walked the camp in the waning evening light making her way toward the quartermasters tent perrin had sent their group of scouts through the gateway to cairhien theyd return the next morning perrin was still brooding about the whitecloaks over the last several days the two armies had exchanged several letters perrin trying to maneuver for a second more formal parley while the whitecloaks insisted on a battle faile had given perrin choice words about sneaking off to meet with the whitecloaks without her perrin was stalling as he let elyas and the aiel scout the whitecloaks to try to find a way to sneak their people out but it was unlikely to be an option hed succeeded back in the two rivers but there had been only a handful of captives then now there were hundreds perrin was not dealing well with his guilt well faile would talk with him shortly she continued through the camp passing the mayener section to her left with banners flying high i will have to deal with that one soon as well faile thought looking up at berelains banner the rumors about her and perrin were problematic shed suspected that berelain might try something in failes absence but taking him into her tent at night seemed particularly forward failes next steps would have to be taken with extreme care her husband his people and his allies were all balanced precariously faile found herself wishing she could ask her mother for advice that shocked her and she hesitated stopping on the worn pathway of trampled yellow grass and mud light faile thought look what has happened to me two years ago failethen called zarinehad run from her home in saldaea to become a hunter for the horn shed rebelled against her duties as the eldest and the training her mother had insisted she undergo she hadnt run because shed hated the work indeed shed proven adept at everything required of her so why had she gone in part for adventure but in partshe admitted to herself only nowbecause of all the assumptions in saldaea you always did what was expected of you nobody wondered if you would do your duty particularly if you were a relative of the queen herself and so shed left not because shed hated what she would become but because she had hated the fact that it had seemed so inevitable now here she was using all of the things her mother had insisted she learn it was nearly enough to make faile laugh she could tell a host of things about the camp from a mere glance theyd need to find some good leather for the cobblers soon water wasnt a problem as it had been raining light sprinkles often over the last few days but dry wood for campfires was an issue one group of refugeesa collection of former wetlander gaishain who watched perrins aiel with outright hostilitywould need attention as she walked she watched to make certain the camp had proper sanitation and that the soldiers were caring for themselves some men would show utmost concern for their horses then forget to eat anything properor at least healthy not to mention their habit of spending half the night gossiping by the campfires she shook her head and continued walking entering the supply ring where food wagons had been unloaded for the horde of cooks and serving maids the supply ring was almost a village itself with hundreds of people quickly wearing pathways in the muddy grass she passed a group of dirtyraced youths digging pits in the ground then a patch of women chattering and humming as they peeled potatoes children gathering the rinds and throwing them into the pits there werent many of those children but errins force had gathered a number of families from around the countryside whostarvinghad begged to join serving men ran baskets of peeled potatoes to cooking pots which were slowly being filled with water by young women making trips to the stream journeyman cooks prepared coals for roasting and older cooks were mixing spices into sauces that could be poured over other foods which was really the only way to give flavor to such mass quantities elderly womenthe few in the campshuffled past with bent backs and light wicker baskets bearing herbs clutched on thin arms their shawls rippling as they chatted with crackling voices soldiers hurried in and out carrying game boys between childhood and manhood gathered sticks for tinder she passed a small gaggle of these who had grown distracted capturing spiders it was a tempest of confusion and order coexisting like two sides of a coin strange how well faile fit in here looking back at herself only a few years before she was amazed to realize that she saw a spoiled selfcentered child leaving the borderlands to become a hunter for the horn shed abandoned duties home and family what had she been thinking she passed some women milling grain then walked around a fresh batch of wild scallions lying on a blanket beside them waiting to be made into soup she was glad shed left and met perrin but that didnt excuse her actions with a grimace she remembered forcing perrin to travel the ways in the darkness alone she didnt even recall what hed done to set her off though shed never admit that to him her mother had once called her spoiled and shed been right her mother had also insisted that faile learn to run the estates and all the while faile had dreamed of marrying a hunter for the horn and spending her life far away from armies and the boring duties of lords light bless you mother faile thought what would she or perrin have done without that training without her mothers teachings faile would have been useless administration of the entire camp would have rested on aravines shoulders capable though the woman was as perrins camp steward she couldnt have managed this all on her own nor should she have been expected to faile reached the quartermasters station a small pavilion at the very heart of the cooking pits the breeze brought an amalgamation of scents fat seared by flames potatoes boiling peppered sauces spiced with garlic the wet sticky scent of potato peelings being carried to the small herd or hogs theyd managed to bring out of maiden the quartermaster bavin rockshaw was a palefaced cairhienin with blond speckled through his graying brown hair like the fur on a mixedbreed dog he was spindly through the arms legs and chest yet had an almost perfectly round paunch he had apparently worked at j quartermastering as far back as the aiel war and was an experta master as practiced in overseeing supply operations as a master carpenter was at woodworking that of course meant that he was an expert at taking bribes when saw faile he smiled and bowed stiffly enough to be formal but without mentation im a simple soldier doing his duty that bow said lady faile he exclaimed waving over some of his serving men here to inspect the ledgers i assume yes bavin she said though she knew there would be nothing suspicious in them he was far too careful still she made a cursory motion of going through the records one of the men brought her a stool another a table upon which to place the ledgers and yet another a cup of tea she was impressed at how neatly the columns added up her mother had explained that often a quartermaster would make many messy notations referencing other pages or other ledgers separating different types of supplies into different books all to make it more difficult to track what was going on a leader who was befuddled by the notations would assume that the quartermaster must be doing his job there was none of that here whatever tricks of numbering bavin was using to obscure his thievery they were nothing short of magical and he was stealing or at least being creative in how he doled out his foodstuffs that was inevitable most quartermasters didnt really consider it thievery he was in charge of his supplies and that was that how odd it is faile said as she leafed through the ledger the strange twists of fate my lady bavin asked hmm oh it is nothing only that torven rikshans camp has received their meals each evening a good hour ahead of the other camps im certain thats just by chance bavin hesitated undoubtedly my lady she continued to leaf through the ledgers torven rikshan was a cairhienin lord and had been placed in charge of one of the twenty camps within the larger mass of refugees he had an usually large number of nobles in his particular camp aravine had brought this to failes attention she wasnt certain what torven had given to receive supplies for meals more quickly but it wouldnt do the other camps might feel that perrin was favoring one over another yes faile said laughing lightly merely coincidence these things happen in a camp so large why just the other day varkel tius was complaining to me that he had put in a requisition for canvas to repair torn tents but hasnt had his canvas for nearly a week now yet i know for a fact that soffi moraton ripped her tent during the stream crossing but had it repaired by that evening bavin was silent faile made no accusations her mother had cautioned that a good quartermaster was too valuable to toss into prison particularly when the next man was likely to be half as capable and equally corrupt failes duty was not to expose or embarrass bavin it was to make him worried enough that he kept himself in check perhaps you can do something about these irregularities bavin she said closing the ledger i loathe to burden you with silly matters but the problems must not reach my husbands ears you know how he is when enraged actually perrin was about as likely to hurt a man like bavin as faile was to flap her arms and fly away but the camp didnt see it that way they heard reports of perrins fury in battle along with her occasional arguments with himprovoked by faile so that they could have a proper discussionand assumed he had a terrible temper that was good so long as they also thought of him as honorable and kind protective of his people yet filled with rage at those who crossed him she rose from the stool handing the ledgers to one of the men curlyhaired and with ink stains on his fingers and jerkin she smiled at bavin then made het way out of the supply ring she noted with displeasure that the bunch opwild scallions beside the pathway had spoiled in the moments since shed seen them last their stalks melted and runny as if theyd been rotting in the sun for weeks these spoilings had begun only recently inside of camp but by reports it happened far more frequently out in the countryside it was hard to tell the hour with the sky so full of clouds but it seemed from the darkening horizon that her time to meet with perrin had come faile smiled her mother had warned her what would happen to her had told her what was expected of her and faile had worried that she would feel trapped by life but what deira hadnt mentioned was how fulfilling it would be perrin made the difference it was no trap at all to be caught with him perrin stood with one foot up on the stump of a felled tree facing north the hilltop let him look out over the plains toward the cliffs of garens wall rising like the knuckles of a slumbering giant he opened his mind questing out for wolves there were some in the distance almost too faint to feel wolves stayed away from large gatherings of men the camp spread out behind him watchfires fluttering at its boundaries this hillside was far enough away to be secluded but not so distant as to be solitary he wasnt certain why faile had asked him to meet her here at dusk shed smelled excited so he hadnt pried women liked their secrets he heard faile coming up the side of the hill stepping softly on the wet grass she was good at being quietnot nearly as good as elyas or one of the aiel but better than one might think of her but he could smell her cent soap with lavender she used that particular soap only on days she deemed special she stepped atop the hillside beautiful impressive she wore a violet vest over a long silk blouse of a lighter shade where had she gotten the clothing he hadnt seen her in this fine outfit before my husband she said stepping up to him he could faintly hear oth ers near the foot of the hillprobably cha faile shed left them behind you look concerned its my fault that gill and the others were captured faile he said my failures continue to mount its a wonder anyone follows me perrin she said laying a hand on his arm weve spoken of this you mustnt say such things why because ive never known you to be a liar she said with a softly chiding tone he looked at her it was growing dark though he could still make out details shed have a harder time seeing them why do you continue to fight this she asked you are a good leader perrin i wouldnt have given myself up for them he said she frowned what does that have to back in the two rivers perrin said turning away from her looking north again i was ready to do it when the whitecloaks had mats family and the luhhans id have given myself up this time i wouldnt have even when i spoke to their leader asking his price i knew i wouldnt give myself up youre becoming a better leader how can you say that im growing callous faile if you knew the things i did to get you back the things i would have done he fingered the hammer at his side the tooth or the claw young bull it matters not hed thrown away the axe but could he blame it for his brutality it was only a tool he could use the hammer to do the same terrible things its not callous faile said or selfish youre a lord now and you cant let it be known that capturing your subjects will undermine your rule do you think queen morgase would abdicate to tyrants who kidnapped her subjects no leader could rule that way your inability to stop evil men does not make you evil yourself i dont want this mantle faile i never have i know sometimes i wish id never left the two rivers i wish id let ran run off to his destiny leaving regular folk behind to live their lives he caught a scent of annoyance from her but if id stayed he added hastily id never have met you so im glad i left im just saying ill be glad when this is all through and finished and i can go back to someplace simple you think the two rivers will ever go back to being the way you remember it he hesitated she was rightwhen theyd gone it had already been showing signs of change refugees from across the mountains moving in the villages swelling now with so many men joining him in war getting ideas into their heads about having a lord i could find someplace else he said feeling stubborn there are other villages they wont all change and youd drag me off to one of these villages perrin aybara she said i what would happen if faile his beautiful faile were confined to a sleepy village he always insisted that he was only a blacksmith but was faile a blacksmiths wife i would never force you to do anything faile he said cupping her face in his hand he always felt awkward when touching her satin cheeks with his thick callused fingers id go if you really wanted me to she replied that was odd hed normally expect a snap from her at his awkward tongue but is it what you want is it really i dont know what i want he said frankly no he didnt want to drag faile off to a village maybe life as a blacksmith in a city somewhere if you wish it she repeated of course that would leave the two rivers without a lord theyd have to find someone else no they dont need a lord thats why i have to stop them treating me like one and you think theyd give up on the idea that quickly faile asked smelling amused after theyve seen how everyone else does it after the way they fawned over that fool luc after welcoming in all of those people from almoth plain who are used to lords what would the two rivers folk do if he stepped down as their lord in a sinking moment of realization he knew that faile was right surely theyd pick someone whod do a better job of it than me he thought maybe master alvere but could perrin trust that men like master alvere or tarn might down the position might they end up picking someone like old cenn buie would they have a choice if perrin stepped aside might some person who figured himself highborn seize power pont be a fool perrin aybara he thought almost anyone would be better than you still the thought of someone else taking controlsomeone else being lordfilled him with intense anxiety and a surprising amount of sadness now faile said stop your brooding i have grand intentions for this evening she clapped her hands loudly three times and movements began below soon servants crested the hillside perrin recognized them as people shed appropriated from among the refugees a group as loyal to her as cha faile they carried canvas which they spread on the ground then they covered that with a blanket and what was that he smelled coming up from below ham what is this faile he asked at first she said i assumed that you had something special planned for our shannahar i grew nervous when you didnt mention it however and so i asked it appears that you do not celebrate it in the two rivers odd though that is shannahar perrin asked scratching his head in the coming weeks faile said we will have been married one year this is our first shannahar our marriage celebration she folded her arms watching as her servants arranged a meal on the blanket in saldaea we celebrate the shannahar each year in the early summer it is a festival to mark another year together another year with neither husband nor wife fallen to the trollocs young couples are told to savor their first shannahar much as one savors the first taste of a succulent meal our marriage will only be new to us once the servants laid out a meal including several glass bowls with candles in them faile dismissed the servants with a smile and a wave and they retreated down the side of the hill faile had obviously taken care to make the meal look lavish the blanket was embroidered perhaps taken from shaido spoils the meal was served on silver plates and platters ham a bed of boiled barley and capers across the top there was even wine faile stepped closer to him i realize that there has been much this year that is not worth savoring maiden the prophet that harsh winter but if these things are the cost for being with you perrin then i would pay them freely a dozen times over if all were well we would spend this next month giving gifts to on another affirming our love celebrating our first summer as husband and wife i doubt we will have the month of ease that is our right but at least we should spend and enjoy this evening together i dont know if i can faile he said the whitecloaks the sky light the last battle itself is almost here the last battle faile how can i feast while my people are being held under threat of execution and while the world itself may die if the world itself is going to die faile said is this not the time when a man must take time to appreciate what he has before it is all taken perrin hesitated she laid a hand on his arm her touch so soft she hadnt raised her voice did she want him to yell it was so hard to tell when she wanted an argument and when she didnt maybe elyas would have advice for him please she said softly try to relax for one evening for me all right he said laying his hand on hers she led him to the blanket and they settled down side by side before the array of silver dishes faile lit more candles off of the lit ones the servants had left the night was chillythe clouds seemed to draw summer warmth away why do this outside perrin said and not in our tent i asked tarn what you do in the two rivers for shannahar she said and as i feared i learned that you dont celebrate it that is really quite backward you realizewell need to change the custom once things settle down regardless tam said that the closest they had was something he and his wife did once a year they would pack up a full mealas extravagant as they could affordand hike to a new place in the woods they would dine there and spend the day with one another she snuggled up against him our wedding was done in the two rivers fashion so i wished this day to be after that fashion as well he smiled despite his earlier objections his tension was easing the food smelled good and his stomach growled prompting faile to sit up and take his plate and hand it to him he dug in he tried to keep his manners but the food was excellent and it had been a long day he found himself ripping into the ham with ferocity though he tried to take care not to drip on the fancy blanket faile ate more slowly the scent of amusement mixing with that of her soap what perrin asked wiping his mouth she was lit only by the candles that the sun was fully down theres much of the wolf in you my husband he froze noticing that hed been licking his fingers he growled at self wiping them instead on a napkin as much as he liked wolves he woudnt invite them to the dinner table with him too much of the wolf in me he said you are what you are my husband and i happen to love what you are so that is well he continued to chew on his cut of the ham the night was quiet the servants having retreated far enough away that he couldnt smell or hear them likely faile had left orders that they werent to be disturbed and with the trees at the base of the hillside they wouldnt have to worry about being observed faile he said softy you need to know what i did while you were captive i did things i worried would turn me into someone you would no longer want it wasnt only the deal with the seanchan there were people in a city so habor that i cant stop thinking of people that maybe i should have helped and there was a shaido with his hand i heard about that it seems that you did what you had to id have gone much farther perrin admitted hating myself all the way you spoke of a lord being strong enough to resist letting himself be manipulated well ill never be that strong not if youre taken we shall have to make certain i dont get taken it could ruin me faile he said softly anything else i think i could handle but if you are used against me nothing will matter id do anything to protect you faile anything perhaps you should wrap me up in soft cloth then she said dryly and tuck me away in a locked room oddly her scent was not offended i wouldnt do that perrin said you know i wouldnt but this means i have a weakness a terrible one the type a leader cant have she snorted you think other leaders dont have weaknesses perrin every king or queen of saldaea has had their own nikiol dianatkhah was a drunkard despite being known as one of our greatest kings and belairah married and put her husband away four times her heart always did lead her to trouble jonasim had a son whose gambling ways nearly brought her house to ruin and lyonford couldnt keep his temper if challenged each and every one was a great monarch and all had their share of weaknesses perrin continued to chew on his food thoughtful in the borderlands faile said we have a saying a polished sword reflects the truth a man can claim to be diligent in his duties but if his sword isnt polished you know that hes been idle well your sword is bright my husband these last few weeks you keep saying that you led poorly during my captivity youd have me believe that you led the entire camp to ruin and dust but thats not true at all you kept them focused you inspired them maintained a strong presence and kept the air of a lord berelains behind some of that he said i half think the woman would have bathed me herself if id gone another day without im certain that wouldnt have been good for the rumors faile noted dryly faile i ill deal with berelain faile said her voice sounded dangerous thats one duty you neednt distract yourself with but ill deal with her faile said her voice more firm it was not wise to challenge her when she smelled that way not unless he wanted to start a full argument she softened taking another bite of barley when i said you were like a wolf my husband i wasnt talking about the way you eat i was talking about the way you give your attention you are driven given a problem to solve no matter how grand and you will see it done cant you understand thats a wonderful trait in a leader it is exactly what the two rivers will need assuming of course that you have a wife to care for some of the smaller issues she frowned i wish youd spoken to me about the banner before burning it it will be difficult to raise it again without looking foolish i dont want to raise it again perrin said thats why i had them burn it but why he took another bite of his ham pointedly not watching her she smelled curious almost desperately so i cant lead them he thought not until i know if i can master the wolf how could he explain explain that he feared the way it took control when he fought when he wanted something too badly he would not rid himself of the wolves they had become too much a part of him but where would he leave his people where would he leave faile if he lost himself to what was inside of him he again remembered a dirty creature once a man locked in a cagethere is nothing left in this one that remembers being a man my husband faile said resting a hand on his arm please she smelled of pain that twisted his heart about it has to do with those whitecloaks perrin said what perrin i thought i said it has to do perrin said firmly with what happened to me the first time i met with them and what id begun to discover in the days before faile frowned ive told you that i killed two whitecloaks he said before i met you yes settle back he said you need to know the whole story and so he told her hesitantly at first but the words soon grew easier he spoke of shadar logoth and of their group being scattered of egwene letting him take the lead perhaps the first time hed been forced to do that hed already told her of his meeting with elyas she knew much about perrin things that hed never told anyone else things hed never even spoken of with elyas she knew about the wolf she knew that he feared hed lose himself but she didnt know what he felt in battle she didnt know what it had felt like to kill those whitecloaks to taste their bloodeither in his own mouth or through his link with the wolves she didnt know what it had been like to be consumed by anger fear and desperation when shed been taken these were the things he haltingly explained he told her of the frenzy hed gone into when searching for her in the wolf dream he spoke of noam and what he feared would happen to him and of how it related to how he acted when he fought faile listened sitting quietly atop the hilltop arms wrapped around her legs lit by candlelight her scents were subdued perhaps he should have held some things back no woman wanted to know what a beast her husband became when he killed did she but now that he was speaking he wanted to be rid of his secrets he was tired of them each word spoken made him relax more it did what the meal touching though it had beenhadnt been able to in telling her of his struggles he felt some of his burden lift he finished by speaking of hopper he wasnt certain why hed saved the wolf for last hopper was part of much perrin had told beforethe whitecloaks the wolf dream but it felt right to reserve hopper until the end so he did as he finished he stared at the flame of one of the candles two of them had gone out leaving others still to flicker that wasnt dim light to his eyes he had trouble remembering what the days had been like when his senses had been as weak as an ordinary mans faile leaned against him wrapping his arm around her thank you she said he let out a deep sigh leaning back against the stump behind him feeling her warmth i want to tell you about maiden she said you dont have to he said just because i hush i was quiet while you spoke its my turn all right it should have been worrying for him to hear about maiden he lay with his back to the stump sky crackling with energy above the pattern itself in danger of unraveling while his wife spoke of being captured and beaten yet it was one of the most oddly relaxing things hed ever experienced the events in that city had been important to her maybe even good for her though he was angered at hearing how sevanna had trussed faile up naked and left her overnight someday hed hunt that woman down not today however today he had his wife in his arms and her strong voice was a comfort he should have realized she would have planned her own escape in fact listening to her careful preparation he began to feel a fool shed been worried that hed get himself killed trying to rescue her she didnt say it but he could infer it how well she knew him faile left some things out he didnt mind faile would be like a penned and caged animal without her secrets he got a good hint of what she was hiding though it was something to do with that brotherless who had captured her something about failes plans to trick the man and his friends into helping her escape perhaps shed felt a fondness for him and didnt wish perrin to regret killing him that wasnt necessary those brotherless had been with the shaido and they had attacked and killed men under perrins protection no act of kindness would redeem that they deserved their deaths that gave him pause the whitecloaks probably said very similar things about him but the whitecloaks had attacked first she finished it was very late now and perrin reached over to a bundle that failes servants had brought up pulling out a blanket well faile asked as he settled back putting his arm around her again im surprised that you didnt give me an earful for barreling in like a wild bull and stomping all over your plans that made her smell satisfied it wasnt the emotion hed expected but hed long ago stopped trying to decipher the ways of womens thought i almost brought the matter up tonight faile said so that we could have a proper argument and a proper reconciliation why didnt you i decided that this night should be done in the two rivers way and you think husbands and wives dont argue in the two rivers he asked amused well perhaps they do but you husband always seem uncomfortable when we yell im very glad youve begun to stand up for yourself as is proper but i have asked much from you to adapt to my ways i thought tonight i would try to adapt to yours those were words that he had never expected to hear from faile it seemed the most personal thing she could ever have given him embarrassingly he felt tears in his eyes and he pulled her tight now she said im not a docile sheep mind you i would never think that he said never she smelled satisfied im sorry i didnt give much thought to you escaping on your own perrin said i forgive you he looked down at her those beautiful dark eyes reflecting the candlelight does this mean we can have the reconciliation without the argument she smiled i will allow it this once and of course the servants have strict orders to ensure our solitude he kissed her it felt so very right and he knew that the worries hed hadand the awkwardness that had been between them since maiden were gone whether it had been something real or something he imagined it had passed he had faile back truly and completely chapter partings and a meeting the morning after the gholam attack mat woke from dreams rotten as last months eggs feeling stiff and aching he had spent the night sleeping in a hollow hed found beneath aludras supply wagon he had chosen the location by random chance using his dice he climbed out from under the wagon standing and rolling his shoulder feeling it pop bloody ashes one of the best things about having money was not having to sleep in ditches there were beggars who spent nights better than this the wagon smelled of sulphur and powders he was tempted to peek under the oiled tarp that stretched over the back of but there would be no point aludra and her powders were incomprehensible so long as the dragons performed mat did not mind not knowing how they worked well he did not mind it much not enough to risk irritating her she was not there at the wagon fortunately for mat she would complain at him again for not having gotten her a bellfounder she seemed to think him her own personal messenger boy an unruly one who refused to do his job properly most women had moments like that he walked through camp brushing bits of straw from his hair he almost went searching for lopin to have him draw a bath until he remembered that lopin was dead bloody ashes poor man thinking about poor lopin put mat in an even more dour mood as he iked toward where hed find some breakfast juilin found him first the short tairen thiefcatcher wore his flattopped conical hat and dark blue mat he said is it true youve given permission for the aes sedai to go back to the tower they didnt need my permission mat said wincing if the women heard it said that way they would tan his hide and make saddle leather from it im planning to give them horses though they have them already juilin said looking in the direction of the picket lines said you gave them permission mat sighed his stomach growled but food would have to wait he walked toward the picket lines he would need to make sure the aes sedai did not make off with his best stock ive been thinking i might go with them juilin said joining mat take thera to tar valon youre welcome to leave any time mat said i wont hold you here juilin was a good enough fellow a little stiff at times well very stiff juilin could make a whitecloak look relaxed he was not the type you wanted to take with you dicing he would spend the night scowling at everyone in the tavern and muttering about the crimes they had certainly committed but he was reliable and a good hand to have in a pinch i want to get back to tear juilin said but the seanchan would be so close and thera it worries her she doesnt much like the idea of tar valon either but we dont have many choices and the aes sedai promised that if i came with them theyd get me work in tar valon so this is parting then mat said stopping and turning to him for now juilin said he hesitated then held out his hand mat took it and shook and then the thiefcatcher was off to gather his things and his woman mat thought for a moment then changed his mind and headed for the cook tent juilin would slow the aes sedai probably and he wanted to fetch something a short time later he arrived at the picket lines fed and carrying a clothwrapped bundle under his arm the aes sedai had of course created an inordinately large caravan out of some of his best horses teslyn and joline also seemed to have decided they could commandeer some pack animals and some soldiers to do the loading mat sighed and walked into the mess checking over the horses joline sat on moonglow a mare of tairen stock that had belonged to one of the men mat had lost in the fighting to escape the seanchan the more reserved edesina had mounted firewisp and was glancing occasionally at two women who stood to the side darkskinned bethamin and pale yellowhaired seta were former suldam the seanchan women tried very hard to look aloof as the group gathered mat sauntered up to them highness seta said it is true youre going to allow these to roam free of you best to be rid of them mat said wincing at her choice of titles for him did they have to throw around such words that like they were wooden pennies anyway the two seanchan women had changed a great deal since beginning with the group but they still seemed to find it odd that mat did not wish to use the aes sedai as weapons do you want to go or do you want to stay we will go bethamin said firmly she was determined to learn it seemed yes seta said though i sometimes think it might be better to simply let us die as opposed to well what we are what we represent means that we are a danger to the empire mat nodded tuon is a suldam he said the two women looked down go with the aes sedai mat said ill give you your own horses so you dont have to rely on them learn to channel thatll be more use than dying maybe someday you two can convince tuon of the truth help me find a way to fix this without causing the empire to collapse the two women looked to him more firm and confident suddenly yes highness bethamin said it is a good purpose for us to have thank you highness seta actually got tears in her eyes light what did they think he had just promised them mat retreated before they could get any more odd ideas in their heads flaming women still he could not help feeling sorry for them learning that they could channel worrying they might be a danger to everyone around them thats bow rand felt mat thought poor fool as always the colors swirled when he thought of rand he tried not to do it too often and before he could banish those colors he caught a glimpse of rand shaving in a fine gilded mirror hanging in a beautiful bathing chamber mat gave some orders to get the suldam horses then he walked over toward the aes sedai thom had arrived and he strolled over light mat he said you look like you tangled with a briarstitch patch and came out sore mat raised a hand to his hair which was probably a real sight i lived the night and the aes sedai are leaving ive half a mind to dance a jig at that thorn snorted did you know those two were going to be here the suldam i figured no those two he pointed mat turned frowning as he found leilwin and bayle domon riding their possessions were rolled up on the backs of their horses leilwinthen known as egeaninhad once been a seanchan noblewoman but tuon had stripped her name away she wore a dress with divided skirts of muted gray her short dark hair had grown out and hung over her ears she climbed from her saddle and stalked in mats direction burn me mat said to thorn if i can be rid of her too ill almost start thinking that life has turned fair on me domon followed her as they approached he was her sojhin or could he still be sojhin now that she had no title well either way he was her husband the illianer was thick of girth and strong he was not too bad a fellow except when he was around leilwin which was always cauthon she said stepping up to him leilwin he replied youre leaving yes mat smiled he really was going to do that dance i always intended to make my way to the white tower she continued i set my mind there on the day i left ebou dar if the aes sedai are leaving i will go with them a ship is always wise to join a convoy when the right opportunity is presented too bad to see you go mat lied tipping his hat to her leilwin was as tough as a hundredyear oak stuck with bits of axe left over from the men foolish enough to try to chop it down if her horse threw a shoe on the road to tar valon she would likely sling the animal over her shoulder and carry it the rest of the way but she did not like mat for all he had done to save her skin maybe it was because he had not let her take charge or maybe because she had been forced act like his lover well he had not enjoyed that part either it had been like holding a sword by the blade and pretending that it did not sting though it had been fun to watch her squirm be well matrim cauthon leilwin said i dont envy the place youve put yourself in in some ways i think the winds that carry you may actually be rougher than the ones which have buffeted me recently she nodded to him then turned to go domon reached over laying a hand on mats arm you did do as you said by my aged grandmother you gave a bumpy ride of it but you did do as you said my thanks the two of them moved off mat shook his head waving to thom and strolling over to the aes sedai teslyn mat said edesina joline all well it is joline said good good mat said you have sufficient pack animals they will do master cauthon joline said then covering a wince she added thank you for giving them to us mat smiled broadly my but it was amusing to hear her trying to acr respectful she had obviously expected elayne to welcome her and the others with open arms not turn them away from the palace without an audience joline eyed mat lush lips pressed together i would liked to have tamed you cauthon she said ive still half a mind to return someday and see the job done properly ill wait breathlessly for that then he said taking the clothwrapped package from under his arm he handed it up to her what is this she asked not reaching for it mat shook the bundle parting gift he said where i come from you never let a traveler depart without giving her something for the road it would be rude reluctantly she accepted it and peeked inside she was obviously surprised to find that it contained a collection of about a dozen powdered sweetbuns thank you she said frowning im sending soldiers with you mat said theyll bring my horses back once you arrive in tar valon joline opened her mouth as if to complain but then closed it what argument could she make that will be acceptable cauthon teslyn said moving her black gelding closer ill give them orders to do as you say mat said turning to her so youll have people to command about and make set up your tents but theres a condition attached teslyn raised an eyebrow i want you to tell the amyrlin something he said if its egwene this should be easy but even if it isnt you tell her the white tower has something of mine and its nearly time that i reclaimed it i dont want to but what i want never seems to matter a whisker these days so ill be coming and i dont mean to be bloody turned away he smiled use that exact language testlyn to her credit chuckled softly ill see it done though i doubt rumors are true elaida would not have given up the amyrlin seat you might be surprised mat surely had been when he had discovered women calling egwene amyrlin he did not know what had hapned up at the white tower but he had a sinking feeling that the aes sedai had wrapped poor egwene up in their schemes so soundly that she would never escape he had half a mind to ride up there himself and see if he could get her out but he had other tasks egwene would have to see to herself for now she was a capable girl she could probably handle it without him for a while thorn stood to his side looking thoughtful he did not know for sure that mat had blown the hornat least mat had never told him he tried to forget about the bloody thing but thorn had probably guessed well i suppose you should be going mat said wheres setalle shell be staying here teslyn said she said that she wanted to keep you from making too many missteps she raised an eyebrow and joline and edesina nodded sagaciously they all assumed that setalle was a former runaway servant from the white tower perhaps having fled as a girl because of a misdeed well that meant he wouldnt be rid of the entire group still if he had to pick one to stay it would be mistress anan she would probably be wanting to find a way to meet up with her husband and family who had fled ebou dar by ship juilin walked up leading thera had that frightened wisp of a woman really been the panarch of tarabon mat had seen mice that were less timid mats soldiers brought out horses for the two of them all in all this expedition was costing him some forty animals and a file of soldiers but it would be worth it besides he intended to retrieve both men and horsesalong with information about what was really happening in tar valon he nodded to vanin the thickwaisted horse thief had not been too pleased when mat had ordered him to go along to tar valon and gather information mat had figured he would be ecstatic considering how he doted on the aes sedai well he would be even less happy when he found juilin was along vanin tended to step lightly around the thiefcatcher vanin mounted a bay gelding as far as the aes sedai knew he was a senior redarm and one of mats field scouts but nobody to be suspicious of we did not look very threatening except maybe as a danger to a bowl of boiled potatoes that might be why he was so good at what he did mat did not need any horses stolen but vanins talents could be applied to other tasks well mat said turning back to the aes sedai i wont keep you further then he stepped back avoiding looking at jolinewho had a predatory cast to her eyes that reminded him all too much of tylin teslyn waved and curiously edesina nodded to him in respect juilin had a wave for him and thorn and mat got a nod from leilwin the woman chewed rocks for breakfast and nails for supper but she was fair maybe he could talk to tuon get her reinstated or something dont be a fool he thought giving a wave to bayle domon first youll need to convince tuon not to make you dacovale he was half convinced she intended to see him as her servant husband or not thinking about that made him sweat around the collar before long they were making dust along the road thorn stepped up beside mat watching the riders sweetbuns tradition among us two rivers folk never heard of that tradition its very obscure ah i see and what did you do to those buns sprinklewort mat said itll turn her mouth blue for a week maybe two and she wont share the sweetbuns with anyone except maybe her warders joline is addicted to the things she must have eaten seven or eight bags worth since we got to caemlyn nice thorn said knuckling his mustache childish though im trying to get back to my basic roots mat said you know recapture some of my lost youth youre barely twenty winters old sure but i did a lot of living when i was younger come on mistress anan is staying and that gives me an idea you need a shave matrim cauthon mistress anan folded her arms as she regarded him he reached up touching his face lopin had always done that each morning the man got as sulky as a dog in the rain when mat did not let him do such things though lately mat had been growing out his beard to avoid notice it still itched like a weekold scab he had found setalle at the supply tents overseeing the midday mealsoldiers from the band hunkered down chopping vegetables and stewing beans with the furtive expression of men who had been given firm instructions setalle was not needed here the bands cooks had always been able to prepare meals without her but there was nothing a woman liked better than finding men who were relaxing then giving them orders besides setalle was a former innkeeper andremarkablya former aes sedai mat often found her supervising things that did not need supervising not for the first time he wished tuon were still traveling with him setalle had usually taken tuons side but staying with the daughter of the nine moons had often kept her busy nothing was more dangerous for the sanity of men than a woman with too much time on her hands setalle still wore clothing of the ebou dari style which mat found pleasant considering the plunging neckline that kind of outfit worked particularly well on a woman as buxom as setalle not that he noticed she had golden hoops in her ears a stately demeanor and gray in her hair the jeweled wedding knife worn around her neck seemed something of a warning the way it nestled in her cleavage not that mat noticed that either ive been growing the beard intentionally mat said to her statement i want to your coat is dirty she said nodding to a soldier who brought her some onions he had peeled he sheepishly poured them into a pot not looking at mat and your hair a mess you look like youve been in a brawl and its not yet noon im fine mat said ill clean up later you didnt go with the aes sedai each step toward tar valon would take me farther from where i need to be i need to send word to my husband when we parted i didnt suspect that id end up in andor of all places im thinking i might be getting access to someone who can make gateways here soon mat said and i he frowned as another group of soldiers approached carrying a few undersized quail theyd hunted the soldiers looked ashamed of the terrible catch setalle ordered them to pluck the birds without so much as a glance toward mat light he needed to get her out of his camp things would not be normal here until they were all gone dont look at me like that lord mat setalle said noram went into the city to see what kind of provisions he could find ive noted that without the cook himself here to prod the men meals dont get done at any reasonable speed not all of us like to take lunch when the sun is setting i didnt say a thing mat said keeping his voice even he nodded to the side can we talk for a moment setalle hesitated then nodded and stepped away from the others with him whats going on really she said softly you look like you slept under a hay pile i slept under a wagon actually and my tents stained with blood not really looking forward to going there to change clothing right now her gaze softened i understand your loss but thats no excuse to go around looking like youve been living in an alleyway youll need to hire another serving man mat scowled i never needed one in the first place i can take care of myself look i have a favor to ask of you i want you to watch after olver for a little while for what purpose that thing might come back mat said and it could try to hurt him besides im going to be leaving with thorn shortly i might be back i should be back but if i dont i well i would rather he not be left alone she studied him he would not be alone the men in camp seem to have a great deal of fondness for the child sure but i dont like the things theyre teaching him the boy needs better examples than that lot she seemed amused by that for some reason ive already begun instructing the child in letters i suppose i can watch after him for a time if need be great wonderful mat let out a relieved sigh women were always happy for a chance to educate a boy when he was young mat thought they assumed they could educate him out of becoming a man if they tried hard enough ill give you some money you can go into the city and find an inn ive been into the city setalle said every inn in the place seems packed to the walls already ill find a place for you mat promised just keep olver safe when the time comes and i have someone to make gateways ill have them send you to illian so you can find your husband a deal setalle said she hesitated glancing northward the others are gone then yes good riddance she nodded looking regretful maybe she had not been ordering his men about for lunch because she had been offended at seeing them relax maybe she had been looking for something to busy herself at im sorry mat said about whatever happened to you the past is gone she replied and i need to leave it be i shoal never have even asked to see the item you wear these last few weeks have made me forget myself mat nodded parting with her then went searching for olver and after that he really should get around to changing his coat and burn him he was going to shave too the men looking for him could bloody kill him if they wanted a slit throat would be better than this itching elayne strolled through the palaces sunrise garden this smaller garden had always been a favored location of her mothers set atop the roof of the laces eastern wing it was rimmed by an oval of white stonework with a larger curved wall at the back elayne had a full view of the city below in earlier years she had liked the lower gardens precisely because they were a retreat it was in those gardens that she had first met rand she pressed a hand to her belly though she felt enormous the pregnancy was only just beginning to show unfortunately shed had to commission an entirely new set of gowns she would probably have to do so again in the coming months what a bother elayne continued to walk the roof garden pink jumpups and white morningstars bloomed in planters the blossoms werent nearly as large as they should have been and already they were wilting the gardeners complained that nothing helped outside the city grass and weeds were dying in swaths and the patchwork quilt of fields and crops looked depressingly brown it is coming elayne thought she continued on her way walking a path made of springy grass manicured and kept short the gardeners efforts werent without some results the grass here was mostly green and the air smelled of the roses that wove their way up the sides of the wall those had brown spots on them but they had bloomed a tinkling stream ran through the middle of the garden lined in carefully placed river stones that stream ran only when she visited water had to be carried up to the cistern elayne paused at another vantage point a queen couldnt choose seclusion the way a daughterheir could birgitte walked up beside her she raided her arms across her redcoated chest eyeing elayne what elayne asked youre in full view birgitte said anyone down there with a bow and a good eye could throw the nation right back into a succession war elayne rolled her eyes im safe birgitte nothing will happen to me oh well i apologize birgitte said flatly the forsaken are loose and angry with you the black ajah are undoubtedly furious that youve capturned their agents and youve humiliated various nobles who tried to seize the throne from you obviously youre in no danger whatsoever ill run along and take lunch then you might as well elayne snapped because i am safe min had a viewing my babes will be born healthy min is never wrong birgitte min said your babies would be strong and healthy birgitte said not that you would be healthy when they arrived how else would they come ive seen people knocked in the head so hard that theyre never the same girl birgitte said some live for years but never speak another word and have to be fed broth and live with a bedpan you could lose an arm or two and still bear healthy children and what about the people around you give you no thought to the danger you could cause them i feel bad for vandene and sareitha elayne said and for those men who died to rescue me dont dare imply that i feel no responsibility for them but a queen must be willing to accept the burden of letting others die in her name we discussed this birgitte we decided that there was no way i could have known that chesmal and the others would arrive as they did we decided birgitte said through clenched teeth that there was no use arguing any further but i want you to keep in mind that any number of things could still go wrong they wont elayne said looking out over the city my children will be safe and that means i will be too we have until their birth birgitte let out an exasperated sigh foolish stubborn she trailed off as one of the nearby guardswomen waved to get her attention two of the kin stepped onto the roof elayne had asked them to come meet with her birgitte took up a position beside one of the short cherry trees her arms folded the two kinswomen wore unadorned dresses sumeko in yellow alise in blue alise was the shorter of the two with gray streaking her brown hair and she was weaker in the power so she hadnt slowed in aging as much as sumeko both women had grown more firm of step lately no further kinswomen had disappeared or been murdered careane had been behind the killings all along a member of the black hiding among them light but thinking of it made elayne s skin crawl your majesty alise said curtsying she spoke with a calm smooth voice and a faint taraboner accent your majesty sumeko said as well mimicking her companions curtsy the two were deferentialmore so to elayne than they were to other aes sedai these days nynaeve had given the kin in general a backbone in regards to the aes sedai and the white tower though alise hadnt ever struck elayne as needing it during the siege elayne had started to regard the kinswomens attitudes with annoyance recently however shed been wondering they had extremely useful to her how high would their newfound boldness lead elayne nodded to each of the kin in turn then gestured toward a trio of chairs that had been placed in the shade of the drooping cherry trees the three seated themselves the stream winding its contrived way past them to the left there was mint tea the other two took a cup each but were careful to add generous amounts of honey tea tasted terrible these days without it how are the kin elayne asked the two women glanced at each other blast elayne was being too formal with them they knew something was up we are well your majesty alise said the fear seems to be leaving most of the women at least those who had enough sense to feel it in the first place i suppose those who didnt were the ones who went off on their own and found themselves dead it is good not to have to spend so much time healing either sumeko noted it was becoming very fatiguing so many wounded day after day she grimaced alise was made of stouter material she sipped her tea face mild not calm and frozen like an aes sedai thoughtful and warm yet reserved that was an advantage these women had that the aes sedai did notthey could be regarded without as much suspicion as they were not tied directly to the white tower but they didnt have its authority either you can sense that i have something to ask of you elayne said meeting alises eyes we can sumeko asked sounding surprised perhaps elayne had given her too much credit alise nodded in a matronly way youve asked much of us while weve been here your majesty no more than i felt you had a right to ask so far i have tried to welcome you in caemlyn elayne said as i realize you can never return home not while the seanchan rule ebou dar that is true alise agreed but one can hardly call ebou dar our home it was merely a place where we found ourselves less a home more a necessity many of us rotated in and out of the city anyway to avoid notice have you considered where you will stay now were going to tar valon sumeko said quickly nynaeve sedai said im certain there will be a place for some of you there elayne interjected those who wish to become aes sedai egwene will be eager to give a second chance to any kin who wish to try again for the shawl but what of the rest of you we spoke of this alise said carefully eyes narrowing we will b come associated with the tower a place for aes sedai to retire surely you will not move to tar valon though what good would th kin be as a place to retire from aes sedai politics if they are so near th white tower we had assumed we would remain here alise said that was my assumption as well elayne said carefully but assump tions are weak i wish to give you promises instead after all if you were to remain in caemlyn i see no reason to not offer you support directly from the crown at what cost alise asked sumeko was watching with a confused frown not much of one elayne said really not a cost at all an occasional favor as you have done the crown in the past the garden fell still faint calls from the city below rose up into the air and the branches shivered in the wind dropping a few brown leaves between elayne and the kin that sounds dangerous alise said taking a sip of her tea surely youre not suggesting that we set up a rival white tower here in caemlyn nothing of the sort elayne said quickly i am aes sedai myself after all and egwene has spoken of letting the kin continue as they have before so long as they accept her authority im not certain we want to continue as we have before alise said the white tower left us to live our lives in terror that we would be discovered but all the while they were using us the more we consider that the less amused that makes us speak for yourself alise sumeko said i intend to be tested and return to the tower i will join the yellow mark my words perhaps but they wont have me alise said im too weak in the power i wont accept some halfway measure forced to scrape and bow every time a sister comes along and wants me to wash her clothing but i wont stop channeling either i wont give it up egwene sedai has spoken of letting the kin continue but if we do would be we be able to work the one power openly i assume you would be able to elayne said much of this was egwenes idea she certainly wouldnt send aes sedai to you to retire if they were to be forbidden to channel no the days of women outside the tower channeling in secret have passed the windfinders the aiel wise ones have proven that times must change perhaps alise said but giving our services to the crown of andor is a very different matter we would make certain not to compete with the towers interests flavne said and you would accept the aymrlins authority so what is the roblem aes sedai provide service to monarchs across the land alise sipped her tea your offer has merit but it depends on the nature of the favors required by the crown of andor i would only ask two things of you elayne said traveling and healing you need not enter our conflicts you need not be part of our politics simply agree to heal my people who are sick and to assign a group of women each day to create gateways when the crown wishes that still sounds an awful lot like your own white tower alise said sumeko was frowning no no elayne said the white tower means authority politics you would be something else entirely imagine a place in caemlyn where any person can come to receive healing free of charge imagine a city free of disease imagine a world where food can travel instantly to those who need it and a queen who can send troops wherever she needs alise said whose soldiers can fight one day then be free of wounds the next a queen who can earn a tidy profit by charging merchants for access to her gateways she took a sip of her tea yes elayne admitted though she wasnt certain how she was going to convince egwene to let her do that part of it we will want half alise said half of anything you charge for traveling or healing healing is free elayne said firmly for anyone who comes regardless or station people are treated in order of the severity of their ailment not in order of their rank i could agree to this alise said sumeko turned to her eyes wide you cannot speak for us you yourself threw in my face the knitting circle having dissolved now that we have left ebou dar besides by the rulei speak only for myself sumeko alise said and those who would me the kin as we knew them are no more we were dominated by our need to remain secret and that is gone now sumeko grew silent you mean to join the aes sedai my friend alise said laying a hand on her arm but they will not have me nor will i have them i need sorn thing else and others will as well but to tie yourselves to the crown of andor we tie ourselves to the white tower alise said but live in caemlyn both have their benefits we arent strong enough to stand on our own andor is as good a place as any it has the favor of the white tower and the favor of the dragon reborn mostly it is here and so are we you can reorganize elayne said growing excited the rule can be crafted anew you can decide to let kin marry now if you wish i think that would be for the best why alise asked because it will tie them down elayne explained that will make them less of a threat to the white tower it will help differentiate you it is something that few women in the white tower do and it gives you something to make the kin more attractive as an option alise nodded thoughtful sumeko seemed to be coming around elayne was sorry to admit that she wouldnt miss the woman when she left elayne intended to push them to restructure how they chose leaders it would be much more convenient if she could work with one like alise as opposed to whomever happened to be the oldest among them i still worry about the amyrlin alise said aes sedai do not charge for services what will she say if we start doing so i will speak with egwene elayne repeated im certain i can convince her that the kin and andor are no threat to her hopefully there was a chance for something incredible in the kin a chance for andor to have constant and inexpensive access to gateways that would put her on nearly equal ground with the seanchan she spoke with the women for a time longer making certain they felt she was giving them due attention eventually she dismissed them but found herself lingering in the garden standing between two planters holding bluebells their clusters of tiny vaselike blossoms drooping and wiggling in the breeze she tried not to look at the planter beside them which was empty the bluebells there had flowered in the color of blood and had actually bled something red when cut the gardeners had pulled them out the seanchan would come for andor eventually by then rands armies would likely be weakened and broken from the fighting their leader possibly dead again it made her heart twist to consider that but she couldnt shy away from the truth andor would be a prize to the seanchan the mines and rich lands ot her realm would tempt them as would the proximity to tar valon beyond that she suspected that those who claimed to be artur hawkwings successors would never be satisfied until they held all that had once belonged to their ancestor elayne looked out over her nation her nation full of those who trusted in her to protect and defend them many who had supported her claim to the throne had had little faith in her but she was their best option their only option she would show them the wisdom of their choice securing the kin would be one step sooner or later the seanchan would be able to travel all they needed to do was capture one woman who knew the weaves and soon each and every damane with the requisite strength would be able to create the portals elayne needed access to them as well what she didnt have however were channelers to use in battle she knew she couldnt ask this of the kin theyd never agree to it nor would egwene nor would elayne herself forcing a woman to use the power as a weapon would make her no better than the seanchan themselves unfortunately elayne knew full well the destruction women using the one power could cause shed been bound in a wagon while birgitte led the attack on the black ajah who had kidnapped her here in caemlyn but shed seen its aftermath hundreds dead hundreds more wounded dozens burned away smoking twisted corpses she needed something an edge against the seanchan something to balance their channelers in combat the only thing she could think of was the black tower it was on andors soil shed told them that she considered them part of her nation but so far shed gone no further than sending inspection parties what would happen to them if rand died dared she try to claim them dared she wait for someone else to chapter the strength of this place perrin ran through the darkness trails of watery mist brushed his face and condensed in his beard his mind was foggy distant where was he going what was he doing why was he running he roared and charged ripping through the veiled darkness and bursting into open air he took a deep breath and landed on the top of a steep hill covered with short patchy grass with a ring of trees at its base the sky rumbled and churned with clouds like a boiling pot of tar he was in the wolf dream his body slumbered in the real world on this hilltop with faile he smiled breathing deeply his problems had not diminished in fact with the whitecloak ultimatum they seemed magnified but all was well with faile that simple fact changed so much with her at his side he could do anything he leaped down from the hillside and crossed the open area where his army camped they had been here long enough that signs had appeared in the wolf dream tents reflected the waking world though their flaps were in a different position each time he looked at them cookfire pits in the ground ruts in the pathways occasional bits of refuse or discarded tools these would pop into existence then vanish he moved quickly through the camp each step taking him ten paces once he might have found the lack of people in the camp eerie but he was accustomed to the wolf dream now this was natural perrin approached the statue at the side of the camp then looked up at the agepocked stone overgrown with lichen of black orange and green the statue must have been posed oddly if it had fallen in such a way it almost looked as if it had been created this wayan enormous arm bursting from the loam perrin turned to the southeast toward where the whitecloak camp would be found he had to deal with them he was increasingly certain nfident eventhat he could not continue until he had confronted these shadows from the past there was one way to deal with them for certain a careful trap using the ashaman and wise ones and perrin could hit the children so hard that they shattered he could maybe even destroy them permanently as a group he had the means the opportunity and the motivation no more fear in the land no more whitecloak mock trials he leaped forward soaring thirty feet and falling lightly to the ground then he took off running southeast along the road he found the whitecloak camp in a forested hollow thousands of white tents set up in tight rings the tents of some ten thousand children along with another ten thousand mercenaries and other soldiers balwer estimated that this was the bulk of the remaining children though he had been unclear on how hed gotten that knowledge hopefully the dusty mans hatred of the whitecloaks wasnt clouding his judgment perrin moved among the tents looking to see if he could discover anything that elyas and the aiel had not it was unlikely but he figured it was worth an attempt while he was here besides he wanted to see the place with his own eyes he lifted flaps moved between groupings of tents inspecting the place and getting a feel for it and its occupants the camp was arranged in a very orderly manner the insides were less stable than the tents themselves but what he saw was also kept orderly the whitecloaks liked things neat tidy and carefully folded and they liked to pretend the entire world could be polished up and cleaned the same way people defined and explained in one or two words perrin shook his head making his way to the lord captain commanders tent the organization of the tents led him to it easily at the center ring it wasnt much larger than the other tents and perrin ducked inside trying to see if he could find anything of use it was furnished simply with a bedthat was in a different position each time perrin looked at it along with a table holding objects that vanished and appeared at random perrin stepped up to it picking up something that appeared there a signet ring he didnt recognize the signet a winged dagger but memorised it just before the ring vanished from his fingers too transient to stay long in the wolf dream though hed met with the whitecloak leader and corresponded with the man he didnt know much about the mans past perhaps this would help he searched through the tent a while longer finding nothing of use then went to the large tent where gaul had explained that many of the captives were being kept here he saw master gills hat appear for a moment then vanish satisfied perrin walked back out of the tent as he did so he found something bothering him shouldnt he have tried something like this when faile was kidnapped hed sent numerous scouts to maiden light hed had to restrain himself from marching off to find faile on his own but hed never tried visiting the place in the wolf dream perhaps it would have been useless but he hadnt considered the possibility and that troubled him he froze passing a cart parked beside one of the whitecloak tents the back was open and a grizzled silver wolf lay there watching him i do let my attention grow too narrow hopper perrin said when i get consumed by a goal it can make me careless that can be dangerous as in battle when concentrating on the adversary in front of you can expose you to the archer on the side hopper cracked his mouth open smiling after the way of wolves he hopped from the cart perrin could sense other wolves nearbythe others of the pack he had run with before oak dancer sparks and boundless all right he said to hopper im ready to learn hopper sat down on his haunches regarding perrin follow the wolf sent then vanished perrin cursed looking about where had the wolf gone he moved through the camp searching but couldnt sense hopper anywhere he reached out with his mind nothing young bull suddenly hopper was behind him follow he vanished again perrin growled then moved about the camp in a flash when he didnr find the wolf he shifted to the field of grain where hed met hopper last time the wolf wasnt there perrin stood among the blowing grain frustrated hopper found him a few minutes later the wolf smelled dissatisfied follow he sent i dont know how perrin said hopper i dont know where youre going the wolf sat down he sent an image of a wolf pup joining others of the pack the pup watched his elders and did what they did im not a wolf hopper perrin said i dont learn the way you do you must explain to me what you want me to do follow here the wolf sent an image of oddly emonds field then he perrin followed appearing on a familiar green a group of buildings lined it which felt wrong emonds field should have been a little vilnot a town with a stone wall and a road running past the mayors inn paved with stones much had changed in the short time he had been away why have we come here perrin asked disturbingly the wolfhead banner still flew on the pole above the green it could have been a trick of the wolf dream but he doubted it he knew all too well how eagerly the people of the two rivers flew the standard of perrin goldeneyes men are strange hopper sent perrin turned to the old wolf men think strange thoughts hopper said we do not try to understand them why does the stag flee the sparrow fly the tree grow they do that is all very well perrin said i cannot teach a sparrow to hunt hopper continued and a sparrow does not teach a wolf to fly but here you can fly perrin said yes and i was not taught i know hoppers scent was full of emotion and confusion wolves all remembered everything that one of their kind knew hopper was frustrated because he wanted to teach perrin but wasnt accustomed to doing things in the way of people please perrin said try to explain to me what you mean you always tell me im here too strongly its dangerous you say why you slumber hopper said the other you you cannot stay here too long you must always remember that you are unnatural here this is not your den hopper turned toward the houses around them this is your den the den of your sire this place remember it it will keep you from being lost this was how your kind once did it you understand it wasnt a question though it was something of a plea hopper wasnt certain how to explain further i can try perrin thought interpreting the sending as best he could but hopper was wrong this place wasnt his home perrins home was with faile he needed to remember that somehow to keep himself from getting drawn into the wolf dream too strongly i have seen your she in your mind young bull hopper sent cocking his head she is like a hive of bees with sweet honey and sharp stings hoppers image of faile was that of a very confusing female wolf one who would playfully nip at his nose one moment then growl at him the next refusing to share her meat perrin smiled the memory is part hopper sent but the other part is you you must stay as young bull a wolfs reflection in the water shimmering and growing indistinct as ripples crossed it i dont understand the strength of this place hopper sent an image of a wolf carved of stone is the strength of you the wolf thought for a moment stand remain be you with that the wolf stood and backed up as if preparing to run at perrin confused perrin imagined himself as he was holding that image in his head as strongly as he could hopper ran and jumped at him slamming his body into perrin hed done this before somehow forcing perrin out of the wolf dream this time however perrin was set and waiting instinctively perrin pushed back the wolf dream wavered around him but then grew firm again hopper rebounded off him though the heavy wolf should have knocked perrin to the ground hopper shook his head as if dazed good he sent pleased good you learn again perrin steadied himself just in time to get slammed by hopper a second time perrin growled but held steady here hopper sent giving an image of the field of grain hopper vanished and perrin followed as soon as he appeared the wolf slammed into him mind and body perrin fell to the ground this time everything wavering and shimmering he felt himself being pushed away forced out of the wolf dream and into his ordinary dreams no he thought holding to an image of himself kneeling among those fields of grain he was there he imagined it solid and real he smelled the oats the humid air alive with the scents of dirt and fallen leaves the landscape coalesced he panted kneeling on the ground but he was still in the wolf dream good hopper sent you learn quickly theres no other option perrin said climbing to his feet the last hunt comes hopper agreed sending an image of the whitecloak camp perrin followed bracing himself no attack came he looked around for the wolf something slammed into his mind there was no motion only the mental attack it wasnt as strong as before but it was unexpected perrin barly managed to fight it off hopper fell from the air landing gracefully on the ground always be ready the wolf sent always but especially when you move an image of a careful wolf testing the air before moving out into an open pasture i understand but do not come too strongly hopper chided immediately perrin forced himself to remember faile and the place where he slept his home he faded slightly his skin didnt grow translucent and the wolf dream stayed the same but he felt more exposed good hopper sent always ready but never holding on too strong like carrying a pup in your jaws thats not going to be an easy balance perrin said hopper gave a slightly confused scent of course it was difficult perrin smiled what now running hopper sent then more practice the wolf dashed away zipping in a blur of gray and silver off toward the road perrin followed he sensed determination from hoppera scent that was oddly similar to the way tarn smelled when training the refugees to fight that made perrin smile they ran down the road and perrin practiced the balance of not being in the dream too strongly yet being ready to solidify his sense of self at any moment occasionally hopper would attack him trying to throw him from the wolf dream they continued until hoppersuddenlystopped running perrin took a few extra steps surging ahead of the wolf before stopping there was something in front of him a translucent violet wall that cut directly through the roadway it extended up into the sky and distantly to both the right and the left hopper perrin asked what is this wrongness hopper sent it should not be here the wolf smelled angry perrin stepped forward and raised a hand toward the surface but hesitated it looked like glass hed never seen anything like this in the wolf dream might it be like the bubbles of evil he looked up at the sky the wall flashed suddenly and was gone perrin blinked stumbling back he glanced at hopper the wolf sat on his haunches staring at the place where the wall had been come young bull the wolf finally sent standing we will practice in another place he loped away perrin looked back down the road whatever the wall had been it had left no visible sign of its existence troubled perrin followed after hopper burn me where are those archers rodel ituralde climbed up to the ton of the hillside i wanted them formed up on the forward towers an hour ago to relieve the crossbowmen before him the battle clanged and screamed and grunted and thumped and roared a band of trollocs had surged across the river crossing on ford rafts or a crude floating bridge fashioned from log rafts trollocs hated crossing water it took a lot to get them over which was why this fortification was so useful the hillside sloped directly down to the only ford of reasonable size in leagues to the north trollocs boiled through a pass out of the blight and ran right into the river arinelle when they could be forced across they faced the hillside which had been dug with trenches piled with bulwarks and set with archer towers at the top there was no way to reach the city of maradon from the blight except by passing over this hill it was an ideal position for holding back a much larger force but even the best fortifications could be overrun particularly when your men were tired from weeks of fighting the trollocs had crossed and fought their way up the slope under a hail of arrows falling into the trenches having difficulty surmounting the high bulwarks the hillside had a flat area at the top where ituralde had his command position in the upper camp he called orders as he looked down on the woven mass of trenches bulwarks and towers the trollocs were dying to pikemen behind one of the bulwarks ituralde watched until the last trollocan enormous ramfaced beastroared and died with three pikes in its gut it looked as if another surge was coming the myrddraal driving another mass of trollocs through the pass enough bodies had fallen in the river that it was clogged for the moment running red the carcasses providing a footing for those running up behind archers ituralde bellowed where are those bloody a company of archers finally ran past some of the reserves hed held back most of them had the coppery skin of domani though there were a few stray taraboners mixed in they carried a wide variety of bows narrow domani longbows serpentine saldaean shortbows scavenged from guard posts or villages even a few tall two rivers longbows lidrin ituralde called the young hardeyed officer hurried across the hillside to him lidrins brown uniform was wrinkled and dirty at the knees not because he was undisciplined but because there were tims when his men needed him more than his laundry did go with those archers to the towers ituralde said those trollocs are going to try another push i do not want another fist breaking through to the top hear me if they seize our position and use it against us im going to have a rotten morning lidrin didnt smile at the comment as he once might have he didnt smile much at all anymore usually only when he got to kill a trolloc he saluted turning to jog after the archers ituralde turned looked down the backside of the hill the lower camp was set up there in the shadow of the steep hillside this hill had been a natural formation once but the saldaeans had built it up over the years with one long slope extending toward the river and a steeper one on the opposite side in the lower camp his troops could sleep and eat and their supplies could be protected all sheltered from enemy arrows by the steep hillside upon which ituralde now stood both of his camps upper and lower were patchwork things some of the tents had been purchased from saldaean villages some were of domani make and dozens had been brought in by gateway from all over the land a large number of them were enormous cairhienin things with striped patterns they kept the rain off his men and that was enough the saldaeans certainly knew how to build fortifications if only ituralde had been able to persuade them to leave their hiding place in the city of maradon and come help now ituralde said where in he cut off as something darkened the sky he barely had time to curse and duck away as a group of large objects rained down arcing high to fall on the upper camp eliciting howls of pain and confusion those werent boulders they were corpses the hulking bodies of dead trollocs the shadowspawn army had finally set up their trebuchets a part of ituralde was impressed that hed driven them to it the siege equipment had undoubtedly been brought to assault maradon which was a little to the south setting up the trebuchets across the ford to assault ituraldes lines instead not only would slow the shadowspawn but would expose their trebuchets to his counterfire he hadnt expected them to hurl carcasses he cursed as the sky darkened again more bodies falling knocking down tents crushing soldiers healers ituralde bellowed where are those ashaman hed pushed the ashaman hard since this siege had begun to the brink of exhaustion now he held them back using them only when trolloc assaults got too close to the upper camp sir a young messenger with dirt under his fingernails scrambled up from front lines his domani face was ashen and he was still too young to grow a proper mustache captain finsas reports the shadowspawn army moving trebuchets into range there are sixteen by his count let captain finsas know that his bloody timing could be better ituralde growled im sorry my lord they rolled them down through the pass before we figured out what was going on the initial volley hit our watchpost lord finsas himself was wounded ituralde nodded rajabi was arriving to take command of the upper camp and organize the wounded below a lot of bodies had hit the lower camp too the trebuchets could get the height and range to launch over the hill and fall down on his men in their previously sheltered area hed have to pull the lower camp back farther across the plain toward maradon which would delay response times bloody ashes never used to swear this much ituralde thought it was that boy the dragon reborn rand althor had given ituralde promises some spoken some implied promises to protect arad doman from the seanchan promises that ituralde could live rather than die trapped by the seanchan promises to give him something to do something important something vital something impossible hold back the shadow fight until help arrived the sky darkened again and ituralde ducked into the command pavilion which had a wooden roof as a precaution against siege weapons hed feared sprayshot of smaller rocks not carcasses the men scattered to help pull the wounded down to the relative safety of the lower camp and from there across the plain toward maradon rajabi led the effort the lumbering man had a neck as thick as a tenyeargrown ash and arms nearly as wide he now hobbled as he walked his left leg hurt in the fighting and amputated beneath the knee aes sedai had healed him as best he could and he walked on a peg hed refused to retire through gateways with the badly injured and ituralde hadnt forced him you didnt throw away a good officer because of one wound a young officer winced as a bloated carcass thumped against the top of the pavilion the officerzhelldidnt have the coppery skin of a domani though he wore a very domani mustache and a beauty mark on his cheek in the shape of an arrow they could not hold against trollocs here for much longer not with the numbers they were fielding ituralde would have to fall back point k point farther into saldaea farther toward arad doman odd how he was always retreating toward his homeland first from the south now from the northeast arad doman would be crushed between the seanchan and the troliocs youd better keep your word boy he couldnt retreat into maradon unfortunately the saldaeans there had made it quite clear they considered ituraldeand the dragon rebornto be invaders bloody fools at least he had a chance to destroy those siege engines another body hit the top of the command pavilion but the roof held from the stinkand in some cases splashof those deceased trollocs theyd not chosen the newly dead for this assault confident that his officers were seeing to their dutiesnow was not the time to interfereituralde clasped his hands behind him seeing him soldiers both inside and out of the pavilion stood a little straighter the best of plans lasted only until the first arrow hit but a determined unyielding commander could bring order to chaos by the way he held himself overhead the storm boiled clouds of silver and black like a blackened pot hanging above a cook fire bits of steel shining through at the edges of the crusted soot it was unnatural let his men see that he did not fear it even when it hailed corpses upon them wounded were carried away and men in the lower camp began to break it down preparing to move it farther back he kept his archers and crossbowmen firing pikemen ready along the bulwarks he had a sizable cavalry but couldnt use them here those trebuchets if left alone would wear his men down with boulders and sprayshotbut ituralde intended to see them burned first using an ashaman or a strike force with flaming arrows through a gateway if only i could retreat into maradon but the saldaean lord there wouldnt let him in if ituralde fell back to the city hed get smashed against those walls by the trollocs bloody bloody fools what kind of idiots denied men refuge when an army of shadowspawn was knocking on their gates i want damage assessments ituralde said to lieutenant nils prepare the archers for an attack on those siege engines and bring two of the ashaman who are on duty tell captain creedin to watch that trolloc assault across the ford theyll redouble their efforts following this barrage as theyll presume us disordered the young man nodded and hastened off as rajabi limped into the pavilion rubbing his broad chin you guessed right again about those trebuchets they did set them up to attack us i try to always guess right ituralde said when i dont we lose rajabi grunted overhead that storm boiled in the distance ituralde could hear trollocs calling war drums beating men shouting somethings wrong ituralde said this whole bloody war is wrong rajabi said we shouldnt be here it should be the saldaeans their whole army not only the few horsemen the lord dragon gave us more than that ituralde said scanning the sky why carcasses rajabi to demoralize us it was a notunheardof tactic but the first volleys why not use stones when theyd do the most damage and then move to bodies once surprise had been expended the trollocs hadnt a mind for tactics but the fades they could be crafty hed learned that firsthand as ituralde stared at the sky another massive volley fell as if spawned by the dark clouds light where had they gotten that many trebuchets enough to throw hundreds of dead bodies there are sixteen by his count the boy had said not nearly enough were some of those carcasses falling too evenly it hit him like a burst of frozen rain those clever bloody monsters archers ituralde screamed archers watch the skies those arent bodies it was too late as he yelled the draghkar unfurled their wings well over half of the carcasses in this volley were living shadowspawn hiding among the falling bodies after the first draghkar attack on his army a few days back hed left archers on permanent rotation watching the skies day and night but the archers didnt have orders to fire on falling bodies ituralde continued to bellow as he leaped out of the pavilion and whipped his sword from its scabbard the upper camp became chaos as draghkar dropped amid the soldiers a large number of them fell around the command pavilion their toolarge black eyes shining drawing men toward them with their sweet songs ituralde screamed as loud as he could filling his ears with the sound of his own voice one of the beasts came for him but his yell prevented him from hearing its croon it looked surprisedas surprised as something so inhuman could lookas he stumbled toward it pretending to be drawn then struck an expert thrust through its neck dark blood dribbled down across milky white skin as ituralde yanked his blade free still screaming he saw rajabi stumble and fall to the ground as one of the shadowspawn leaped on him ituralde couldnt go to himhe was confronted by another of the monsters himself in a blessed moment he noticed balls of fire striking down draghkar in the airthe ashaman but at the same time in the distance he heard the war drums grow louder as hed predicted the churning force of trollocs would be striking across the ford with as much strength as they ever had light but sometimes he hated being right youd better keep your promise to send me help boy ituralde thought as he fought the second draghkar his screaming growing hoarse light but youd better faile strode through perrins camp the air ringing with chattering voices grunts of exertion and calls of men giving orders perrin had sent one last request to the whitecloaks for parley and there had been no reply yet faile felt refreshed shed spent the entire night nuzzled against perrin atop their hill shed brought plenty of bedding and blankets in some ways the grassy hilltop had been more comfortable than their tent the scouts had returned from cairhien this morning their report would come soon for now faile had bathed and eaten it was time to do something about berelain she crossed the trampled grass toward the mayener section of camp feeling her anger rise berelain had gone too far perrin claimed that the rumors came from berelains maids not the woman herself but faile saw the truth the first was a master of manipulating and controlling rumor that was one of the best ways to rule from a position of relative weakness the first did so in mayene and she did the same here in camp where faile was the stronger party as perrins wife a pair of winged guards stood at the entrance to the mayener section their breastplates painted crimson winged helmets shaped like pots and extending down the backs of their necks they stood up taller as faile neared holding lances that were mostly ornamental pennons flapping with the golden hawk in flight stenciled on their blue lengths faile had to crane to meet their eyes escort me to your lady she ordered the guards nodded one holding up a gauntleted hand and waving for two other men from inside the camp to take up the watch we were told to expect you the guard told faile in a deep voice faile raised an eyebrow today no the first simply said that should you come you were to be obeyed of course im to be obeyed this is my husbands camp the guards did not argue with her though they probably disagreed berelain had been sent to accompany perrin but he had not been given express command over her or her troops faile followed the men the ground was by a miracle actually starting to dry out faile had told perrin that she wasnt bothered by the rumors but she was frustrated by berelains boldness that woman faile thought how dare sheno no faile couldnt continue down that path a good shouting match would make her feel better but it would reinforce the rumors what else would people surmise if they saw her stalk to the firsts tent then scream at her faile had to be calm that would be difficult the mayener camp was arranged with lines of men radiating from a central tent like spokes on a wheel the winged guard didnt have tents those were with master gillbut there was a very orderly arrangement to the groupings they almost seemed too level the folded blankets the piles of lances the horse poles and the periodic firepits berelains central pavilion was lavender and maroonsalvage from maiden faile maintained her composure as the two towering guards led her up to the tent one knocked on the post outside for permission to enter berelains tranquil voice responded and the guard pushed back the entrance flap for faile as she moved to enter rustling inside made her step back and annoura came out the aes sedai nodded to faile the overlapping braids around her face swinging she seemed displeased she hadnt regained her mistresss favor yet faile took a deep breath then stepped into the pavilion it was cool inside the floor was covered with a maroon and green rug of a twisting ivy pattern though the pavilion looked empty without berelains usual travel furniture she did have a pair of sturdy oak chairs and a light table from maiden the first rose lady faile she said calmly today she wore the diadem of mayene the thin crown had a simple grandeur about it unornamented save for the golden hawk taking flight as if leaping toward the sunlight streaming in patches through the tent ceiling flaps had been removed there to let in the light the firsts dress was gold and green a very simple belt at her waist the neckline plunging faile sat in one of the chairs this conversation was dangerous it could lead to disaster but it had to be done i trust you are well berelain said the rains of the last few days have not been overly taxing the rains have been dreadful berelain faile said but im not here to talk about them berelain pursed perfect lips light but the woman was beautiful faile felt downright dingy by comparison her nose too large her bosom too small her voice wasnt nearly as melodic as berelains why had the creator made people as perfect as berelain was it mockery of the rest of them but perrin didnt love berelain he loved faile remember that very well berelain said i assumed this discussion would come let me promise you that the rumors are absolutely false nothing inappropriate happened between myself and your husband he has told me that already faile said and i trust his word over yours this made berelain frown she was a master of political interactions possessing a skill and subtlety that faile envied despite her youth berelain had kept her tiny citystate free from the much larger and powerful tear faile could only guess how much juggling political doubledealing and sheer cleverness that must have required so why have you come to me berelain asked sitting down if your heart is at ease then there is no problem we both know that whether or not you slept with my husband is not an issue here faile said and berelains eyes widened it isnt what happened but what is presumed that angers me rumors can be found in any place where people are gathered berelain said particularly where men gossip such strong persistent rumors are unlikely to have happened without encouragement faile said now everyone in the campincluding the refugees sworn to meassumes that you bedded my husband while i was away this not only makes me look like a fool but casts a shadow upon perrins honor he cannot lead if people take him for the type of man who will run to the arms of another woman the moment his wife is away other rulers have overcome such rumors berelain said and for many of them the rumors werent unfounded monarchies survive infidelity perhaps in illian or tear faile said but saldaea expects better of its monarchs as do the people of the two rivers perrin is not like other rulers the way his men look at him rips him apart inside i think you underestimate him berelain said he will overcome and he will learn to use rumor for his gain that will make him stronger as a man and a ruler faile studied the woman you dont understand him at all do you berelain reacted as if shed been slapped pulling back she obviously didnt like the bluntness of this conversation that might give faile some slight advantage i understand men lady faile berelain said coldly and your husband is no exception since you have decided to be candid i will return in kind you were clever to take aybara when you did welding saldaea to the dragon reborn but do not think that he will remain yours without contest faile took a deep breath it was time to make her play perrins reputation has been severely damaged by what you have done my lady first for my own dishonor i might have been able to forgive you but not for his i dont see what can be done i do faile said and im pretty certain one of us is going to have to die berelain remained impassive excuse me in the borderlands if a woman finds that another has been bedding her husband she is given the option of knife combat that was true though the tradition was an old one rarely observed any longer the only way to clear my name is for you and me to fight what would that prove if nothing else if you were dead it would stop anyone from thinking that you are still sleeping with my husband behind my back are you actually threatening me in my own tent this is not a threat faile said remaining firm light she hoped this went the right way this is a challenge berelain studied her eyes calculating i will make a public statement i will publicly chastise my maids for their rumors and will tell the camp that nothing happened do you really think that would stop the rumors you didnt object to them before my return that is seen as proof and of course now you would be expected to act as if nothing happened you cant be serious about this challenge in regards to my husbands honor berelain i am always serious she met the womans eyes and saw concern there berelain didnt want to fight her and of course faile didnt want to fight berelain and not just because she wasnt certain if she could win or not though she had always wanted to get revenge on the first for that time when berelain had taken her knife from her i will make the challenge formally this evening before the entire camp faile said keeping her voice even you will have one day to respond or leave i will not be a party to this foolishness you already are faile said rising this is what you set in motion the moment you let those rumors begin faile turned to walk from the tent she had to work hard to hide her nervousness had berelain seen how her brow prickled with sweat faile felt as if she walked on the very edge of a sword should word of this challenge get to perrin he would be furious she had to hope thatlady faile berelain said from behind the firsts voice was edged with concern surely we can come to another accommodation do not force this faile stopped heart thumping she turned back the first looked genuinely worried yes she believed that faile was bloodthirsty enough to make this challenge i want you out of perrins life berelain faile said i will have that one way or another you wish me to leave berelain asked the tasks the lord dragon gave me are finished i suppose i could take my men and march another direction no faile didnt want her to go the disappearance of her troops would be a blow in the face of that looming whitecloak army and perrin would have need of the winged guard again faile suspected no faile said leaving will do nothing for the rumors berelain it will do as much as killing me would the woman said dryly if we fight and you somehow managed to kill me all that would be said is that you discovered your husbands infidelity and became enraged i fail to see how that would help your position it would only encourage the rumors you see my problem then faile said letting her exasperation show through there seems to be no way to be rid of these rumors berelain studied her the woman had once promised she would take perrin had all but vowed it she seemed to have backed off on that in part recently and her eyes showed hints of worry she realizes that she let this go too far faile thought understanding or course berelain hadnt expected faile to return from maiden that was why shed made such a bold move now she realized shed overextended herself and she legitimately thought faile unhinged enough to duel her in public i never wanted this berelain faile said walking back into the tent and neither did perrin your attentions are an annoyance to us both your husband did little to dissuade me berelain said arms folded during your absence there were points where he directly encouraged me you understand him so little berelain it was amazing how the man could be so blind while being so clever in other ways so you claim berelain said you have two choices right now berelain faile said stepping up to her you can fight me and one of us will die youre right that wouldnt nd the rumors but it would end your chances at perrin either youd be dead or youd be the woman who killed his wife your other choice faile said meeting berelains eyes is to come up with a way to destroy these rumors once and for all you caused this mess you will fix it and there was her gamble faile couldnt think of a way out of the situation but berelain was much more accomplished in this regard than she was so faile came prepared to manipulate berelain into thinking she was ready to do something unreasonable then let the womans impressive political acumen attack the situation would it work faile met berelains eyes and allowed herself to feel her anger her outrage at what had happened she was being beaten frozen and humiliated by their common enemy and during that berelain had the gall to do something like this she held the firsts eyes no faile did not have as much political experience as berelain but she had something the woman didnt she loved perrin deeply truly she would do anything to keep him from being hurt the first studied her very well she said so be it be proud of yourself faile it is rare that i take myself off a prize i have long desired you havent said how we could get rid of the rumors there may be a method berelain said but it will be distasteful faile raised an eyebrow we will need to be seen as friends berelain explained fighting being at odds this will fuel the rumors but if we are seen spending time with one another it will disarm them that mixed with a formal renunciation on my part of the rumors will likely be enough faile sat down in the chair she had been using earlier friends she detested this woman it would have to be a believable act berelain said rising and walking over to the serving stand at the corner of the tent she poured herself some chilled wine only that would work youll find another man as well faile said someone you can give your attentions to for a time at least to prove that you are not intere in perrin berelain raised the cup yes she said i suspect that would help too can you put on such an act faile ni bashere taybara you believed i was ready to kill you over this didnt you faile thought i promise it berelain paused winecup halfway to her lips then she smiled and drank we shall see then she said lowering the cup what comes of this chapter talk of dragons mat tugged on a sturdy brown coat the buttons were brass but other than that it was free of ornamentation made of a thick wool it had a few holes from arrows that really should have killed him one of the holes had a bloodstain around it but that had mostly been washed out it was a nice coat he would have paid good coin for a coat like this one when he lived back in the two rivers he rubbed his face looking in the mirror of his new tent he had shaved off that bloody beard finally how did perrin manage that bloody itching the man must have sandpaper for skin well mat would find another way to disguise himself when needed he had nicked himself a few times while shaving but it was not as if he had forgotten how to take care of himself he did not need a manservant to do what he could manage on his own nodding to himself he pulled on his hat and grabbed his ashandarei from the corner of the tent the ravens on the blade seemed to perch excitedly in anticipation of battles to come bloody right you do mat said resting the ashandarei on his shoulder as he walked out or the tent he grabbed his pack and slung it over his other shoulder starting tonight he would be spending nights in the city he strode through camp nodding to a group of passing redarms he had doubled the watch he was worried about the gholam but also about the many military camps in the area half were mercenaries half were the retainers of this minor lord or that coming to pay respects to the queen suspiciously arriving after the righting was done no doubt each and every one was professing his heartfelt allegiance to elayne explaining that his men supported her all along their words probably fell a little flat since mat had it on good authority from three separate drunks in taverns that elayne had used traveling extensively in recruiting her defense it was easier to feign a delayed arrival when you were responding to a written message mat mat mat stopped on the pathway outside his tent as olver came racing up the boy had taken to wearing a red band around his arm much as the redarms did but he still wore his brown trousers and coat he was carrying his rolledup cloth for snakes and foxes under one arm and a pack slung over the other setalle stood in the near distance along with lussin and edder two redarms that mat had assigned to watch over her and the boy theyd be departing for the city soon mat olver said panting youre leaving i dont have time to play with you now olver mat said lowering his ashandarei to the crook of his arm i have to go meet with a queen i know olver said i figured that since were both going to town we could ride together and plan i have some ideas about how to defeat the snakes and the foxes were going to show them mat burn me but we bloody will who taught you that language mat he said this is important we have to plan we havent talked about what were going to do silently mat cursed himself for discussing the quest to rescue moiraine where olver could hear the boy was not going to take it well when he was left behind i need to think about what im going to say to the queen mat said rubbing his chin but i guess youre right planning is important why dont you go tell noal about your ideas i already did olver said and thorn too and talmanes talmanes he was not going with them into the tower light how much had olver been spreading the news around olver mat said squatting down to be on eye level with the boy you need to keep quieter we dont want too many people knowing what were doing i didnt tell nobody we dont trust mat olver said dont worry most were redarms great mat thought what would the soldiers think of their commander planning to go off and fight a bunch of creatures from childrens stories hopefully they would see olvers comments as the fancies of a young boy just be careful mat said ill come stop by your inn tomorrow and can play a game then and talk about it all right olver nodded all right mat but blood and bloody ashes he turned and walked away and stop swearing mat called after him then shook his head bloody soldiers would have olver corrupted by the time he was twelve mat continued on his way leaning his spear on his shoulder again he found thorn and talmanes mounted at the front of the camp along with a force of fifty redarms thorn wore an extravagant winered coat and trousers gold work at the arms with a shirt bearing white lace at the cuffs and a silken cravat tied at the neck the buttons were of gleaming gold his mustaches had been trimmed and neatly combed the entire outfit was new including the black cloak its inner lining of gold mat froze in place how had the man so perfectly transformed from an old scamp of a gleeman into a royal courtier light i see from your reaction that the presentation is effective thorn said blood and bloody ashes mat exclaimed what happened did you take ill from a bad sausage at breakfast thorn whipped his cloak back revealing that he had his harp out and at his side he looked like a courtbard i figured that ifafter all of these yearsi was going to make an appearance in caemlyn i should look the part no wonder youve been singing for coin every day mat said the people in those taverns have way too much money talmanes raised an eyebrowas good as a grin from that man at times he seemed so dour as to make thunderclouds feel cheerful he also wore a fine outfit his of deep cobalt and silver mat felt at his cuffs he could have used some lace if lopin had been here he would have set out the proper outfit without mat even asking a little lace was good for a man made him look presentable is that what youre wearing to visit the queen mat talmanes asked of course it is the words left his mouth before he had a chance to think about them its a good coat he walked over to take pips reins good for sparring in maybe talmanes said elayne is the queen of andor now mat thorn said and queens are a particular lot you should show her respect i am showing her bloody respect mat said handing his spear to one of the soldiers then climbing into the saddle he took the spear back then turned pips so he could regard thorn this is a good enough coat for a farmer youre not a farmer anymore mat talmanes said i am too mat said stubbornly but musenge called you thorn began he was mistaken mat said just because a man marries someone doesnt mean he suddenly becomes bloody nobility thorn and talmanes exchanged a look mat thorn said thats actually exactly how it works its pretty much one of the only ways to become nobility thats the way we do it here maybe mat said but tuon is from seanchan who knows what they do there we all know how strange they can be we cant know anything until we talk to her thorn frowned im certain from things she said that we cant know anything until we talk to tuon mat repeated louder this time until then im mat none of this prince of whatever nonsense thorn looked confused but talmanes lips turned ever so slightly up at the side burn that man mat was inclined to think his solemn nature was all an act was he secretly laughing inside well mat talmanes said you never have made any sense so why should we expect you to now onward then to meet the queen of andor certain you dont want to roll in the mud first ill be fine mat said dryly pulling his hat down as a soldier tied his pack to the back of his saddle he kicked pips into motion and the procession began the nowfamiliar ride to caemlyn mat spent most of the time going over his plan in his head he had aludras papers tucked into a leather folder and they included her demands every bellfounder in caemlyn large quantities or bronze and iron and powders worth thousands of crowns and she claimed that was the minimum of what she needed how under the light was mat going to get bloody elayne trakand to give him all that he would have to do a lot of smiling but elayne had proven resistant to his smiles before and queens were not like ordinary folk most women they would smile back or they would scowl at you so you knew where you stood elayne seemed the type to smile at you then toss you in prison all the same for once it would be nice if his luck could see him off somewhere enjoypipe and a game of dice with a pretty serving girl on his knee and no beyond his next throw instead he was married to a seanchan high blood and was off to beg the queen of andor for her help how did he get these situations sometimes he thought that the creator must be like talmanes straight of face but secretly having a grand time laughing at mat his procession passed numerous camps on the open plains around caemlyn all mercenaries were required to stay at least a league away but the forces of the lords could camp closer that put mat in a rough place there was always tension between sellswords and loyal armsmen and with the mercenaries so far from caemlyn fights were common the band was right in the middle of it he did some quick figuring based on the trails of campfire smoke he saw twisting into the air there were at least ten thousand mercenaries in the area did elayne know what a bubbling kettle she was brewing here too much heat and the whole bloody thing would boil over mats procession drew attention he had one of the men flying the banner of the band of the red hand and his men were developing a reputation by mats count they were the largest single groupmercenary or lords forceoutside caemlyns walls they were as organized and disciplined as a regular army and were under the leadership of a personal friend of the dragon reborn his men could not help bragging about that though mat would much rather that they had kept quiet they passed groups of men waiting by the side of the road curious to catch a glimpse of lord mat he kept his eyes forward if they had expected some fop in a rich coat then they would be disappointed though perhaps he could have chosen a better coat this one was stiff and the collar itched of course more than a few seemed to think talmanes was lord mat from the way they pointed probably because of how he was dressed bloody ashes this conversation with elayne was going to be tough but mat had a hidden card one he hoped would be enough to get her to look past the expense of aludras proposal though he was more afraid she would see what he was doing and want to take part in it and when a woman wanted to be part of something that meant she wanted to be in charge they approached the gate in caemlyns whitegray walls passing the growing outer city the soldiers waved him on mat gave them a tip of the hat and thom gave a flourishing wave to the small crowd gathered here they cheered great just bloody great the march through the new city was uneventful save for more crowds watching would someone recognize his face from those drawings mat wanted to get off the main thoroughfares but caemlyns narrow streets were a twisting mess a force of fifty horsemen was too large to move tfirough those streets they eventually passed through the brilliant white walls of the inner city where the roads were wider the ogierbuilt buildings less cramped and the population thinner here they passed more groups of armed men including guardsmen in white and red mat could make their camp out ahead covering the gray paving stones of the courtyard with their tents and horselines the caemlyn palace was like another little city within the city inside the city it had a low fortified wall and while its peaks and spires rose into the air it had more of the look of a war bunker than the sun palace did odd how he had never noticed that when he was younger if caemlyn fell this palace could hold on its own they needed more barracks though within that wall this camping out in the courtyard was ridiculous mat took talmanes thorn and a force of ten redarms as an escort a tall man in a burnished breastplate three golden knots on the shoulder of his cloak waited at the palace entrance he was a young man but the way he stoodrelaxed yet poised hand on the pommel of his sword indicated he was a practiced soldier too bad he had such a pretty face a life in the military would probably end up wrecking that the man nodded to mat thorn and talmanes lord cauthon he asked mat just mat the man raised an eyebrow but said nothing my name is charlz guybon ill lead you to her majesty she had sent guybon himself to escort mat he was highranking secondincommand of the armies that was unexpected was elayne afraid of him or was she was honoring him maybe guybon had wanted to see mat for himself she would not honor mat not after making him wait so long to get an audience a fine greeting for an old friend his suspicions were confirmed when guybon did not lead them to the grand hall but down to a quiet area of the palace ive heard much about you master cauthon guybon said he seemed like one of those stiff soldiers solid but maybe a little too solidlike a bow without enough spring to it from who mat asked elayne mostly rumors around the city people like to talk about you they do mat thought i didnt do half of what they say he grumbled and the other half wasnt my bloody fault guybon laughed what of the story of you hanging from a tree for nine days didnt happen mat said resisting the urge to tug at the scarf around his neck nine days where did that come from he had not even hung for nine bloody minutes nine seconds had been too long they also say guybon continued that you never lose at dice or at love and that your spear never misses its target wish those second two were true burn me but i wish they were but you do always win at dice near enough mat said tugging down the brim of his hat but dont spread that one or ill never find a game they say you slew one of the forsaken guybon noted not true mat said where had that one come from and the stories of you dueling the king of the aiel invaders in a battle of honor did you really win the dragon reborn the loyalty of the aiel bloody ashes mat said i killed couladin but it didnt happen in any kind of duel i ran into him on the battlefield and one of us had to die it wasnt bloody well going to be me interesting guybon said i thought that one might be true at least its one of the few that could have happened unlike he trailed off what mat said they passed an intersection of halls where servants grouped watching him and the other pass and whispering among themselves guybon looked hesitant im sure youve heard doubtful burn him what was next had the members of the band been spreading these rumors even they did not know about some of those things well theres this rumor that says you stepped into deaths domain to challenge him and demand answers to your questions guybon said looking more embarrassed and that he gave you that spear you hold and foretold to you your own death mat felt a chill that one was close enough to the truth to be frightening silly i know guybon said sure mat said silly he tried to laugh but it came out as a cough guybon regarded him curiously light mat realized he thinks im dodging the question only rumors of course mat said quickly too quickly maybe blood and bloody ashes guybon nodded looking thoughtful mat wanted to change the topic but he did not trust himself to open his bloody mouth he could see that more and more palace servants had stopped to watch the procession he felt like cursing some more at thar but then noticed that many of them seemed focused on thorn thorn had been courtbard right here in caemlyn he did not talk about it but mat knew he had suffered a fallingout with the queen thorn had been in virtual exile ever since coming to caemlyn only when pressed morgase was dead now so this was thorn returning from his exile it seemed that was probably why he had dressed so finely mat looked down at his coat again burn me i should have worn something nicer guybon led them to a carved wooden door bearing the roaring lion of andor he knocked softly received the call to enter then gestured mat toward the door the queen will receive you in her sitting room thorn youre with me mat said talmanes you watch the soldiers the nobleman looked crestfallen but elayne was undoubtedly going to embarrass mat and he did not want talmanes there to see ill introduce you later mat promised bloody noblemen they thought every second thing was an affront to their honor mat would have been happy to wait outside mat stepped up to the door taking a deep breath he had fought in dozens of skirmishes and battles without growing nervous now his hands were shaking why did he feel as if he were walking directly into an ambush without a scrap of armor on elayne as queen burn him but this was going to hurt he opened the door and strode in his eyes found elayne immediately she sat beside a hearth holding a cup of what appeared to be milk she looked radiant in a gown of deep red and gold beautiful full red lips that mat would not have minded kissing if he had not been a married man her redgold hair seemed to shimmer in the hearthlight and her cheeks were full of color she seemed to have gained a little weight best not to mention that or should he sometimes women got angry when you mentioned that they looked different and sometimes they got angry if you did not notice she was a pretty thing not as pretty as tuon of course elayne was far too pale and too tall and had too much hair it was distracting still she was pretty seemed a waste as a queen she would have made an excellent serving girl ah well somebody had to be queen mat glanced at birgitte who was the only other one in the room she looked the same always did with that golden braid and high boots like the hero from the bloody stories which was exactly what she was it was good to see her again she was one woman he knew who would not snap at him for speaking the truth thorn stepped in beside him and mat cleared his throat she would expected him to be formal well he was not going to bow or scrape and elayne leaped out of her chair she ran across the room as birgitte closed the door thorn im so glad that youre all right elayne grabbed him in an embrace hello dear one thorn said fondly i hear youve done well for yourself and for andor elayne was crying mat pulled off his hat befuddled sure thorn and elayne had been close but elayne was queen now elayne turned toward mat its good to see you mat do not think that the crown has forgotten your service to me bringing thorn back to andor is another debt we owe you well um mat said it really wasnt anything you know elayne burn me youre queen hows that feel elayne laughed finally releasing thom such a way with words you have mat im not going to bow to you or anything he warned or bother with that your majesty nonsense i wouldnt expect it elayne said unless were in public of course i mean i have to keep up appearances for the people i suppose thats true mat agreed it did make sense he held out a hand to birgitte but she chuckled and gave him a hug slapping him on the back like an old pal meeting for a mug of ale and well perhaps that was what they were without the ale he could have used some ale come sit elayne said gesturing toward the chairs by the fire im sorry to make you wait so long mat its nothing he said youre busy its embarrassing she said one of my stewards lumped you with the mercenary groups its so hard to keep track of them all if you wish ill give you leave to camp closer to the city theres not room inside the walls for the band im afraid that wont be needed mat said taking one of the seats letting us move closer is kind enough thank you thom sat and birgitte preferred to stand though she did join them by the hearth leaning back against the stones you look well elayne thorn said is everything going well with the child children elayne corrected there will be twins and yes everything is well save for me having to be poked and prodded at nearly every opportunity wait mat said what he glanced again at elaynes stomach thom rolled his eyes dont you ever listen when youre in the city gambling i listen mat muttered usually he looked accusingly at elayne does rand know about this she laughed i should hope he isnt too surprised burn me mat said hes the father the father of my children is a matter of some speculation in the city elayne said solemnly and the crown prefers there to be speculation for the time but enough about me thom you have to tell me everything how did you escape ebou dar forget ebou dar birgitte snapped hows olver did you find him we did thom said and he is well though i fear the lad is destined for life as a professional soldier not a bad life birgitte said eh mat there are worse he said still trying to get his legs underneath him how had becoming queen made elayne less highandmighty had he missed something she actually seemed agreeable now well that was unfair there were times when she had been agreeable before they had merely been mixed between times when she had been ordering mat around he found himself smiling as thom related the details of their escape and the capture of tuon followed by their travels with master lucas menagerie drawn from the quiver of a storyteller the tale sounded a whole lot more impressive than it had been to live mat almost thought himself a hero listening to thom right before thom got to the part about tuons marriage words however mat coughed and cut in and we beat the seanchan fled into murandy and eventually found an aes sedai to get us here through a gateway by the way have you seen verin lately no elayne said thom eyed mat with amusement blast mat said well there went his chance to use her for a gateway to the tower of ghenjei he would worry about that later he took the leather envelope from his belt then opened it taking out aludras papers elayne he said i need to talk to you yes you mentioned bellfounders in your letter what trouble have you gotten yourself into matrim cauthon thats not fair at all he said spreading out the sheets im not the one who gets into trouble if i youre not going to mention my getting captured in the stone of tear again are you she asked with a roll of her eyes he stopped of course not that happened ages ago i barely remember she laughed the pretty sound ringing in the room he felt himself blushing anyway im not in trouble i just need some resources what kind of resources elayne asked growing curious as he spread out the papers on the table next to her chair birgitte leaned down well mat said rubbing his chin there are three bellfounders in the city ill need those and were going to need some powders theyre listed on this page and well need a little bit of metal he winced and handed her one of aludras lists elayne read the page then blinked are you mad sometimes i think i might be he said but burn me i think this will be worth the cost what is it elayne asked as birgitte looked over one of the sheets then handed it to elayne aludra calls them dragons mat said thorn says you knew her yes i did elayne said well these are launching tubes like the ones for her fireworks only theyre made of metal and theyre big and instead of launching nightflowers they launch these headsized chunks of iron why would you want to launch chunks of iron up into the air elayne said frown deepening you dont birgitte said eyes opening wide you launch them at someone elses army mat nodded aludra claims that one of these dragons could launch an iron ball as far as a mile mothers milk in a cup birgitte said you cant be serious she is mat said and i believe her you should see what shes created already and she claims these will be her masterpiece look she shows here the dragons firing on a city wall from a mile away with fifty dragons and two hundred and fifty solders she could knock down a wall like the one around caemlyn in a few hours elayne looked pale did she believe him would she be angry at him for wasting her time i know that wont be of much use in the last battle mat said quicly trollocs dont have walls but look here i had her design a spreading shot fire it on a line of trollocs from four hundred paces and one of these dragons will do the work of fifty bowmen burn me elayne but were going to be at a disadvantage the shadow can always toss more trollocs at us than we have soldiers and the bloody things are twice as hard to kill as a man we need an advantage i remember he cut himself off he had been about to say he remembered the trolloc wars which would not have been a good idea a man could start some embarrassing rumors that way look he said i know this sounds outrageous but you have to give it a chance she looked up at him and was she crying again what had he done mat i could kiss you she declared this is exactly what i needed mat blinked what birgitte chuckled first norry now mat youll have to watch yourself elayne rand will be jealous elayne snorted looking down at the plans the bellfounders arent going to like this most of the craftsmen were looking forward to getting back to daily work following the siege oh i dont know about that elayne birgitte said ive known a craftsman or two in my time to a person they complain about royal privilege during war but as long as the crown compensates them theyre secretly happy steady work is always appreciated besides something like this will make them curious well have to keep it secret elayne said so youll do it mat asked surprised he had not needed his secret bribe to distract her well need proof of one working first of course elayne said but if these devices these dragons work half as well as aludra claims well id be a fool not to put every man on them we can thats right generous of you mat said scratching his head elayne hesitated generous building these for the band for the band mat these will be for andor here now mat said these are my plans and my resources elayne said she sat up straight suddenly becoming more poised surely you see that the crown could offer a more stable and useful control for the deployment of these weapons to the side thorn was grinning what are you so happy about mat demanded nothing thorn said you do your mother proud elayne thank you thorn she said favoring him with a smile whose side are you on mat said everyones thorn said thats not a bloody side mat said then looked back to elayne i put a lot of effort and thought into getting these plans out of aludra ive nothing inst andor but i dont trust anyone with these weapons who isnt me and if the band were part of andor elayne asked she really did sound like a queen all of a sudden the band is beholden to nobody mat said that is admirable mat elayne said but it makes you mercenaries i think that the band deserves something more something better with official backing you would have access to resources and authority we could give you a commission in andor with your own command structure it was actually tempting just a little but it did not matter he did not think elayne would be happy to have him in her realm once she knew of his relationship with the seanchan he meant to return to tuon eventually somehow if only to work out what she really felt about him he had no intention of giving the seanchan access to these dragons but he did not fancy giving them to andor either unfortunately he had to admit that there was no way he was going to have andor build them without giving the weapons to the nation too i dont want a commission for the band mat said were free men and thats how we like it elayne looked troubled but id be willing to split the dragons with you mat said some for us some for you what if elayne said i built all of the dragons and owned all of thembut promised that only the band could use them no other forces would have access to them that would be kind of you mat said suspicious though no offense it would be better for me if the noble houses didnt have these at least not at first they will spread eventually weapons always do i build them and promise to give them to the band no commission just a contract hiring you for a long term you can go at any time but if you do you leave the dragons behind mat frowned feels like youre wrapping a chain around my neck elayne im only suggesting reasonable solutions the day you become reasonable is the day i eat my hat mat said no offense elayne raised an eyebrow at him yes she had become a queen just like that i want the right to keep a few of these dragons mat said if we leave onequarter to us threequarters to you but well take your contract and while were in your employ only we use them as you said her frown deepened burn him but she had grasped the power of those dragons quickly he could not let her hesitate now they needed the dragons to go into production immediately and he was not about to let the chance of having them pass the band by sighing to himself mat reached up and undid the strap at the back of his neck then pulled the familiar foxhead medallion out of his shirt the second he removed it he felt more naked than if he had stripped bare he set it on the table elayne glanced at it and he could see a flash of desire in her eyes what is that for its a sweetener mat said leaning forward elbows on knees you get it for one day if you agree to start production on a prototype dragon this evening i dont care what you do with the medallionstudy it write a bloody book about it wear it about but you return it tomorrow your word on it birgitte whistled slowly elayne had wanted to get her hands on that medallion the moment she discovered he had it of course so had every other bloody aes sedai that mat had met i get the band in at least a oneyear contract elayne said renewable well pay you whatever you were earning in murandy how did she know about that you can cancel she continued as long as you provide a months warningbut i keep four dragons out of five and any men who wish to join the andoran military must be given the chance i want one out of four mat said and a new serving man a what elayne said a serving man mat said you know to take care of my clothing youd do a better job of picking than i would elayne looked at his coat then up at his hair that she said ill give you regardless of how the other negotiations go one out of four mat said i get the medallion for three days he shivered three days with the gholan in town she would have him dead it was already a gamble to give it to her for a day but he could not think of anything else he could offer what do you even think you can do with the thing he asked copy it elayne said absently if im lucky really i wont know until i study it mat suddenly had the horrifying image of every aes sedai in the world earing one of those medallions he shared a look with thorn who seemed equally surprised to hear this but what did that matter mat could not channel before he had worried thatif she studied itelayne might figure a way to touch him with the one power when he was wearing it but if she just wanted to copy it well he found himself relieved and intrigued theres been something ive been meaning to mention elayne he said the gholam is here in town its been killing people elayne remained calm but he could tell from the way she was even more formal when she spoke that the news worried her then i will be certain to return the medallion to you on time he grimaced all right he said three days very well she said i want the band to start immediately ill be traveling to cairhien soon and i have a feeling they would be a better support force there than the queens guard so that was what this was about elayne was moving on the sun throne well that seemed a good use for the men at least until mat needed them better than letting them sit around getting lazy and picking fights with sellswords i agree to that mat said but elayne the band has to be free to fight in the last battle however rand wants and aludra has to supervise the dragons i have a feeling that shell insist that she remain with you if the band breaks off from andor i have no issues with that elayne said smiling i figured you wouldnt but just so were clear the band has control of the dragons until we leave you cant sell the technology to others someone will replicate it mat she said copies wont be as good as aludras mat said i promise you that elayne studied him blue eyes weighing him judging him id still rather have the band as a fully commissioned andoran force well i wish i had a hat made all of gold a tent that could fly and a norse that leaves droppings of diamonds but well both have to settle with whats reasonable wont we it wouldnt be unreasonable to wed have to do what you said elayne mat replied i wont have it some battles arent worth fighting and im going to decide when my men put themselves at risk thats that i dont like having men who could leave me at any time you know i wont hold them back merely to spite you mat said ill do whats right what you see as being right she corrected every man should have that option he replied few men use it wisely we want it anyway mat said we demand it she glancedalmost imperceptiblytoward the plans and the medallion on the table you have it she said deal he said standing up spitting in his hand and holding it out she hesitated stood and spat in her hand then held it out to him he smiled and shook it did you know that i might ask you to take arms against the two rivers she asked is that why you demanded the right to leave if you want against the two rivers why under the light would she want to do that you dont need to fight them elayne we shall see what perrin forces me to do she replied but lets not discuss that right now she glanced at thorn then reached under her table and pulled out a rolled piece of paper with a ribbon about it please i want to hear more of what happened during your trip out of ebou dar will you take dinner with me this evening wed be delighted thorn said standing wouldnt we mat i suppose mat said if talmanes can come hell tear my throat out if i dont at least let him meet you elayne taking dinner with you will have him dancing all the way back to the camp elayne chuckled as you wish ill have servants show you to some rooms where you can rest until the time arrives she handed thorn the rolledup paper this will be proclaimed tomorrow if you will it what is it thom asked frowning the court of andor lacks a proper courtbard she said i thought you might be interested thom hesitated you honor me but i cant accept that there are things i need to do in the next little while and i cant be tied to the court you neednt be tied to the court elayne said youll have freedom to leave and go where you wish but when you are in caemlyn id have you be known for who you are i he took the roll of paper ill consider it elayne excellent she grimaced im afraid i have an appointment with my midwife now but i will see you at dinner i havent yet asked what matrim meant by calling himself a married man in his letter i expect a full report no expurgations she eyed mat smiling slyly expurgation means parts cut out mat in case you werent bloody aware he put his hat on i knew that what had that word been again expirations light why had he mentioned his marriage in that letter he had hoped it would make elayne curious enough to see him elayne laughed gesturing them toward the exit thom spared a paternal kiss for her cheek before partinggood that it was paternal mat had heard some things about those two that he did not want to believe with thom old enough to be her grandfather no less mat pulled open the door moving to leave and mat elayne added if you need to borrow money to buy a new coat the crown can lend you some considering your station you really should dress more nicely im no bloody nobleman he said turning not yet she said you dont have perrins audacity in naming yourself to a title ill see that you get one you wouldnt dare he said but see here he said as thom joined him in the hallway im proud of who i am and i like this coat its comfortable he clenched his hands into fists refusing to scratch at his collar if you say so elayne said i will see you at dinner ill have to bring dyelin shes very curious to meet you with that she had birgitte close the door mat stared at it vengefully for a moment then turned toward thom talmanes and the soldiers waited a short distance down the hallway out of hearing range they were being given warm tea by some palace servants that went well mat decided hands on hips i worried she wouldnt bite but i think i reeled her in pretty well though the bloody dice were still rolling in his head thom laughed clapping him on the shoulder what mat demanded tom just chuckled then glanced down at the scroll in his other hand and this was unexpected as well well andor doesnt have a courtbard mat said yes thorn said looking over the scroll but theres a pardon written in here too for any and all crimesknown and unknowni may have committed in andor or cairhien i wonder who told her told her what nothing mat nothing at all we have a few hours until dinner with elayne what do you say we go buy you a new coat all right mat said you think i could get one of those pardons too if i asked for it do you need one mat shrugged walking down the hallway with him cant hurt to be safe what kind of coat are you going to buy me anyway i didnt say id pay dont be so stingy mat said ill pay for dinner and bloody ashes somehow mat knew he would chapter a choice you must not speak rosil said to nynaeve the slender longnecked woman wore an orange dress slashed with yellow at least speak only when spoken to you know the ceremony nynaeve nodded her heart beating treacherously as they walked into the dungeonlike depths of the white tower rosil was the new mistress of novices and a member of the yellow ajah by coincidence excellent excellent rosil said might i suggest you move the ring to the third finger of your left hand you may suggest it nynaeve said but did not move the ring she had been named aes sedai she would not give in on that point rosil pursed her lips but said nothing further the woman had shown nynaeve remarkable kindness during her short time in the white tower which had been a relief nynaeve had grown to expect that every yellow sister would regard her with disdain or at least indifference oh they thought she was talented and many insisted on being trained by her but they did not think of her as one of them not yet this woman was different and being a burr in her sandal was not a good repayment it is important to me rosil nynaeve explained that not give any indication of disrespect for the amyrlin she named me aes sedai to act as if i were merely accepted would be to undermine her words this test is importantwhen the amyrlin raised me she never said that i need not be tested but i am aes sedai rosil cocked her head then nodded yes i see you are correct nynaeve stopped in the dim corridor i want to thank you and the others who have welcomed me these last daysniere and meramor i had not assumed i would find acceptance here among you there are some who resist change dear rosil said it will ever be so but your new weaves are impressive more importantly theyre effective that earns you a warm welcome from me nynaeve smiled now rosil said raising a finger you might be aes sedai in the eyes of the amyrlin and the tower but tradition still holds no speaking for the rest of the ceremony please the lanky woman continued leading the way nynaeve followed biting off a retort she wouldnt let her nerves rule her deeper into the tower they wound and despite her determination to be calm she found herself increasingly nervous she was aes sedai and she would pass this test shed mastered the hundred weaves she didnt need to worry except some women never returned from the test these cellars had a grand beauty to them the smooth stone floor was leveled carefully lamps burned high on the walls likely those had required a sister or accepted to light them with the one power few people came down here and most of the rooms were used for storage it seemed a waste to her to put such care in a place rarely visited eventually they arrived at a pair of doors so large that rosil had to use the one power to open them its an indication nynaeve thought folding her arms the vaulted hallways the enormous door this is here to show accepted the importance of what they are about to do the enormous gatelike doors swung open and nynaeve forced herself to master her jitters the last battle was looming she would pass this test she had important work to be about head raised high she entered the chamber it was domed with standlamps around the perimeter a large terangreal dominated the center it was an oval narrowed at the top and bottom that sat unsupported many terangreal looked ordinary that was not the case here this oval was obviously something worked by the one power it was made of metal but the light changed colors as it reflected off the silvery sides making the thing seem to glow and shift attend rosil said formally there were other aes sedai in the room one from each ajah including unfortunatelythe red they were all sitters an oddity perhaps because of nyaeves notoriety in the tower saerin from the brown yukiri of the gray barasine from the red notably romanda from the yellow was there she had insisted on taking part she had been hard with nynaeve so far egwene herself had come one more than normal and the amyrlin as well nynaeve met the amyrlins eyes and egwene nodded unlike the test tobe raised to acceptedwhich was made entirely by the terangrealhis test involved the sisters actively working to make nynaeve prove herself and egwene would be among the most harsh to show that she had been right in raising nynaeve you come in ignorance nynaeve almeara rosil said how will you depart in knowledge of myself nynaeve said for what reason have you been summoned here to be tried for what reason should you be tried to show that i am worthy nynaeve said several of the women frowned including egwene those werent the right wordsnynaeve was supposed to say that she wanted to learn whether or not she was worthy but she was already aes sedai so by definition she was worthy she just had to prove it to the others rosil stumbled but continued and for what would you be found worthy to wear the shawl i have been given nynaeve said she didnt say it to be arrogant once again she simply stated the truth as she saw it egwene had raised her she wore the shawl already why pretend that she didnt this test was administered clad in the light she began taking off her dress i will instruct you rosil said you will see this sign upon the ground she raised her fingers forming weaves that made a glowing symbol in the air a sixpointed star two overlapping triangles saerin embraced the source and wove a weave of spirit nynaeve suppressed the urge to embrace the source herself only a little longer she thought and then nobody will be able to doubt me saerin touched her with the weave of spirit remember what must be remembered she murmured that weave had something to do with memory what was its purpose the sixpointed star hovered in nynaeves vision when you see that sign you will go to it immediately rosil said go at a steady pace neither hurrying nor hanging back only when you reach it may you embrace the source the weaving required must begin immediately and you may not leave that sign until it is completed remember what must be remembered saerin said again when the weave is complete rosil said you will see that sign again marking the way you must go again at a steady pace without hesitation remember what must be remembered one hundred times you will weave in the order that you have been given and in perfect composure remember what must be remembered saerin said one final time nynaeve felt the weaving of spirit settle into her it was rather like healing she removed her dress and shift as the other sisters knelt beside the terangreal performing complex weaves of all five powers they caused it to glow brightly the colors on its surface shifting and changing rosil cleared her throat and nynaeve blushed handing her the pile of garments then took off her great serpent ring and placed it on top followed by lans ringwhich she normally wore around her neck rosil took the clothing the other sisters were completely absorbed in their work the terangreal began glowing a pure white in the center then started to revolve slowly grinding against the stone nynaeve took a deep breath striding forward she paused before the terangreal stepped through and and where was she nynaeve frowned this didnt look like the two rivers she stood in a village made of huts waves lapped against a sandy beach to her left and the village ran up a slope toward a rocky shelf to her right a distant mountain towered above an island of some sort the air was humid the breeze calm people walked between huts calling goodnaturedly to one another a few stopped to stare at her she looked down at herself realizing for the first time that she was naked she blushed furiously who had taken her clothing when she found the person responsible shed switch them so soundly they wouldnt be able to sit for weeks a robe was hanging from a nearby clothesline she forced herself to remain calm as she walked over and pulled it free she would find its owner and pay them she couldnt very well walk about without a stitch she threw the robe on over her head the ground shook suddenly the gentle waves grew louder crashing against the beach nynaeve gasped steadying herself against the clothesline pole above the mountain began spurting smoke and ashes nynaeve clutched the pole as the rocky shelf nearby began to break apart boulders tumbling down the incline people yelled she had to do something as she looked about she saw a sixpointed star carved into the ground she wanted to run for it but she knew she needed to walk carefully keeping calm was difficult as she walked her heart fluttered with rror she was going to be crushed she reached the star pattern just as a large shower of stones rumbled toward her smashing huts despite her fear nynaeve quickly formed the correct weavea weave of air that formed a wall she set it in front of herself and the stones thudded against the air forced back there were hurt people in the village she turned from the star pattern to help but as she did she saw the same sixpointed star woven in reeds and hanging from the door of a nearby hut she hesitated she could not fail she walked to the hut and passed through the doorway then she froze what was she doing in this dark cold cavern and why was she wearing this robe of thick scratchy fibers she had completed the first of the hundred weaves she knew this but nothing else frowning to herself she walked through the cavern light shone through cracks in the ceiling and she saw a greater pool of it ahead the way out she walked from the cavern to find that she was in the waste she raised a hand to shade her eyes from the bright sunlight there wasnt a soul in sight she walked forward feet crunching on weeds and scalded by hot stones the heat was overwhelming soon each step was exhausting fortunately some ruins lay ahead shade she wanted to run for it but she had to remain calm she walked up to the stones and her feet fell on rock shaded by a broken wall it was so cool she sighed in relief a pattern of bricks lay nearby in the ground and they made a sixpointed star unfortunately that star was back out in the sunlight she reluctantly left the shade and walked toward the pattern drums thumped in the distance nynaeve spun disgusting brownfurred creatures began to climb over a nearby hill carrying axes that dripped with red blood the trollocs looked wrong to her shed seen trollocs before though she didnt remember where these were different a new breed perhaps with thicker fur eyes hidden in the recesses of their faces nynaeve walked faster but did not break into a run it was important to keep her calm that was completely stupid why would she need toor want tokeep herself from running when there were trollocs nearby if she died because she wasnt willing to hasten her step it would be her own fault keep composure dont move too quickly she maintained her steady pace reaching the sixpointed star as the trollocs drew close she began the weave she was required to make and split off a thread of fire she sent an enormous spray of heat away from her burning the nearest of the beasts to cinders jaw set against her fear she crafted the rest of the required weave she split her weaves a halfdozen times and finished the complicated thing in mere moments she set it in place then nodded there other trollocs were coming and she burned them away with a wave of her hand the sixpointed star was carved into the side of an archway of stone she walked toward it trying to keep from looking nervously over her shoulder more trollocs were coming more than she could possibly kill she reached the archway and stepped through nynaeve finished the fortyseventh weave which caused the sounds of bells in the air she was exhausted shed had to make this weave while standing on top of an impossibly narrow tower hundreds of feet in the air wind buffeted her threatening to blow her free an archway appeared below in the dark night air it seemed to grow right out of the pillars side a dozen feet below her parallel to the ground its opening toward the sky it held the sixpointed star gritting her teeth she leaped off the spire and fell through the archway she landed in a puddle her clothing was gone what had happened to it she stood up growling to herself she was angry she didnt know why but someone had done something to her she was so tired that was their fault whoever they were as she focused on that thought it became more clear to her she couldnt remember what theyd done but they were definitely to blame she had cuts across both of her arms had she been whipped the cuts hurt something fierce dripping wet she looked around shed completed fortyseven of the hundred weaves she knew that but nothing else other than the fact that somebody very badly wanted her to fail she wasnt going to let them win she rose out of the puddle determined to be calm and found some clothing nearby it was garishly colored bright pink and yellow with a generous helping of red it seemed an insult she put it on anyway she walked down a path in the bog stepping around sinkholes and pools of stagnant water until she found a sixpointed star drawn in the mud she began the next weave which would make a burning blue star shoot into the air something bit at her neck she slapped her hand at it killing a blackfly well no surprise that shed find those in this dank swamp she would be glad toanother bite on her arm she slapped at it the very air started to buzz flies zipping around her nynaeve gritted her teeth continuing the weave more and more bites prickled on her arms she couldnt kill them all could she get rid of the flies with a weave she began a weave of air to create a breeze around her but was interrupted as she heard screams it was faint over the buzzing of the flies but it sounded like a child trapped in the bog nynaeve took a step toward the sounds and opened her mouth to call but blackflies swarmed into her mouth choking her they got at her eyes and she had to squeeze them shut that buzzing the screams the biting light they were in her throat in her lungs finish the weave you must finish the weave she continued somehow despite the pain the sound of the insects was so loud that she could barely hear the whoosh of the fiery star as it blasted into the air she quickly wove a weave to blow the flies away and once she did she looked about she coughed and trembled she could feel the flies sticking to the inside of her throat she didnt see any child in danger had it been a trick of her ears she did see another sixpointed star above a door carved into a tree she walked toward it as the flies buzzed around her again calm she had to be calm why it made no sense she did it anyway walking with eyes closed as the flies swarmed her she reached out feeling for the door and pulling it open she stepped through she pulled to a stop inside the building wondering why she was coughing so much was she ill she leaned against the wall exhausted angry her iegs were covered in scrapes and her arms itched with some kind of insect bites she groaned looking down at her garish clothing what could possibly have possessed her to wear red yellow and pink together she stood up with a sigh and continued down the rickety hallway the planks that made up the floor rattled as she walked and the plaster on the walls was broken and crumbling she reached a doorway and peeked in the small chamber contained four small brass beds the mattresses had straw peeking from the seams each bed bore a young child clutching a ratty blanket two of them were coughing and all four looked pale and sickly nynaeve gasped hurrying into the room she knelt beside the first child a boy of perhaps four years she checked his eyes then told him to cough as she listened at his chest he had the creeping sickness who is caring for you nynaeve demanded mistress mala runs the orphanage the child said in a weak voice we havent seen her in a long time please a young girl said from the next bed she had bloodshot eyes her skin so pale it was practically white some water could i have some water she trembled the other two were crying pitiful weak sounds light there wasnt a single window in the room and nynaeve saw roaches scuttling under the beds who would leave children in such conditions hush she said im here now ill care for you shed need to channel to heal them then no she thought cant do that i cant channel until i reach the star she would brew draughts then where was her herb pouch she looked around the room searching for a source of water she froze there was another room across the hallway had that been there before a rug on its floor bore the symbol of the sixpointed star she rose the children whimpered ill return nynaeve said stepping toward that room each step twisted her heart she was abandoning them but no she was only walking into the next room wasnt she she reached the rug and began to weave just this one quick weaving then she could help she found herself crying as she worked ive been here before she thought or a place like it a situation such as this she found herself more and more angry how could she channel with those children calling for her they were dying she completed the weave then watched it blow out jets of air ruffling her dress she reached for her braid and held it as a door appeared on the side of the room a small glass window was set into the top and it bore the sixpointed star she had to continue she heard the weeping children tears in her eyes heart breaking she walked to the door it grew worse she left people to be drowned beheaded and buried aliveone of the worst was when she had to form a weave while villagers were consumed by enormous spiders with bright red fur and crystalline eyes she hated spiders sometimes she would appear naked that stopped bothering her though she couldnt remember anything specific but the number of the weave she was on she understoodsomehowthat nudity was nothing comparedd to the terrors shed seen she stumbled through a stone archway memories of a house on fire fading from her mind this was the eightyfirst weave she remembered that that and her fury she wore a singed dress of sackcloth how had she burned it she stood up straight holding her head arms throbbing back feeling whipped legs and toes bearing cuts and scratches she was in the two rivers except it wasnt the two rivers not as she remembered it some of the buildings smoldered still burning theyre coming again a voice yelled master alvere why was he holding a sword people she knew people dear to herperrin master alvere mistress aldonel aerie bottegerstood beside a low wall all holding weapons some waved to her nynaeve perrin called shadowspawn we need your help enormous shadows moved on the other side of the wall shadowspawn of terrible sizenot trollocs but something far worse she could hear roars she had to help she moved toward perrin but froze as she saw across the green in the other directiona sixpointed star painted on a hillside nynaeve perrin sounded desperate he began striking at something that reached over the wall tentacles of midnight black perrin chopped at them with an axe as one snatched up aerie and pulled himscreaming into the darkness nynaeve began to walk toward the star calm measured that was stupid an aes sedai had to be calm she knew that but an aes sedai also needed to be able to act to do what was needed to help those who needed it it didnt matter what it cost her personally these people needed her so she started to run even that didnt feel like enough she ran to get to the star but still she left people she loved to fight alone she knew she couldnt channel until she reached the sixpointed star that made absolutely no sense shadowspawn were attacking she had to channel she embraced the source and something seemed to try to stop her something like a shield she pushed it aside with difficulty and power flooded her she began flinging fire at the monster burning off a tentacle as it grabbed for perrin nynaeve continued throwing fire until she reached the sixpointed star there she wove the eightyfirst weave which created three rings of fire in the air she worked furiously attacking at the same time she didnt know the point of creating this weave but she knew she had to finish it so she increased the strength of the weave making the burning rings extremely large then she began hurling them at the creatures massive halos of flame crashed into the dark things killing them there was a sixpointed star on the roof of master al veres inn had it been burned there nynaeve ignored it venting her anger at the things with tentacles no this is important more important than the two rivers i must go on feeling like an utter cowardbut knowing it was the right thing to doshe ran to the inn passing through the doorway nynaeve lay weeping on the ground beside a broken archway she was on the last of the hundred weaves she could barely move her face was streaked with tears she had hollow memories of fleeing battles of leaving children to die of never being able to do enough her shoulder bled a wolfs bite her legs were flayed as if shed walked through a long patch of thorns all across her body were burns and blisters she was naked she rose to her knees which were scraped and bleeding her braid ended in a smoldering stump about a handspan below her shoulders she retched to the side shivering so sick so weak how could she continue no they will not beat me she slowly raised herself to her feet she was in a small room harsh sunlight leaking through cracks between the wallboards a bundle of white cloth lay on the ground she picked it up unfolding it it was a white dress with the colors of the ajahs banded at the bottom the clothing of an accepted in the white tower she dropped it i am aes sedai she said stepping over the robe and pushing open the door better to go naked than to give in to that lie outside the door she found another dress this time yellow that was more proper she allowed herself the time to put it on though she couldnt stop trembling and her fingers were so tired she could barely make them work her blood stained the cloth dress on she inspected her surroundings she was on a hillside in the blight the ground covered in weeds that bore the distinctive dark marks why was there a shack in the blight and why had she been inside of it she felt so tired she wanted to go back into the shack and sleep no she would continue she trudged up the hill at its top she looked down on a land covered in broken rubble and pockets of darkness lakes if they could be called that the liquid looked thick and oily dark shapes moved within them malkier she thought stunned that she recognized the place the seven towers only rubble now the thousand lakes corrupted the place of lans heritage she stepped forward but her toe hit something a stone beneath her feet had been carved with a small symbol the sixpointed star she sighed in relief it was almost through she began the final weave below a man stumbled out from behind a mound of rubble swinging expertly with his sword she knew him even at a distance that strong figure square face colorshifting cloak and dangerous way of walking lan she screamed he was surrounded by beasts that looked like wolves but too large they had dark fur and their teeth flashed as they lunged toward lan darkhounds an entire pack nynaeve finished the hundredth weave with a start she hadnt realized shed continued it a shower of colorful specks burst into the air around her she watched them fall feeling used she heard a sound over her shoulder but when she glanced there was nothing there just the shack the sixpointed star hung over a door there the symbol made of bits of gemstones that door hadnt been there before she took a step toward the shack then looked back lan swung about him with his sword forcing the darkhounds away one bit of saliva from those beasts would kill him lan she screamed run he didnt hear her the sixpointed star she needed to walk to it she blinked then looked down at her hands in the direct center of each palm was a tiny scar almost unnoticeable seeing them sparked a memory in her nynaeve i love you this was a test she could remember that now it was a test to force her to choose between him and the white tower shed made that choice once but shed known it wasnt real this wasnt real either was it she raised a hand to her head mind cloudy that is my husband down there she thought no i will not play this game she screamed weaving fire and throwing it toward one of the darkhounds the creature burst into flames but the fire didnt seem to hurt it nynaeve stepped forward throwing more fire useless the hounds just kept attacking she refused to give in to her exhaustion she banished it growing calm controlled ice they wanted to push her see what she could do well let it be she reached out drawing in an immense amount of the one power then she wove balefire the line of pure light sprang from her fingers warping the air around it she hit one of the darkhounds and seemed to puncture it the light continuing on into the ground the entire landscape rumbled and nynaeve stumbled lan fell to the ground the darkhounds leaped at him no nynaeve thought righting herself weaving balefire again she blasted another hound then another more of the monsters leaped from behind rock formations where were they all coming from nynaeve strode forward blasting with the forbidden weave each strike made the ground tremble as if in pain the balefire shouldnt puncture the ground like that something was wrong she reached lans side he had broken his leg nynaeve he said you must go she ignored his words kneeling down and weaving balefire as another hound rounded the rubble their number was increasing and she was so tired each time she channeled she felt it would surely be her last but it could not be not with lan in danger she wove a complex healing putting every bit of strength she had left into it mending his leg he scrambled up and grabbed his sword turning to fend off a darkhound they fought together her with balefire him with steel but his swings were lethargic and it took her a few heartbeats longer each time she made the balefire the ground was shaking and rumbling ruins crashing to the ground lan she said be ready to run what with her last ounce of strength she wove balefire and aimed it directly downward in front of them the ground undulated in agony almost like a living thing the earth split nearby darkhounds tumbling in nynaeve collapsed the one power slipping from her she was too tired to channel lan grabbed her arm we must go she hauled herself to her feet taking his hand together they ran up the rumbling hillside darkhounds howled behind some of the pack leaping the rift nynaeve ran for all she was worth clinging to lans hand they crested the hill the ground was shaking so terribly she couldnt believe the shack still standing she stumbled down the hill toward it lan with her he tripped crying out in pain his hand slipped from her fingers she spun behind them a flood of darkhounds crested the hilltop snarling teeth flashing and spittle flying from their mouths lan waved for her to go his eyes wide no she grabbed him by the arm and heaving hauled him down the slope together they tumbled through the doorway and and gasping nynaeve fell from the terangreal she collapsed alone on the cold floor naked shaking in a flood she remembered it all each and every horrible moment of the test each betrayal each frustrating weave the impotence the screams of the children the deaths of people she knew and loved she wept against the floor curling up her entire body was afire with pain her shoulder legs arms and back still bled she was burned to blisters in swaths across her body and the greater part of her braid was gone her unraveled hair fell across her face as she tried to banish the memories of what she had done she heard groans from nearby and through bleary eyes she saw the aes sedai in the circle break off their weaves and slump she hated them she hated each and every one of them light saerins voice someone heal her everything was growing blurry voices grew muddled like sounds under water peaceful sounds something cold washed over her she gasped her eyes opening wide at the icy shock of the healing rosil knelt beside her the woman looked worried the pain left nynaeves body but her exhaustion increased tenfold and the pain inside it remained oh light she could hear the children screaming well saerin said from nearby seems that shell live now would someone please tell me what in the name of creation itself that was she sounded furious ive been a part of many a raising even one where the woman didnt survive but i have never in all of my days seen a woman put through what this one just suffered she had to be tested properly rubinde said properly saerin demanded livid nynaeve didnt have the strength to look at them she lay breathing in and out properly saerin repeated that wasnt proper that was downright vengeful rubinde almost any one of those tests was beyond what ive seen demanded of other women you should be ashamed all of you light look what youve done to the girl it is unimportant barasine the red said in a cold voice she failed the test what nynaeve croaked finally looking up the terangreal had fallen dim and rosil had fetched a blanket and nynaeves clothing egwene stood to the side arms clasped before her her face was serene as she listened to the others she would not have a vote but the others would regarding whether nynaeve had passed the test or not you failed child barasine said regarding nynaeve with an emotionless stare you did not show proper decorum lelaine of the blue nodded looking annoyed to be agreeing with a red this was to test your ability to be calm as an aes sedai you did not show that the others looked uncomfortable you werent supposed to speak of the specifics of a testing nynaeve knew that much she also knew that most of the time failing and dying were the same thing though she wasnt terribly surprised to hear claims that shed failed now that she thought about it she had broken the rules of the test shed run in order to save perrin and others shed channeled before she should have she had trouble summoning regret every other emotion was for the moment consumed by the hollow loss she felt barasine does have a point seaine said reluctant by the end you were openly furious and you ran to reach many of the markers and then there is the matter of the forbidden weave most troubling i do not say you should fail but there are irregularities nynaeve tried to climb to her feet rosil placed a hand on her shoulder to forbid her but nynaeve took the arm and used it as support pulling herself up on unsteady legs she took the blanket and wrapped it around her shoulders holding it closed at the front she felt so drained i did what i had to who among you would not run if you saw people in danger who among you would forbid herself to channel if she saw shadowspawn attacking i acted as an aes sedai should this test barasine said is meant to ensure that a woman is capable of dedicating herself to a greater task to see that she can ignore the distractions of the moment and seek a higher good nynaeve sniffed i completed the weaves i needed to i maintained my focus yes i broke my calmbut i kept a cool enough head to complete my tasks one should not demand calmness for the mere sake of calmness and a prohibition on running when there are people you need to save is foolish my goal in this test was to prove that i deserve to be aes sedai well then i could argue that the lives of the people i saw were more important than gaining that title if losing my title is what would be required to save someones lifeand if there were no other consequencesid do it every time not saving them wouldnt be serving a higher good it would just be selfish barasines eyes opened wide with anger nynaeve turned to walk with some difficultyto the side of the room where she could sit on a bench and rest the women gathered together to speak softly and egwene walkedstill sereneover to nynaeve the amyrlin sat down beside her though she had been allowed to participate in the test and create some of the experiences that tested nynaeve the choice of the raising would be up to the others youve angered them egwene said and confused them i spoke the truth nynaeve grumbled perhaps egwene said but i wasnt speaking of your outburst during the test you flouted the orders you were given i couldnt flout them i didnt remember that id been given them i well actually i could remember what i was supposed to do but not the reasons nynaeve grimaced thats why i broke the rules i thought they were just arbitrary i couldnt remember why i wasnt supposed to run so in the face of seeing people die it seemed silly to walk the rules are supposed to hold strongly even though you dont remember them egwene said and you should not have been able to channel before reaching the marker that is in the very nature of the test nynaeve frowned then how youve spent too much time in telaranrhiod this test it seems to function much in the same way as the world of dreams what we create in our minds became your surroundings egwene clicked her tongue shaking her head i warned them that this might be a danger your practice in the world of dreams made you innately able to break the test nynaeve didnt reply to that feeling sick what if she did fail being cast out of the tower now after getting so close i think your infractions might help you however egwene said softly what youre too experienced to have been given this test egwene explained in a way what happened is proof that you deserved the shawl when i granted it to you you performed each of the weaves expertly with speed and skill i particularly liked the way you used useless weaves on occasion to attack the things you saw the fight in the two rivers nynaeve said that one was you wasnt it the others dont know the place well enough to create it you can sometimes create visions and situations based on the mind of the woman being tested egwene said it is an odd experience using this terangreal one that i am not certain i understand but the two rivers was you yes egwene admitted and the last one with lan egwene nodded im sorry i thought that if i didnt do it nobody would i am glad that you did nynaeve said it showed me something it did nynaeve nodded back against the wall holding the blanket in place and closing her eyes i realized that if i had to choose between becoming an aes sedai and going with lan id choose lan what people call me doesnt change anything inside of me lan however he is more than a title i can still channeli can still be meif i never become aes sedai but i would never be myself again if i abandoned him the world changed when i married him she felt freed somehow realizing it and saying it pray the others dont realize that egwene said it would not be good for them to determine that you would place anything before the white tower i wonder if nynaeve said we sometimes put the white toweras an institutionbefore the people we serve i wonder if we let it become a goal in itself instead of a means to help us achieve greater goals devotion is important nynaeve the white tower protects and guides the world and yet so many of us do it without families nynaeve said without love without passion beyond our own particular interests so even while we try to guide the world we separate ourselves from it we risk arrogance egwene we always assume we know best but risk making ourselves unable to fathom the people we claim to serve egwene seemed troubled dont voice those ideas too much at least not today theyre already frustrated enough with you but this testing was brutal nynaeve im sorry i couldnt be seen favoring you but perhaps i shouid have put a stop to it you did what you werent supposed to and that drove the others to be increasingly severe they saw that sick children hurt you so they put more and more of them into the test many seemed to consider your victories a personal affront a contest of wills that drove them to be harsh cruel even i survived nynaeve said eyes closed and i learned a great deal about me and about us she wanted to be aes sedai fully and truly embraced she wanted it badly but in the end if these people chose to refuse her their approval she knew she could continue on and do what she needed to do anyway eventually the sitterstrailed by rosilwalked up nynaeve hauled herself to her feet to be respectful we must discuss the forbidden weave you used saerin said stern it is the only way i know to destroy darkhounds nynaeve said it was needed you do not have the right to decide that saerin said what you did destabilized the terangreal you could have destroyed it killing yourself and perhaps us we want you to swear that you will never use that weave again i wont do that nynaeve said tiredly and if it means the difference between gaining the shawl or losing it forever giving an oath like that would be foolish nynaeve said i could find myself in a situation where people would die if i didnt use it light ill be fighting in the last battle alongside rand what if i were to get to shayol ghul and discover that without balefire i could not help the dragon stop the dark one would you have me choose between a foolish oath and the fate of the world you think youre going to shayol ghul rubinde asked incredulous im going to be there nynaeve said softly it is not a question rand has asked it of me though i would have gone if he hadnt they shared a look seeming troubled if youre going to raise me nynaeve said then youll just have to trust my judgment on balefire if you dont trust me to know when to use a very dangerous weave and when not to then id rather you not raise me i would be careful egwene said to the women refusing the shawl to the woman who helped cleanse the taint from saidinthe woman who defeated moghedien herself in battle the woman married to the king of malkierwould set a very dangerous precedent saerin looked at the others three nods yukiri seaine andsurprisinglyromanda three shakes of the head rubinde barasine lelaine that left only saerin the deciding vote the brown turned back to her nynaeve almeara i declare that you have passed this test narrowly to the side egwene let out a softalmost inaudiblesigh of relief nynaeve realized shed been holding her own breath it is done rosil said clapping her hands together let no one ever speak of what has passed here it is for us to share in silence with she who experienced it it is done the women nodded in agreement even those who had voted against nynaeve nobody would know that nynaeve had nearly failed they had probably confronted her about the balefire directlyrather than seeking formal punishmentbecause of the tradition of not speaking of what happened in the terangreal rosil clapped again nynaeve almeara you will spend the night in prayer and contemplation of the burdens you will take up on the morrow when you don the shawl of an aes sedai it is done she clapped a third and final time thank you nynaeve said but i already have my shawl and she cut off as egwene gave her a glare a serene glare but a glare nonetheless perhaps nynaeve had pushed things far enough tonight already i will be happy to follow tradition nynaeve continued discarding her objection so long as i am allowed to do one very important thing first then i will return and fulfill tradition nynaeve needed a gateway to get where she was going she hadnt specifically told the others shed be leaving the tower to see to her task but she hadnt said she wouldnt either she hustled through the dark camp of tents which sat just outside a partially built wall the night sky was dim with those clouds covering it and fires burned at the perimeter of the camp perhaps too many fires those here were being extremely cautious fortunately the guards had allowed her into the camp without comment the great serpent ring worked wonders when applied in the right locations theyd even told her where to find the woman she sought in truth nynaeve had been surprised to find these tents outside rather than inside the walls of the black tower these women had been sent to bond ashaman as rand had offered but according to the guards egwene s envoy had been made to wait the ashaman had said that others had the first choice whatever that meant egwene probably knew more shed sent messengers back and forth with the women here particularly to warn them about black sisters who might be among them those theyd known of had vanished before the first messengers arrived nvnaeve hadnt the mind to ask more details at the moment she had another task she stepped up to the proper tent feeling so tired from the testing that she felt she would soon tumble to the ground in a flurry of yellow cloth a few warders passed through the camp nearby watching her with calm expressions the tent before her was a simple gray thing it was lit with a faint glow and shadows moved inside myrelle nynaeve said loudly i would speak with you she was surprised at how strong her voice sounded she didnt feel that she had much strength remaining the shadows paused and then moved again the tent flaps rustled and a confused face peered out myrelle wore a blue nightgown that was almost translucent and one of her wardersa bear of a man with a thick black beard after the illianer fashionsat shirtless on the tent floor inside child myrelle said sounding surprised what are you doing here she was an oliveskinned beauty with long black hair and rounded curves nynaeve had to stop herself from reaching for her braid it was too short now to tug that was going to take a lot of getting used to you have something that belongs to me nynaeve said hmm that depends on opinion child myrelle frowned i was raised today nynaeve said formally i passed the testing we are equals now myrelle she left the second part unsaidthat nynaeve was the stronger of the two not truly equals then return tomorrow myrelle said i am occupied she moved to turn back into the tent nynaeve caught the womans arm i have never thanked you she said though she had to grit her teeth to get the words out i do so now he lives because of you i realize that however myrelle this is not a time to push me today i have seen people i love slaughtered i have been forced to consign children to living torment i have been burned scourged and harrowed swear to you woman if you do not pass me lans bond this very moment i will step into that tent and teach you the meaning of obedience do not press me in the morning i swear the three oaths im free of them for one more night myrelle froze then she sighed and stepped back out of the tent so be it she closed her eyes weaving spirit and sending the weaves into nynaeve it felt like an object being shoved physically into her mind nynaeve gasped her surroundings spinninge myrelle turned and slipped back into her tent nynaeve slid down until she was sitting on the ground something was blossoming inside her mind an awareness beautiful wonderful it was him and he was still alive blessed light she thought eyes closed thank you chapter an open gate we thought it best seonid said to let one of us give the full report i have gathered information from the others for presentation perrin nodded absently he sat on cushions in the meeting pavilion faile at his side it was crammed full of people again cairhien is still in a mess of course seonid began the businesslike green was a curt woman not mean or disagreeable but even her interactions with her warders seemed like those of a prosperous farmer with his workers the sun throne has remained unoccupied for far too long all know that the lord dragon has promised the throne to elayne trakand but she has been struggling to secure her own throne she has finally done so by reports she looked to perrin for comment smelling satisfied he scratched at his beard this was important and he needed to pay attention but thoughts of his training in the wolf dream kept drawing his mind so elayne is queen that must make rand happy the lord dragons reaction is unknown seonid continued as if checking off another item on a list the wise ones made no comments and asked no questions they sat on their cushions in a little cluster like rivets on a hinge likely the maidens had already told them all of this i am reasonably certain that the lord dragon is in arad doman seonid continued several rumors speak of thisthough of course there are rumors placing him in many places but arad doman makes sense f i him as a tactical conquest and the unrest there threatens to destabili the borderlands im not certain if its true that he sent the aiel there o not he did edarra said simply she offered no further explanation yes seonid said well many of the rumors say that he is planning to meet the seanchan in arad doman i suspect he would want the clans there to aid him that brought up thoughts of maiden perrin imagined damane and wise ones at war the one power ripping through ranks of soldiers blood earth and fire spinning in the air it would be like dumais wells only worse he shivered anyway from the visionsand they appeared as seonid spokehe knew that rand was where she said seonid continued speaking of trade and food resources in cairhien perrin found himself thinking about that strange violet wall hed seen in the wolf dream idiot he told himself sternly keep listening light he really was a bad ruler hed had no trouble running at the front of the wolves when theyd let him hunt why couldnt he do the same for his own people tear is rallying troops seonid said rumors say the lord dragon commanded king darlin to gather men for war there is apparently a king in tear now by the way a curious event some say that darlin will march for arad doman though others say it must be for the last battle still others insist that althor intends to defeat the seanchan first all three options seem plausible and i cant give more without a trip to tear myself she eyed perrin smelling hopeful no perrin said not yet rand isnt in cairhien but andor seems stable it makes the most sense for me to head there and talk to elayne shell have information for us faile smelled worried lord aybara seonid said do you think the queen will welcome you with the flag of manetheren and your selfendowed title of lord perrin scowled both of those fool banners are down now and elayne will see things right once i explain them to her and my soldiers alliandre said you will probably want to ask before moving foreign troops onto andoran soil you wont be coming perrin said ive said it before alliandre youll be in jehannah well get you there as soon as we deal with the whitecloaks has a decision been made about them then arganda asked leaning forward eager and excited theyve demanded a battle perrin said and they ignore my requests for further parley ive a mind to give them a fight they began talking of that though it soon became a discussion of what it meant to have a king in tear eventually seonid cleared her throat and stered the conversation back to her report the seanchan are a matter of great discussion in cairhien seonid said the invaders seem to be focusing on securing their lands including altara they are still expanding in the west however and there are pitched battles on almoth plain expanding toward arad doman arganda said there is a battle brewing there most likely seonid said if the last battle comes annoura said then it would be advantageous to have an alliance with the seanchan she seemed thoughtful legs crossed as she sat on her embroidered blue and yellow silk pillow they have chained wise ones edarra said her tooyoung face growing dark she smelled dangerous angry but cold like the smell before a person planned to kill not just shaido who deserve their fate if there is an alliance with the seanchan it will end as soon as the caracarns work is finished already many of my people speak of a blood feud with these invaders i doubt rand wants a war between you perrin said a year and a day edarra said simply wise ones cannot be taken gaishain but perhaps the seanchan ways are different regardless we will give them a year and a day if they do not release their captives when we demand them after that time they will know our spears the caracarn cannot demand any more from us the pavilion grew still anyway seonid said clearing her throat once finished with cairhien we met up with those who had gone to andor to check on rumors there wait perrin said andor the wise ones decided to send maidens there that wasnt the plan perrin growled looking at the wise ones you dont control us perrin aybara edarra said calmly we needed to know if there were still aiel in the city or not and if the caracarn was there your ashaman complied when we asked them for the gateway the maidens could have been seen he grumbled well he had told grady to do the gateways as the aiel asked him though hed been referring to the timing of the departure and the return he should have been more precise well they werent seen seonid sounded exasperated like one talk ing with a foolish child at least not by anyone they didnt intend to sperak with light was it him or was she beginning to seem a lot like a wise one was that what seonid and the others were doing in the aiel camp learning to become more stubborn light help them all regardless seonid continued it was wise of us to visit caemlyri rumor cannot be trusted particularly not when one of the forsaken was said to be operating in the area one of the forsaken gallenne asked in andor perrin nodded waving for another cup of warmed tea rand said it was rahvin though i was in the two rivers when the battle happened the colors swirled in perrins head rahvin was impersonating one of the local noblemen a man named gabral or gabil or some such he used the queenmade her fall in love with him or somethingand then killed her a serving tray hit the ground with a muted peal porcelain cups shattered tea spraying into the air perrin spun cursing and several of the maidens leaped to their feet clutching belt knives maighdin stood looking stunned arms at her sides the fallen tray lay on the ground before her maighdin faile said are you all right the sunhaired serving woman turned to perrin looking dazed if you please my lord will you repeat what you said what perrin asked woman whats wrong you said one of the forsaken had taken up residence in andor maighdin said voice calm she gave him as sharp a look as hed gotten from any aes sedai are you certain of what you heard perrin settled back on his cushion scratching his chin sure as i can be its been some time now but i know rand was convinced he fought someone with the one power in the andoran palace his name was gaebril sulin said i was there lightning struck from an open sky and there was no doubt it was the one power it was one of the forsaken there were some in andor who claimed the caracarn spoke of this edarra added he said that this gaebril had been using forbidden weaves on wetlanders in the palace twisting their minds making them think and do as he wished maighdin whats wrong perrin asked light woman hes dead now you neednt fear i must be excused maighdin said she walked from the pavilion leaving the tray and broken porcelain bone white scattered on the ground i will see to her later faile said embarrassed she is distraught to find that shed lived so close to one of the forsaken shes from caemlyn you know the others nodded and other servants moved forward to clean up the mess perrin realized he wasnt going to be getting any more tea fool man he thought you lived most your life without being able to order tea on command you wont die now that you cant get a refill by waving your hand lets move on he said settling on his cushions he could never quite get comfortable on the blasted things my report is finished seonid said pointedly ignoring the servant who was cleaning up porcelain shards in front of her i stand by my earlier decision perrin said dealing with the whitecloaks is important after that well go to andor and ill talk to elayne grady how are you managing the weathered ashaman looked up from where he sat in his black coat im fully recovered from my sickness my lord and neald almost is as well you still look tired perrin said i am grady said but burn me im better than i was many a day in the field before i went to the black tower its time to start sending some of these refugees where they belong perrin said with those circles you can keep a gateway open longer im not right sure being in a circle is still tiring maybe more so but i can make much larger gateways with the help of the women wide enough to drive two wagons through good well start by sending the ordinary folk home each person we see back where they belong will be a stone off my back and if they dont want to go tarn asked a lot of them have started the training perrin they know whats coming and theyd rather face it herewith youthan cower in their homes light were there no people in this camp who wanted to go back to their families surely there are some of them who want to go back some tarn said remember faile said the weak and the aged were sent away by the aiel arganda nodded ive looked in on these troops more and more of the gatshain are coming out of their stupor and when they do theyre hard hard as many soldiers ive known some will want to check on family tarn said but only if youll let them back they can see that sky they know whats coming for now well send back the ones that want to go and remain in their homes perrin said i cant deal with the others until after im done with the whitecloaks excellent gallenne said eagerly you have a plan of attack well perrin said i figure that if theyre going to be companionable enough to line up well have at them with my archers and channelers and destroy them i approve of this plan gallenne said so long as my men can charge to deal with the rabble left at the end balwer perrin said write the whitecloaks tell them well fight and that they should pick a place as he said the words he felt a strange reluctance it seemed such a waste to kill so many who could fight against the shadow but he didnt see a way around it balwer nodded smelling fierce what had the whitecloaks done to balwer the dusty secretary was fascinated with them the meeting began to break up perrin stepped to the tents open side and watched the separate groups leave alliandre and arganda moving toward their section of the camp faile walked beside berelain oddly the two were chatting together their scents said they were angry but their words sounded companionable what were those two up to only a few wet stains on the ground inside the tent remained of the dropped tray what was wrong with maighdin erratic behavior like that was disturbing all too often it was followed by some manifestation of the dark ones power my lord a voice asked preceded by a quiet cough perrin turned realizing that balwer was waiting behind him the secretary stood with hands clasped before him looking like a pile of sticks that children had dressed up in an old shirt and coat yes perrin asked i happened to overhear several items of ah some interest while visiting the scholars of cairhien you found the supplies right yes yes i am quite well stocked please a moment i do believe youll be interested in what i overheard go ahead then perrin said walking back into the pavilion the last of the others had left balwer spoke in a soft voice first off my lord it appears that the children of the light are in league with the seanchan it is common knowledge now and i worry that the force ahead of us was planted to balwer perrin interrupted i know you hate the whitecloaks but youve already told me that news a halfdozen times over yes but nothing more about the whitecloaks perrin said holding up a hand unless its specific news about this force ahead of us do you have any of that no my lord all right then was there anything else you wanted to tell me balwer showed no signs of annoyance but perrin could smell dissatisfaction light knew that the whitecloaks had plenty to answer for and perrin didnt blame balwer for his hatred but it did grow wearying well my lord balwer continued i would hazard that the tales of the dragon reborn wanting a truce with the seanchan are more than idle hearsay several sources indicate that he has sued their leader for peace but what did he do to his hand perrin asked dispelling yet another image of rand from his vision what was that my lord nothing perrin said in addition balwer said reaching into his sleeve there are an alarming number of these traveling among cutpurses slipfingers and footpads in cairhien he pulled out a sheet of paper with a sketch of perrins face on it the likeness was alarmingly good perrin took the paper frowning there were no words on it balwer handed him a second one identical to the first a third paper followed this one with a picture of mat where did you get these perrin asked as i said my lord balwer continued they are being passed around in certain circles apparently there are very large sums of money promised to anyone who can produce your corpse though i could not determine who would be doing the paying and you discovered these while visiting the scholars at rands school perrin asked the pinchfaced scribe displayed no emotion who are you really balwer a secretary with some measure of skill in finding secrets some measure balwer i havent asked after your past i figure a man deserves to be able to start fresh but now the whitecloaks are here and you have some connection to them i need to know what it is balwer stood silently for a time the raised walls of the pavilion rustled my previous employer was a man i respected my lord balwer said he was killed by the children of the light some among them may recognize me you were a spy for this person perrin asked balwers lips turned down distinctly he spoke more softly i merely have a mind for remembering facts my lord yes youve got a very good mind for it your service is useful to me balwer im only trying to tell you that im glad youre here the man smelled pleased if i may say my lord it is refreshing to work for someone who doesnt see my information as simply a means of betraying or compromising those around him well be that as it may i should probably start paying you better perrin said that gave balwer a panicked scent that wont be necessary you could demand high wages from any number of lords or merchants petty men of no consequence balwer said with a twitch of his fingers yes but i still think you should be paid more its simple sense if you hire an apprentice blacksmith for your forge and dont pay him well enough hell impress your regular customers then open a new forge across the street the moment he can afford to ah but you do not see my lord balwer said money means nothing to me the informationthat is what is important facts and discoveries they are like nuggets of gold i could give that gold to a common banker to make coins but i prefer to give it to the master craftsman to make something of beauty please my lord let me remain a simple secretary you see one of the easiest ways to tell if someone is not what he seems is to check his wages he chuckled ive uncovered more than one assassin or spy that way yes i have no pay is needed the opportunity to work with you is its own payment perrin shrugged but nodded and balwer withdrew perrin stepped out of the pavilion stowing the pictures in his pocket they disturbed him hed bet these pictures were in andor too placed by the forsaken for the first time he found himself wondering if he was going to need an army to keep himself safe it was a disturbing thought the wave of bestial trollocs surged over the top of the hill overrunning the last of the fortifications they grunted and howled thickfingered hands tearing at the dark saldaean soil and clutching swords hooked spears hammers clubs and other wicked weapons spittle dripped from tusked lips on some while on others wide toohuman eyes stared out from behind wicked beaks their black armor was decorated with spikes ituraldes men stood strong with him at the bottom of the back slope of the hillside he had ordered the lower camp to disband and retreat as far as they could to the south along the riverbank meanwhile the army had retreated from the fortifications he hated to surrender the high ground but getting pushed down that steep hill during an assault would have been deadly he had room to fall back so hed use it now that the fortifications were lost he positioned his forces just at the base of the hill near where the lower camp had once been the domani soldiers wore steel caps and had set their fourteenfoot pikes with butts in the dirt holding them for more stability steel points toward the towering wave of trollocs a classic defensive position three ranks of pikemen and shieldmen pikes slanted toward the top of the slope when the first rank of pikes killed a trolioc theyd fall back and pull their weapons free letting the second rank step forward to kill a slow careful retreat rank by rank a double row of archers behind began loosing arrows slamming wave after wave up into the shadowspawn dropping bodies down the slope those rolled some still screaming spraying dark blood a larger number continued down over their brothers trying to get at the pikemen an eagleheaded trolioc died on a pike in front of ituralde there were chips along the edges of the things beak and its headset with predatory eyessat atop a bulllike neck the edge of the feathers coated with some kind of dark oily substance the monster screeched as it died voice low and only faintly avian somehow forming guttural sounds in the trolioc language hold ituralde called turning and trotting his horse down the line of pikemen keep the formation burn you the trollocs surged down the hillside dying on those pikes it would be a temporary reprieve there were too many trollocs and even a rotating triple pike line would be overwhelmed this was a delaying tactic behind them the rest of his troops began their retreat once the lines had weakened the ashaman would assume the burden of defense buying time for the pikemen to retreat if the ashaman could manage the strength hed pushed them hard maybe too hard he didnt know their limits the way he did for ordinary troops if they were able to break the trolioc advance his army would fall back southward that retreat would take them past the safety of maradon but they would not be allowed in those inside had rebuffed all ituraldes attempts at communication we do not abet invaders had been the reply each time bloody fools well the trollocs would likely form up around maradon for a sustained siege giving ituralde and his men time to fall back to a more defensible position hold ituralde called again riding past an area where the trolloc press was beginning to show results atop one of the hilltop fortifications a pack of wolfheaded trollocs lurked wary while their companions charged down before them archers ituralde said pointing a volley of arrows followed spraying the wolfheaded trollocs or minds as the dragonsworn in ituraldes army had started calling them trollocs had their own bands and organization but his men often referred to individuals by the features they displayed horns for goats beaks for hawks arms for bears those with the heads of wolves were often among the more intelligent some saldaeans claimed to have heard them speaking the human language to bargain with or trick their opponents ituralde knew much about trollocs now you needed to know your enemy unfortunately there was huge variety in trolloc intelligence and personality and there were many trollocs who shared physical attributes from various groups ituralde swore hed seen one twisted abomination with the feathers of a hawk but the horns of a goat the trollocs atop the fortification tried to get out of the way of the arrows a large pack of hulking beasts behind shoved them down the hill with a roar trollocs were cowardly things normally unless hungry but if they were whipped into a frenzy they fought well the fades would follow this initial wave once the archers were out of arrows and trollocs had softened the men below ituralde didnt look forward to that light ituralde thought i hope ive can outrun them the ashaman waited in the distance for his order he wished he had them closer but he couldn t risk it they were too important an asset to lose to a stray arrow hopefully the front ranks of trollocs would be severely battered by the pikemen their carcasses twisted and banked against the pikesand the trollocs behind stumbling and falling against their own bloody remnants ituraldes remaining saldaeans would ride as a harrying force at any who got through the ashaman blasts then the pikemen should be able to draw back and follow the rest of the army in retreat once past maradon they could use gateways to fall back to his next chosen position a forested pass some ten leagues south his men should be able to escape should light but he hated being forced to command a toofast retreat like this stay firm he told himself continuing to ride and call out the order to hold it was important that they hear his voice that boy is the dragon reborn hell keep bis promises my lord a voice called ituraldes guard split to let a young boy ride up panting my lord its lieutenant lidrin hes fallen ituralde demanded no my lord hes the boy looked over his shoulder in the pike line nearby the soldiers were bulging forward toward the trolloc wave rather than falling back what in the light ituralde said heeling dawnweave into motion the white gelding galloped forward ituraldes guard and the young messenger joining him in a thunder of hooves he could hear lidrins yells despite the roar of the battlefield the young domani officer was out in front of the pike lines attacking the trollocs with sword and shield bellowing lidrins men had pushed through to defend him leaving the pikemen confused and disoriented lidrin you fool ituralde reined his horse to a halt come lidrin bellowed raising his sword up before the trollocs he laughed loudly voice halfmad face splattered with blood come i will face you all my sword thirsts lidrin ituralde screamed lidrin the man glanced over his shoulder his eyes were wide with a crazed kind of glee ituralde had seen it before in the eyes of soldiers who fought too long too hard were going to die rodel lidrin called this way i get to take them with me one or two at least join me lidrin get back here and the man ignored him turning back and pressing forward get his men back here ituralde yelled gesturing close the pike ranks quickly we cant the trollocs surged forward lidrin fell in a spray of blood laughing his men were too strongly pressed and they split down the middle the pikemen reset themselves but a fist of trollocs crashed into them some trollocs fell most didnt the nearby creatures screeched and howled at seeing the hole in the defenses they came scrambling over bodies at the base of the hill throwing themselves at the pikemen ituralde cursed then pushed dawnweave forward in war as in farming you sometimes had to step in and get kneedeep in the muck he bellowed as he crashed into the trollocs his guard rode in around him closing the gap the air became a crashing tempest of metal on metal and grunts of pain dawnweave snorted and danced as ituralde lashed out with his sword the warhorse disliked being so close to the shadowspawn but he was well trained a gift from one of basheres men he had claimed that a general on the borderlands needed an animal who had fought trollocs before ituralde blessed that soldier now the fighting was brutal the leading rank of pikemen and those behind began buckling ituralde briefly heard ankaers voice taking command screaming at the men to get back into line he sounded frantic that was bad ituralde swung doing heron on the stumpa horseback sword formand taking a bullheaded trolloc across the throat a spray of fetid brownish blood spurted forth and the creature fell back against a boarheaded monster a large red standarddepicting a goats skull with a fire burning behind itrose atop the hill the symbol of the ghobhlin band ituralde turned his horse dancing out of the way of a wicked axe blow then urged his mount forward driving his sword into the trollocs side around him whelborn and lehynentwo of his bestdied as they defended his flank light burn the trollocs the entire line was breaking apart he and his men were too few but most of his forces had already pulled back no no no ituralde thought trying to extricate himself from the battle and take over the command but if he pulled back the trollocs would break through hed have to risk it he was ready for problems like this a trumpet sounded retreat ituralde froze listening with horror to the haunted sound rolling across the battlefield the horns werent supposed to blow unless he or a member of his guard gave the order personally it was too soon far too soon some of the other trumpeters heard the call and took it up though others did not they could see that it was far too soon unfortunately that was worse it meant that half of the pikemen began to pull back while the other half held their position the lines around ituralde burst men scattering as the trollocs swarmed over them it was a disaster as bad a disaster as ituralde had ever been part of his fingers felt limp if we fall shadowspawn destroy arad doman ituralde roared yanking on the reins of his horse and galloping back away from the surging trollocs the remaining members of his guard followed helmke and cutaris ituralde yelled to two of his men sturdy longlimbed domani get to durhems cavalry and tell them to attack the center as soon as an opening appears kappre head to alins cavalry order him to assault the trollocs on the eastern flank sorrentin go to those ashaman i want the trollocs to go up in flame the horsemen galloped off ituralde rode westward to the place where the pikemen were still holding he started to rally one of the back ranks and bring it to the bulging section he almost had it working but then the myrddraal came sliding through the trolloc ranks like snakes striking with oily speed and a flight of draghkar descended ituralde found himself fighring for his life around him the battlefield was a terrible mess ranks destroyed trollocs roaming freely for easy kills myrddraal trying to whip them into attacking the few remaining pike formations instead fires flew in the air as the ashaman aimed for the trollocs but their fires were smaller weaker than they had been days ago men screamed weapons clanged and beasts roared in the smoke beneath a sky of tooblack clouds ituralde was breathing hard his guards had fallen at least he had seen staven and rett die what of the others he didnt see them so many dying so many there was sweat in his eyes light he thought at least we gave them a fight held out longer than i thought possible there were columns of smoke to the north well one thing had gone wellthat ashaman tymoth had done his job the second set of siege equipment was burning some of his officers had called it madness to send away one of his ashaman but one more channeler wouldnt have mattered in this disaster and when the trollocs attacked maradon the lack of those catapults would make a big difference dawnweave fell a trolloc javelin that had been meant for ituralde had fallen low the horse screamed with the weapon lodged in its neck blood pulsing down its sweatfrothed skin ituralde had lost mounts before and he knew to roll to the side but was too offbalance this time he heard his leg snap as he hit he gritted his teeth determined not to die on his back and forced himself up into a sitting position he dropped his swordheronmark though it wasand lifted up a broken discarded pike in a fluid motion and rammed it through the chest of an approaching trolloc dark stinking blood coated the shaft spurting down onto ituraldes hands as the trolloc screamed and died there was thunder in the air that wasnt oddthere was often thunder from those clouds often eerily disjointed from the bursts of lightning ituralde heaved pushing the trolloc to the side by levering the pike then a myrddraal saw him ituralde reached for his sword gritting his teeth but knew he had just seen his killer one of those things could fell a dozen men facing it with a broken leg he tried to stumble to his feet anyway he failed falling backward cursing he raised his sword prepared to die as the thing slunk forward movements like liquid a dozen arrows slammed into the fade ituralde blinked as the creature stumbled the thunder was getting louder ituralde propped himself up and was amazed to see thousands of unfamiliar horsemen charging in formation through the trolloc ranks sweeping the creatures before them the dragon reborn he came but no these men flew the saldaean flag he looked back the gates of maradon were open and ituraldes tired survivors were being allowed to limp inside fire was flying from the battlementshis ashaman had been allowed up top to get a vantage on the battlefield a force of twenty horsemen broke off and ran down the myrddraal trampling it the last man in the group leaped free of his saddle and hacked at the creature with a hand axe all across the battlefield the trollocs were run down shot or lanced it wouldnt last more and more trollocs were rolling through ituraldes former fortifications and loping down the slope but the saldaean relief would be enough with those gates open and with the ashaman blasting wreaking destruction the remnants of ituraldes force were fleeing to safety he was proud to see barettal and connelthe last of his guard stumbling across the field toward him on foot their mounts no doubt dead their uniforms bloodied he slid his sword into its scabbard and pulled the javelin from dawnweaves neck supporting himself on it he managed to stand a rider from the saldaean force trotted up to him a man with a lean face a hooked nose and a set of bushy black eyebrows he wore a short trimmed beard and he raised a bloodied sword to ituralde you live i do ituralde said as his two guards arrived you command this force for now the man said i am yoeli can you ride better that than staying here yoeli reached out a hand and pulled ituralde into his saddle behind him ituraldes leg protested with a flare of pain but there wasnt time to wait for a stretcher two other horsemen took ituraldes guards onto their horses and soon they three were riding for the city at a gallop bless you ituralde said it took you long enough though i know yoelis voice sounded oddly grim i hope you are worth this invader for my actions this day will likely cost my life what the man didnt reply he simply bore ituralde on thundering hooves into the safety of the citysuch as that safety was considering the city was now besieged by a force of several hundred thousand shadowspawn morgase walked out of the camp nobody stopped her though some did give her odd looks she passed the wooded northern rim the trees were burloak spaced apart to allow for their great spreading arms she moved beneath the boughs breathing deeply of the humid air gaebril had been one of the forsaken she eventually found a place where a tiny highland stream filled a cleft between two rocks and created a still clear pool the tall rocks around it clustered like an ancient broken throne built for a giant fifteen spans tall the trees bore leaves above though many looked sickly a thinner patch of clouds blew past allowing fingers of sunlight to reach down from the overcast sky that splintered light shone in rays through the clear water making patches of light on the pools bottom minnows darted between the patches as if investigating the light morgase rounded the pool then settled atop a flat boulder the sounds of the camp could be heard in the distance calling posts being driven into the ground carts rattling on pathways she stared into the pool was there anything more hateful than being made the pawn of another of being forced to dance upon their strings like a wooden puppet in her youth shed grown well acquainted with bowing berore the whims of others that had been the only way for her to stabilize her rule taringail had tried to manipulate her in truth hed been successful much of the time there had been others too so many who had pushed her this way or that shed spent ten years pandering to whichever faction was the strongest ten years slowly building alliances it had worked shed eventually been able to maneuver on her own when taringail had died hunting many had whispered that his passing released her but those close to her had known that she had already gone a long way toward unseating his authority she could remember the very day when shed cast off the last of those who had presumed to be the real power behind the throne that was the day that in her heart shed truly become queen shed sworn that shed never let another manipulate her again and then years later gaebril had arrived after that valda who had been worse at least with gaebril she hadnt realized what was happening that had numbed the wounds footsteps on fallen twigs announced a visitor the light from above dimmed the thinner clouds moving on the shafts of light faded and the minnows scattered the footsteps stopped beside her stone im leaving tallanvors voice said aybara has given leave for his ashaman to make gateways starting with some of the distant cities im going to tear rumors say theres a king there again hes gathering an army to fight in the last battle i want to be with it morgase looked up staring ahead through the trees it wasnt really a forest they say you were as singleminded as goldeneyes she said softly that you would not rest that you barely took time to eat that you spent every moment searching for a way to free me tallanvor said nothing ive never had a man do that for me she continued taringail saw me as a pawn thorn as a beauty to be hunted and romanced and gareth as a queen to be served but none of them made me their entire life their heart i think thorn and gareth loved me but as something to be held and cared for then released i didnt think youd ever let go i wont tallanvor said softly you go to tear yet you said youd never leave my heart stays here he said i know well what it is to love from afar morgase id done it for years before this fools trip began and i will do it for years yet my heart is a traitor perhaps some trolloc will do me a favor and rip it free of my chest so bitter she whispered you have made it amply clear that my attentions are not wanted a een and a simple guardsman pure foolishness a queen no longer she said not in name morgase just in mind a leaf fell from above and struck the pool with a lobed margin and verdant richness it should have had a long life yet do you know the worst part of this tallanvor asked its the hope the hope i let myself feel traveling with you protecting you i thought maybe you would see maybe you would care and forget about him him gaebril tallanvor snapped i can see that you still think of him even after what he did to you i leave my heart here but you left yours in caemlyn from the corner of her eye she could see him turn away whatever it is you saw in him i dont have it im only a simple common idiot of a guardsman who cant say the right words you fawned over gaebril and he all but ignored you thats how love is bloody ashes ive all but done the same thing with you she said nothing well he said thats why i have to go youre safe now and thats all that matters light help me but thats still all that i care about he began to walk away feet crunching twigs gaebril was one of the forsaken she said the crunching twigs stopped he was really rahvin she continued he took over andor through use of the one power forcing people to do as he said tallanvor hissed twigs crunching as he hastened back to her are you certain certain no but it does make sense we cant ignore what is happening in the world tallanvor the weather the way food spoils in a heartbeat the movements of this rand althor he is no false dragon the forsaken must be loose again what would you do if you were one of them raise up an army and conquer or simply stroll into a palace and take the queen as your consort twist her mind so that she lets you do as you wish youd gain the resources of an entire nation all with minimal effort barely a finger raised she raised her head and stared off into the distance northward toward andor they call it compulsion a dark foul weave that removes the will from your subject im not supposed to know that it exists you say that i think of him that is true i think about him and hate him hate myself for what i let him do and a part of my heart knows that if he were to appear here and demand something from me id give it i couldnt help myself but this thing i feel for himthis thing that blends my desire and my hatred like two locks in a braidit is not love she turned and looked down at tallanvor i know love tallanvor and gaebril never had it from me i doubt that a creature like him could comprehend love tallanvor met her eyes his were dark gray soft and pure woman you give me that monster hope again be wary of what lies at your feet i need time to think would you refrain for now from going to tear he bowed morgase if you want anything from meanythingall you ever need to do is ask i thought i made that clear ill remove my name from the list he withdrew morgase watched him her mind a tempest despite the stillness of the trees and pond before her chapter the end of a legend at night gawyn couldnt see the white towers wounds in darkness one couldnt tell the difference between a beautifully intricate mural and a wall full of mismatched tiles at night the most beautiful of tar valons buildings became another dark lump and at night the holes and scars on the white tower were patched with a bandage of darkness of course on a night as dark as these clouds caused one also couldnt tell the towers color white or black at night it didnt really matter gawyn walked the white tower grounds wearing stiff trousers and coat of red and gold like a uniform but of no specific allegiance he didnt seem to have a specific allegiance these days almost unconsciously he found himself walking toward the eastern tower entrance as if to climb up to egwenes sleeping chambers he set his jaw turning the other way he should have been sleeping but after nearly a week of guarding egwenes door at night he wasas soldiers liked to sayon a midnight lunch perhaps he could have stayed in his rooms to relax but his quarters in the white towers barracks felt confining nearby two small feral cats stalked through tufts of grass eyes reflecting the torchlight of a guard post the cats hunkered low watching him as if consideringfor a brief momentwhether or not hed be worth attacking an unseen owl cruised in the air above the only evidence of its passing a solitary feather that floated down it was easier to pretend at night some men lived their entire lives that way preferring the curtains of darkness to the open windows of daylight because they let them see the world all in shadow it was summer now but though the day had been hot the night was strangely cold he shivered at a passing breeze there hadnt been any murders since the death of that unfortunate white when would the killer strike again heor shecould be moving through the hallways at this moment searching for a solitary aes sedai as those cats searched for mice egwene had sent him away from her door but that didnt mean he couldnt be on the watch what good was it to walk the grounds he should be indoors where he had a chance of doing some good gawyn made his way to one of the servant entrances the lowceilinged hallway inside was clean and well lit like the rest of the tower though the floor was set with dull gray slate instead of glazed tiles an open room to his right resounded with laughter and chatting offduty guardsmen enjoying time with their comrades gawyn gave them barely a glance but then froze he looked back in recognizing some of the men mazone celark zang what are you men about the three looked up with alarm then chagrin they were among about a dozen younglings who were dicing and smoking pipes with the offduty tower guardsmen the younglings stumbled to their feet and gave salutes though he was no longer their commander they didnt seem to realize that celark foremost among them hastened over to gawyn he was a lean fellow with light brown hair and thick fingers my lord he said nothing important my lord just a little harmless fun the warders dont like this kind of behavior gawyn said you know that celark if it gets around that youre staying up this late dicing youll never convince an aes sedai to take you celark grimaced yes my lord there was something reluctant in that grimace what gawyn said out with it man well my lord celark said its that some of us we arent so sure that we want to be warders not all of us came here for that you know some were like you wanting to train with the best and the rest of us well things have changed now what things gawyn asked foolish things my lord the man said looking down youre right of course theres early sparring tomorrow but well weve seen war were soldiers now being a warder its all a man should aspire to but some of us wed rather not see what we have now end you know gawyn nodded slowly when i first came to the tower celark said i wanted nothing more than to be a warder now i dont know that i want to spend my life protecting one woman solitary roving about the countryside you could be warder to a brown or white gawyn said and stay in the tower celark frowned with all respect my lord i think that might be just as bad warders they dont live like other men thats for certain gawyn said eyes lifting upward toward egwenes distant quarters he would not go seeking that door he forced his gaze back down to celark theres no shame in choosing a different path the others make it sound like there is the others are wrong gawyn said gather those of you who want to remain with the younglings and report to captain chubain tomorrow ill speak with him ill wager he could use you as a division in the tower guard he lost a lot of men in the seanchan attack celark relaxed visibly youd do that my lord of course it was an honor to lead you men do you think maybe you could join with us the youths voice was hopeful gawyn shook his head ive another path to take but the light willing ill end up close enough to keep an eye on you he nodded toward the room go back to your games ill speak to makzim for you as well makzim was the stern thickarmed warder currently leading the training sessions celark nodded gratefully hurrying back to the others gawyn continued down the corridor wishing his choices were as easy as those of his men lost in thought hed climbed halfway to egwenes rooms before he stopped to realize what he was doing need something to distract me the hour wasnt too late perhaps he could find bryne and chat gawyn made his way to brynes rooms if gawyn had a strange position among the aes sedai brynes was nearly as odd warder to the former amyrlin general of egwenes conquering army and renowned great captain brynes door was open a crack emitting a line of light across the bluetiled corridor that was his habit when he was in and awake should one of his officers need him many nights bryne was away staying at one of his command centers around the island or in a nearby village gawyn knocked softly come brynes voice was firm and familiar gawyn slipped in then returned the door to its cracked position bryne sat at a ricketylooking desk working on a letter he glanced at gawyn just a moment gawyn waited the walls were papered with maps of tar valon andor cairhien and surrounding regions many bore recent notations in red chalk bryne was preparing for war the notations made it clear he felt hed eventually have to defend tar valon itself against trollocs several maps showed villages across the northern part of the countryside listing their fortificationsif anyand their loyalty to tar valon theyd be used for supply dumps and forward positions another map had circles pointing out ancient watchtowers fortifications and ruins there was a methodical inevitability to brynes calculations and a sense of urgency he wasnt looking to build fortifications but to use those already in place he was moving troops into the villages he felt most useful another map showed progress in active recruitment it wasnt until gawyn stood theresmelling the musty scent of old paper and burning candlesthat he felt the reality of the impending war it was coming soon the dragon would break the seals of the dark ones prison the place he had told egwene to meet him the field of merrilor was marked in bright red on the maps it was north on the border of shienar the dark one loose upon the world light it made gawyns own problems insignificant bryne finished his letter sanding the paper folding it and reaching for his wax and seal its a little late for calling on people son i know but i thought you might be up and so i am bryne dribbled wax onto the letter what is it you need advice gawyn said sitting on a stool unless its about the best way to quarter a group of men or how to fortify a hilltop youll find my advice lacking but what is it you want to talk about egwene forbade me to protect her im certain the amyrlin had her reasons bryne said calmly sealing the letter foolish ones gawyn said she has no warder and there is a killer in the tower one of the forsaken he thought both true bryne said but what does that have to do with you she needs my protection did she ask for your protection no indeed as i recall she didnt ask you to come with her into the tower either nor did she ask for you to begin following her about like a hound that has lost his master but she needs me gawyn said interesting the last time you thought that youwith my helpupset weeks worth of her work to reunite the white tower sometimes son our help is not needed no matter how freely offered or how urgent that help may seem gawyn folded his arms unable to lean against the wall lest he disturb a map showing orchards across the surrounding countryside one village near dragonmount was circled four times for some reason so your advice is to let her remain exposed perhaps to take a knife in the back i havent given any advice bryne said leafing through some reports on his desk his firm face lit by flickering candlelight i have only made observations though i think it curious that you conclude that you should leave her alone i bryne she doesnt make sensel the corner of brynes mouth raised in a wry smile he lowered his papers turning to gawyn i warned you that my advice would be of little use im not sure if there are answers that will suit you but let me ask this what is it you want gawyn trakand egwene he said immediately i want to be her warder well which is it gawyn frowned do you want egwene or do you want to be her warder to be her warder of course and and well to marry her i love her bryne it seems to me that those are two different things similar but separate but other than things to do with egwene what is it that you want nothing gawyn said shes everything well theres your problem how is that a problem i love her so you said bryne regarded gawyn one arm on the table the other resting on his leg gawyn resisted the urge to squirm beneath that gaze you always were the passionate one gawyn like your mother and your sister impulsive never calculating like your brother galad doesnt calculate gawyn said he just acts no bryne said perhaps i spoke wronggalad may not be calculating but he isnt impulsive to be impulsive is to act without careful thought galad has given everything a great deal of thought hes worked out his code of morality that way he can act quickly and decisively because hes already determined what to do you act with passion you dont act because of the way you think but because of the way you feel in a rush with a snap of emotion that gives you strength you can act when you need to then sort through the ramifications later your instincts are usually good just like your mothers were but because of that youve never had to face what to do when your instincts lead you in the wrong direction gawyn found himself nodding but son bryne said leaning forward a man is more than one drive one goal no woman wants that in a man it seems to me that men who spend time making something of themselvesrather than professing their devotionare the ones who get somewhere both with women and with life itself bryne rubbed his chin so if i have advice for you its this find out who you would be without egwene and then figure out how to fit her into that i think thats what a woman youre an expert on women now a new voice asked gawyn turned surprised to find siuan sanche pushing open the door bryne didnt miss a beat youve been there listening long enough siuan to know thats not what the conversation was about siuan snorted bustling into the room with a pot of tea you should be in bed she said ignoring gawyn after a cursory glance very true bryne said casually oddly the needs of the land dont submit to my whims maps can be studied in the morning and they can be studied at night and during the afternoon every hour i spend could mean leagues of ground defended if trollocs break through siuan sighed loudly handing him a cup then pouring the tea which smelled of cloudberry it was decidedly odd to see siuanwho because of her stilling looked like a woman gawyns agemothering the grizzled general bryne siuan turned to gawyn as bryne accepted his drink and you gawyn trakand she said ive been meaning to speak to you giving orders to the amyrlin telling her what she should do honestly men seem to think that women are nothing more than their personal messengers sometimes you dream up all sorts of ridiculous schemes then expect us to somehow carry them out she eyed him not looking like she expected any response other than an ashamed lowering of the eyes gawyn gave that and then made a hasty exit to avoid further bullying he wasnt surprised by anything bryne had said the man was nothing if not consistent and he had repeated the same themes to gawyn before think instead of being impulsive be deliberate but hed spent weeks thinking his ideas chasing one another in circles like flies trapped in a jar hed gotten nowhere gawyn walked the hallways noting chubains guards posted at regular intervals he told himself he wasnt climbing to egwene he was merely checking on the guards and yet he soon found himself in a hallway near the amyrlins quarters just one hallway over hed check on her quickly and gawyn froze what am i doing he thought a lot of his nervousness tonight came from not knowing if egwene was properly guarded or not he wouldnt be able to sleep untilno he told himself forcefully this time ill do as she asks he turned to go a sound made him hesitate glancing over his shoulder footfalls and clothing rustling it was too late for novices but servants might well be delivering late meals bryne and gawyn werent the only ones who kept unusual hours in the white tower it came again so soft barely audible frowning gawyn slipped off his boots then sneaked forward to glance around the corner there was nothing egwenes doorinlaid with gold in the shape of avendesorasat closed the hallway empty sighing gawyn shook his head leaning back against the wall to slip his boots back on he wished egwene would at least let chubain set guards at her room leaving it unwatched wassomething moved in the shadow just down from egwenes doorway gawyn froze there wasnt much of a dark patch there only a shadow a few inches wide made by an alcove but as he studied that patch he had trouble keeping his eyes on it his gaze slid free like a dollop of butter on a hot turnip it seemed it seemed that the darkness was larger than he had originally thought why couldnt he look straight at it there was a flash of movement and something spun in the air gawyn threw himself to the side and steel struck stone one boot on he dropped the other as he pulled his sword free the knife that had been thrown for his heart skidded across the tiled floor gawyn peered round the corner tense someone was fleeing down the hallway someone wearing all black a hood over the head gawyn took off after the person sword held before him arms pumping gait awkward as his unbooted foot hit opposite his booted one the assassin was extremely fast gawyn bellowed the alarm his voice echoing through the silent halls of the tower then he cut left the assassin would have to turn and come up the hallway here to the right gawyn burst into another hallway charging on a heading that would cut off the assassin he skidded around the corner the hallway was empty had the assassin doubled back gawyn cursed as he ran forward and reached the original hallway at the other end it was empty a doorway perhaps all would be dead ends if gawyn waited until help came no gawyn thought spinning darkness look for darkness there was a deep patch of it by a doorframe to his left far too small to hold anyone but he had that same sense of disorientation as he looked at it a person leaped out swinging a sword for gawyns head he whipped his blade into cutting the reeds knocking aside the attack the assassin was much shorter than gawyn so he should have had a strong advantage in reach yet the assassin moved with a blurring speed sword darting at gawyn in a series of thrusts not using any sword forms gawyn recognized gawyn fell into twisting the wind as he was forced to act as if he were surrounded he barely kept the attacker at bay he could hear yells in the distanceguards responding to his call he shouted again he could sense frustration in the attackers moves the assassin had expected to defeat gawyn quickly well gawyn had expected the same but focusing on this opponent was very difficult gawyns blowswhen he could make themhit air when they should have landed on flesh gawyn twisted to the side raising his blade for boar rushes down the mountain but that gave the assassin an opening he flung another knife at gawyn forcing him to the side the knife clanged against the wall and the assassin fled down the hallway gawyn rushed after but he couldnt keep up soon the assassin was far away darting to the left that direction led to a series of intersections such speed gawyn thought stopping breathing in and out in gasps hands on knees it isnt natural two of chubains guards arrived a moment later swords at the ready gawyn pointed assassin listening at egwenes door went that way one ran where he pointed the other went to raise the general alarm light gawyn thought what if i didnt interrupt him listening what if i interrupted him on his way out gawyn dashed to egwenes door fatigue evaporating sword out he tested the door it was unlocked egwene he cried throwing the door open and leaping into the room there was a sudden explosion of light and a crashing sound gawyn found himself wrapped up in something strong invisible cords towing him into the air his sword fell to the ground and his mouth filled with an unseen force and so it was that he found himself hanging from the ceiling disarmed struggling as the amyrlin herself walked from her bedroom she was alert and fully dressed in a crimson dress trimmed with gold she did not look pleased mat sat beside the inns hearth wishing the fire were a little less warm he could feel its heat through the layers of his ragged jacket and white shirt matched by a pair of workmans thick trousers the boots on his feet had good soles but the sides were worn he did not wear his hat and his scarf was pulled up around the bottom half of his face as he leaned back in the mountain oak chair elayne still had his medallion he felt naked without it he had a shortsword sitting by his chair but that was mostly for show a walking staff leaned innocently beside it he would rather use that or the knives hidden in his coat but a sword was more visible and would make the footpads who sauntered through the streets of low caemlyn think twice i know why youre asking after him chet said there was a man like chet in nearly every tavern old enough to have seen men like mat be born grow up and die and willing to talk of all those years if you got enough drink in them or often if you didnt the stubble on chets long face was dappled silver and he wore a lopsided cap his patched coat had once been black and the redandwhite insignia on his pocket was too faded to read it was vaguely military and one did not usually get scars like the thick angry one on his cheek and neck from a bar fight aye chet continued many are askin after the leader of that band well this mug of ale is appreciated so let me give you some advice you walk like you know which end of that sword means business but youd be a fool to challenge that one prince of ravens lord of luck he faced old death himself and diced for his future he did aint never lost a fight mat said nothing he leaned back in his chair this was his fourth tavern this night and in three of them he had been able to find rumors about matrim cauthon barely a lick of truth to them blood and bloody ashes oh sure there were tales of other people too most about rand each one making the colors swirl when he heard them tear had fallen to the seanchan no illian no rand had defeated them all and was fighting the last battle right now no he visited women in their sleep getting them with child no that was the dark one no mat was the dark one bloody stories they were supposed leave mat alone some he could trace back to the bandlike the story of a city full of the dead awakening but many of the people claimed that the stories had come from their uncle or cousin or nephew mat flicked chet a copper the man tipped his hat politely and went to get himself another drink mat did not feel like drinking he had a suspicion that those pictures of him were part of why the stories were spreading so quickly in the last tavern he had visited someone had actually pulled out a copy of the sketchfolded and wrinkledand shown it to him nobody had recognized him so far though the hearthfire continued to crackle low caemlyn was growing and enterprising men had realized that providing rooms and drinks for the transients could make a healthy profit so shanties had started to become taverns and those had begun to grow into full inns wood was in high demand and many of the mercenary bands had taken to woodcutting some worked honestly paying the queens levy for claims others worked less legally there had already been hangings for it who would have thought men hanging for poaching trees what next men hanging for stealing dirt low caemlyn had changed drastically roads springing up buildings being enlarged a few years and low caemlyn would be a city itself theyd have to build another wall to close it in the room smelled of dirt and sweat but no more so than other taverns spills were quickly cleaned up and the serving girls looked eager to have work one in particular gave him a quiet smile refilling his mug and showing some ankle mat made sure to remember her she would be good for talmanes mat lifted up his scarf enough to drink he felt like a fool wearing the scarf this way but it was too hot for a hooded cloak and the beard had been torture even with the scarf on his face he did not stand out too much in low caemlyn he was not the only tough walking around with his face obscured he explained that he had a bad scar he wanted to cover others assumed he had a bounty on his head both were actually true unfortunately he sat for a time staring into the dancing flames of the hearth chets warning caused an uncomfortable pit to open in mats stomach the greater his reputation grew the more likely he would be challenged there would be great notoriety in killing the prince of the ravens where had they gotten that name blood and bloody ashes a figure joined him at the fire lanky and bony noal looked like a scarecrow who had dusted himself off and decided to go to town despite his white hair and leathery face noal was as spry as men half his age when he was handling a weapon anyway other times he seemed as clumsy as a mule in a dining parlor youre quite the notable man noal said to mat holding out his palms to the fire when you stumbled across me in ebou dar i had no idea what illustrious company id find myself in give this a few more months and youll be more famous than jain farstrider mat hunkered down farther into his chair men always think it would be a grand to be known in every tavern and every city noal said softly but burn me if it isnt just a headache what do you know of it jain complained about it noal said softly mat grunted thorn arrived next he was dressed as a merchants servant wearing a blue outfit that was not too fine but also not in disrepair he was claiming to have come to low caemlyn to determine whether his master would be well advised to put a shopfront here thorn pulled off the disguise with aplomb waxing his mustaches to points and speaking with a faint murandian accent mat had offered to come up with a backstory for his act but thorn had coughed and said that he already had one worked out flaming liar of a gleeman thorn pulled up a chair seating himself delicately as if he were a servant who thought highly of himself ah what a waste of my time this was my master insists that i associate with such rabble as this and here i find the worst of the lot noal chuckled softly if only thorn said dramatically i had been instead sent to the camp of the majestic amazing indestructible famous matrim cauthon then i would certainly have burn me thorn mat said let a man suffer in peace thorn laughed waving over the serving girl and buying drinks for the three of them he gave her an extra coin and quietly asked her to keep casual ears from getting too close to the hearth are you sure you want to meet here noal asked itll do mat said he did not want to be seen back in camp lest the gholam look there for him all right then noal said we know where the tower is and can get there assuming mat procures us a gateway i will mat said i havent been able to find anyone who has gone inside noal continued some say its haunted thorn said taking a slurp from his mug others say its a relic from the age of legends the sides are said to be of smooth steel without an opening i did find a captains widows younger son who once heard a story of someone who found great treasures in the tower he didnt say how the lad had gotten in though we know how to get in mat said olvers story noal asked skeptically its the best we have mat said look the game and the rhyme are about the aelfinn and eelfinn people knew about them once those bloody archways are proof of that so they left the game and the rhyme as warning that game cant be won mat noal said rubbing his leathery chin and thats the point of it you need to cheat but maybe we should try a deal thorn said playing with the waxed tip of a mustache they did give you answers to your questions bloody frustrating ones mat said he had not wanted to tell thorn and noal about his questionshe still had not told them what he had asked but they did answer thorn said it sounds like they had some kind of deal with the aes sedai if we knew what it was the aes sedai had that the snakes and foxes wantedthe reason they were willing to bargain then maybe we could trade it to them for moiraine if shes still alive noal said grimly she is thorn said staring straight ahead light send it she has to be alive we know what they want mat glanced at those flames what noal asked us mat replied look they can see whats going to happen they did it to me they did it to moiraine if that letter is any clue they knew she would leave a letter for you thorn they knew it and they still answered her questions maybe they had to thorn said yes but they dont have to answer straightforwardly mat said they didnt with me they answered knowing she would come back to them and they gave me what they did knowing id get pulled back too they want me they want us you dont know that for certain mat thom set his mug of ale on the floor between his feet and got out his pipe to mats right men cheered a dice game they can answer questions but that doesnt mean they know everything could be like aes sedai foretellings mat shook his head the creatures put memories into his head he figured they were the memories of people who had touched the tower or been into it the aelfinn and the eelfinn had those memories and burn him they probably had his too could they watch him see through his eyes he wished again for his medallion though it would do no good against them they were not aes sedai they would not use channeling they do know things thom mat said theyre watching we wont surprise them makes them hard to defeat then thom said lighting a tinder twig with the fire then using it to light his pipe we cant win unless we break the rules mat repeated but theyll know what were doing thom said if what you say is true so we should trade with them and what did moiraine say thom mat said in that letter you read every night thom puffed on his pipe raising an absent hand to his breast pocket where he kept the letter she said to remember what we knew of the game she knows theres no way to win when dealing with them mat said no trades thom no bargains we go in fighting and we dont leave until we have her thom hesitated for a moment then nodded his pipe beginning to puff courage to strengthen noal said well we have enough of that with mats luck you dont have to be part of this you know noal mat said you have no reason to risk yourself on this im going noal said ive seen a lot of places most places actually but never this one he hesitated its something i need to do and thats the end of it very well mat said fire to blind noal said what do we have lanterns and torches mat said knocking his foot against the sack beside his chair and some of those firesticks from aludra so we can light them a few surprises from her too fireworks noal asked and a few of those exploding cylinders we used against the seanchan she calls them roarsticks thorn whistled she let you have some two when i presented her with elaynes agreement she was ready to let me have almost anything i asked for mat grimaced she wanted to come along to light them herself burn me but that was a tough argument to end but weve got a whole lot of nightflowers he tapped the sack beside his chair with the edge of his foot you brought them thorn asked i wanted to keep them close mat said and she only gave them to me today theyre not going to explode by accident thorn that doesnt happen very often well at least move them back from the hearth thorn said he glanced at his pipe and cursed then scooted his chair a few inches from mat next noal said music to dazzle i got us a variety thorn said ill bring my harp and flute but i found us some hand drums and hand cymbals they can be strapped to the side of your leg and hit with one hand i also bought an extra flute he eyed mat a simple one designed for those with thick slow fingers mat snorted and finally iron to bind noal said sliding forward a pack of his own it clinked faintly as he untied the top the contents reflecting the deep orange hearthlight a set of throwing knives for each of us and two shortswords each of pure iron no steel i got us some chains too and a band of iron to clip around the butt of mats spear it might throw the weight off though ill take it mat said noal did up his pack again and the three of them sat before the hearth for a time in a way these things theyd gathered were an illusion a way to reassure themselves that they were doing something to prepare but mat remembered those twisted places beyond the gateways the angles that were not right the unnatural landscape the creatures called snakes and foxes because they defied standard description that place was another world the preparations he did with thorn and noal might help but they might also be useless there was no telling until they stepped into that tower it felt like not knowing if you had the right antidote until after the snakes teeth were already clamped down on your eventually he bade the other two a good night noal wanted to head back to the bands camp which was now only a tenminute ride from the city thorn agreed to go with him and they took mats pack full of nightflowersthough both men looked as if they would rather be carrying a sack full of spiders mat belted his sword on over his coat took up his staff then headed back toward his inn he did not go directly there though and instead found himself trailing through the alleys and streets shanties and tents had sprung up beside solid buildings as the cityoutsidethecity spread along the walls like mold growing on a loaf of bread the sky was dark but the night was still busy touts calling from within the lit doorways of inns mat made sure the shortsword was visible there were many who would think to exploit a lone wanderer at night particularly outside the city walls where the arm of the law was a little on the flabby side the air smelled of impending rain but it often did these days he wished it would go on and storm or bloody clear up it felt as if the air were holding its breath waiting for something a blow that never fell a bell that never rang a set of dice that never stopped spinning just like the ones that thundered in his head he felt at the letter from verin in his pocket would the dice stop if he opened it maybe it was about the gbolam if he did not retrieve his medallion from elayne soon the thing was likely to find him and rip his insides out bloody ashes he felt like going drinking forgetting who he was and who people thought he wasfor a while but if he got drunk he was likely to let his face show by accident perhaps begin to talk about who he really was you never could tell what a man would do when he was drunk even if that man was your own self he made his way through the city gates and into the new city the air began to mist with something that was not quite rain as if the sky had listened to his rant and had decided to allow a little sneeze to spray down on him wonderful he thought bloody wonderful the paving stones soon grew wet from the notrain and the streetlamps glowed with balls of vaporous haze mat hunkered down scarf still covering his face as if he were a bloody aielman had he not been too hot only a little bit ago he was as eager as thom to move on and find moiraine she had made a mess of his life but mat supposed he owed her for that better to live in this mess than to be trapped back in the two rivers living a boring life without realizing how boring it was mat was not like perrin who had mooned over leaving the two rivers before they had even gotten to baerion an image of perrin flashed in his head and mat banished it and what of rand mat saw him sitting on a fine chair staring down at the floor in front of himself in a dark room a single lamp flickering he looked worn and exhausted his eyes wide his expression grim mat shook his head to dispel that image as well poor rand the man probably thought he was a bloody blackferret or something by now gnawing on pinecones but it was likely a blackferret that wanted to live back in the two rivers no mat did not want to go back there was no tuon back in the two rivers light well he would have to figure out what to do with tuon but he did not want to be rid of her if she were still with him he would let her call him toy without complaining well not much anyway moiraine first he wished he knew more about the aelfinn and eelfinn and their bloody tower nobody knew about it nobody spoke more than legends nobody had anything useful to say nobody but birgitte mat stopped in the street birgitte she had been the one to tell olver how to get into the tower how had she known cursing himself for a fool he turned toward the inner city the streets were emptying of the traffic that had burdened them before the almostrain began soon mat felt he had the whole city to himself even the cutpurses and beggars withdrew for some reason that put him on edge more than being stared at it was not natural someone should have tried at least to bloody shadow him to see if he was worth picking off once again he longed for his medallion he had been an idiot to give that away better to have cut off his own bloody hand and offered that to elayne as payment was the gholam there in that darkness somewhere there should have been toughs on the street cities were full of them that was practically one of the bloody requirements for a city a town hall a few inns and a tavern and several bluntfaced fellows whose only desire was to pound you into the mud and spend your coin on drink and womenhe passed a courtyard and headed through the masons gate into the inner city the white archway almost seeming to glow rainslick in the phantom light of the clouded moon mats quarterstaff knocked against the paving stones the gate guards were huddled and quiet in their cloaks like statues not men at all the entire place felt like a tomb a ways past the gate he passed an alleyway and hesitated he thought he could see a group of shadowy forms inside tall buildings rose on either side grand ogier masonry a grunt sounded from inside the alleyway a robbery mat said with relief a hulking figure looked back out of the alleyway moonlight revealed fellow with dark eyes and a long cloak he seemed stunned to find mat nding there he pointed with a thickfingered hand and three of his companions made for mat mat relaxed wiping his brow free of rainwater so there were footpads out this night what a relief he had been jumping at nothing a thug swung his cudgel at mat mat had worn the shortsword on the right side intentionally the thug took the bait assuming that mat would move to draw the weapon instead mat brought up the quarterstaff swiftly snapping the butt against the mans leg the footpad stumbled and mat swung into the mans head the drizzle which was nearly a proper rain by now sprayed off the cutpurse as he fell tripping one of his companions mat stepped back and slammed the top of the quarterstaff down on the head of the tripping thug he went down on top of his companion the third man looked back toward his leader who held to the collar of a gangly man mat could barely make out in the shadows mat took the opportunity to leap over the small pile of unconscious thugs swinging at the third man the footpad brought his cudgel up to protect his head so mat slammed his quarterstaff into the mans foot he then swung the quarterstaff knocking aside the third mans weak parry and dropped him with a blow to the face mat casually flipped a knife toward the leader of the gang who was charging forward the leader gurgled stumbled in the drizzle clawing at the knife in his neck the others mat would leave unconsciouspoor fools maybe they would take this warning and reform mat stepped to the side as the leader stumbled past then finally collapsed on top of his three companions mat kicked him over pulled out the knife then cleaned it finally he glanced at the victim of the robbery sure am glad to see you mat said you you are the man asked sure am mat said standing up straight i thought the thieves were not out tonight a city without cutpurses well thats like a field without weeds and if there were no weeds what would you need a farmer for bloody inhospitable i tell you the rescued man stumbled forward on shaky feet he seemed confused by what mat had said but he scrambled up taking mats hand thank you the man had a nasal voice thank you so so much in the faint moonlight mat could barely make out a wide face with buck teeth atop an awkwardly thin body mat shrugged setting aside his staff and unwinding his scarfwhich was getting soddenand beginning to wring it free id stay away from traveling by yourself at night if i were you friend the man squinted in the darkness you he said voice nearly a squeak mat groaned blood and bloody ashes cant i go anywhere without he cut off as the man lunged a dagger flashing in the faint moonlight mat cursed and snapped his scarf in front of him the dagger hit the cloth instead of mats gut and mat quickly twisted his hands tying the assassins dagger in lengths of cloth the man yelped and mat released the scarf and pulled out a pair of knives one in each hand releasing them by reflex they took the assassin in the eyes one in each eye light mat had not been aiming for the eyes the man collapsed to the wet paving stones mat stood breathing in and out mothers milk in a cup mothers bloody milk he grabbed his quarterstaff glancing about him but the gloomy street was empty i rescued you i rescued you and you try to stab me mat knelt down beside the corpse then grimly certain what he would find he fished in the mans pouch he came out with a couple of coins gold coinsand a foldedup piece of paper moonlight revealed mats face on it he crinkled the paper and shoved it in his pocket one in each bloody eye better than the man deserved mat retied his scarf grabbed his knives then walked out onto the street wishing he had left the assassin to his fate birgitte folded her arms leaning against a marble pillar and watching as elayne sat enjoying an evening presentation of players groups like this acting out storieshad become very popular in cairhien and were now trying to achieve the same success in andor one of the palace halls where bards performed had been adapted to allow the players to act out their stories birgitte shook her head what was the good of acting out fake stories why not go live a few stories of your own besides shed prefer a bard any day helpfully this fashion of seeing players would die quickly this particular story was a retelling of the tragic marriage and death of the princess walishen slain by beasts of the shadow birgitte was familiar with the ballad that the players had adapted to form their story in fact they sang parts of it during the performance it was remarkable how little that song had changed over the years some different names a few different notes but the same overall much like her own lives repeated over and over but with little variations sometimes she was a soldier sometimes she was a forest woman with no formal military training shed been a general once or twice unfortunately shed rather leave that particular job for someone else shed been a guard a noble thief a lady a peasant a killer and a savior but she had never before been a warder the unfamiliarity didnt bother her in most of her lives she had no knowledge of what had come before what she could draw from her previous lives now was a boon yes but she had no right to those memories that didnt stop her heart from twisting each time one of those memories faded light if she couldnt be with gaidal this time around couldnt she at least remember him it was as if the pattern didnt know what to do with her shed been forced into this life shoving other threads aside taking an unexpected place the pattern was trying to weave her in what would happen when all of the memories faded would she remember waking up as an adult with no history the thought terrified her as no battlefield ever had she nodded to one of her guardswomen kaila bent who passed by the back row of the makeshift theater and saluted well birgitte asked stepping around the corner to speak with kaila nothing to report kaila said all is well she was a lanky firehaired woman and had taken very easily to wearing the trousers and coat of a guardswoman or all is as well as it could be while having to suffer through the death of princess walishen stop complaining birgitte said suppressing a wince as the divaso the players called herbegan a particularly shrill ariaso they called a song by yourself why did the players need so many new names for things you could be out patrolling in the rain i could kaila asked sounding eager why didnt you say so sooner maybe ill get struck by lightning that might be preferable birgitte snorted get back to your rounds kaila saluted and left birgitte tuned back into the theater leaning against the pillar perhaps she should have brought some wax to stuff in her ears she glanced over at elayne the queen sat with a calm demeanor watching the play at times birgitte felt more like a nursemaid than a bodyguard how did you protect a woman who seemed at times so determined to see herself dead and yet elayne was also so very capable like tonight shed somehow convinced her most bitter rival to attend this play that was ellorien sitting over in the eastern row the womans last parting from the palace had been so bitter that birgitte hadnt expected her to return unless she was in chains yet here she was it whispered of a political maneuver by elayne that was thirteen steps more subtle than birgitte had a mind for she shook her head elayne was a queen volatility and all shed be good for andor assuming birgitte could keep that goldenhaired head from being lopped off its neck after some time suffering through the singing kaila approached again birgitte stood up straight curious at the womans quick pace what she asked quietly you looked bored kaila whispered so i thought id bring this to you disturbance at the plum gate that was the southeastern entrance to the palace grounds someone tried to sneak through another beggar looking for scraps or a spy for one of the lordlings hoping to listen in i dont know kaila said i heard the news thirdhand from calison as we passed on patrol he said the guardsmen have the intruder in custody at the gate birgitte glanced to the side it looked like another solo was about to begin you have command here hold this post and take reports ill go stretch my legs and check on this disturbance bring me some wax for my ears when you come back would you birgitte chuckled leaving the theater and stepping into a whiteandred palace hallway though she had guardswomen and men with extra bows at the hallways birgitte herself carried a sword for an assassination attempt would most likely turn to closequarters fighting birgitte trotted down the hallway glancing out a window when she passed the sky leaked a strengthening drizzle utterly dreary gaidal would have liked this weather he loved the rain on occasion shed joked that drizzle suited his face better making him less likely to frighten children light but she missed that man the most direct route to the plum gate took her through the servants quarters in many palaces this would have meant entering a section of the building that was more drab meant for less important people but this building had been ogier built and they had particular views about such things the marble stonework here was as grand as it was elsewhere with tiled mosaics of red and white the rooms while small by royal standards were each large enough to hold an entire family birgitte generally preferred to take her meals in the servants large open dining hall four separate hearths crackled here in defiance of the dreary night and offduty servants and guards laughed and chatted some said you could judge a monarch by the way he treated those who served him if that were the case then the andoran palace had been designed in a way to encourage the best in its queens birgitte reluctantly passed by the inviting scents of food and instead pushing her way out into the cold summer storm the chill wasnt biting just uncomfortable she pulled up the hood of her cloak and crossed the slick paving down to the plum gate the gatehouse was alight with an orange glow and the guardsmen on watch stood outside in wet cloaks halberds held to the side birgitte marched up to the gatehouse water dripping from the lip of her hood then pounded on the thick oak door it opened revealing the baldheaded mustached face of renald macer sergeant on duty a stout man he had wide hands and a calm temperament she always thought he should be in a shop somewhere making shoes but the guard took all types and dependability was often more important than skill with the sword captaingeneral he exclaimed what are you doing here getting rained on she snapped oh my he stepped back making way for her to enter the gatehouse it had a single crowded room the soldiers were on storm shift meaning twice as many men would work the gate as usual but they would only have to stand outside an hour before rotating with the men warming inside the gatehouse three guardsmen sat at a table throwing dice into a dicing box while an openfronted iron stove consumed logs and warmed tea dicing with the tour soldiers was a wiry man with a black scarf wrapped around the bottom of his face his clothing was scruffy his head topped by a mop of wet brown hair kicking out in all directions brown eyes glanced at birgitte over the top of the scarf and the man sank down a little in his seat birgitte took off her cloak and shook it free of rainwater this is your intruder i assume why yes the sergeant said how did you hear about that she eyed the intruder he tried to sneak onto the palace grounds and now you re dicing with him the sergeant and the other men looked sheepish well my lady im no lady not this time at least i work for a living er yes macer continued well he gave up his sword readily and he doesnt seem that dangerous just another beggar wanting scraps from the kitchens right nice fellow thought wed get him warm before sending him out into that weather again a beggar she said with a sword sergeant macer scratched his head i guess that is kind of odd you could charm the helmet off a general on a battlefield couldnt you mat she said mat the man asked in a familiar voice i dont know what you mean my good woman my name is garard a simple beggar who has a quite interesting past if you care to listen to it she eyed him with a firm gaze oh bloody ashes birgitte he complained taking off the scarf i only wanted to get warm for a spell and win the coin off my men a friendly game never hurt a man mat said unless it was against you look why are you sneaking into the palace it took too much bloody work to get in last time mat said sitting back in his chair thought i might pass that up this time sergeant macer glanced at birgitte you know this man unfortunately she said you can release him to my custody sergeant ill see that master cauthon is properly taken care of master cauthon one of the men said you mean the raven prince oh for bloody mat said as he stood and picked up his walking staff thanks he said dryly to birgitte throwing on his coat she put her cloak back on then pushed open the door as one of the guards handed mat his sword belt still attached since when had mat carried a shorts word probably a decoy away from the quarterstaff the two stepped out into the rain as mat tied on the belt raven prince she asked i dont want to talk about it why not because im getting too bloody famous for my own good thats why wait until it tracks you across generations she said glancing up at the sky blinking as a raindrop hit her square in the eye come on lets go grab a drink mat said walking toward the gate wait she said dont you want to go see elayne elayne mat said blood and ashes birgitte im here to talk to you why do you think i let those guards catch me you want a drink or not she hesitated then shrugged by putting kaila on duty in her place birgitte had officially gone on break she knew a fairly decent tavern only two streets from the palace all right she said waving to the guards and leading mat onto the rainy street but ill need to have milk or tea instead of ale we arent sure if her warder drinking would be bad for the babies or not she smiled thinking of a drunk elayne trying to talk to her allies after the play though if i make her tipsy it might be good revenge for some of the things shes done to me i dont know why you let her bond you in the first place mat said the street was nearly empty around them though the tavern up ahead looked inviting its yellow light spilling into the street i didnt have a say in the matter she said but i dont regret it did you really sneak into the palace to meet with me mat shrugged i have some questions about what he replaced that ridiculous scarf which she noticed had a rip in the middle you know he said things mat was one of the few who knew who she really was he couldnt mean no she said turning i dont want to talk about it bloody ashes birgitte i need your information come on for an old friend we agreed to keep each others secrets and im not out blabbing yours mat said quickly but see theres this issue what issue the tower of ghenjei thats not an issue she said you stay away from it i cant of course you can its a flaming building mat it cant exactly chase you down very amusing look will you at least hear me out over a mug of er milk ill buy she stopped for a moment then she sighed bloody right youll buy she muttered waving him onward they entered the inn known as the grand hike which was crowded beyond usual because of the rain the innkeeper was a friend of birgittes however and he had the bouncer toss out a drunkard sleeping in one of the booths to make room for her she tossed him a coin in thanks and he nodded his ugly head to herhe was missing several teeth one eye and most of his hair bestlooking man in the place birgitte held up two fingers to order drinks he knew that she took milk these daysand she waved mat to the booth dont rightly think ive ever seen an uglier man than that innkeeper mat said as they sat you havent been alive long enough she said leaning back against the wall and putting her booted feet up on the table there was just room enough for her to do so sitting on the bench of the booth lengthwise if old snert were a few years younger and if someone thought to break his nose in a few places i might consider him hes got a fine chest nice and full of curly hair to get your fingers in mat grinned have i ever mentioned how odd it is to go drinking with a woman who talks about men like that she shrugged ghenjei why in the name of normad s ears are you wanting to go there whose ears mat asked answer me mat sighed then absently accepted his mug as the serving girl delivered it uncharacteristically he didnt slap her backside though he did give her a good leer as she walked away the bloody snakes and foxes have a friend of mine he said lowering his scarf and taking a pull on his drink leave him you cant save him mat if he was foolish enough to go into their realm he deserves what he got its a woman mat said ah birgitte thought bloody fool heroic but still a fool i cant leave her mat continued i owe her besides a good friend of mine is going in whether i want him to or not i have to help then theyll have all three of you birgitte said look if you go in through the portals then youre locked into the treaties they protect you to an extent but they also restrict you youll never get anywhere useful after entering by one of the archways and if you go in the other way mat asked you told olver how to open the tower because i was telling him a bedtime story light i never thought one of you sapforbrains would actually try to get in but if we go in that way can we find her mayaybe birgitte said but you wont the treaties wont be in effect so the aelnnn and eelfinn can draw blood normally you only have to worry about tricks with pits or ropes since they cant she trailed off glancing at him how did you get hanged anyway he flushed looking down into his drink they should post a flaming explanation on those archways step through here and they can bloody hang youand they will idiot birgitte snorted theyd talked about the memories he had she should have put it together if you go in the other way theyll probably try that as well shedding blood in their kingdom can have strange effects theyll try to break your bones with a fall or drug you to sleep and they will win mat its their world and if we cheat mat asked iron music fire thats not cheating thats being smart everyone with half a wit who enters through the tower carries those things but only one out of a thousand makes it back out mat he hesitated then fished a small handful of coins out of his pocket what do you think the odds are that if i toss these into the air they will all come up heads one in a thousand mat he tossed them above the table they came down in a spray hitting the tabletop not a single one of them bounced or rolled from the table onto the floor mat didnt look down at the coins he met her eyes as they all rolled and vibrated to a stop she glanced at them two dozen coins each had landed face up one in a thousand is good odds he said for me bloody ashes youre as bad as elayne dont you see all it takes is one wrong throw even you miss once in a while ill take the chance burn me birgitte i know its stupid but im doing it how do you know so much about the tower anyway youve been into it havent you i have she admitted mat looked smug well you got back out howd you manage it she hesitated then finally took up her mug of milk that legend didnt survive im assuming i dont know it mat said i went in to ask them to save the life of my love she said it came after the battle of lahpoint hills where we led the buchaner rebellion gaidal was wounded horribly a blow to the head that made him unable to think straight he forgot who i was some of the time it tore my heart so i took him to the tower to be healed and howd you get out mat asked howd you fool them i didnt birgitte said softly mat froze the eelfinn never healed him she continued they killed us both i didnt survive mat that is the end of that particular legend he fell silent oh he finally said well thats kind of a sad story then they cant all end in victory gaidal and i dont deal well with happy endings anyway better for us to burn out in glory she grimaced remembering one incarnation when she and he had been forced to grow old together peacefully most boring life shed ever known though at the timeignorant of her grander part in the patternshed been happy with it well im still going mat said she sighed i cant go with you mat not and leave elayne she has a death wish the size of your pride and i mean to see she survives i dont expect you to go mat said quickly burn me thats not what im asking and he frowned a death what the size of my what never mind she said drinking her milk she had a soft spot for milk though she didnt tell people of it of course shed be happy when she could drink again she missed old snerts yeasty drinks she liked ugly beer as much as she liked ugly men i came to you because i need help mat said what more is there to say youre taking iron fire and music iron will hurt them ward them and hold them fire will scare them and kill them music will entrance them but youll find that both fire and music grow less and less effective the longer you use them the tower isnt a place its a portal a kind of gate to the crossroads between their realms youll find both of them there aelfinn snakes and eelfinn foxes assuming theyre working together currently they have a strange relationship but what do they want mat asked from us i mean why do they care emotion birgitte said thats why they built portals into our world thats why they entice us in they feed off what we feel they like aes sedai in particular for some reason perhaps those with the one power taste like a strong ale mat shivered visibly the inside will be confusing birgitte said getting anywhere specific in there is difficult going in through the tower instead of the archways put me in danger but i knew that if i could reach that grand hall id be able to make a deal you dont get anything free if you go in the tower by the way theyll ask for something something dear to you anyway i figured out a method to find the grand hall iron dust left behind me in the intersections where id passed so that i knew which ways id gone before they couldnt touch it you see and are you sure youve never heard this story mat shook his head it used to be popular around these parts she said frowning a hundred years ago or so you sound offended it was a good story she said if i survive ill have thorn compose a bloody ballad about it birgitte tell me about the dust did your plan work she shook her head i still got lost i dont know if they blew away the dust somehow or if the place is so huge that i never repeated myself i ended up cornered my fire going out my lyre broken my bowstring snapped gaidal unconscious behind me he could walk some of the days in there but was too dizzy on others so i pulled him on the litter id brought some of the days mat said how long were you in there i had provisions for two months birgitte said grimacing dont know how long we lasted after those ran out bloody ashes mat said then took a long swig of his ale i told you not to go in birgitte said assuming you do reach your friend youll never get back out you can wander for weeks in that place and never turn right or left keep going straight passing hallway after hallway all the same the grand hall could be minutes away if you knew which direction to take but youll keep missing it mat stared into his mug perhaps wishing hed ordered something more potent you reconsidering she asked no he said but when we get out moiraine better bloody appreciate this two months he frowned wait if you both died in there how did the story get out she shrugged never did find out perhaps one of the aes sedai used their questions to ask everyone knew id gone in i was called jethari moondancer then youre sure youve never heard the story he shook his head again she sighed settling back well not every one of the tales about her could live on forever but shed thought that one would stand for a few more generations she raised her mug to drink the last of her milk the mug never got there she froze when she felt a jolt of emotion from elayne anger fury pain birgitte slammed the mug down on the table then threw coins down and stood up cursing what mat said on his feet in an eyeblink elayne in trouble again shes hurt bloody ashes mat snapped grabbing his coat and staff as they ran for the exit chapter foxheads elayne turned the strange medallion around in her fingers tracing the foxs head worked into the front as with many terangreal it was difficult to tell exactly what kind of metal had been used to create it originally she suspected silver with the senses of her talent however the medallion was no longer silver it was something else something new the songmistress of the lucky mans theater troop continued her song it was beautiful pure and high elayne sat on a cushioned chair on the right side of the hall which had been repurposed with a raised area at the front for the players a pair of birgittes guards stood behind her the room was dim lit only by a line of small flickering lamps set behind blue glass in alcoves on the walls the blue light was overwhelmed by the burning yellow lanterns set around the front of the platform elayne was barely paying attention she had often listened to the death of princess walishen as a ballad and didnt really see the point of adding words to it and different players instead of just having one bard do the entire thing but it was elloriens favorite ballad and the favorable news out of cairhien about these playerswhich nobles there had recently discoveredhad many of the nobles in andor buzzing hence this evening ellorien had come at elaynes invitation likely she was intrigued why had elayne been so audacious as to invite her soon eayne would take advantage of having ellorien here but not quite yet let the wornan enjoy the production first shed be expecting a political ambush shed wait for elayne to walk over and sit in one the seats near her or perhaps send a servant with an offerelayne did neither instead sitting and regarding the foxhead terangreal it was a complex work of art despite being only a single solid piece of metal she could feel the weaves that had been used to create it its intricacy was far beyond the simplicity of the twisted dream rings she was doing something wrong in trying to reproduce the medallion she carried in her pouch one of her failed attempts shed had copies cast for her as precise in detail as her silversmiths could create though she suspected the form was not important the amount of silver seemed to be for some reason but not the shape that silver took shed gotten close the copy in her pouch didnt work perfectly less powerful weaves slid off anyone holding it but very powerful ones could not be deflected for some reason and more problematic it was impossible to channel while touching the copy she could channel while holding the original indeed shed been giddy when shed discovered that holding the medallion didnt interfere with her weaves at all being pregnant didthat was still a source of frustration to herbut it was possible to hold the foxhead and channel but not the copy she hadnt gotten it quite right and unfortunately her time was slim mat would need his medallion back soon she took out the fake and set it on the seat beside her then embraced the source and wove spirit several of the kin a group of whom were watching the production some seats to the side glanced up at her as she did so most were too distracted by the song elayne reached over and touched the medallion immediately her weaves unraveled and the source winked away from her much as if a shield had been placed over her she sighed as the song reached its heights the copy was so close yet so frustrating at the same time shed never wear something that prevented her from touching the source not even for the protection it offered still it was not completely useless she could give a copy to birgitte perhaps and a few of the guardsmen captains it wouldnt do for her to create too many of these not when they could be used so effectively against aes sedai could she perhaps give one of the copies to mat hed never know since he couldnt channel himself no she thought squashing that temptation before it could fly too high she had promised to return mats medallion and she would not some copy that didnt work as well she tucked both medallions into her dress pocked now that she knew she could get mat to part with his medallion perhaps she could bully him into giving her more time though the presence of the gholarn did worry her how to deal with the thing perhaps copies of the medallion for all her guards wouldnt be a bad idea after all the song finished the final highpitched note dwindling like a candle running out of wick the end of the play came shortly afterward men in white masks jumping out of the darkness a brilliant light flashed something thrown into one of the lanterns and when it faded again walishen lay dead on the stage the bell of her red dress splayed around her like spilled blood the audience stood to clap most of them were kin though not a few were attendants of the other high seats who had been invited all of those were supporters of hers dyelin of course and young conail northan and the equally youngbut twice as proudcatalyn haevin the final noble here was syivase caeren what to make of her elayne shook her head slipping the fake foxhead into her pouch and lending a demure clap to the other accolades the players would be focused only on her if she didnt give some sign of approval theyd fret the entire night that done elayne made her way out to a nearby sitting room which was furnished with padded thickarmed chairs for relaxed conversation there was a bar at the side manned by a serving man in a crisp red and white uniform he stood with hands behind his back waiting respectfully as people ambled in ellorien wasnt there of courseit was basic courtesy for a guest to wait for the host to withdraw first though ellorien and elayne werent on the best of terms it wouldnt do to show poor manners soon after elayne arrived ellorien trailed in the plump woman was chatting with one of the kinswomen pointedly ignoring the high seats who walked near her her conversation sounded forced she probably could have been expected to avoid the sitting room entirely but elayne knew that the woman would want to make certain to express that she had not changed her mind about house trakand elayne smiled but did not approach the woman instead turning toward syivase as she entered of medium build the blueeyed girl might have been pretty save for that expressionless look on her face not emotionless like an aes sedai completely expressionless it sometimes seemed like syivase was a dressing dummy set up for display but then on other occasions shed show a hidden depth a cunning deep down thank you for the invitation your majesty syivase said evenly her voice a faintly eerie monotone it was most enlightening enlightening elayne said i should hope that it was enjoyable syivase said nothing she glanced at ellorien and here she finally showed some emotion an icy kind of dislike the kind that gave you a shiver why invite her your majesty house caeren was at odds with trakand once too elayne said of ten those whose loyalty is most difficult to win are the most valuable once it is yours she will not support you your majesty sylvase said her voice still too calm not after what your mother did when my mother took the throne years ago elayne said glancing over at ellorien there were some houses it was said shed never win over and yet she did so you already have enough support your majesty youve had your victory one of them she left the rest unsaid there was a debt of honor owed to house traemane courting elloriens approval wasnt merely about strengthening the lion throne it was about repairing rifts caused by elaynes mother while under the influence of gaebril it was about recovering her houses reputation about undoing the wrongs that could be undone sylvase would not understand that elayne had learned about the poor girls childhood this one would not put much stock in the honor of a high seat sylvase seemed to believe in only two things power and vengeance so long as she supported elayne and could be guided she would not be a liability but she would never be the strength to house trakand that someone like dyelin was how is my secretary serving your needs your majesty sylvase asked well enough i suppose elayne said so far he hadnt produced anything of value though elayne hadnt given him leave to do anything too drastic during his questioning she was trapped in a conundrum shed been hunting this group of black ajah for what seemed like forever she finally had them but what did she do with them birgitte had taken the captives alive ostensibly so that they could be questioned then tried by the white tower but that meant they had no reason to speak they knew their ultimate end would be execution so elayne either had to be willing to bargain with them or she had to let the questioner take extreme measures a queen had to be hard enough to allow these things or that was what her teachers and tutors had explained there was no question as to the guilt of these women and they had already done enough to earn themselves death a dozen times over elayne wasnt certain how far she herself was willing to descend however to pry their secrets free besides would that actually do any good ispan had had some kind of compulsion or oaths binding her these were likely to have the same would they be able to reveal anything useful if only there were a way to she hesitated missing sylvases next comment as a thought occurred to her birgitte wouldnt like it of course birgitte didnt like anything but elayne had felt birgitte move off out of the palace somewhere perhaps doing rounds of the guard posts outside excuse me sylvase elayne said i just recalled something that i absolutely must do of course your majesty the girl said in a flat almost inhuman voice elayne moved from her then quickly greetedand bade good evening to the others conail looked bored hed come because it had been expected of him dyelin was her usual pleasant yet careful self elayne avoided ellorien she greeted everyone else in the room of note once finished she began to walk toward the exit elayne trakand ellorien called out elayne paused smiling to herself she turned wiping her face of anything other than calculated curiosity yes lady ellorien have you invited me here only to ignore me the woman demanded from across the room other conversations grew quiet not at all elayne said i was merely under the impression that you would have a more pleasant time if i did not force you to interact with me this evening was not intended for political purposes ellorien frowned well what was it for then to enjoy a good ballad lady ellorien elayne said and perhaps to remind you of days when you often enjoyed entertainment in the company of house trakand she smiled and nodded slightly then left let her think about that elayne thought with satisfaction ellorien had no doubt heard that gaebril had been one of the forsaken the woman might not believe it but perhaps she would recall the years of respect she and morgase had shown one another should a few short months be cause to forget years of friendship at the bottom of the steps out of the lounge elayne found kaila bent one of birgittes guardswoman captains the lanky firehaired woman was chatting amiably with a pair of guardsmen both of whom seemed quite eager to gain her favor all three snapped to attention when they noticed elayne where did birgitte go elayne asked she went to investigate a disturbance at the gates your majesty kaila said ive had word that it was nothing that mercenary captain who came to visit you earlier tried to sneak onto the palace grounds captain birgitte is questioning him elayne raised an eyebrow you mean matrim cauthon the woman nodded shes questioning him thats what i heard your majesty kaila replied that means the two of them have gone out for drinks elayne said with a sigh light this was a bad time for it or was it a good time birgitte couldnt object to elaynes plan for the black ajah if she was out with mat elayne found herself smiling captain bent you are with me she left the theater rooms and entered the palace proper the woman followed waving for the squad of guardswomen standing in the hallway to follow smiling to herself elayne began giving orders one of the guardswomen ran off to deliver them though she looked confused at the strange list of commands elayne made her way to her rooms then sat down thinking she would have to move quickly birgitte was in a surly mood elayne could tell that through the bond a servant soon arrived carrying an enveloping black cloak elayne jumped up and slipped it on then embraced the source it took her three tries bloody ashes but being pregnant was frustrating sometimes she spun weaves of fire and air around her using the mirror of mists to make herself look taller more imposing she fetched her jewelry chest and fished out a small ivory carving of a seated woman shrouded in her own hair she used the angreal to pull as much of the one power into her as she dared to anyone watching who could channel shed look imposing indeed she glanced back at the guardswomen they were confused obviously and stood with their hands unconsciously on their swords your majesty kaila asked how do i look elayne said tweaking her weaves to make her voice deeper kailas eyes opened wider like a thunderhead given life your majesty imposing then elayne asked jumping slightly at the dangerous almost inhuman sound of her voice perfect id say so the lanky guardswoman said rubbing her chin with one hand though the slippers do spoil the effect elayne glanced down cursing at the pink silk she wove some more making her slippered feet vanish the weave would make it appear as if she were floating in the air wrapped in a pulsing shroud of darkness cloak and straps of black cloth fluttering round her her face was hidden completely in blackness as an added touch she created two faintly glowing picks of red where the eyes should be like coals radiating with a deep crimson light light preserve us one of the guards whispered elayne nodded to herself her heart quickening in excitement she wasnt worried shed be safe mins viewing promised that she ran through her plans again they were solid but there would be only one way to test them for certain elayne inverted her weaves and tied them off then she turned to the guards turn out the lights she said to them and remain perfectly still i will return shortly but kaila said that is an order guardswoman elayne said firmly you had best obey it the woman hesitated she likely knew that birgitte would never let this happen but kaila was not birgitte thankfully she reluctantly gave the order and the lights in the room were doused elayne reached into her pocket and took out the foxhead medallion the real one and held it hidden and tucked in her hand she took a deep breath then created a gateway the ribbon of light was bright in the blackened room glowing and bathing them in a pale glow like moonlight it opened into a room that was similarly dark elayne stepped through and found herself in the palace dungeons in one of the cells a woman knelt on the far side of the cell beside the sturdy door with a small window at the top slotted with bars that let in the only light in the dank cell there was a small cot to elaynes right and a bucket for a chamber pot to her left the tiny room smelled of mold and human waste and she could clearly hear the scratching of rats nearby it still seemed too lavish quarters for the woman in front of her elayne had chosen chesmal with calculation the woman had seemed to have some authority among the black and she was powerful enough that most of the others would bow to her but she also had seemed more passionate than logical when elayne had last encountered her that would be important the tall handsome woman spun as soon as elayne entered the cell elayne held her breath blessedly the act worked chesmal threw herself to the strawcovered floor of the cell great one the woman hissed i had silence elayne shouted her voice booming chesmal cringed then glanced to the side as if waiting for the guards outside to peek in there would be kinswomen there to hold chesmals shield elayne could feel them nobody came despite the sound the kin were following elaynes orders odd though those orders were you are less than a rat elayne said with her disguised voice you were sent to see to the great lords glory but what have you done allowed yourself to be captured by these fools these children chesmal wailed bowing herself further i am dust great one i am nothing we have failed you please do not destroy me and why shouldnt i elayne barked the work of your particular group has been marked with failure after failure what have you done that would possibly persuade me to allow you to live we have killed many of these fools who work against the great lord chesmal wailed elayne winced then steeling herself created a whip of air and lashed it across the womans back it was no more than chesmal deserved you elayne said you had nothing to do with their deaths do you think me stupid do you think me ignorant no great one chesmal wailed curling up further please then give me reason to let you live i have information great one chesmal said quickly one of those we were told to seek the two men that must be killed at all costs one is here in caemlyn whats this elayne hesitated tell me more he rides with a mercenary group chesmal said sounding relieved to have information that was wanted he is the man with the keen eyes who wears the hat and carries the spear marked by ravens mat the darkfriends were hunting mat he was friends with rand true and taveren but what had mat done to gain the ire of the forsaken themselves more disturbing was that chesmal knew of mats presence in the city he hadnt arrived until after the black sisters had been captured that meant that meant chesmal and the others were in contact with other darkfriends but who and how did you discover this why was this not reported earlier i got news this very day great one chesmal said sounding more selfassured now we are planning an assassination and how can you do that while imprisoned elayne demanded chesmal looked up briefly her square face showing confusion she said nothing ive tipped her off that i dont know as much as i should elayne gritted her teeth behind her mask of shadows great one chesmal said i have been following my orders carefully we are almost in a position to begin the invasion as commanded soon andor will be awash with the blood of our enemies and the great lord shall reign in fire and ash we will see it done what was this an invasion of andor impossible how would it happen how could it happen and yet dared she ask the questions chesmal seemed to suspect that something was wrong you are not the chosen who visited me before are you great one chesmal asked our ways are not to be questioned by one such as you elayne growled punctuating the remark with another switch of air across the womans back i need to know how much you have been told so that i can judge the gaps in your understanding if you are ignorant of well that is to be seen first explain to me how much you know of the invasion i know that the deadline nears great one chesmal said if we had longer perhaps we could plan more extensively if you could see me freed from these confines then i could she trailed off glancing to the side deadline elayne opened her mouth to demand more but hesitated what she could no longer feel the kin outside had they retreated and what of chesmals shield the door rattled the lock spun then the door flew open revealing a group of people on the other side and they were not the group of guards elayne had been expecting at their head was a man with short black hair thinning at the sides and huge mustaches he wore brown trousers and a black shirt his coat long almost an openfronted robe sylvases secretary behind him were two women temaile and eldrith both of the black ajah both holding to the source light elayne stifled her surprise meeting their gaze and not giving ground if she could convince one black sister that she was of the forsaken then perhaps she could convince three temailes eyes opened wide and she threw herself to her knees as did the secretary eldrith however hesitated elayne couldnt be certain if it was her stance her disguise or her reaction to seeing the three newcomers perhaps it was something else entirely either way eldirith wasnt taken in the roundfaced woman began to channel elayne cursed to herself forming weaves of her own she slammed a shield at eldrith right as she felt one come for her fortunately she was holding mats terangreal the weave unraveled and the medallion grew cold in elaynes hand elaynes own weave slid evenly between eldrith and the source cutting her off the glow of the power winked out around her what are you doing you idiot chesmal screeched you try to overthrow one of the chosen youll see us all dead thats not one of the chosen eldrith yelled back elayne belatedly thought to weave a gag of air youve been duped it elayne got the gag in her mouth but it was too late temaile who had always looked too delicate to be a black sisterembraced the sou rce and looked up chesmal s expression turned from horror to anger elayne quickly tied off eldriths shield and began weaving another one a weave of air hit her the foxhead medallion grew cold andblessing mat for his timely loanelayne placed a shield between chesmal and the source temaile gaped at elayne obviously stunned to see her weaves fail sylvase s secretary wasnt so slow however he threw himself forward unexpectedly ramming elayne back against the wall with a great deal of force pain laced out from her shoulder and she felt something crack her shoulder bone the babes she thought immediately it was a primal flash of horror and instant terror that defied all thoughts about min and viewings in her surprise she let go of the gateway leading back to her room above it winked out she has a terangreai olsome kind temaile cried weaves fall off her elayne scrambled pushing against the secretary and beginning a weave of air to thrust him back as she did however he clawed at her hand perhaps having noticed a flash of silvery metal there the secretary got his long fingers around the medallion just as elaynes burst of air hit him the secretary flew backward clinging to the medallion elayne growled still furious temaile grinned maliciously and weaves of air sprang up around her she threw them forward but elayne met them with her own the two weaves of air slammed against one another causing the air to churn in the small room bits of straw blew up in a flurry elaynes ears protested the sudden pressure the darkhaired secretary scrambled back from the battle clutching the terangreai elayne reached a weave toward himbut it unraveled elayne yelled in anger pain throbbing in her shoulder where shed hit the wall the small room was cramped with so many people in it and temaile stood in the doorway unintentionally blocking the secretary from getting away or maybe it was intentional she probably wanted that medallion the other two black sisters hunkered down air blasting around them still shielded elayne drew as much through the angreal as she dared forcing her weave of air forward shoving aside the one temaile was using to push the two held for a moment then elaynes burst through crashing into temaile and tossing her out of the cell and against the stone wall outside elayne followed with a shield though it appeared that temaile had been knocked unconscious by the blast the secretary bolted for the nearby doorway elayne felt a stab of panic she did the only thing she could think of she picked up chesmal in a weave of air and threw her at the secretary both went down in a heap a metallic ping sounded in the air as the foxhead medallion slipped free and hit the ground rolling through the door elayne took a deep breath pain flaring across her chest her arm falling slack she could no longer hold it up properly she cradled it in her other arm angry clinging to the source the sweetness of saidar was a comfort she wove air and tied up chesmal the secretary and eldrith who had been trying to crawl toward elayne unobtrusively calming herself elayne pushed past them out of the small cell to check on temaile in the hallway outside the woman was still breathing but was indeed unconscious elayne tied her in air too to be certain then carefully picked up the foxhead medallion she winced at the pain of her other arm yes shed broken a bone for certain the dark hallway was empty set with four doorways for cells lit by only a single standlamp where were the guards and kin she reluctantly released the weaves that formed her disguiseshe wouldnt want any soldiers arriving and mistaking her for one of the darkfriends certainly someone had heard some of that racket in the back of her mind she could sense concern from birgitte who was getting closer the warder had undoubtedly felt elaynes injury almost elayne preferred the pain of her shoulder to the lecture shed get from birgitte she winced again considering that as she turned and inspected her captives shed need to check the other cells of course her babes would be all right she would be all right shed overreacted to the pain she hadnt really been afraid still best tohello my queen a mans voice whispered in her ear right before a second pain blossomed in her side she gasped stumbling forward a hand reached out and yanked the medallion from her fingers elayne spun and the room seemed blurry something warm ran down her side she was bleeding she was so stunned she felt the source slip away from her doilin mellar stood behind her in the hallway holding a bloodied knife in his right hand hefting the medallion in his left his hatchetlike face was broken by a deep smile almost a leer though he wore only rags he looked as selfassured as a king on his throne elayne hissed and reached for the source but nothing happened she heard chuckling behind her shed hadnt tied off chesmals shield as soon as elayne released the source rhe weaves would have vanished sure enough elayne glanced and found weaves cutting her off from the source chesmal handsome face flushed smiled at her light there was blood pooling at elaynes feet so much of it she stumbled back against the wall of the hallway mellar to one side chesmal the other she couldnt die min had said we could be misinterpreting birgirtes voice returned to her any number of things could still go wrong heal her mellar said what chesmal demanded behind her eldrith was dusting herself off inside the cell doorway shed fallen to the ground when elaynes weavings of air dissipated but her shield was still there that one elayne had tied in place think elayne told herself blood dribbling between her fingers there has to be a way out there has to be oh light birgitte hurry heal her mellar said again the knife wound was to make her drop you fool chesmal said if the weaves had been tied off a wound wouldnt have released us then she would have died mellar said shrugging he eyed elayne those handsome eyes of his shone with lust and that would have been a pity for she was promised to me aes sedai i wont have her die here in this dungeon she doesnt die until i have had time to enjoy her he looked at the black sister besides you think those whom we serve would be pleased if they knew youd let the queen of andor die without yielding her secrets chesmal looked dissatisfied but she apparently saw the wisdom in his words behind them the secretary slipped out of the cell andafter glancing both waysslunk down the hallway toward the steps and hurried up them chesmal crossed the hallway toward elayne blessedly elayne was getting fuzzyheaded she rested her back against the wall barely feeling the pain of her broken shoulder and slid down until she was sitting idiot girl chesmal said i saw through your ploy of course i was leading you on knowing that help was coming the words were hollow she was lying for the benefit of the others the healing elayne needed that healing her mind was growing dull her vision darkening she held her hand to her side terrified for herself for her children her hand slipped she felt something through the fabric in the pocket of her dress the foxhead medallion copy chesmal put her hands on elaynes head crafting healing weaves elaynes veins became ice water her body overwhelmed by a wave of power she drew in a deep breath the agony in her side and shoulder vanishing there chesmal said now quickly we need to elayne whipped free the other medallion and held it up by reflex chesmal grabbed it that made the woman unable to channel her weaves vanished including elaynes shield chesmal cursed dropping the medallion it hit and rolled as chesmal wove a shield elayne didnt bother with a shield this time she wove fire simple direct dangerous the dark sisters clothing burst into flame before she could finish weaving and she cried out elayne hauled herself to her feet the hallway shook and spunthe healing had taken a lot out of herbut before things stopped spinning she wove another thread of fire lashing it at mellar he had risked the life of her children he had stabbed her he the weaves unraveled the moment they touched him he smiled up at her stopping something with his foot the second medallion here now he said scooping it up another one if i shake you will a third fall free elayne hissed chesmal was still screaming afire she fell to the ground kicking the hallway growing pungent with the scent of burned flesh light elayne hadnt meant to kill her but there wasnt time to spare she wove air snatching up eldrith again before the woman could escape elayne pushed her forward between herself and mellar just in case he watched with keen eyes edging forward holding the two medallions in one hand and his dagger in the other it still glistened with elaynes blood we arent finished my queen he said in a soft voice these others were promised power but my reward was always to be you i always collect what i am owed he watched elayne with care expecting some trick if only she had one she could barely stand upright holding the source was difficult she backed away keeping eldrith between herself and mellar his eyes flicked to the statuesque woman she stood with arms tied to her sides by air floating an inch above the ground with a jerking motion he jumped forward and slit eldriths throat elayne started scrambling backward sorry mellar said and it took elayne a moment to realize he was addressing eldrith but orders are orders with that he ducked plunging his dagger into temailes unconscious body he couldnt escape with the medallions with a surge of strength elayne drew in the one power and wove earth she pulled at the ceiling above mellar as he stood up stones shattered blocks falling downward causing him to yell and cover his head as he ducked away something rang in the air metal on stone the hallway shook and dust sprayed in the air the rain of rocks drove mellar away but kept her from chasing he vanished up the stairwell to the right elayne sank down to her knees feeling drained but then she saw something glittering among the rubble of the ceiling blocks shed pulled down a bit of silvery metal one of the medallions holding her breath she grabbed it blessedly the source didnt leave her mellar had escaped with the copy it seemed but she still had the original she sighed allowing herself to sit back against the cold stone wall she wanted to lapse into unconsciousness but forced herself to tuck away the medallion then remain awake until birgitte appeared in the hallway the warder panted heavily from having run her red coat and golden braid wet with rainwater mat stepped down into the hallway after her wearing a scarf up around his face his wet brown hair plastered to his head his eyes darted from side to side a quarterstaff held at guard birgitte knelt by elaynes side are you all right she asked urgently elayne nodded in exhaustion i got myself out of this one in a way did you happen to do the world a favor and kill mellar on your way in mellar birgitte asked alarmed no elayne theres blood on your dress im fine she said really ive been healed so mellar was free quickly she said search the hallways the guards and the kin who were guarding this place we found them birgitte said stuffed into the bottom of the stairwell dead elayne what happened to the side mat poked at temailes corpse noting the dagger wound in her chest elayne pressed her hands to her abdomen her babes would be all right wouldnt they i did something very rash birgitte and i know that you are going to scream at me for it but would you first please take me to my rooms i think we should have melfane look at me just in case an hour after the failed assassination attempt on egwene gawyn stood alone in a small room that was part of the amyrlins chambers hed been released from the weaves that had held him then told to stay put egwene finally strode into the room sit she said he hesitated but her fierce eyes could have set candles aflame he sat down on the stool this small room held several dressers and trunks for clothing the doorway led out to the larger sitting room where hed been captured in weaves a doorway off of that room led to egwenes bedchamber egwene shut the door sequestering the two of them from the many guards warders and aes sedai milling about in the rooms outside their conversations made a low hum through the door egwene still wore red and gold and she had golden threads woven into her dark hair her cheeks were flushed with anger at him that made her even more beautiful than usual egwene i do you realize what you have done i checked to see if the woman i love was safe following the discovery of an assassin outside her door she folded her arms beneath her breasts he could almost feel the heat of her anger your yelling has drawn half of the white tower they saw you captured the assassin probably knows now about my weaves light egwene you talk as if i did it on purpose i was only trying to protect you i didnt ask for your protection i asked for your obedience gawyn dont you see the opportunity weve missed if you hadnt scared mesaana away shed have walked into my traps it wasnt one of the forsaken gawyn said it was a man you said you couldnt see the face or make out the figure because it was blurred well yes gawyn said but he fought with the sword and a woman couldnt use a sword the size of the person you saw indicated a woman maybe but one of the forsaken light egwene if it had been mesaana then shed have used the power to burn me to dust another reason egwene said that you should not have disobeyed me perhaps youre rightperhaps this was one of mesaanas minions a darkfriend or gray man if that were the case id have them captive and be able to learn about mesaanas plots and gawyn what if you had found mesaana what could you have done he looked down at the floor i told you that i had taken precautions she continued and still you disobeyed and now because of what youve done the murderer knows that i was anticipating her shell be more careful next time how many lives do you think you just cost us gawyn kept his hands in his lap trying to hide the fists that they had formed he should have felt ashamed but all he could feel was anger a rage he couldnt explainfrustration at himself but mostly at egwene for turning an honest mistake into a personal affront it seems to me he said that you dont want a warder at all because ill tell you egwene if you cant stand being looked after then no man will do perhaps you are right she said curtly her skirts rustled as she pulled open the door to the hall went out and then pulled it closed behind her not quite a slam gawyn stood up and wanted to kick the door light what a mess this had become he could hear egwene through the door sending the gawkers back to their beds ordering the tower guard to be extra vigilant tonight that was likely for show she knew that the assassin wouldnt try again so soon gawyn slipped out of the room and left she noted his departure but said nothing to him instead turning to speak softly with silviana the red had a glare for gawyn that would have made a boulder wince gawyn passed several guards whofor their partsseemed respectful of gawyn as far as they knew hed foiled an attempt on the amyrlins life gawyn nodded to their salures chubain stood nearby inspecting the knife that had nearly taken gawyn in the chest chubain held up the knife to him have you ever seen anything like this gawyn took the narrow sleek knife it was balanced for throwing with a fine steel blade that looked something like an elongated candles flame set into the center were three bits of bloodcolored rock what kind of stone is that gawyn asked holding the knife up to the light ive never seen it before gawyn turned the knife over a few times there werent any inscriptions or carvings this came within half a breath of claiming my life you can take it if you wish chubain said maybe you can ask brynes men if theyve ever seen one like it we have a second one we found down the hallway it was also intended for my heart gawyn said tucking the knife into his belt thank you i have a gift for you in return chubain raised an eyebrow youve been complaining of the men you lost gawyn said well ive a group of soldiers i can recommend strongly from brynes army chubain asked lips downturned like many of the tower guard he still regarded brynes army as a rival force no gawyn said men loyal to the tower some of those who trained to be warders and who fought with me on elaidas side theyre feeling displaced now and they would rather be soldiers than warders id appreciate it if youd give them a home theyre solid men and excellent warriors chubain nodded send them to me theyll come to you tomorrow gawyn said i only ask one thing try not to break the group apart theyve been through much together their bond gives them strength shouldnt be difficult chubain said the tenth tower company was destroyed nearly to a man by those flaming seanchan ill set some veteran officers over your lads and form the new company out of them thank you gawyn said he nodded toward egwenes quarters watch over her for me chubain i think shes determined to see herself dead it is ever my duty to defend and uphold the amyrlin but where will you be she made it clear that she wants no warder gawyn said his mind drifting back to the things bryne had said to him earlier what did he want aside from egwene perhaps it was time to find out i think its past time i went to visit my sister chubain nodded and gawyn took his leave he visited the barracks and gathered his possessionslittle more than a change of clothing and a winter cloakthen made his way to the stables and saddled challenge then he led the horse to the traveling ground egwene maintained a sister on duty there at all times tonights aes sedaia petite drowsyeyed green named nimrididnt question him she made him a gateway to a hillside about an hours travel from caemlyn and so he left tar valonand egwene alverebehind what is that lan demanded the aged nazar looked up from his saddlebags leather hadori holding down his powdery white hair a small stream gurgled near their camp in the middle of a forest of highland pines those pines shouldnt have borne half so many brown needles nazar had been tucking something into his saddlebags and lan had happened to spot a bit of gold peeking out this nazar asked he pulled the cloth out a brilliant white flag with a golden crane embroidered in the center it was a fine work with beautiful stitching lan nearly grabbed it out of nazars fingers and ripped it in half now i see that expression on your face lan mandragoran nazar said weil dont you be getting all selfcentered about this a man has a right to carry his kingdoms flag with him youre a baker nazar im a borderlander first son the man said tucking the banner away this is my heritage bah lan said turning away the others were breaking up camp hed grudgingly allowed the three newcomers to join himthey were stubborn as boars and in the end he had had to succumb to his oath hed promised that hed accept followers these men technically hadnt asked to ride with himtheyd simply started doing it that was enough besides if they were going to travel in the same direction then there was little sense in making two camps lan continued to wipe his face dry from the mornings washing bulen was getting bread ready for breakfast this grove of pines was in eastern kandor they were getting close to the border into arafel perhaps he couldhe froze there were several new tents in their camp a group of eight men were chatting with andere three of them looked plump around the waistnot warriors judging by their soft clothing though they did appear to be malkieri the other five were all shienarans topknots on their heads leather bracers on their arms and horsebows stored in cases on their backs beside long twohanded swords what is this lan demanded weilin managan and gorenellin andere said gesturing to the malkieri these others are qi joao merekel ianor kuehn i didnt ask who lan said voice cold i asked what what have you done andere shrugged we met them before running into you we told them to wait along the southern roadway for us rakim fetched them last night while you were sleeping rakim was supposed to be on watch lan said i watched in his stead andere said i figured wed want these fellows all three of the plump merchants looked to lan then went down on their knees one was weeping openly taishar malkier the five shienarans saluted lan dai shan one said we have brought what we could to the cause of the golden crane another of the merchants added all that we could gather in a little time it is not much said the third but we lend you our swords as well we may look to have grown soft but we can fight we will fight i dont need what you brought lan said exasperated i before you say too much more old friend andere said laying a hand on lans shoulder perhaps you should have a look at that he nodded to the side lan frowned hearing a rattling sound he stepped past a patch of trees to look upon the path to the camp two dozen wagons were approaching each piled high with suppliesweapons sacks of grain tents lan opened his eyes wide a good dozen warhorses were hitched in a line and strong oxen pulled the wagons teamsters and servants walked alongside them when they said they sold what they could and brought supplies andere said they meant it we will never be able to move quietly with all of this lan said andere shrugged lan took a deep breath very well he would work with it moving quietly appears to be failing anyway from now on we will pose as a caravan delivering supplies to shienar but you will swear to me he said turning toward the men each of you will swear not to reveal who i am or send word to anyone else who might be looking for me you will swear it nazar looked like he would object but lan silenced him with a stern look one by one they swore the five had become dozens but it would stop there chapter to make a stand bed rest melfane announced taking her ear from the wooden tube shed placed against elaynes chest the midwife was a short amplecheeked woman who today wore her hair tied back by a translucent blue scarf her neat dress was of white and matching skyblue as if worn in defiance of the perpetually overcast sky what elayne asked one week melfane said wagging a thick finger at elayne you arent to be on your feet for one week elayne blinked stunned her exhaustion fleeing for the moment melfane smiled cheerfully as she consigned elayne to this impossible punishment bed rest for a week birgitte stood in the doorway mat in the room beyond hed stepped out for melfanes inspection but otherwise hed hovered near her almost as protectively as birgitte youd never know they cared for her by the way they spoke howeverthe two of them had been sharing curses each trying to top the other elayne had learned a few new ones who knew that hundredlegs did those things her babes were safe so far as melfane could tell that was the important part bed rest is of course impossible elayne said i have far too much to do well it will have to be done from bed melfane replied her voice pleasant but completely unyielding your body and your child have undergone a great stress they need time to recover i will be attending you and making certain you maintain a strict diet but i wont hear any excuses melfane interrupted im the queenl elayne said exasperated and im the queens midwife melfane replied still calm there isnt a soldier or attendant in this palace who wont help me if i determine that your healthand that of your childis at risk she met elaynes eyes would you like to put my words to the test your majesty elayne cringed imagining her own guards forbidding her exit to her chambers or worse tying her down she glanced at birgitte but received only a satisfied nod its no more than you deserve that nod seemed to say elayne sat back in her bed frustrated it was a massive fourposter decorated in red and white the room was ornate sparkling with various creations of crystal and ruby it would make a beautifully gilded prison indeed light this wasnt fair she did up the front of her gown i see that youre not going to try my word melfane said standing up from the side of the bed you show wisdom she glanced at birgitte i will allow you a meeting with the captaingeneral to assess the evenings events but no more than a halfhour mind you i wont have you exerting yourself but melfane wagged that finger at her again a halfhour your majesty you are a woman not a plow beast you need rest and care she turned to birgitte do not upset her unduly i wouldnt dream of it birgitte said her anger was finally beginning to abate replaced by amusement insufferable woman melfane withdrew to the outer chamber birgitte remained where she was regarding elayne through narrow eyes some displeasure still boiled and churned from the bond the two regarded one another for a long moment what are we do to with you elayne trakand birgitte finally asked lock me in my bedroom it appears elayne snapped not a bad solution and would you keep me here forever elayne asked like gelfina from the stories locked away for a thousand years in the forgotten tower birgitte sighed no but six months or so would help keep my anxiety levels down we dont have time for that elayne replied we dont have time for much these days risks must be taken risks involving the queen of andor going alone to face a mob of the black ajah youre like some bloodbesotted idiot on the battlefield charging ahead of his comrades seeking death without a shieldmate to guard your back elayne blinked at the anger in the woman dont you trust me elayne birgitte asked would you be rid of me if you could what no of course i trust you then why wont you let me help you im not supposed to be here now i have no purpose other than what circumstance has given me you made me your warder but you wont let me protect you how can i be your bodyguard if you wont tell me when youre putting yourself in danger elayne felt like pulling the covers up to shield herself from those eyes how could birgitte be the one who felt so hurt elayne had been the one whod been wounded if it means anything she said i dont intend to do this again no youll do something else reckless i mean i intend to be more careful maybe youre right and the viewing isnt a perfect guarantee it certainly didnt stop me from panicking when i felt a real danger you didnt feel a real danger when the black ajah locked you up and tried to cart you away elayne hesitated she should have been frightened that time but she hadnt been not only because of mins viewing the black ajah would never have killed her not under those circumstances she was too valuable feeling that knife enter her side pierce her skin dig toward her womb that had been different the terror she could remember the world blackening around her her heartbeat thudding growing louder like the drumbeats at the end of a performance the ones that came before the silence birgitte regarded elayne appraisingly she could feel elaynes emotions she was queen she could not avoid risks but perhaps she could rein herself in well birgitte said did you at least discover anything i did elayne said i at that moment a scarfwrapped head appeared in the doorway mat had his eyes closed you covered up yes elayne said and in a far more fashionable way than you matrim cauthon that scarf looks ridiculous he scowled opening his eyes and pulling off the scarf revealing the angular face beneath you try moving through the city without being recognized he said every butcher innkeeper and bloody backroom slipfinger seems to know what i look like these days the black sisters were planning to have you assassinated elayne said what mat asked elayne nodded one mentioned you it sounded like darkfriends had been searching for you for some time with the intent of killing you birgitte shrugged theyre darkfriends no doubt they want us all dead this was different elayne said it seemed more intense i suggest keeping your wits about you the next while thatll be a trick birgitte noted seeing as to how he doesnt have any wits in the first place mat rolled his eyes did i miss you explaining what you were doing in the flaming dungeons sitting in a pool of your own blood looking for all the world like youd seen the losing end of a battlefield skirmish i was interrogating the black ajah elayne said the details are none of your concern birgitte have you a report from the grounds nobody saw mellar leave the warder said though we found the secretarys body on the ground floor still warm died from a knife to the back elayne sighed shiaine gone birgitte said along with marillin gemalphin and falion bhoda the shadow couldnt leave them in our possession elayne said with a sigh they know too much they had to end up either rescued or executed well mat said shrugging youre alive and three of them are dead seems like a reasonably good outcome but the ones who escaped have a copy of your medallion elayne thought she didnt speak it however she also didnt mention the invasion that chesmal had spoken of she would talk of it with birgitte soon of course but first she wanted to consider it herself mat had said the nights events had a reasonably good outcome but the more elayne thought about it the more dissatisfied she was an invasion of andor was coming but she didnt know when the shadow wanted mat dead but as birgitte had pointed out that was no surprise in fact the only certain result of the evenings adventures was the sense of fatigue elayne felt that and a week confined to her rooms mat she said taking off his medallion here its time i gave this back you should know that it probably saved my life tonight he walked over and took it back eagerly then hesitated were you able to copy it not perfectly but to an extent he put it back on looking concerned well that feels good to have back ive been wanting to ask you something now might not be the time speak of it elayne said tired might as well well its about the gholam the city has been emptied of most civilians yoeli said as he and ituralde walked through maradons gate were close to the blight this is not the first time weve evacuated my own sister sigril leads the lastriders who will watch from the ridge to the southeast and send word if we should we fall she will have sent word to our watchposts around saldaea requesting aid she will light a watchfire to alert us if they come the leanfaced man looked at ituralde his expression grim there will be few troops who could come to our aid queen tenobia took many with her when she rode to find the dragon reborn ituralde nodded he walked without a limpantail one of the ashaman was quite skilled with healing his men made a hasty camp in the courtyard just inside the city gates the trollocs had taken the tents theyd left behind then lit them on fire at night to illuminate them feasting on the wounded ituralde had moved some of his troops into the empty buildings but he wanted others close to the gate in case of an assault the ashaman and aes sedai had worked to heal ituraldes men but only the worst cases could get attention ituralde nodded to antail who was working with the wounded in a ropedoff section of the square antail didnt see the nod he concentrated sweating working with a power ituralde didnt want to think about are you certain you want to see them yoeli asked he held a horsemans long spear on his shoulder the tip tied with a triangular black and yellow pendant it was called the traitors banner by the saldaeans here the city bristled with hostility different groups of saldaeans regarding one another with grim expressions many wore strips of black cloth and yellow cloth twisted about one another and tied to their sword sheaths they nodded to yoeli desya gavane cierto cuendar isain carentin ituralde thought a phrase in the old tongue it meant a resolute heart is worth ten arguments he could guess what that banner meant sometimes a man knew what he must do though it sounded wrong the two of them walked for a time through the streets maradon was like most borderland cities straight walls square buildings narrow streets the houses looked like fortressed keeps with small windows and sturdy doors the streets wound in odd ways and there were no thatched roofsonly slate shingles fireproof the dried blood at several key intersections was difficult to make out against the dark stone but ituralde knew what to look for yoelis rescue of his troops had come after fighting among the saldaeans they reached a nondescript building there would be no way for an outsider to know that this particular dwelling belonged to vram torkumen distant cousin to the queen appointed lord of the city in her absence the soldiers at the door wore yellow and black they saluted yoeli inside ituralde and yoeli entered a narrow staircase and climbed three flights of stairs there were soldiers in nearly every room on the top floor four men wearing the traitors banner guarded a large goldinlaid door the hallway was dark narrow windows a rug of black green and red anything to report tarran yoeli asked not a thing sir the man said with a salute he wore long mustaches and had the bowed legs of a man very comfortable in the saddle yoeli nodded thank you tarran for all you do i stand with you sir and will at the end may you keep your eyes northward but your heart southward my friend yoeli said taking a deep breath and pushing open the door ituralde followed inside the room a saldaean man in a rich red robe sat beside a hearth sipping a cup of wine a woman in a fine dress did needlework in the chair across from him neither looked up lord torkumen yoeli said this is rodel ituralde leader of the domani army the man at the hearth sighed over his cup of wine you do not knock you do not wait for me to address you first you come during an hour when have spoken of my need for quiet contemplation really vram the woman said you expect manners from this man now yoeli quietly rested his hand on the hilt of his sword the room held a jumble of furniture a bed on the side of the room that obviously didnt belong there a few trunks and standing wardrobes so vram said rodel ituralde youre one of the great captains i realize it might be insulting to ask but i must observe formalities you realize that by bringing troops onto our soil you have risked a war i serve the dragon reborn ituralde said tarmon gaidon comes and all previous allegiances boundaries and laws are subject to the dragons will vram clicked his tongue dragonsworn i had reports of course and those men you employ seemed an obvious hint but it is still so strange to hear do you not realize how utterly foolish you sound ituralde met the mans eyes he hadnt considered himself dragonsworn but there was no use calling a horse a rock and expecting everyone else to agree dont you care about the invading trollocs there have been trollocs before vram said there have always been trollocs the queen yoeli said the queen vram interrupted will soon return from her expedition to unmask and capture this false dragon once that happens she will see you executed traitor you rodel ituralde will likely be spared because of your station but i should not like to be your family when they receive the ransom demand i hope that you have wealth to accompany your reputation otherwise you shall likely spend many of the next years as a general to nothing more than the rats of your cell i see ituralde said when did you turn to the shadow vrams eyes opened wide and he stood you dare name me darkfriend ive known some saldaeans in my time ituralde said ive called some friends ive fought against others but never have i known one who would watch men fight shadowspawn and not offer to help if i had a sword vram said may you burn vram torkumen ituralde said i came here to tell you that that on behalf of the men i lost the man seemed shocked as ituralde turned to go yoeli joined him pulling the door closed you disagree with my accusation ituralde asked joining the traitor as they returned to the stairs i honestly cant decide if hes a fool or a darkfriend yoeli said hed have to be one or the other to not put together the truth from the winter those clouds and the rumors that althor has conquered half the world then you have nothing to fear ituralde said you wont be executed i killed my countrymen yoeli said staged a revolt against my queens appointed leader and seized command of the city though ive not a drop of noble blood thatll change the moment tenobia returns i warrant ituralde said youve earned yourself a title for certain yoeli stopped in the dark stairwell lit only from above and below i see that you do not understand i have betrayed my oaths and killed friends i will demand execution as is my right ituralde felt a chill bloody borderlanders he thought swear yourself to the dragon he supersedes all oaths do not waste your life fight beside me at the last battle i will not hide behind excuses lord ituralde the man said continuing down the steps no more than i could watch your men die come let us see to the housing of those ashaman i would like very much to see these gateways you speak of if we could use them to send messages out and bring supplies in this could be a very interesting siege indeed ituralde sighed but followed they didnt speak of fleeing by way of the gateways yoeli wouldnt abandon his city and he realized ituralde wouldnt abandon yoeli and his men not after what theyd gone through to rescue him this was as good a place as any to make a stand better than many a situation hed been in lately that was for certain perrin entered their tent to find faile brushing her hair she was beautiful each day he still felt a sense of wonder that she was really back she turned to him and smiled in satisfaction she was using the new silver comb hed left on her pillowsomething hed traded for from gaul who had found it in maiden if this shannahar was important to her then perrin intended to treat it the same way the messengers have returned perrin said closing the flaps to the tent the whitecloaks have chosen a battlefield light faile theyre going to force me to wipe them out i dont see the trouble with that she said well win probably perrin said sitting down on the pillows beside their sleeping pallet but despite the ashaman doing most of the work at first well have to move in to fight that means well lose people good men we need at the last battle he forced himself to relax the fists that hed clenched the light burn those whitecloaks for what theyve done and for what theyre doing then its a welcome opportunity to defeat them perrin grunted a reply and didnt explain the depth of frustration he felt he would lose that fight against the whitecloaks no matter what happened men would die on both sides men they needed the lightning flashed outside casting shadows on the canvas ceiling faile went over to their trunk getting out a sleeping shift for herself and setting aside a robe for him faile thought a lord should have a robe handy in case he was needed at night shed been correct a couple of times so far she moved past him smelling worried though her expression was pleasant he had expended all options for a peaceful resolution with the whitecloaks it looked like want it or not killing would be his lot again very soon he stripped to his smallclothes and lay down then started drifting off before faile had finished changing he entered the wolf dream beneath the great sword impaling the ground in the distance he could make out the hill that gaul had named a fine watchpoint the campsite was supplied from behind by a stream perrin turned and sped toward the whitecloak camp they sat like a dam in a river stopping him from continuing onward hopper he called looking around the whitecloak camp still tents standing on an open field there was no response so perrin searched the camp a while longer balwer had not recognized the seal perrin had described who led these whitecloaks an hour or so later perrin had come to no conclusion about that however he was fairly certain which tents they kept their supplies in those might not be as well guarded as the prisoners andwith gatewayshe might be able to burn their supplies maybe their lord captain commanders letters were filled with phrases like i am giving your people the benefit of believing they knew not of your nature and my patience for your delays wears thin and there are only two options surrender yourself for proper trial or bring your army to suffer the lights judgment there was a strange sense of honor to this man one perrin had seen hinted at when hed met the man but could sense even more through the letters but who was he he signed each letter only lord captain commander of the children of the light perrin moved out onto the roadway where was hopper perrin took off at a brisk run after a few moments he moved off onto the grass the earth was so soft each step seemed to spring his foot back up into the air he reached out and thought he sensed something to the south he ran toward it he wished to go faster so he did trees and hills zipped past the wolves were aware of him it was oak dancers pack with boundless sparks morninglight and others perrin could feel them sending to one another distant whispers of images and scent perrin moved faster feeling the wind become a roar around him the wolves began to move away farther south wait he sent must meet with you they returned only amusement suddenly they were heading east and he pulled to a stop then turned he ran as quickly as he knew how but when he got near they were suddenly elsewhere theyd shifted vanishing from the south and appearing north of him perrin growled and suddenly he was on all fours his fur blew his mouth open as he dashed to the north drinking in the hissing wind but the wolves stayed ahead distant he howled they sent back taunts he pushed himself faster leaping from hilltop to hilltop bounding over trees the ground a blur in moments the mountains of mist sprang up to his left and he passed along them in a rush the wolves turned east why couldnt he catch them he could smell them ahead young bull howled at them but got no response do not come too strongly young bull young bull pulled to a halt and the world lurched around him the main pack continued on to the east but hopper sat on his haunches beside a large curving stream young bull had been here before it was near the den of his sires he had traveled along the river itself on the back of one of the humans floating trees heno no remember faile his fur became clothing and he found himself on hands and knees he glared at hopper why did you run away perrin demanded you wish to learn hopper sent you grow more skilled faster you stretch your legs and run this is good perrin looked back the way he had come thinking of his speed hed bounded from hilltop to hilltop it had been wonderful but i had to become the wolf to do that perrin said and that threatened to make me here too strongly what use is training if it makes me do things youve forbidden you are quick to blame young bull a young wolf howling and yapping outside the den making a racket this is not a thing of wolves hopper was gone in an eyeblink perrin growled looking eastward where he sensed the wolves he took off after them going more cautiously he couldnt afford to let the wolf consume him hed end up like noam trapped in a cage his humanity gone why would hopper encourage him to that this is not a thing of wolves had he meant the accusations or had he meant what was happening to perrin the others all knew to end the hunt young bull hopper sent from a distance only you had to be stopped perrin froze pulling to a halt on the bank of the river the hunt for the white stag hopper was there suddenly beside the river with him this started when i began to sense the wolves perrin sent the first time i lost control of myself was with those whitecloaks hopper lay down resting his head on his paws you often are here too strongly the wolf sent is what you do hopper had told him that off and on since hed known the wolf and the wolf dream but suddenly perrin saw a new meaning to it it was about coming to the wolf dream but it was also about perrin himself hed begun to blame the wolves for what he did the way he was when fighting the way hed become when searching for faile but were the wolves the cause of that or was it some part of him was it possible that that was what caused him to become a wolfbrother in the first place is it possible perrin said to run on four legs but not come here too strongly of course it is hopper sent laughing after the way of wolvesas if what perrin had discovered was the most obvious thing in the world maybe it was perhaps he wasnt like the wolves because he was a wolfbrother perhaps he was a wolfbrother because he was like the wolves he didnt need to control them he needed to control himself the pack perrin said how do i catch them move more quickly that is one way another is to be where you want perrin frowned then he closed his eyes and used the direction the wolves were running to guess where they would be something shifted when he opened his eyes he was standing on a sandy hillside tufts of longbladed grass peeking out of the soil an enormous mountain with a broken tipshattered as if it had been slapped by the hand of a giant rose to his right a pack of wolves burst out of the forest many of them were laughingyoung bull hunting when he should seek the end young bull seeking the end when he should enjoy the hunt he smiled trying to feel good captured about the laughter though in truth he felt much as he had on the day that his cousin wil had planted a bucket of wet feathers to drop on perrin something fluttered in the air a chicken feather wet around the edges perrin started realizing that they were spread around him on the ground as he blinked they vanished the wolves smelled greatly amused sending images of young bull dusted with feathers get lost in dreams here young bull hopper sent and those dreams become this dream perrin scratched his beard fighting down his embarrassment hed experienced before the unpredictable nature of the wolf dream hopper he said turning to the wolf how much could i change about my surroundings if i wanted if you wanted hopper said its not about what you want young bull its about what you need what you know perrin frowned sometimes the wolfs meanings still confused him suddenly the other wolves in the group turnedas if oneand looked to the southwest they vanished they went here hopper sent an image of a distant wooded hollow the wolf prepared to follow hopper perrin said stepping forward how did you know where they went did they tell you no but i can follow how perrin said it is a thing ive always known hopper sent like walking or jumping yes but how the wolf smelled confused it is a scent he finally replied though scent was much more complex than that it was a feeling an impression and a smell all in one go somewhere perrin said let me try to follow hopper vanished perrin walked up to where the wolf had been smell it hopper sent distantly he was near enough to give a sending by reflex perrin reached out he found dozens of wolves in fact he was amazed by how many of them were here on the slopes of dragonmount perrin had never felt so many gathered in one place before why were they here and did the sky look more stormy in this place than it had in other areas of the wolf dream he couldnt sense hopper the wolf had closed himself off somehow making perrin unable to place where he was perrin settled down smell it hopper had sent smell it how perrin closed his eyes and let his nose catry the scents of the area to him pine cones and sap quills and leaves leatherleaf and hemlock and something else yes he could smell something a distant lingering scent that seemed out of place many of the scents were the samethe same fecund sense of nature the same wealth of trees but those were mixed with the scents of moss and of wet stone the air was different pollen and flowers perrin squeezed his eyes tight breathing in deeply somehow he built a picture in his mind from those scents the process was not unlike the way a wolf sending translated into words there he thought something shifted he opened his eyes he was sitting on a stone outcropping amid pines he was on the side of dragonmount several hours hike up from where he had been the stone outcropping was covered in lichen and it jutted out over the trees spreading below a patch of violet springbreath grew here where sunlight could reach the blossoms it was good to see flowers that werent wilted or dying if only in the wolf dream come hopper sent follow and he was gone perrin closed his eyes breathing in the process was easier this time oak and grass mud and humidity it seemed each place had its own specific scent perrin shifted then opened his eyes he crouched in a field near the jehannah road this was where oak dancers pack had gone earlier and hopper moved about the meadow smelling curious the pack had moved on but they were still close can i always do that perrin asked hopper smell where a wolf went in the dream anyone can hopper said if they can smell as a wolf does he grinned perrin nodded thoughtfully hopper loped back across the meadow toward him we must practice young bull you are still a cub with short legs and soft fur wehopper froze suddenly what perrin asked a wolf suddenly howled in pain perrin spun it was morninglight the howl cut off and the wolfs mind winked out vanishing hopper growled his scents panicked angry and sorrowful what was that perrin demanded we are hunted go young bull we must go the minds of the other members of the pack leaped away perrin growled when a wolf died in the wolf dream it was forever no rebirth no running with nose to the wind only one thing hunted the spirits of the wolves slayer young bull hopper sent we must go perrin continued to growl morninglight had sent one last burst of suprise and pain her last vision of the world perrin formed an image from that jumble then closed his eyes young bull no heshift perrin snapped his eyes open to find himself in a small glade near where in the real worldhis people made camp a muscular tanned man with dark hair and blue eyes squatted in the center of the glade a wolfs corpse at his feet slayer was a thickarmed man and his scent was faintly inhuman like a man mixed with stone he wore dark clothing leather and black wool as perrin watched slayer began to skin the corpse perrin charged forward slayer looked up in surprise he resembled lan in an almost eerie fashion his hard face all angles and sharp lines perrin roared hammer suddenly in his hands slayer vanished in a blink of an eye and perrins hammer passed through empty air perrin breathed deeply the scents were there brine and wood wet with water seagulls and their droppings perrin used his newfound skill to hurl himself at that distant location shift perrin appeared on an empty dock in a city he didnt recognize slayer stood nearby inspecting his bow perrin attacked slayer brought his head up eyes widening his scent growing amazed he raised the bow to block but perrins swing shattered it with a roar perrin pulled his weapon back and swung again this time for slayers head oddly slayer smiled dark eyes glittering with amusement he smelled eager suddenly eager to kill a sword appeared in his raised hand and he twisted it to block perrins blow the hammer bounced off too hard as if it had hit stone perrin stumbled and slayer reached out placing a hand against perrins shoulder he shoved his strength was immense the shove tossed perrin backward to the dock but the wood disappeared as he hit perrin passed through empty air and splashed into the water beneath his bellow became a gurgle dark liquid surrounded him he struggled to swim upward dropping his hammer but found that the surface inexplicably became ice ropes snaked up from the depths whipping up around perrins arms yanking him downward through the frozen surface above he could see a shadow moving slayer raising his reformed bow the ice vanished and the water parted water streamed off perrin and he found himself staring up at arrow pointed directly at his heart slayer released perrin willed himself away shift he gasped hitting the stone outcropping where he had been with hopper perrin fell to his knees seawater streaming from his body he sputtered wiping his face heart pounding hopper appeared beside him panting his scent angry foolish cub stupid cub chase down a lion when youre barely weaned perrin shivered and sat up would slayer follow could he as minutes stretched and nobody appeared perrin began to relax the exchange with slayer had happened so quickly that it felt like a blur that strength it was more than any man could have and the ice the ropes he changed things perrin said made the dock vanish beneath me created ropes to bind me pushed the water back so that he could get a clear shot at me he is a lion he kills dangerous i need to learn i must face him hopper you are too young these things are beyond you too young perrin said standing hopper the last hunt is nearly upon us hopper lay down head on paws you always tell me that im too young perrin said or that i dont know what im doing well what is the point of teaching me if not to show me how to fight men like slayer we will see hopper sent for tonight you will go we are done perrin sensed a mournful cast to the sending and also a finality tonight oak dancers pack and hopper would grieve for morninglight sighing perrin sat with his legs crossed he concentrated and managed to imitate the things that hopper had done in tossing him from the dream it faded around him he woke on the pallet in his darkened tent faile snuggled up beside himperrin lay for a time staring up at the canvas the darkness reminded him of the tempestuous sky in the wolf dream sleep seemed as far off as caemlyn eventually he rosecarefully extricating himself from faile and pulled on his trousers and shirt the camp was dark outside but there was enough light for his eyes he nodded to kenly maerin and jaim dawtry the two rivers men who guarded his tent tonight whats the time he asked one of them after midnight lord perrin jaim said perrin grunted distant lightning lit the landscape he walked off and the men started to follow ill be fine without guards he told them watch over my tentlady faile still sleeps his tent was near the edge of camp he liked that it gave him a little more sense of seclusion nestled near the hillside at the western side of the camp though it was late he passed gaul sharpening his spear near a fallen log the tall stone dog stood up and began to follow and perrin didnt dismiss him gaul felt he hadnt been fulfilling his selfappointed duty of watching after perrin lately and had stepped up his efforts perrin thought he really just wanted an excuse to stay away from his own tent and the pair of gaishain women who had taken up residence there gaul kept his distance and perrin was glad was this how all leaders felt no wonder so many nations ended up at war with one anothertheir leaders never had any time to think by themselves and probably attacked to get people to stop pestering them a short distance away he entered a stand of trees with a small pile of logs dentonhis serving man until they got lamgwin backhad frowned when perrin had asked for them once a minor lord of cairhien denton had refused to return to his station he thought of himself as a servant now and would not let anyone convince him otherwise there was an axe not the deadly halfmoon blade he had once carried to battle but a sturdy woodsmans axe with a fine steel head and a haft smoothed by the sweaty hands of workers perrin rolled up his sleeves then spat on his hands and picked up the axe it felt good to hold the worked wood in his hands he raised it to his shoulder stood the first log in front of him then stepped back and swung he hit the log straight on splinters flipping into the dark night air the log railing into two pieces he split one of the halves next gaul took a seat beside a tree getting out a spear and continuing to sharpen its head the rasping of metal against metal accompanied perrins thunk of axe against wood it felt good why was it that his mind worked so much better when he was doing something loial spoke much of sitting and thinking perrin didnt think he himself could figure anything out that way he split another log the axe cutting clear was it really true could his own nature be to blame for the way he acted not the wolves hed never acted like that back in the two rivers he split another log always ivas good at concentrating my attention that was part of what had impressed master luhhan give perrin a project and hed keep working on it until he was done he split the halves of that log maybe the changes in him were a result of encountering the outside world hed blamed the wolves for many things and he had placed unnatural demands on hopper wolves werent stupid or simple but they did not care about things that humans did it must have been very hard for hopper to teach in a way that perrin would understand what did the wolf owe him hopper had died during that fateful night so long ago the night when perrin had first killed a man the night perrin had first lost control of himself in a battle hopper didnt owe perrin anything but he had saved perrin on several occasionsin fact perrin realized that hoppers intervention had helped to keep him from losing himself as a wolf he swung at a log a glancing blow that knocked it to the side he repositioned and continued gauls quiet sharpening soothing him he split it perrin grew caught up in what he was doing maybe too much that was true but at the same time if a man wanted to get anything done he had to work on one project until it was complete perrin had known men who never seemed to finish anything and their farms were a mess he couldnt live like that there had to be a balance perrin had claimed he had been pulled into a world filled with problems much larger than he was he had claimed he was a simple man what if he was wrong what if he was a complex man who had once happened to live a simple life after all if he was so simple why had he fallen in love with such a complicated woman the split logs were piling up perrin bent down gathering up quarters their grain rough against his fingers callused fingers he would never be a lord like those milkfed creatures from cairhien but there were other kinds of lords men like failes own father or men like lan who seemed more weapon than man perrin stacked the wood he enjoyed leading the wolves in his dream but wolves didnt expect you to protect them or to provide for them or to make laws for them they didnt cry to you when their loved ones died beneath your command it wasnt the leadership that worried him it was all the things that came with it he could smell elyas approaching with his loamy natural earthen scent he smelled like a wolf almost youre up late elyas said stepping up perrin heard gaul rustling slipping his spear back into its place on his bowcase then withdrawing with the silence of a sparrow streaking off into the sky he would stay close but would not listen in perrin looked up at the dark sky resting the axe on his shoulder sometimes i feel more awake at night than during the day elyas smiled perrin didnt see it but he could smell the amusement did you ever try to avoid it elyas perrin asked ignore their voices pretend that nothing about you had changed i did elyas said he had a soft low voice one that somehow suggested the earth in motion distant rumbles i wanted to but then the aes sedai wanted to gentle me i had to flee do you miss your old life elyas shruggedperrin could hear the motion the clothing scraping against itself no warder wants to abandon his duty sometimes other things are more important or well maybe they are just more demanding i dont regret my choices i cant leave elyas i wont i left my life for the wolves that doesnt mean you have to noam had to perrin said did he have to elyas said it consumed him he stopped being human he caught a scent of worry elyas had no answers do you ever visit wolves in your dreams elyas perrin asked a place where dead wolves run and live again elyas turned eyeing him that place is dangerous perrin its another world although tied to this one somehow legends say the aes sedai of old could go there and other people too perrin said thinking of slayer be careful in the dream i stay away from it his scent was wary do you ever have trouble perrin asked separating yourself from the wolf i used to but not any longer i found a balance elyas said how the older man fell still for a moment i wish i knew it was just something i learned perrin something youll have to learn or end up like noam perrin met elyas golden eyes then nodded thank you for the advice no perrin said for coming back for showing me that one of us at least can live with the wolves and not lose himself its nothing elyas said i had forgotten that it could be nice to be around people for a change i dont know how long i can stay though the last hunt is almost here perrin looked up at the sky again that it is pass the word on to tam and the others for me ive made my decision the whitecloaks have picked a place to fight ive decided to go ahead and meet them tomorrow all right elyas said you dont smell like you want to do it though it needs to be done perrin said and thats that everyone wanted him to be a lord well this was the sort of thing lords did made decisions that nobody wanted to make it would still sicken him to give the order hed seen a vision of those wolves running sheep toward a beast it seemed to him that maybe that was what he was doing running the whitecloaks toward destruction they certainly wore the color of sheeps wool but what to make of the vision of faile and the others approaching a cliff elyas moved off leaving perrin with the axe still on his shoulder he felt as if he hadnt been chopping logs but bodies chapter return to bandar eban rand and min did not announce themselves as they came to bandar eban they stepped through the gateway into a small alley guarded by two maidenslerian and heidiaalong with naeff the tall squarechinned ashaman the maidens scouted to the end of the alleyway peering suspiciously at the city rand stepped forward and laid a hand on heidias shoulder calming the slender woman who seemed anxious at rands guard being so few he wore his brown cloak overhead the clouds broke melting away above the city in response to rands arrival min looked upward feeling the warmth shine on her face the alley smelled terribleof refuse and wastebut a warm breeze blew through carrying the stenches away my lord dragon naeff said i dont like this you should have gteater protection let us return and gather it will be fine naeff rand said he turned to min and held out his hand she took it joining him naeff and the maidens had orders to follow behind at a distance they would draw attention as min and rand stepped out onto one of the domani capitals many boardwalks she raised a hand to her mouth it had only been a short time since rands departure how had the city changed so quickly the street was full of sickly dirty people crowded alongside walls huddled in blankets there wasnt room to move on the boardwalks min and rand had to step down into the mud to continue people coughed and moaned and she realized the stenches werent confined to the alley the entire city seemed to stink once banners had hung from many of these buildings but theyd been pulled down and ripped apart for blankets or fuel most of the buildings had broken windows with refugees clogging the doorways and floors inside as min and rand walked the people around them turned to watch some looked delirious others looked hungry and dangerous many were domani but there seemed to be as many palerskinned people refugees from almoth plain or saldaea perhaps min loosened a knife in her sleeve as they passed a group of young toughs lounging at an alley way s mouth perhaps naeff had been right this didnt feel safe i walked through ebou dar like this rand said softly suddenly she was aware of his pain a crushing guilt more hurtful than the wounds in his side that was part of what made me change the people in ebou dar were happy and wellfed they didnt look like these the seanchan rule better than i rand you arent responsible for this min said you werent here to his pain increased and she realized shed said the wrong thing yes he replied softly i wasnt here i abandoned this city when i saw that i could not use it as the tool i wished it to be i forgot min i forgot what this was all about tarn was so very right a man must know why he is fighting rand had sent his fatheralong with one of the ashamanto the two rivers to prepare and gather them for the last battle rand stumbled as he walked suddenly looking very tired he sat down on a nearby box a copperskinned urchin watched him keenly from a nearby doorway across the street a roadway branched off the main thoroughfare that one wasnt clogged with people brutishlooking men with cudgels stood at its mouth they break into gangs rand said softly shoulders bowing the rich hire the strong to protect them to fight away those who come seeking their wealth but its not a wealth of gold or jewelry its about food now rand she said going to one knee beside him you cant i know i must go on rand said but it hurts to know the things that ive done min by turning myself to steel i pushed out all of these emotions by allowing myself to care again to laugh again ive had to open myself to my failures too rand i see sunlight around you he looked up at her then glanced at the sky not that sunlight min whispered a viewing i see dark clouds pushed away by the sunlights warmth i see you a brilliant white sword held in your hand wielded against one of black held by a faceless darkness i see trees growing green again bearing fruit i see a field the crops healthy and full she hesitated i see the two rivers rand i see an inn there with the mark of the dragons fang inlaid on its door no longer be a symbol of darkness or hate a sign of victory and hope he looked to her min caught something from the corner of her eye she turned toward the people sitting on the street and gaped every single one had an image above them it was remarkable to see so many viewings all at once flaring to light above the heads of the sickly the weak and the abandoned i see a silver axe above that mans head she said pointing to a bearded beggar who lay against a wall his chin down against his chest he will be a leader in the last battle that woman therethe one sulking in the shadowsshe will be trained by the white tower and become aes sedai i can see the flame of tar valon beside her and i know what it means that man over there who looks like a simple street tough he will save her life i know he doesnt look like it but he will fight all of them will i can see it she looked at rand and took his hand you will be strong rand youll do this youll lead them i know it you saw that he asked in a viewing she shook her head i dont need to i believe in you i almost killed you he whispered when you look at me you see a murderer you feel my hand at your throat what of course i dont rand meet my eyes you can sense me through the bond do you feel a sliver of hesitation or fear from me he searched her eyes with his own so deep she didnt back down she could meet the eyes of this sheepherder he sat up straighter oh min what would i do without you she snorted you have kings and aiel chiefs following you aes sedai ashaman and taveren im certain youd get along no rand said youre more vital than them all you remind me who i am besides you think more clearly than most of those who call themselves my counselors you could be a queen if you wished it all i wish for is you stupid looby thank you he hesitated though i could manage without quite so much name calling lifes tough isnt it he smiled then he stood taking a deep breath his guilt was still there but he managed it now as he managed the pain nearby the refugees perked up rand turned toward the bearded wretch min had indicated earlier the man sat with his feet in the mud you the man said to rand youre him the dragon reborn yes rand said you were a soldier i the mans eyes grew distant another life i was in the kings guard before he was taken before we were seized by lady chadmar then disbanded the fatigue seemed to bleed from his eyes as he thought of earlier days excellent rand said we need to restore this city captain captain the man said but i he cocked his head then he stood up and brushed himself off he suddenly had a faintly military air about him despite the ripped clothing and the snarled beard well i suppose youre right but i dont think itll be easy the people are starving i will see to that rand said i need you to gather your soldiers i dont see many of the other lads here no wait theres votabek and redbord he waved to a pair of the toughs min had noticed earlier they hesitated then walked over durnham one of them asked whats this its time for the lawlessness in the city to end durnham said were going to organize things clean it up the lord dragon has returned one of them spat to the side he was a burly man with curly black hair domani skin and a thin mustache burn him he left us i he cut off as saw rand im sorry rand said meeting the mans eyes i failed you i will not do so again the man glanced at his companion who shrugged lains never going to pay us might as well see what we can do here naeff rand called waving the ashaman forward he and the maidens stepped up from where they had been watching make a gateway back to the stone i want weapons armor and uniforms ill do it immediately naeff said well have soldiers bring themno rand said pass the supplies through into this building here ill clear a place for the gateway inside it but no soldiers are to come rand raised his eyes looking at the street bandar eban has suffered enough beneath the hands of outsiders today she will not know the hand of a conqueror min stepped back and watched with wonder the three soldiers hastened into the building and cleared out the urchins when rand saw them he asked them to be messengers to run errands they responded everyone responded to rand when they took time to look at him perhaps another might have thought it some form of compulsion but min saw their faces change saw hope return as a glimmer in their eyes they saw something about rand they could trust something at least they hoped they could trust the three soldiers sent a few of the messenger boys and girls to fetch other former soldiers naeff made his gateway in minutes the original three soldiers stepped out of the building wearing silvery breastplates and simple clean clothing of green the men had combed their beards and hair and found some water to wash their faces as quickly as that they stopped looking like beggars and became soldiers a bit smelly but soldiers nonetheless the woman min had noted earlierthe one she was certain could learn to channelcame over to speak with rand after a bit she nodded and soon had gathered women and men to fill buckets from the well min frowned at that until they started wiping clean the faces and hands of those who approached people began to gather around some curious others hostile still others merely caught in the flow the woman and her team began sorting through them and setting them to work some to seek out the wounded or sickly others to take up swords and uniforms another woman began interrogating the urchins discovering where their parents were if they had any min sat down on the box that rand had been sitting on within the hour he had a group of soldiers five hundred strong led by captain durnham and his two lieutenants many of those five hundred kept glancing down at their clean clothing and silvery breastplates as if amazed rand spoke with many of them apologizing directly as he was speaking to one woman the crowd behind began to shuffle and move rand turned to see an aged man approaching his skin broken by terrible lesions the crowd kept its distance naeff rand called my lord bring the aes sedai through rand said there are people who require healing the woman who had gotten people to fill water buckets led the old man to one side my lord captain durnham said marching up min blinked the man had found a razor somewhere and shaved off his beard revealing a strong chin hed left a domani mustache four men followed him as a guard were going to need more room my lord durnham said that building you chose is overflowing and more and more are coming filling the street what do you suggest rand asked the docks durnham replied they are held by one of the city merchants ill wager we can find some nearempty warehouses to use those once held food but well there isnt any left and the merchant who holds the place rand asked my lord captain durnham said nothing you cant deal with rand smiled then waved for durnham to lead the way rand held his hand out to min rand she said joining him theyll need food yes he agreed he looked southward toward the nearby docks well find it there wont it already have been eaten rand didnt reply they joined the newly formed city guard walking at the head of a force in green and silver behind them trailed a growing throng of hopeful refugees the enormous docks of bandar eban were some of the most impressive in the world they lay in a halfmoon at the base of the city min was surprised to see how many ships were there most of them sea folk vessels thats right min thought rand had them bring food to the city but it had spoiled as rand had left the city hed gotten word that all of the food on those ships had fallen to the dark ones touch someone had set up blockades at the base of the roadway other roads to the docks looked similarly inhibited uniformed soldiers peeked out nervously from behind the barricade as rands force walked up stop right there a voice called we dont rand lifted his hand then waved it casually the barricadeformed of furniture and planksrumbled then slid to the side with a grinding of wood men cried out from behind scrambling away rand left the barricade slumped at the side of the road he stepped forward and min could sense peace inside of him a raggedlooking group of men with cudgels stood in the road eyes wide rand picked one at the front who is it that blocks my people from these docks and seeks to hoard food for himself i would speak with this person my lord dragon a surprised voice asked min glanced to the side a tall lean man in a red domani coat hustled toward them from the docks his shirt had once been fine and ruffled but was now wrinkled and unkempt he looked exhausted what was his name min thought iralin thats it master of the docks iralin rand asked what is going on here what have you done what have done the man demanded ive been trying to keep everyone from rushing those ships for the spoiled food anyone who eats it gets sick and dies the people wont listen several groups tried to storm the docks for the food so i decided not to let them kill themselves eating it the mans voice had never been that angry before min remembered him as peaceable lady chadmar fled an hour after you left iralin continued the other members of the council of merchants ran within the day those burning sea folk claim they wont sail away until theyve unloaded their waresor until i give them payment to do something else so ive been waiting for the city to starve itself eat that food and die or go up in another riot of flame and death thats what ive been doing here what have you been doing lord dragon rand closed his eyes and sighed he did not apologize to iralin as he had the others perhaps he saw that it would not have meant anything min glared at iralin he has weights upon his shoulders merchant he cannot watch over each and every it is all right min rand said laying his hand on her arm and opening his eyes it is no more than i deserve iralin before i left the city you told me that the food on those ships had spoiled did you check every barrel and sack i checked enough iralin said still hostile if you open a hundred sacks and you find the same thing in every one you figure out the pattern my wife has been trying to figure out a safe method of sifting the rotted grain from the safe grain if theres any safe grain to be had rand began walking toward the ships iralin followed looking confused perhaps because rand hadnt yelled at him min joined them rand approached a sea folk vessel sitting low in the water moored by ropes a group of sea folk lounged atop it would speak with your sailmistress rand called i am she said one of the sea folk a woman with white in her straight black hair and a pattern of tattoos across her right hand milis din shalada three stars i made a deal rand called up for food to be delivered here that one doesnt want it delivered milis said nodding to iralin he wont let us unload says that if we do hell have his archers loose on us i wouldnt be able to hold the people back iralin said ive had to spread rumors in town that the sea folk are holding the food hostage you see what we suffer for you milis said to rand i begin to wonder about our bargain with you rand althor do you deny that i am the coramoor rand asked meeting her eyes she seemed to have trouble looking away from him no milis said no guess that i do not you will want to board the whitecap i suppose if i may up with you then she said once the gangplank was in place rand strode up it followed by min with naeff and the two maidens after a moment iralin came too followed by the captain and some of his soldiers milis led them to the center of the deck where a hatch and ladder led down to the ships hold rand climbed down first moving awkwardly being onehanded min followed beneath light peeked through slots in the deck illuminating sack upon sack of grain the air smelled dusty and thick well be glad to have this cargo gone milis said softly coming down next its been killing the rats i would think youd appreciate that min said a ship without rats is like an ocean without storms milis said we complain about both but my crew mutters every time they find one of the vermin dead there were several open sacks of grain nearby turned on their sides spilling dark contents across the floor iralin had spoken of trying to sift the bad from the good but min didnt see any good just shriveled discolored grains rand stared at the open sacks as iralin came down into the hold captain durnham shuffled down the ladder last with his men nothing stays good any longer iralin said its not just this grainpeople brought winter stores from the farms with them theyre all gone were going to die and thats that we wont reach the bloody last battle we peace iralin rand said softly it is not so bad as you think he stepped forward and yanked free the tie on the top of a sack it fell to the side and golden barley spilled from it across the floor of the hold not a single speck of darkness on it the barley looked as if it had just been haryested each grain plump and full mills gasped what did you do to it nothing rand said you merely opened the wrong sacks the rest are all good merely iralin said we happened to open the exact number of bad sacks without reaching one of the good ones thats ridiculous not ridiculous rand said laying his hand iralins shoulder simply implausible you did well here iralin im sorry to have left you in such a predicament im naming you to the merchant council irilin gaped to the side captain durnham pulled open another sack this ones good sos this one said one of his men potatoes here another soldier said from beside a barrel look as good as any ive had better than most actually not dried up like youd expect from winter leftovers spread the word rand said to the soldiers gather your men to set up distribution in one of the warehouses i want this grain well guarded iralin was wise to worry that the people would rush the docks dont give out uncooked grainthat will turn people to hoarding and bartering with it well need cauldrons and fires to cook some of it move the rest to stores hurry now yes sir captain durnham said the people ive gathered so far will help rand said they wont steal the grain we can trust them have them unload the ships and burn the bad grain there should be thousands of sacks that are still good rand looked to min come i need to organize the aes sedai for wealing he hesitated looking at the stunned iralin lord iralin you are steward of the city for now and durnham is your commander you will soon have sufficient troops to restore order steward of the city iralin said can you do that rand smiled somebody must hurry about your work there is much to do i can only remain here long enough for you to make things stable a day or so rand turned to climb up the ladder a day iralin said still standing in the hold with min to get things stable we cant possibly do it in that time can we i think youll be surprised by him lord iralin min said gripping the ladder and starting to climb i am each day chapter perrin rode stepper out of camp leading a large army they didnt fly the wolfhead banner so far as he knew his order to burn the things had been followed he was less certain of that decision now there was an odd scent in the air a staleness like the inside of a room that had been left locked up for years stepper trotted onto the jehannah road grady and neald flanked perrin directly and they smelled eager neald you sure youre ready perrin asked as he turned the army to the southeast i feel as strong as i ever have my lord neald answered strong enough to kill some whitecloaks ive always wanted a chance to do that only a fool looks for a chance to kill perrin said br yes my lord neald said though maybe i should mention no need to speak of that grady interrupted what perrin asked grady looked embarrassed its nothing im sure say it grady perrin said the older man took a deep breath we tried to make a gateway this morning to send refugees back and it didnt work one time earlier it happened too weaves fell apart and unraveled on us perrin frowned other weaves work fine they do neald said quickly like i said my lord grady said im sure it will work when we try again just not enough practice it wasnt likely that theyd need traveling to retreat from this battlenot with only two ashaman and so large a force but it was still disconcerting to lose the chance it had better not happen with other weaves he was depending on grady and neald to confuse and disrupt the initial whitecloak charge maybe we should turn back perrin thought but squelched the thought immediately he didnt like having to make this decision it made him sick to think of fighting man against man when their real enemy was the dark one but his hand had been forced they continued on his hammer in its strap at his side hopper had implied it was no different from the axe to the wolf one weapon was like another mayener winged guards rode beside him redpainted breastplates gleaming looking like graceful hawks ready to swoop alliandres soldiers straightforward and determined rode behind like boulders poised to crush two rivers longbowmen like sapling oaks were nimble yet sturdy aiel like adders with razor teeth wise ones reluctantly drawn along uncertain thunderheads boiling with unpredictable energy he didnt know if they would fight for him the rest of his army was less impressive thousands of men with a range of experience and agesome mercenaries some refugees from maiden some women who had seen the maidens and cha faile and insisted on being trained alongside the men perrin hadnt stopped them the last battle was coming who was he to forbid those who wanted to fight he had considered forbidding faile to come today but hed known how that would turn out instead he placed her at the back surrounded by wise ones and cha faile accompanied by aes sedai perrin gripped his reins tighter listening to the marching feet few of the refugees had armor arganda had called them light infantry perrin had another term for them innocents with blades why did they follow him couldnt they see that they would fall first they trusted him light burn them they all trusted him he rested his hand on his hammer smelling the damp air mixed with fear and excitement the thunder of hooves and footsteps reminding him of the dark sky thunder with no lightning lightning with no thunder the battlefield was ahead a broad green grassland lined on the far end by troops in white that whitecloak army wore silver breastplates shined to perfection their tabards and cloaks a pure white this grassy plain was a good place to have a battle it would also be a good place to plant crops to understand a thing you must understand its parts and its purpose what had been the purpose of his war axe to kill that was why it had been made that was all it had been good for but the hammer was different perrin pulled stepper up sharply beside him the ashaman stopped and the entire column of troops started to pull to a halt groups bunched up as they slowed yelled orders replaced the sounds of marching the air was still the sky overhead dreary he couldnt smell the grass or the distant trees for the dust in the air and the men sweating in their armor horses snorted a number of them nibbling at the grass others shuffled catching the tension of their riders my lord grady asked what is it the whitecloak army was already in position with a v formation of riders at the front they waited lances upright ready to be lowered to spill blood the axe only kills perrin said but the hammer can either create or kill that is the difference it made sense to him suddenly that was why hed needed to throw the axe away he could choose not to kill he would not be pushed into this he turned to gaul who stood with several maidens a short distance away i want the aes sedai and wise ones up here now perrin hesitated order the aes sedai but ask the wise ones order the two rivers men up as well gaul nodded and ran to do as asked perrin turned back to the whitecloaks for all their faults the whitecloaks considered themselves honorable they wouldnt attack until perrin was in position the cluster of wise ones and aes sedai joined him at the front faile he noticed rode with them well he had told her to stay with them he held out a hand to her inviting her next to him the two rivers men came up on the flank of his force gaul said you were very polite edarra noted to perrin that means you want something from us that we will not want to do perrin smiled i want you to help me prevent this battle you do not wish to dance the spears edarra asked i have heard some of what these men in white have done in the wetlands i think they wearr white to hide what is dark inside of them theyre confused perrin said well theyre more than confused theyre lightcursed frustrating but we shouldnt be fighting them not with the last battle coming if we squabble among ourselves we will lose to the dark one edarra laughed i would like to see someone tell that to the shaido perrin aybara or rather i would like to have seen someone suggest that to you when they still held your wife well the shaido needed killing he said but i dont know if these whitecloaks do maybe they only need a good fright i want you and the aes sedai to blast the ground in front of their army you ask something you should not aybara seonid said sternly we will not take part in your battle the diminutive green met his eyes voice crisp and curt youre not taking part in battle perrin said youre preventing one seonid frowned im afraid it would be the same in this case if we attack the earth it would be using the one power as a weapon we could hurt those men im sorry perrin ground his teeth but did not force them the wise ones and ashaman would probably be enough he turned to the two rivers men tarn tell the men to nock arrows and be ready to launch a volley tarn nodded sending a runner with the order the two rivers men lined up this was beyond the range of most bows but a good pull on a two rivers longbow could manage it perrin nodded to the wise ones then motioned toward the ashaman before anything else could be said the ground in front of the whitecloaks erupted a rumble shook the meadow dirt exploding into the air grady and neald moved their horses forward the whitecloaks horses reared and men shouted in terror a small group of men at the very front didnt seem disturbed by the explosions and they kept their horses under control those would be the leaders indeed perrins eyes could make out the lord captain commander himself sitting there dirt sprayed into the air again falling to pelt the trench beneath the wise ones wore that look of concentration that came with channeling can one of you enhance my voice perrin asked i can do it grady said i saw the mhael do it once good perrin said turning to tarn once the channelers stop tell the men to give me a couple of long volleys try and hit that trench a few moments later the explosions ended the two rivers men drew a volley and loosed it thick shafts rose in an arc and soon the rift bristled with arrows perrin watched the whitecloak army they had broken ranks standing in disorder a clank of armor matched by hoofbeats announced argandas arrival the first captain of ghealdan wore his plumed helm his eyes hard beneath it what was the point of that if i may ask lord aybara he smelled fie you just gave away our advantage an ambush could have killed thousands and broken their initial charge yes perrin said faile still rode at his other side and they know it look at their lines arganda theyre worried the whitecloaks are realizing what theyd have to go through to charge us if i was willing to give them this as a warning burst what was i holding back but that was the extent of what we can do faile said they dont know that perrin grinned it would be stupid of us to commit everything we have in a warning blast like that arganda held his tongue though he obviously was thinking that very thing he was a soldier to the bone an axe there was nothing wrong with that but perrin had to be the hammer when he pointed men like arganda killed grady perrin said my voice please i wouldnt mind if our army could hear what i say too i can manage that grady said perrin took a deep breath then spoke i am perrin aybara his voice boomed across the plain i am friend to the dragon reborn and i serve here at his command i am marching to the last battle lord captain commander you demanded i meet with you on your terms before and i came i ask you to return the honor here and meet as i request if you are determined to kill me before i ride against the shadow at least do me the service of giving me one last chance to prevent spilling blood this day he nodded to grady and the man released his weave do we have a pavilion we could set up for parley back at the camp faile said i can try a gateway neald said knuckling his mustacheor at least the thin bit of fur on his face that he called a mustache waxed to points try it he concentrated nothing happened the young man blushed furiously doesnt work not traveling or skimming i see perrin said well lets send a rider back we should be able to have the tent set up here in minutes i dont know if theyll agree to meet but i want to get ready in case they do bring berelain and alliandre back as well and perhaps someone with drinks and the chairs and table from my tent the proper orders were given and a two rivers manrobb solterrode off maidens trailing after him the whitecloaks seemed to be considering his proposition good arganda and most of the others spread out to pass the word about what was happening though they couldnt possibly have missed perrins announcement everyone seemed to be doing what they should so perrin sat back in his saddle to wait faile sidled her horse up to him she smelled intrigued what perrin asked somethings changed about you im trying to figure out what im stalling perrin said i havent made any decisions yet but i dont want to kill these men not yet not unless i have to theyre not going to give any ground husband faile said theyve already judged you well see he said he looked up at the sky thinking of the strange scent and the fact that the ashaman gateways werent working slayer was prowling this area in the wolf dream and there was that wall of glass something felt very wrong on the wind and his senses itched at him be wary be prepared the hammer could kill or create he didnt know which situation this was yet he didnt intend to strike until he did galad sat on the grassy plain that should have been a field of battle looking at the trench torn in the ground bristling with hundreds of arrows he was prepared for aes sedai an aes sedai could not hurt someone unless she or her warder was in danger and galad had given very specific orders to his people not to engageor even go nearaes sedai if the children saw aes sedai they were to stop and nod their heads turning their weapons away if his men showed plainly that they would not harm aes sedai then the sisters should be useless in battle many of the children did not believe this they called the stories of the three oaths deliberate fabrications they hadnt lived in the white tower galad didnt like most aes sedai and he certainly didnt trust them but he knew that the oaths did hold galad s men moved back into line muttering he raised his looking glass inspecting aybaras front line men in black coats several aiel women including one of those who had come with aybara to their first meetings a channeler no doubt he imagined the ground exploding beneath his charging forces knocking the cavalry into the air others falling into the trench while the later lines stalled in confusion prey to those impressive longbows bornhald rode up to galad his face angry we arent really going to parley are we galad lowered his looking glass yes i think we are but we already met with him bornhald said you said you wanted to see those eyes as proof he was shadowspawn and you saw them what more do you need byar said nudging his mount closer he often acted as a guard to galad these days he cant be trusted my lord captain commander galad nodded at the trench he could have destroyed us with that attack i agree with byar bornhald said he wants to draw you out then kill you to demoralize us galad nodded slowly thats possible he turned to lord captain harnesh who rode nearby if i die i want you to take command and charge attack without mercy i repeal my order to avoid aes sedai kill anyone who seems to be channeling make it a priority its possible that we do not understand what is happening here but youre still going bornhald asked yes galad said he had let bornhald and byar goad him into battle but now he wondered if hed been too hasty he had seen those eyes and had heard the testimonies of both his children and some of those who had ridden with aybara it had seemed clear that attacking was the thing to do but aybara was right he had come to meet with galad when asked perhaps there was a way to prevent bloodshed galad did not believe it but if there was even a chance then delaying was the right thing it was as simple as that bornhald did not seem pleased his anger at the man who had killed his father was understandable but it could not be allowed to guide the children you may come with me galad said nudging his horse forward that goes for you as well child byar the lords captain should remain behind scattered through the men lest aybara leave us without leaders harnesh saluted bornhald reluctantly fell into place beside galad as did byar whose eyes burned with a wild zeal that matched bornhald s anger both had experienced defeat and indignity at the hands of this perrin aybara galad also took fifty children as guards riding in formation behind him a pavilion was set up by the time they arrived flat topped and simple it had four poles stretching the brownish gray canvas there was a small square table under it accompanied by two chairs aybara sat on one side of the table he stood up as galad approached today the large man wore a green coat and brown trousersboth well crafted but plainand had that hammer slung at his waist the clothes had an earthy sensibility to them no this was not a man of palaces but a man of fields and forests a woodsman who had risen to be a lord a pair of two rivers men stood at the back of the pavilion holding powerful two rivers longbows they were said to be independent farmers and herdsmen of old sturdy stock and they had chosen this perrin aybara to lead them galad walked toward the pavilion byar and bornhald joined him though the other fifty remained mounted outside unlike their last meeting there were aes sedai here three whom he could spot a short cairhienin woman a slim pleasantlooking woman in a simple dress a stocky woman whose numerous braids meant she was likely from tarabon they stood with the group of aiel women in shawls guarded by a handful of maidens of the spear well those aiel did give credence to the claim that aybara had been sent by the dragon reborn galad rested his hand casually on the pommel of his sword looking over the pavilions other occupants and then he froze a strikingly beautiful woman stood behind aybaras chair no not beautiful gorgeous lustrous black hair streamed down past her neck it seemed to shine she wore a red gown thin enough to accentuate her form and deeply cut enough to expose swelling bosom and those eyes so dark with long beautiful lashes he seemed pulled toward them why hadnt this woman come last time you appear surprised aybara said as he sat back down he had a gruff voice the lady first is here at the lord dragons command as am didnt you notice the flag of mayene above my forces i galad snapped his mouth closed executing a bow to the woman berelain sur paendrag paeron she was said to be a marvelous beauty but those tales did her little justice galad tore his eyes from her and forced himself to take the seat opposite aybara he had to concentrate on his foe those golden eyes were as unsettling as he remembered so strange to look into yes this man couldnt be anything other than shadowspawn why would so many follow such a creature why would she follow such a creature thank you for coming aybara said our last meeting was hasty well do it proper this time you should be made aware that this woman beside me is alliandre maritha kigarin queen of ghealdan blessed of the light defender of garens wall so that stately darkhaired woman was the current queen of ghealdan of course with the unrest here lately there were probably a halfdozen people trying to claim the throne she was pretty but completely overshadowed by berelain perrin nodded toward a third woman this is faile ni bashere tavbara my wife and cousin to the queen of saldaea aybaras wife regarded galad with suspicion yes she was obviously saldaean by that nose bornhald and byar hadnt known of her royal connections two monarchs in the tent and both behind aybara galad rose from his seat and gave a bow to alliandre to match the one hed given berelain your majesty youre very polite lord captain commander berelain said and those were elegant bows tell me where did you receive such training her voice was like music in the court of andor my lady i am galad damodred stepson of the departed queen morgase and halfbrother of elayne trakand the rightful queen ah perrin said about time i put a name to you wish youd said that last time berelain stared into his eyes and she smiled looking as if she wanted to step forward she caught herself however galad damodred yes i thought i recognized something in your face how is your sister i hope she is well galad said i have not seen her in some time elaynes fine perrin said gruffly last i heardwhich was only a few days backshed secured her claim to the throne i wouldnt be surprised if shes looking to marry rand by now if she can pull him away from whatever realm hes conquering behind galad byar hissed softly had aybara intended insult by indicating a relationship between elayne and the dragon reborn unfortunately galad knew his sister all too well she was impulsive and she had shown an unseemly fascination with young althor my sister may do as she wishes galad said surprised at how easily he contained his annoyance at both her and the dragon reborn we are here to discuss you perrin aybara and your army aybara leaned forward laying two hands on the table we both know this isnt about my army what is it about then galad asked aybara met his gaze with those unnatural eyes of his its about a pair of children of the light i killed two years back now every time i turn around it seems that there is a group of you snapping at my heels it wasnt often that a murderer was so open about what he had done galad heard the rasp of a sword being drawn behind him and raised a hand child bornhald you will control yourself two children of the light shadowspawn bornhald spat and what of my father i had nothing to do with his death bornhald aybara said geofram was killed by the seanchan unfortunately for a whitecloak he seemed like a reasonable man though he was planning to hang me he was to hang you for the murders you just confessed to galad said calmly shooting a glance at bornhald the man snapped his sword back in its sheath but his face was red they werent murders aybara said they attacked me i fought back that is not what i have heard galad said what game was this man playing i have sworn testimony that you were hiding underneath a cleft in the rock when the men asked you to come out you jumped out screaming and attacked them without provocation oh there was provocation aybara said your whitecloaks killed a friend of mine the woman who was with you galad asked from what i hear she escaped safely hed been shocked when bornhald had mentioned that name egwene alvere another woman who seemed to prefer dangerous company not her perrin said a friend named hopper and after him a companion of his they were wolves the man was condemning himself further you make friends of wolves known to be creatures of the shadow wolves arent of the shadow aybara said they hate shadowspawn as much as any man ive known and how do you know this aybara said nothing further there was more there byar said this man seemed able to command wolves run with them like a wolf himself that testimony was part of what had persuaded galad that battle was the only recourse it seemed that byars words had not been exaggeration but there was no need yet to dwell on that aybara had admitted to murder i dont accept the killing of wolves as something to exonerate you galad said many hunters slay wolves who attack their flocks or threaten their lives the children did nothing wrong your attack on them therefore was unprovoked murder there was far more to it than that aybara said but i doubt ill convince you of that i cannot be convinced of something that isnt true galad said and you wont leave me alone either aybara said we are at an impasse then galad said you have confessed to crimes that i as a servant of justice must see righted i cannot walk away you see why i felt further parley was useless what if i were willing to stand trial perrin asked aybaras boldnosed wife rested a hand on his shoulder he reached up and laid his hand on it but did not turn away from galad if you will come and accept punishment from us for what youve done galad said it would mean execution surely the creature wouldnt give himself up at the back of the pavilion a group of servants had arrived and were preparing tea tea at a war parley obviously aybara had little experience with this kind of thing not punishment aybara said sharply a trial if i am proven innocent i go free and youthe lord captain commanderinstruct your men to stop hounding me especially bornhald and that one behind you who growls like a pup seeing his first leopard and if you are proven guilty that depends dont listen to him my lord captain commander byar said he promised to give himself to us once before then betrayed his word i did not aybara said you did not fulfill your part of the bargain galad slapped the table this is useless there will be no trial why not aybara demanded you talk of justice but wont offer me a trial and who would judge it galad asked would you trust me to do so of course not perrin said but alliandre can shes a queen and your companion galad said i mean her no insult but i fear she would acquit you without hearing evidence even the lady first would not be adequatethough i would of course trust her word i fear that my men would not light but that woman was beautiful he glanced at her for a moment and found her blushing as she regarded him it was faint but he was sure he saw it he found himself blushing as well the aes sedai then aybara said galad tore his eyes away from berelain and looked at aybara giving him a flat stare if you think that a judgment by one from the white tower would satisfy my men you know little of the children of the ligh perrin aybara aybaras eyes grew hard yes he knew that it was too bad a trial would have been a tidy end to this a serving woman approached the table with two cups of tea but there was no need this second parley was over youre right then aybara said looking frustrated this meeting was pointless no galad said stealing another glance at berelain not pointless for me he knew more of aybaras strength that would help him in battle beyond that it had been right to delay fighting for a short time to make certain it was needed there was still plenty of light in the day for the fighting to proceed but what of that woman the lady first he forced himself to look away it was difficult galad stood and bowed to alliandre then to berelain he moved to leave then he heard a gasp oddly it came from the serving woman who had brought the tea galad glanced at her it was morgase galad froze completely still hed been trained by swordmaster after swordmaster never to let his surprise overwhelm him but at that moment their careful training was for naught that was his stepmother that redgold hair he had tugged as a child that face so beautiful and strong those eyes those were her eyes a ghost he had heard the stories manifestations of the dark ones evil returning the dead to life but nobody else in the pavilion seemed uneasy and this woman was too real hesitantly galad reached out and touched the apparition on the cheek the skin was warm galad she said what are you doing here how she cut off as he seized her in an embrace causing those around him on both sides to jump in surprise she jumped too she lived how i killed valda galad thought immediately killed him for the death of my mother who is not dead i have done evil no valda had deserved to die for the assault on morgase or was that part true he had spoken to children sure that it was but theyd also been sure she was dead he would sort that out later right now he needed to stop embarrassing himself in front of his men he released his stepmother but she kept hold of his arm she looked dazed he had rarely seen her that way perrin aybara had stood up and was watching them with a frown you know maighdin maighdin galad asked she wore a simple dress and no jewelry was she trying to hide as a servant aybara this is morgase trakand defender of the realm protector of the people high seat of house trakand she is your queenl that brought a stillness to the pavilion aybara scratched at his beard thoughtfully his wife watched morgase with eyes wide either shocked or angry maighdin aybara said is this true she lifted her chin staring aybara in the eyes how could they not see the queen in her i am morgase trakand she said but i have renounced my throne in favor of elayne before the light i will never again claim the crown galad nodded yes she must have feared that aybara would use her against andor im taking you back to my camp mother galad said still watching aybara then we can discuss the way you were treated by this man she turned level eyes on galad an order galad have i no say in the matter he frowned leaning in and speaking in a whisper does he have others captive what leverage does he have over you she shook her head and replied softly this man is not what you think he is galad hes roughcut and i certainly dont like what hes doing to andor but he is no friend of the shadow i have more to fear from your associates than from perrin aybara yes she did have reason to distrust the children good reason will you come with me my lady i promise you that you may leave and return to aybaras camp at any time whatever you suffered from the children in the past you will be safe now i vow this morgase gave him a nod damodred aybara said wait a moment galad turned laying his hand on his sword pommel again not as a threat but a reminder many of those in the pavilion had begun to whisper yes galad asked you wanted a judge aybara said would you accept your mother in that position galad didnt hesitate of course shed been a queen since her eighteenth nameday and he had seen her sit in judgment she was fair harsh but fair but would the other children accept her shed been trained by the aes sedai theyd see her as one of them a problem but if it gave a way out of this perhaps he could make them see the truth i would galad said and if i vouched for her my men would as well well aybara said id accept her too both men turned to morgase she stood in her simple yellow dress looking more a queen by the moment perrin she said if i sit in judgment i will not temper my decisions you took me in when we needed shelter and for that i am appreciative but if i decide that you have committed murder i will not hold back my decision that will do aybara said he seemed sincere my lord captain commander byar said softly in galad s ear sounding fervent i fear this would be a farce hes not said he would submit to punishment no i have not aybara said how had he heard those whispers it would be meaningless you think me a darkfriend and a murderer you wouldnt accept my word on taking punishment not unless i was in your custody which i wont allow see byar said more loudly what is the point galad met aybaras golden eyes again it will give us a trial he said growing more certain and legal justification im beginning to see child byar we must prove our claims otherwise we are no better than asunawa but the trial will not be fair galad turned to the tall soldier are you questioning my mothers impartiality the gaunt man froze then shook his head no my lord captain commander galad turned back to aybara i ask queen alliandre to grant that this trial be legally binding in her realm if lord aybara requests it i will she sounded uncomfortable i do request it alliandre perrin said but only if damodred agrees to release all of my people that hes holding keep the supplies but let the people go as you promised me you would before very well galad said it will happen once the trial begins i promise it when will we meet give me a few days to prepare in three days then galad said we hold the trial here in this pavilion in this place bring your witnesses aybara said ill be here chapter a call to stand i am not opposed to questioning the lord dragon egwene read from the letter as she sat in her study indeed the more absolute a mans power becomes the more necessary questioning becomes however know that i am not a man who gives his loyalty easily and i h ave given my loyalty to him not because of the throne he provided me but because of what he has done for tear yes he grows more erratic by the day what else are we to expect from the dragon reborn he will break the world we knew this when we gave him our allegiance much as a sailor must sometimes give his loyalty to the captain who steers his ship straight for the strand when an unnavigable tempest rises behind the strand is the only option still your words bring me concern the destruction of the seals is not something we should undertake without careful discussion the lord dragon charged me with raising him an army and i have done so if you provide the gateways you have promised i will bring some troops to this meeting place along with the loyal high lords and ladies be warned however that the seanchan presence to my west continues to weigh heavily upon my mind the bulk of my armies must remain behind high lord darlin sisnera king of tear beneath the rule of the dragon reborn rand althor egawene tapped the sheet with one finger she was impresseddarlin had committed his words to paper rather than sending a messenger with them memorized if a messenger fell into the wrong hands his words could always be denied convicting a man of treason based on the testimony of one messenger was difficult words on paper however bold by writing them darlin said i do not care if the lord dragon discovers what i have written i stand by it but leaving behind the bulk of his army that would not do egwene inked her pen king darlin your concern for your kingdom is well measured as is your loyalty to the man you follow i know that the seanchan are a danger to tear but let us not forget that the dark one not the seanchan is our primary concern during these worst of days perhaps it is easy to think yourself safe from the trollocs when so distant from the battle lines but how will you feel once the cushions ofandor and cairhien have fallen you are separated from the seanchan by hundreds of miles egwene paused tar valon had been separated from the seanchan by hundreds of miles and had nearly been destroyed he was right to be afraid and he was a good king for considering it but she needed his army at the field of merrilor perhaps she could offer a way for him to both be safe and help with rand illian holds for now she wrote and gives you a buffer between the seanchan and yourself i will provide you with gateways and a promise if the seanchan move against tear will give you gateways so you can return immediately and defend your nation she hesitated chances were good that the seanchan had traveling now nobody was safe from them no matter how far or close they might be if they decided to strike for tear even giving darlin gateways back might not be enough to help she felt a shiver remembering her own time with the seanchan captive as a damane she loathed them with a hatred that sometimes worried her but dariins support was essential to her plans she gritted her teeth and continued writing the dragon reborn must see our full forces marshaled to oppose his brash intentions if he sees this as halfhearted we will never dissuade him from his course please come with all of your troops she sanded the letter then folded and sealed it darlin and elayne were monarchs of two of the most powerful kingdoms both were very important to her plans next she would respond to a letter from gregorin den lushenos of illian she hadnt yet told him directly that she had mattin stepaneos at the white tower but had hinted at it shed also spoken to mattin himself letting him know he was free to leave if he wished she would not be in the habit of holding monarchs against their will unfortunately mattin was now afraid for his life should he return hed been gone too long and he viewed illian as being in the dragon reborns pocket which it probably was what a mess one problem at a time gregorin the steward in illian was very hesitant to support her causehe seemed more intimidated by rand than darlin was and the seanchan were not a distant concern for him they were practically pounding on his city gates she wrote gregorin a firm letter giving a promise like the one shed given darlin perhaps she could arrange to keep mattin awaysomething both men might want though she wouldnt let gregorin know thatin exchange for him bringing his armies northward obliquely she realized what she was doing she was using rands proclamation as a beacon by which to gather and tie the monarchs to the white tower they would come to support her arguments against breaking the seals but in the end they would serve humankind in the last battle a knock came at her door she looked up as silviana peeked in the woman held up a letter it was curled tightly from having been carried in by pigeon your expression is grim egwene noted the invasion has begun she said watchtowers across the blightborder go silent one at a time waves of trollocs advance beneath clouds that boil black kandor arafel and saldaea are at war do they hold egwene asked with a spike of fear yes silviana said but news is uncertain and piecemeal this letterwhich is from an eyesandears i trustclaims that an assault this massive has not been seen since the trolloc wars egwene took a deep breath what of tarwins gap i dont know find out call siuan in here she might have more the blue network is the most extensive siuan wouldnt know everything of course but she would have her fingers in it silviana nodded curtly she didnt say the obviousthat the blue network was the blue ajahs not to be preempted by the amyrlin well the last battle was at hand some concessions had to be made silviana closed the door softly and egwene picked up her pen to finish her screed to gregorin she was interrupted by another knock this one much rnore hasty silviana threw open the door a second later mother she said theyre meeting as you said they would egwene felt a stab of annoyance she calmly put down her pen and stood let us be to it then she walked from her study pace hurried in the keepers antechamber she passed a pair of acceptednicola who had just been raised and nissa shed like them both raised to the shawl before the last battle they were young but powerful and every sister would be neededeven one who like nicola had proved to have terrible judgment in the past these two had brought the news about the hall the novices and accepted were among the most loyal to egwene but were often ignored by the sisters for now they remained behind as egwene and silviana hurried toward the hall i cant believe they would try this silviana said softly as they walked its not what you think egwene guessed they wont try to depose me the division is too fresh in their minds then why meet without you there are ways to move against an amyrlin without deposing her shed been expecting this for some time but that didnt make it any less frustrating aes sedai would unfortunately be aes sedai it had only been a matter of time before someone decided to try wrenching power from her they reached the hall egwene pushed open the doors and stepped in her appearance was met with cool aes sedai gazes the seats werent all filled but twothirds of them were she was surprised to see three red sitters what of pevara and javindhra it appeared that their extended absence during this time had prompted the red to action they had been replaced by raechin and viria connoral the sisters were the only siblings in the white tower now that vandene and adeleas were dead an odd choice but not unexpected both romanda and lelaine were in attendance they met egwenes gaze evenly how strange to see them here with so many sisters who they had been at odds with a common foeegwenecould heal any number of rifts she should have been pleased at that perhaps lelaine was the only blue and there was also only one brown takima who looked sick the ivoryskinned brown wouldnt meet egwenes gaze there were two whites two yellowsincluding romandatwo grays and all three greens egwene gritted her teeth when she saw that that was the ajah she would have joined but it gave her the most grief egwene did not chastise them for meeting without her she simply strode down between them silviana announcing her egwene turned and sat down on the amyrlin seat her back to the huge rose window there she sat quietly well romanda finally asked her gray hair up in a bun she looked like a mother wolf sitting atop the ledge out front of her den are you going to say anything mother you did not inform me of this meeting egwene said so i assume you do not want my words i have come merely to watch that seemed to make them more uncomfortable silviana walked to her side brandishing one of her best expressions of displeasure all right then rubinde said i believe we were going to hear from saroiya next the blocky white was one of the sitters who had left the tower when elaida was raised but she had made her share of trouble in salidar egwene was not surprised to see her here the woman stood pointedly not looking at egwene i will add my testimony during the days of uncertainty within the towerthat would mean the division few sisters liked to speak of it outrightthe amyrlin did exactly as romanda indicated we were taken by surprise when she called for a declaration of war within the law there are provisions that give the amyrlin almost total power when official war is declared by being goaded into making war with elaida we gave the amyrlin the means to subject the hall to her will she looked around the room but did not turn to egwene it is my opinion that she will try something similar again that must be prevented the hall is meant to be a balance upon the amyrlins power she sat down hearing the words actually relieved egwene one could never be certain what kinds of scheming were happening in the white tower this meeting meant her plans were proceeding as hoped and that her enemiesor well her reluctant allieshadnt seen what she was really doing they were busy reacting to things shed done months ago that didnt mean they werent dangerous but when a person anticipated danger it could be handled what can we do magla asked she glanced at egwene to be prudent i mean to make certain the hall of the tower is in no way limited we cannot declare war lelaine said firmly and yet to avoid it varilin said war is declared between halves of the white tower but not against the shadow war takima said hesitantly is already declared against the shadow need there be an official proclamation is not our existence enough indeed do not the oaths make our position clear but we must make some kind of declaration romanda said she was eldest among them and would be the one running the meeting something to make the position of the hall known to dissuade the amyrlin from an imprudent call for war romanda didnt seem embarrassed at all by what they had done here she looked directly at egwene no she and lelaine would not quickly forgive egwene for choosing a red as her keeper but how would we send such a message andaya asked i mean what are we to do make a pronouncement from the hall that there wont be a declaration of war would that not sound ridiculous the women fell silent egwene found herself nodding though not specifically to what was being said she had been raised through unconventional circumstances left alone the hall would try to establish its power as greater than hers this day could easily have meant a step toward that the amyrlin seats strength had not been constant through the centuries one could rule almost totally while another was controlled by the sitters i believe the hall acts in wisdom egwene said speaking very carefully the sitters turned to her some looked relieved those who were more familiar with her however looked suspicious well that was good better they regard her as a threat than as a child to be bullied she hoped they would eventually respect her as their leader but there was only so much she could do with the time given the war between factions within the tower was a different type of battle egwene continued it was deeply and individually my battle as amyrlin for that division was initially about the amyrlin seat but the war against the shadow is more vast than any one person it is greater than you or i greater than the white tower it is the war of all life and creation from the most destitute of beggars to the most powerful of queens the sitters considered that in silence romanda spoke first and so you would not oppose the hall taking over prosecution of the war managing general brynes armies and the tower guard that depends egwene said upon how the provision was worded there was movement in the hallway outside and saerin bustled into the hall accompanied by janya frende they shot takima withering glances and she shrank down like a threatened bird saerin and egwenes other supporters would have been informed of this meeting just after egwene herself was romanda cleared her throat perhaps we should see if there is anything in the law of war that can help im certain you have studied it quite thoroughly now romanda egwene said what is it you propose there is a provision for the hall taking up prosecution of a war romanda said that requires the amyrlins assent egwene said idly if that was romandas game then how had she intended to get egwene s approval after meeting without her perhaps shed had a different plan yes it would require the amyrlins agreement said raechin she was a tall darkhaired woman and liked to wear her hair in a coil of braids atop her head but you said that you thought us wise to take this measure well egwene said trying to sound as if she were being pressed into a corner agreeing with the hall is quite different from allowing a provision to ban me from the daytoday workings of the army what is the amyrlin seat to do if not see to the war by reports youve been dedicating yourself to wrangling kings and queens lelaine said that seems a fine task for the amyrlin then youll stand for such a provision egwene said the hall sees to the army while i am given authority for dealing with the monarchs of the world i lelaine said yes id stand for that i suppose i could agree egwene said shall we put it to a vote romanda said quickly as if pouncing on the moment very well egwene said who will stand for this motion rubinde rose to her feet and was joined by faiselle and farnah the other greens raechin and her sister stood quickly though barasine was watching egwene with eyes narrowed magla stood next and romanda reluctantly joined her ferane rose slowly lelaine was next she and romanda shot daggered glances at one another that was nine egwenes heart beat quickly as she glanced at takima the woman seemed very disturbed as if trying to sort through egwenes plan the same went for saroiya the calculating white studied egwene tugging her ear suddenly her eyes went wide and she opened her mouth to speak at that moment doesine and yukiri arrived striding into the room saerin stood immediately slim doesine glanced at the women around her what motion are we standing for an important one saerin said well i suppose ill stand for it then as will i yukiri said the lesser consensus is given it seems saerin said the hall is given authority over the white towers army while the amyrlin is given authority and responsibility for dealing with the worlds monarchs no saroiya said climbing to her feet dont you see he is a king he holds the laurel crown youve just given the amyrlin sole responsibility for dealing with the dragon reborn there was silence in the hall well romanda said surely she she trailed off as she turned seeing egwenes serene face i suppose someone should ask for the greater consensus saerin said dryly but youve managed to hang yourselves quite efficiently with the lesser rope already egwene stood i meant what i said about the halls choices being wise and nobody has hanged herself it is wise of the hall to put me in charge of dealing with the dragon rebornhe will need a firm familiar hand you are also wise to see that the details of managing the army were demanding too much of my attention you will want to choose someone among you to go through and approve all of general brynes supply requests and recruitment schemes i assure you there are a multitude of them i am pleased that you have seen the need to aid the amyrlin though i am deeply displeased at the secretive nature of this meeting do not try to deny that it was done in secret romanda i see you preparing to object if you wish to speak know that i will pin you by the three oaths into answering directly the yellow bit off her comment how can you not have learned the foolishness of acts like this egwene said is your memory so short she looked at the women in turn and was satisfied by the number who winced it is time egwene said for a change to be made i propose that there be no further meetings of this nature i propose that it be written into tower law that if any sitter leaves the white tower her ajah must appoint a surrogate to vote for her while absent i propose that it be written into tower law that no meeting of the hall can be convened unless every sitter or her surrogate either is present or has sent word directly that she cannot attend i propose that the amyrlin must be informedand given a reasonable amount of time to attend if she wishesof every meeting of the hall save when she cannot be found or is indisposed in some way bold changes mother saerin said you propose altering traditions that have been established for centuries traditions that hitherto have been used only for treachery backbiting and division egwene said it is time for this hole to be closed saerin the last time it was used effectively the black ajah manipulated us into casting down an amyrlin raising a fool in her place and dividing the tower are you aware that kandor saldaea and arafel are swarming with shadowspawn several of the sisters gasped others nodded including lelaine so the blue network was still reliable good the last battle is here egwene said i will not withdraw my proposal either you will stand now or you will be knownthrough all timeas one of those who refused at the dusk of an age can you not stand for openness and light will you notfor all of our sakesmake it impossible for a meeting of the hall to be called without your presence to leave any out means the possibility that you will be left out the women were silent one by one those who were standing sat back down to prepare for the new vote who will stand for this motion egwene asked they stood blessedly they stoodone at a time slowly reluctantly but they did it every one of them egwene let out a deep breath they might squabble and scheme but they knew right when they saw it they shared the same goals if they disagreed it was because they had different views on how to reach those goals sometimes it was hard to remember that looking shaken by what theyd done the sitters allowed the meeting to break up outside sisters had begun to gather surprised to find the hall meeting egwene nodded to saerin and the others of her supporters and walked from the room silviana at her side that was a victory the keeper said once they were alone she sounded satisfied but you did still give up control of our armies i had to egwene said they could have pulled command away from me at any time this way i got something in return authority over the dragon reborn yes egwene said but i was referring more to closing that loophole in tower law so long as it was possible for the hall to meet in relative secret my authoritythe authority of any amyrlincould be circumvented now if they want to maneuver theyll have to do it in front of my silviana gave a rare smile i suspect that since something like today is the result of such maneuvering mother they will be more hesitant in the future thats the idea egwene said though i doubt aes sedai will ever stop trying to maneuver they simply cannot be allowed to dice with the last battle or the dragon reborn back at egwenes study nicola and nissa still waited you did well egwene told them very well in fact im of a mind to give you more responsibility go to the traveling ground and go to caemlynthe queen there will be expecting you return with the items she gives you yes mother nicola said grinning what will she give us terangreal egwene said used for visiting the world of dreams im going to begin training you and some others in their use do not use them without my express permission however i will send some soldiers with you that should be enough to keep the two in line the two accepted curtsied and trotted away excited silviana looked at egwene you didnt swear them to silence they are accepted and they will brag about being trained with the terangreal im depending on it egwene said walking to the study door silviana raised an eyebrow i dont intend to let the girls come to harm egwene said in fact theyll be doing a lot less in telaranrhiod than they probably suspect from what i just said rosil has been lenient with me so far but shell never let me put accepted in danger this is just to start the proper rumors what rumors gawyn scared off the assassin egwene said there hasnt been a murder in days and i suppose we should bless him for that but the killer is still hiding and ive glimpsed black sisters watching me in telaranrhiod if i cant catch them here then i will catch them there but first i need a way to trick them into thinking they know where to find us so long as you intend them to find you and not those girls silviana said voice calmbut iron she had been the mistress of novices egwene found herself grimacing thinking of the things that had been expected of her as an accepted yes silviana was right she would have to take care not to subject nicola and nissa to similar dangers she had survived and was stronger for it but accepted should not be put through such trials unless there was no other choice i will take care egwene said i simply need them to spread the rumor that i have a very important meeting coming up if i lay the groundwork properly our phantom wont be able to resist coming to listen in bold essential egwene said she hesitated hand on her door speaking of gawyn have you found out where in the city hes run off to actually mother i had a note on this earlier today it appears that well he isnt in the city one of the sisters delivering your messages to the queen of andor returned with news of seeing him there egwene groaned closing her eyes that man will be the death of me tell him to return infuriating though he is im going to need him in the coming days yes mother silviana said taking out a sheet of paper egwene entered her study to continue her letters time was short time was so very very short chapter oddities what are you planning husband faile asked they were back in their tent following the parley with the whitecloaks perrins actions had surprised herwhich was invigorating yet also disturbing he took off his coat i smell a strangeness on the wind faile something ive never smelled before he hesitated glancing at her there are no wolves no wolves i cant sense any nearby perrin said eyes distant there were some before now theyre gone you said that they dont like being close to people he pulled off his shirt exposing a muscled chest covered in curling brown hair there were too few birds today too few creatures in the underbrush light burn that sky is that causing this or is it something else he sighed sitting down on their sleeping pallet youre going to go there faile asked somethings wrong he repeated i need to learn what i can before the trial there might be answers in the wolf dream the trial perrin i dont like this idea youre angry about maighdin of course im angry about maighdin she said theyd been through malden together and she hadnt told faile that she was the queen of bloody andor it made faile look like a foollike a smalltown braggart extolling her skill with the sword in front of a passing blademaster she didnt know if she could trust us perrin said she was fleeing one of the forsaken it seems id have hidden myself too faile glared at him dont look at me like that he said she didnt do it to make you look bad faile she had her reasons let it go that made her feel a little better it was so nice that he would stand up for himself now well it makes me wonder who lini will turn out to be some seanchan queen master gill the king of arad doman in hiding perrin smiled i suspect theyre her attendants gill is who he says he is at least balwer is probably having a fit for not having figured this out i bet he did figure it out faile said kneeling beside him perrin i meant what i said about this trial im worried i wont let myself be taken he said i only said id sit through a trial and give them a chance to present evidence then whats the point faile said it gives me more time to think he said and it might stop me from having to kill them their captain damodredsomething about him smells better than many of the rest not rabid with anger or hate this will get our people back and let me plead my side it feels good for a man to be able to have his say maybe thats what ive needed all this time well all right faile said but in the future please consider warning me of your plans i will he said yawning and lying back in truth it didnt occur to me until the last moment faile kept her tongue with some difficulty at least something good had come from that parley shed watched berelain when shed met damodred and shed rarely seen a womans eyes light up so brightly faile might be able to make use of that she looked down perrin was already snoring softly perrin found himself sitting with his back against something hard and smooth the toodark almost evil sky of the wolf dream boiled above the forest which was a mixture of fir oak and leatherleaf he stood up then turned and looked at what he had been leaning against a massive steel tower stretched toward the turbulent sky too straight with walls that looked like a single piece of seamless metal the tower exuded a completely unnatural feel i told you this place was evil hopper sent suddenly sitting next to perrin foolish cub i didnt come here by choice perrin protested i woke here your mind is focused on it hopper said or the mind of one to whom you are connected mat perrin said without understanding how he knew the colors didnt appear they never did in the wolf dream as foolish a cub as yourself maybe more foolish hopper smelled incredulous as if unwilling to believe that was possible come the wolf sent it has returned what has hopper vanished perrin followed with a frown he now could easily catch the scent of where hopper had gone they appeared on the jehannah road and that strange violet glass wall was there again slicing the roadway in half extending high in the air and into the distance in either direction perrin walked up to a tree its bare branches seemed trapped in the glass immobile hopper paced nearby we have seen this thing before he sent long long ago so many lives ago what is it a thing of men hoppers sending included confused images flying glowing discs impossibly tall structures of steel things from the age of legends hopper didnt understand their use any more than he understood the use of a horse cart or a candle perrin looked down the roadway he didnt recognize this section of ghealdan it must be farther toward lugard the wall had appeared in a different place than it had last time a thought occurring to him perrin moved down the roadway in a few jumping bursts a hundred of paces away he looked back and confirmed his suspicions that glass didnt make a wall but an enormous dome translucent with a violet tint it seemed to extend for leagues hopper moved at a blur coming to stand beside him we must go hes in there isnt he perrin asked he reached out oak dancer sparks and boundless were near ahead inside the dome they responded with quick frantic sendings at hunt and being hunted why dont they flee perrin asked hopper sent confusion im going to them perrin said willing himself forward nothing happened perrin felt a stab of panic in his gut what was wrong he tried again this time trying to send himself to the base of the dome it worked he arrived in an eyeblink that glasslike surface rising in a cliff face before him its this dome he thought its blocking me suddenly he understood the trapped feeling the wolves had sent they couldnt get away was that the purpose of this dome then to trap wolves so that slayer could kill them perrin growled stepping up to the surface of the dome he couldnt pass in by imagining himself there but perhaps he could he get through by more mundane means he raised a hand then hesitated he didnt know what touching the surface would do the wolves sent images of a man in black and leather with a harsh lined face and a smile curling on his lips as he launched arrows he smelled wrong so wrong he also smelled of dead wolves perrin couldnt leave them in there no more than he could leave master gill and the others to the whitecloaks furious at slayer he touched the surface of the dome his muscles suddenly lost strength they felt like water his legs unable to hold him up he fell to the ground hard his foot was still touching the domepassing through it the dome appeared to have no substance his lungs no longer worked inflating his chest was too difficult panicked he imagined himself elsewhere but it didnt work he was trapped as surely as the wolves a graysilver blur appeared next to him jaws grabbed his shoulder as hopper pulled him free of the violet dome perrin immediately felt his strength return he gasped for breath foolish cub hopper sent youd leave them perrin said voice ragged not foolish to dig in the hole foolish for not waiting for me in case hornets came out hopper turned toward the dome help me if i fall he padded forward then touched his nose to the dome hopper stumbled but righted himself and continued on slowly on the other side he collapsed but his chest continued to move how did you do it perrin asked rising i am me hopper as he saw himselfwhich was identical to who he was also scents of strength and stability the trick it seemed was to be in complete control of who you were like many things in the wolf dream the strength of ones mental image was more powerful than the substance of the world itself come hopper sent be strong pass through i have a better idea perrin said standing up he charged forward at fuii speed he hit the violet dome and immediately went limp but his momentum carried him to the other side where he rolled to a stop he groaned shoulder hurt arm scraped foolish cub hopper sent you must learn now isnt the time perrin said climbing to his feet we have to help the others arrows in the wind thick black deadly the hunters laughter the scent of a man who was stale the killer was here hopper and perrin ran down the road and perrin found that he could increase his speed within the dome tentatively he tried jumping forward with a thought and it worked but when he tried to send himself outside nothing happened so the dome was a barrier within it he could move freely but he could not move to a place outside it by imagining himself elsewhere he had to pass the domes wall physically if he wanted out oak dancer boundless and sparks were ahead and slayer too perrin growledfrantic sendings flooded him dark woods slayer he seemed so tall to the wolves a dark monster with a face chiseled as if from rock blood on the grass pain anger terror confusion sparks was wounded the other two jumped back and forth taunting and distracting slayer while sparks crawled toward the border of the dome care young bull hopper sent this man hunts well he moves almost like a wolf though he is something wrong ill distract him you get sparks you have arms you carry there was more to the sending than that of course hoppers age and experience perrin still a pup perrin gritted his teeth but didnt argue hopper was more experienced than he was they parted perrin reaching out for sparks finding where he washidden within a patch of treesand taking himself directly there the dark brown wolf had an arrow in his thigh and he was whimpering softly trailing blood as he crawled perrin knelt quickly and pulled the arrow out the wolf continued to whimper smelling frightened perrin held the arrow up it smelled evil disgusted he tossed it aside and picked up the wolf something crackled nearby and perrin spun boundless leaped between two trees smelling anxious the other two wolves were leading slayer away perrin turned and ran toward the domes nearest edge carrying sparks he couldnt leap directly to the edge of the dome because he didnt know where it was he burst from the trees heart thumping the wolf in his arms seemed to grow stronger as they left the arrow behind perrin ran more quicly using a speed that felt reckless moving hundreds of paces with blurring speed the dome wall approached and he pulled to a stop slayer was suddenly there standing before him bow drawn he wore a black cloak that billowed around him he was no longer smiling and his eyes were thunderous he released perrin shifted and never saw where the arrow landed he appeared in the place where hed first entered the dome he should have gone there first he hurled himself through the violet dome collapsing on the other side sending sparks tumbling the wolf yelped perrin hit hard young bull sparks sent an image of slayer dark like a thunderhead standing right inside the barrier with bow drawn perrin didnt look he shifted sending himself to the slopes of dragonmount once there he leaped to his feet anxious hammer appearing in his hand groups of nearby wolves sent greeting perrin ignored them for the moment slayer did not follow after a few tense moments hopper appeared did the others get away perrin asked they are free he sent whisperer is dead the sending showed the wolf from the viewpoint of the others in the packbeing killed moments after the dome appeared sparks had taken an arrow as he nuzzled at her side in panic perrin growled he nearly jumped away to confront slayer again but a caution from hopper stopped him too soon you must learn its not only him perrin said i need to look at the area around my camp and that of the whitecloaks something smells wrong there in the waking world i need to see if something is odd there odd hopper sent the image of the dome it is probably related the two oddities seemed likely to be more than mere coincidence search another time slayer is too strong for you perrin took a deep breath i have to face him eventually hopper not now no perrin agreed not now now we practice he turned to the wolf as we will do every night until i am ready rodel ituralde rolled over in his cot neck slick with sweat had saldaea always been this hot and muggy he wished for home the cool ocean breezes of bandar eban things felt wrong why hadnt the shadowspawn attacked a hundred possibilities rattled in his mind were they waiting for new siege engines were they scouting out forests in order to build them or were their commanders content with a siege the entire city was surrounded but there had to be enough trollocs out there to overwhelm it now they had taken to beating drums all hours thump thump thump steady like the heartbeat of an enormous animal the great serpent itself coiling around the city dawn was beginning to shine outside he hadnt turned in until well after midnight durhemwho commanded the morning watchhad ordered that ituralde not be disturbed until noon his tent was in a shadowed alcove of the courtyard he had wanted to be close to the wall and had refused a bed that had been foolish though a cot had been fine for him in previous years he wasnt as young as hed once been tomorrow hed move now he told himself sleep it wasnt that easy the accusation that he was dragonsworn left him unsettled in arad doman hed been fighting for his king someone hed believed in now he was fighting in a foreign land for a man hed met only once all because of a gut feeling light but it was hot sweat ran down his cheeks making his neck itch it shouldnt be this hot so early in the morning it wasnt natural those burning drums still pounding he sighed climbing off his sweatdampened cot his leg ached it had for days now youre an old man rodel he thought stripping off his sweaty smallclothes and getting out some freshly washed ones he stuffed his trousers into kneehigh riding boots a simple white shirt with black buttons went on next and then his gray coat buttoning straight up to the collar he was strapping on his sword when he heard hurried footsteps outside followed by whispers that conversation grew heated and he stepped outside just as someone said lord ituralde will wish to know know what ituralde asked a messenger boy was arguing with his guards all three turned toward him sheepishly im sorry my lord connel said we were instructed to let you sleep a man who can sleep in this heat must be halflizard connel ituralde said lad whats the word captain yoeli is on the wall sir the youth said ituralde recognized the young manhed been with him from near the beginning of this campaign he said you should come ituralde nodded he laid a hand on connels arm thank you for watching me old friend but these bones arent so frail as you think connel nodded blushing the guard fell into place behind as ituralde crossed the courtyard the sun had risen many of his troops were up too many he wasnt the only one having difficulty sleeping atop the wall he was greeted by a disheartening sight on the dying land thousand upon thousands of trollocs camped burning fires ituralde didnt like to think about where the wood for those fires came from hopefully all of the nearby homesteaders and villagers had heeded the call to evacuate yoeli stood gripping the crenelated stone of the wall next to a man in a black coat deepe bhadar was senior among the ashaman whom althor had given him one of only three who wore both the dragon and the sword pins on his collar the andoran man had a flat face and black hair that he wore long ituralde had sometimes heard some of the blackcoated men mumbling to themselves but not deepe he seemed fully in control yoeli kept glancing at the ashaman ituralde didnt feel comfortable with men who could channel either but they were an excellent tool and they hadnt failed him he preferred to let experience instead of rumor rule him lord ituralde deepe said the ashaman never saluted ituralde just althor what is it ituralde asked scanning the hordes of trollocs they didnt seem to have changed since hed bedded down your man claims to be able toyw something yoeli said out there they have channelers lord ituralde deepe said i suspect at least six perhaps more men since i can feel the power theyre wielding doing something powerful if i squint at the far camps i think i can sometimes see weaves but it may be my imagination ituralde cursed thats what theyve been waiting for what yoeli asked with ashaman of their own they are not ashaman deepe said fervently all right then with channelers of their own they can tear this wall down easily as knocking over a pile of blocks yoeli that sea of trollocs will surge in and fill your streets not so long as i stand deepe said i like determination in a soldier deepe ituralde said but you look as exhausted as i feel deepe shot him a glare his eyes were red from lack of sleep and he clenched his teeth the muscles in his neck and face tense he met ituraldes eyes then took a long forced breath you are correct deepe said but neither of us can do anything about that he raised his hand doing something that ituralde couldnt see a flash of red light appeared over his handthe signal he used to draw the others to him prepare your men general captain it will not be long they cannot continue to hold that kind of power without consequences yoeli nodded then hurried away ituralde took deepes arm drawing his attention you ashaman are too important a resource to lose ituralde said the dragon sent us here to help not to die if this city falls i want you to take the others and whatever wounded you can and get out do you understand soldier many of my men will not like this but you know it is for the best ituralde said dont you deepe hesitated yes you are correct as you so often are i will get them out he spoke in a lower voice this is a hopeless resistance my lord whatever is happening out there it will be deadly it galls me to suggest it but what you have said about my ashaman applies to your soldiers as well let us flee he said the word flee with bitterness the saldaeans wouldnt leave with us i know ituralde considered it finally he shook his head every day we delay up here keeps these monsters away from my homeland a day longer no i cannot go deepe this is still the best place to fight youve seen how fortified those buildings are we can hold inside for a few days split apart keep the army busy then my ashaman could stay and help you have your orders son you follow them understand deep snapped his jaw shut then nodded curtly i will take ituralde didnt hear the rest an explosion hit he didnt feel it arrive he was standing with deepe one moment then round himself on the floor of the wall walk the world strangely silent around him his head screamed with pain and he coughed raising a trembling hand to find his face bleeding there was something in his right eye it seared with pain when he blinked why was everything so quiet he rolled over coughing again right eye squeezed shut the other watering the wall ended a few inches away from him he gasped an enormous chunk of the northern wall was simply gone he groaned looking back in the other direction deepe had been standing beside him he found the ashaman lying on the wall walk nearby head bleeding his right leg ended in a ragged rip of flesh and broken bone above where the knee should have been ituralde cursed and stumbled forward drorpping to his knees beside the man blood was pooling beneath deepe but he was still twitching alive i need to sound the alarm alarm that explosion would have been alarm enough inside the wall buildings were demolished crushed by stones flying in a spray away from the hole outside trollocs were loping forward carrying rafts to cross the moat ituralde pulled the ashamans belt off and used it to bind his thigh it was all he could think to do his head was still throbbing from the explosion the city is lost light its lost just like that hands were helping him up dazedly he glanced about connel hed survived the blast though his coat was torn to shreds he pulled ituralde away while a pair of soldiers took deepe the next minutes were a blur ituralde stumbled down the stairs from the wall nearly pitching headfirst fifteen feet onto the cobbles only connels hands kept him from falling and then a tent a large opensided tent ituralde blinked a battlefield should not be so quiet icy coldness washed over him he screamed sounds assaulted his ears and mind screams rock breaking trumpets sounding drums throbbing men dying it all hit him at once as if plugs had been yanked from his ears he shook himself gasping he was in the sick tent antailthe quiet thinhaired ashamanstood above him light but ituralde felt exhausted too little sleep mixed with the strain of being healed as the sounds of battle consumed him he found his eyelids treacherously heavy lord ituralde antail said i have a weave that will not make you well but it will make you think you are well it could be harmful to you do you want me to proceed i ituralde said the word came out as a mumble it blood and bloody ashes antail muttered he reached forward another wave of power washed through ituralde it was like a broom sweeping through him pushing away all of the fatigue and confusion restoring his senses and making him feel as if hed had a perfect nights rest his right eye didnt hurt anymore there was something lingering deep down an exhaustion in his bones he could ignore that he sat up breathed in and out then looked to antail nowthat is a useful weave son you should have told me you could do this its dangerous antail repeated more dangerous than the women s version im told in some ways more effective youre trading alertness now for more profound exhaustion later on later on we wont be in the middle of a city that is falling to the trollocs light willing at least deepe i saw to him first antail said gesturing to the ashaman lying on a nearby cot his clothing singed and his face bloodied his right leg ended in a healed stump and he appeared to be breathing though unconscious connel ituralde said my lord the soldier said stepping up hed found a squad of soldiers to act as a personal guard lets investigate this mess ituralde said he ran out of the sick tent toward cordamora palace the city was in chaos groups of saldaeans and domani rushing this way and that connel showing foresight sent a messenger to find yoeli the palace stood nearby just before the front gate its wall had been damaged in the blast but the building still looked hale ituralde had been using it as a command post men would expect to find him here they ran inside connel carrying ituraldes swordthe belt had been cut free at some point they climbed to the third floor then ran out onto a balcony that surveyed the area broken by the blast as hed originally feared the city was lost the swath of broken wall was being defended by a hastily assembled jumble of defenders a mounting tide of trollocs were throwing down rafts on the moat some beginning to surge forward followed by fades men ran through the streets disoriented if hed had more time to prepare he could have held as hed told deepe not now light but this defense has been one disaster after another gather the ashaman ituralde ordered and any of my officers you can find we will organize the men into a retreat through gateways yes my lord connel said ituralde no yoeli burst out onto the balcony uniform dirtied and ripped you survived ituralde said relieved excellent man your city is lost im sorry bring your men with us and we can look yoeli said pulling ituralde to the side of the balcony pointing to the east a thick column of smoke rose in the distance a village the trollocs had burned the watchfire yoeli continued my sister has seen aid coming we must stand until they arrive ituralde hesitated yoeli he said softly if a force has come it cant be large enough to stop this horde of trollocs and thats assuming its not a ruse the shadowspawn have proven clever in the past give us a few hours yoeli said hold the city with me and send scouts through those gateways of yours to see if a force really is coming a few hours ituralde said with a hole in your wall were overwhelmed yoeli please yoeli pled are you not one of those they name great captain show me what that title means lord rodel ituralde ituralde turned back at the broken wall behind him in the palaces top room he could hear his officers gathering the line at the wall was fragmenting it wouldnt be long now show me what that means perhaps tymoth are you here ituralde bellowed a redhaired man in a black coat stepped onto the balcony hed be in command of the ashaman now that deepe had fallen here lord ituralde gather your men ituralde said urgently take command of that gap and have the soldiers there retreat i want the ashaman to hold the breach i need a halfhour i want all of your energyeverything youve gotto hit those trollocs you hear me everything youve got if you can channel enough to light a candle when this is done ill have your hides sir the ashaman said our retreat leave antail in the healing tent ituralde said he can make a large enough gateway for the ashaman to run but everyone else hold that breach tymoth dashed away yoeli ituralde said your job is to gather your forces and stop them from running through the city like he paused hed been about to say like its tarmon bloody gaidon burn me like there is nobody in command if we are going to hold we will need to be organized and disciplined i need four cavalry companies formed up in the courtyard in ten minutes give the orders yes my lord yoeli said snapping to it oh ituralde said turning im going to need a couple of cartloads or firewood as many barrels of oil as you can come up with and all of the wounded in either army who can still run but who have face or arm wounds also get me anyone in the city whos ever held a bow go nearly an hour later ituralde stood hands clasped behind his back waiting hed moved in from the balcony to look out a window as to not expose himself but he still had a good view of the fighting outside the palace the ashaman line was finally weakening theyd given him the better part of an hour blasting back wave after wave of trollocs in an awesome display of power blessedly the enemy channelers had not appeared after that show of power hopefully they were drained and exhausted it felt like dusk with those oppressive clouds overhead and the masses of figures darkening the hillsides beyond the city the trollocs fortunately didnt bring ladders or siege towers only wave after wave at that breach whipped into attack by the myrddraal already some of the blackcoated men were limping away from the breach looking exhausted the last few threw a final blast of fire and erupting earth then followed their companions they left the gap completely open and undefended as ordered come on ituralde thought as the smoke cleared the trollocs peered through the smoke climbing over the carcasses of those the ashaman had killed the shadowspawn loped on hooves or thick paws some sniffed the air the streets inside the gap were filled with carefully placed men who were bloodied and wounded they began to scream as the trollocs entered running as commanded likely none of their fear was feigned the scene looked more terrible now that many of the nearby buildings were smoldering as if from the blast roofs on fire smoke pouring from windows the trollocs wouldnt know that the slate roofs had been designed not to burn and laws kept buildings from containing too much wood ituralde held his breath the trollocs broke running into the city howling and roaring groups breaking apart as they saw the opportunity to pillage and slaughter the door behind ituralde slammed open and yoeli hastened in the last ranks are placed is it working ituralde didnt answer the proof was below the trollocs assumed their battle wonthe blasting power of the ashaman had the air of one final stand and the city appeared to be in chaos the trollocs all ran down the streets with obvious glee even the myrddraal who entered appeared at ease the trollocs avoided the burning buildings and the palace which was walled they moved deeper into the city pursuing the fleeing soldiers down a wide avenue on the eastern side of the city carefully piled rubble encouraged the bulk of them down this avenue do you have aspirations of being a general captain yoeli ituralde asked softly my aspirations are not important yoeli said but a man would be a fool not to hope to learn then pay attention to this lesson son below shutters on windows were flung open on buildings along the avenue the trollocs had taken bowmen surged out onto balconies if you ever have so much as an impression that youre doing what your enemy expects you to do then do something else the arrows fell and trollocs died large crossbows that shot quarrels almost the size of spears targeted the fades and many could be seen lurching across the pavement not knowing that they were already dead as scores of trollocs linked to them fell confused enraged the stillliving creatures began to bellow and pound in the doors of the buildings filled with archers but as they did so the thunder began hoofbeats yoeli s best cavalry charged down the streets lances forward they trampled the trollocs slaughtering them the city became an enormous ambush a man couldnt ask for better vantages than those buildings and the streets were wide enough to allow a charge by those who knew the layout the trollocs went from bellowing in joy to screaming in pain and scrambled over one another in their haste to get away they entered the courtyard by the broken wall the saldaean horsemen followed their hooves and flanks wet with the noxious blood of the fallen men appeared at windows of burning buildingsthe fires carefully created in sectionedoff roomsand began loosing arrows down into the large courtyard others tossed new lances to the horsemen who reequipped lined up and rode into the trollocs the arrows stopped falling and the cavalry made a sweeping charge crossed the courtyard hundreds of trollocs died perhaps thousands those that didnt die scrambled out of the gap most of the myrddraal fled those that did not were targets for the archers killing one of them could kill dozens of trollocs linked to them the fades went downmany sprouting dozens of arrows ill give the order to unite and hold the breach again yoeli said eagerly no ituralde said but fighting at the breach will gain us nothing ituralde said give the orders for the men to move to different buildings and have the archers take different positions are there warehouses or other large buildings that can hide the horsemen move them there quickly and then we wait they wont be caught again no ituralde said but theyll be slow and cautious if we fight them head on we lose if we hold buy time we win thats the only way out of this yoeli to survive until help comes if its coming yoeli nodded our next trap wont kill as many ituralde said but trollocs are cowards at heart the knowledge that any roadway could suddenly turn into a death trap will make them hesitate and will earn us more time than would losing half of our men holding that wall all right yoeli said he hesitated but doesnt this mean that theyre anticipating us this phase of the plan will work only because they expect our ambushes i suppose thats true so shouldnt we do something different you said that if weve got a hint that the enemy knows what were going to do we should change plans youre thinking about it too much son go do as i commanded er yes my lord he hurried away this ituralde thought is why i should never teach tactics it was hard to explain to students that there was a rule that trumped all of the others always trust your instincts the trollocs would be afraid he could use that hed use anything they gave him he didnt like to think too long about that rule lest he dwell on the fact that hed violated it already because his every instinct screamed that he should have abandoned this city hours ago chapter a terrible feeling what is perrin plotting do you think berelain asked as she strolled beside faile and alliandre faile didnt answer the late afternoon was softly lit by a distant sun shrouded in clouds soon it would make the horizon burn as it sank down for the night in two days perrin would go on trial hed delayed specifically she knew to gain more time for the ashaman to work out the strange problem with gateways their army was growing still more people flooding to them scout reports indicated that the whitecloak force was growing as well more slowly but still growing in days like these an army was a symbol of strength andat the very leastfood a stand of fingeroot trees glutted themselves on the water of the stream near perrins war camp such strange plants they were with those roots that dipped into the water trunks like flowing glass that had pooled while hardening there was nothing like them up in saldaea it seemed that two wrong steps here could lead you into a swamp no answer for me berelain asked she seemed distracted these days ive been thinking perhaps it would be good to send an envoy to the whitecloak army do you think perrin would allow me to go and speak with them perhaps i could make a personal appeal on his behalf she kept bringing up that topic no faile said you know his mind is made up on this trial berelain the first pursed her lips but did not press further the three continued heir walk accompanied by ten maidens once faile might have combined about the attention that was before shed been taken so unexpectedly and so easily in the distance she saw a small group of refugees leaving the camp walking away to the southeast crosscountry before things had gone wrong with the gateways about ten thousand had been sent to rural areas in cairhien all had instructions to remain quiet perrin didnt want his location known yet women would be still but of course the men would gossip they always did few knew that gateways failed perrin had told the people that he needed the ashaman strong in case there was righting with the whitecloaks it was true enough still some refugees had asked to leave going on foot to these faile gave bits of gold or a jewel from sevannas store and wished them the best she was surprised at how many wanted to return to homes that were in seanchancontrolled lands despite the departures the size of perrins force was swelling day by day faile and the others passed a large group practicing with swords the refugees who had decided to train were now some twentyfive thousand strong they practiced late into the day and faile could still hear barked orders from tarn well berelain continued her musings what will perrin do why set up this trial he wants something from those whitecloaks she stepped around a gnarled fingeroot the first like so many others read much more into perrins actions than there was to find hed be amused if he knew the plots they ascribed to him and she claims to understand men faile thought perrin was by no means stupid nor was he the simple man he sometimes claimed to be he planned he thought and he was careful but he was also direct deliberate when he said something he meant it i agree with berelain alliandre said we should just leave march away or attack those whitecloaks faile shook her head it bothers perrin when people think he did something wrong as long as the whitecloaks continue to insist he is a murderer his name will not be clear he was being bullheaded and foolish but there was a nobility about it so long as it didnt get him killed however she loved him for that very sense of honor changing him would be ill advised so she had to make certain others didnt take advantage of him as she always did when they discussed the whitecloaks berelain got a strange look in her eyes and she glancedperhaps unconsciously in the direction their army camped light she wasnt going to ask again if she could go speak to them she had come up with a dozen different reasons why she wanted to faile noticed a large group of soldiers trying to look inconspicuous as they rounded the inside of the camp keeping pace with faile and their guards on their promenade perrin wanted her well protected this young lord captain commander alliandre said idly he looks quite striking in that white uniform wouldnt you say if you can get past that sunburst on his cloak such a beautiful man oh bereiain said surprisingly warm color rose in her cheeks id always heard that morgases stepson was a handsome man alliandre continued but i hadnt anticipated him being so pristine like a statue carved from marble bereiain whispered a relic from the age of legends a perfect thing left behind for us to worship hes passable faile said with a sniff i prefer a bearded face myself it wasnt a lieshe loved a bearded face and perrin was handsome he had a burly power to him that was quite appealing but this galad damodred was well it wasnt fair to compare him to perrin that would be like comparing a stained glass window to a cabinet made by a master carpenter both were excellent examples of their craft and it was hard to weigh them against one another but the window certainly did shine berelains expression seemed distant she was definitely taken with damodred such a short time for it to have happened faile told bereiain that finding another man for her attentions would help with the rumors but the whitecloak commander had the woman lost all sense so what do we do alliandre asked as they rounded the south side of the camp halfway to the point from which theyd started about the whitecloaks faile asked about maighdin alliandre said morgase i cant help feeling that she took advantage of my kindness faile said after all we went through together she didnt tell me who she was you seem to be determined to give her very little credit bereiain said faile didnt reply shed been thinking about what perrin said and he was probably right faile should not be so angry with her if morgase really had been fleeing one of the forsaken it was a miracle that she was still alive besides she herself had lied about who she was when first meeting perrin in truth her anger was because morgase was going to judge perrin she presumed to judge perrin maighdin the ladys maid might be grateful but morgase the queen would see perrin as a rival would morgase really treat this judgment fairly or would she take the chance to discredit a man who had raised himself up as a lord i feel as you do my lady alliandre said softly and how is that deceived alliandre said maighdin was our friend i thought i knew her you would have acted exactly as she did in that situation berelain said why give away information if you dont have to because we were friends alliandre said after what we went through together it turns out that shes morgase trakand not just a queenthe queen the womans a legend and she was here with us serving us tea poorly you have to admit faile said thoughtfully she did get better with the tea faile reached to her throat touching the cord that bore rolans stone she didnt wear it every day but she did so often enough had morgase been false that entire time theyd been with the shaido or had she in a way been more true with no titles to live up to she hadnt been forced to be the legendary morgase trakand under circumstances like that wouldnt a persons true nature be more likely to show through faile gripped the cord morgase would not turn this trial against perrin out of spite but she would offer judgment in honesty which meant faile needed to be prepared and have readyscreams sounded nearby faile reacted immediately spinning toward the woods she instinctively anticipated aiel leaping from the bushes to kill and capture and she felt a moment of sheer panic but the screams were coming from inside camp she cursed turning about but felt something tug at her belt she looked down with a start to see her belt knife pull itself from its sheath and flip into the air a bubble of evil berelain said stumbling to the side faile ducked throwing herself to the ground as her knife nipped through the air toward her head it narrowly missed as faile came up in a crouch she saw with a start that berelain was facing down a dagger one that lookedfrom the damage to berelains shirtto have ripped its way free of a hidden sheath inside her sleeve beyond berelain the camp was in a tumult the nearby practicing refugeess were scattering swords and spears nipping through the air of their own volition it looked as if every weapon in the camp had suddenly sprung to life rising up to attack its master motion faile dodged to the side as her knife came back for her but a whitehaired figure in brown snatched the weapon from the air holding it in a tight grip sulin rolled clinging to it her teeth gritted as she wrenched it from the air and slammed it down onto a stone breaking the blade from the hilt it stopped moving sulins spears however pulled from their place on her back and spun in the sky tips pointing toward her run the maiden said turning and trying to face all three spears at once where faile demanded picking up a stone from the ground the weapons are everywhere berelain was struggling with her dagger shed grabbed it but it was fighting her wrenching her arms from side to side alliandre was surrounded by three knives light faile suddenly felt lucky for having worn only one today several of the maidens charged in to help alliandre throwing stones at the knives dodging spears that lunged for them berelain was alone gritting her teethfeeling half a fool for helping the woman she hatedfaile jumped in and placed her hands over berelains lending her strength to that of the first together they wrenched the dagger to the side toward the ground where they could drive its point into the earth when they did remarkably it stopped moving faile released it hesitantly then looked up at the disheveled berelain the woman pressed her right hand to her other palm stanching the blood from a cut shed taken she nodded at faile thank you what stopped it faile asked heart thumping shouts sounded from around the camp cursing clangs from weapons the dirt berelain asked kneeling faile dug her fingers into the loam she turned noticing with alarm that one of the maidens was down though others had felled several of the flying spears faile tossed her handful of soil at one that was still whipping about when the dirt touched the spear the weapon dropped sulin saw it eyes widening behind her veiled face she dropped the stones shed been wielding and took up a handful of soil spraying it over her head as a spear drove for her heart the dirt stopped it and it fell to the ground nearby the soldiers who had been following along to guard faile and the others were having a worse time of things they had backed into a circle using their shields to block incoming weapons hunkered down with worried expressions quickly faile said to the maidens digging both hands into the soil spread the word let the others know how to stop the weapons she threw soil at the daggers beside alliandre dropping two with one throw then began running for the nearby soldiers there is no need for you to apologize galad morgase said softly you couldnt have known what was happening in the fortress of the light you were leagues and leagues away they sat in his tent chairs facing each other lateafternoon light shining on the walls galad sat with hands clasped before him as he leaned forward so thoughtful she remembered her first impressions of him long ago when shed married his father the young child had simply been part of the deal and while morgase had adopted him she had always worried that he felt less loved than his siblings galad had always been so solemn quick to point out when someone did something wrong but unlike other childrenelayne especiallyhe had not used his knowledge as a weapon she should have seen she should have realized hed be attracted to the whitecloaks for their vision of a world that was black and white could she have prepared him better shown him that the world was not black and whiteit wasnt even gray it was full of colors that sometimes didnt fit into any spectrum of morality he looked up hands still clasped eyes troubled i accused valda wrongly when i went to him i said i was demanding trial beneath the light because he had abused you and killed you half was wrong i have done something where i was in error at least in part regardless of that fact im pleased that i killed him her breath caught in her throat valda had reputedly been one of the greatest swordsmen alive and galad had bested him in a duel this youth but he was a youth no longer galad had made his choices and she had a difficult time judging him for them in some ways they seemed more admirable than her own choices you did well she said valda was a snake i am certain he was behind nialls death galad you did the world a service he nodded for what he did to you he deserved death but i shall need to release a statement anyway he rose clasping his hands behind his back as he walked his white clothing seeming to glow in the light i will explain that my accusation of murder was false but that valda still deserved death for his other offenses dire offenses he stopped for a moment i wish i had known there was nothing you could have done son she said my captivity was my own fault for trusting my enemies galad waved a hand there was no resisting gaebril if what you have heard is true as for your captivity you did not trust your enemies you were betrayed like all of us by valda the children are never the enemies of a person who walks in the light and perrin aybara she asked shadowspawn no son i dont like some of the things he is doing but i promise you he is a good man then the trial will prove that galad said good men can make mistakes if you proceed with this it could end in a way that none of us wish galad froze frowning mother are you implying that he should be allowed to escape his crime come she said gesturing sit back down youre dizzying me with that pacing about perhaps hed risen to the position of lord captain commander only recently but he already seemed to bristle at taking an order he did sit however oddly she felt like a queen again galad hadnt seen her during the hard months he thought of her as the old morgase so around him she actually felt like the old morgase almost niall had held her as a prisoner but had respected her and she had begun to think that she might be able to respect him as well what had happened to the board where she and niall had played stones so often she hated to think of it broken in the seanchan assault would galad become a lord captain commander like niall or perhaps someone better the queen in her the queen reawakened wanted to find a way to bring his light out and stifle the shadow galad she said what are you going to do about the trial no with this army of yours we will fight at the last battle admirable she said but do you know what that means it means fighting alongside the dragon reborn and the aes sedai we can serve alongside the witches for a time if it is in the name of the greater good she closed her eyes breathing out galad listen to yourself you name them witches you went to train with them perhaps to become a warder yes she opened her eyes he seemed so earnest but even the most deadly and violent of hounds could be earnest do you know what they did to elayne mother he asked you mean losing her morgase still harbored anger over that they sent her out on missions he said voice laced with disgust they refused to let me see her probably because she was out being put into danger i met her later outside the tower where was she morgase asked eager here in the south my men name the aes sedai witches sometimes i wonder how far off from the truth that is galad not all women who wield the one power are evil inherently he said that is a mistaken tradition of the children the way of the light doesnt make that claim it just says that the temptation to use the one power can corrupt i believe that the women who now run the white tower have let their schemes and selfish plots blind them she nodded not wishing to argue the point thank the light elaida wasnt here to hear that logic either way he said we will fight alongside them and the dragon reborn and this perrin aybara if need be the struggle against the shadow outweighs all other concerns then let us join that struggle she said galad forget this trial aybara intends to disband some of his army and give the rest to althor he met her eyes then nodded yes i can see now that the pattern has led you to me we will travel with you after the trial has finished she sighed i dont do this by choice galad said rising again aybara himself suggested that he be tried the mans conscience weighs against him and to deny him this opportunity would be wrong let him prove his innocence to us and to himself then we can continue he hesitated reaching out and touching the whitescabbarded sword on his dressing table and if we continue without him then he will rest in the light having paid for his crimes galad she said you know lini was among the people you took from perrins camp she should have spoken up revealed herself to me i would have set her free and yet she did not i have heard you all but threatened to execute the prisoners if perrin didnt come to battle would you have actually done this their blood would have been on his head linis blood galad i i would have seen her among them and removed her from danger so you would have killed the others morgase said people who did no wrong who were innocent of nothing more than being beguiled by aybara the executions would never have occurred it was merely a threat a lie bah what is the point of this mother to make you think son morgase said in ways that i should have encouraged before rather than leaving you to your simple illusions life is not so easy as the toss of a coin one side or the other have i ever told you of the trial of tham felmley galad shook his head looking irritated listen to me he was a brickmason in caemlyn a reputable one he was accused of murdering his brother in the early days of my reign he had enough repute and the case was important enough that i judged it myself he hanged at the end of it a fitting end for a murderer yes morgase said unfortunately the murderer went free one of his workers had actually done the deed it didnt come out until two years later when the man was taken for another murder he laughed at us then as we hanged him felmley had been innocent all along the real man the murderer was one of those to condemn him during the original trial galad fell silent its the only time morgase said where i know for certain that i hanged someone by mistake so you tell me galad should i hang for my mistake in condemning an innocent man you did your best mother and a man is still dead who did not deserve it galad looked troubled the children like to speak of the light protecting them morgase said of guiding their judgment and leading people to justice that isnt how it works galad valda claiming the blessing of the light could do terrible things and i hoping for the lights aid have killed unjustly im not saying that aybara is innocent i havent heard enough either way but i want you to understand sometimes a good man can do wrong at times it is appropriate to punish him at other times punishment serves nobody and the best thing to do is to let him continue and learn as i continued and learned after making such a poor judgment galad frowned that was good finally he shook his head his face clearing we shall see what the trial brings it there was a knock on the post outside galad turned his frown deepening yes my lord captain commander a whitecloak said lifting the nap andstepping into the tent he was a lean man with sunken eyes that had dark patches beneath them weve just had word from the creature aybaras camp theyre asking to push back the day of the trial galad stood for what purpose he demanded a disturbance in their camp they claim the whitecloak said something about wounded needing tending my lord captain commander it is obviously a ploy a trick of some sort we should attack them or at the very least deny this pointless extension galad hesitated he looked at morgase it is no ploy son she said i can promise you that if aybara says he needs more time hes being honest with you bah galad said waving the messenger away i shall consider it alongside the things you have said mother perhaps some extra time to consider would be welcomed the channelers say they are working as hard as they can gaul explained walking beside perrin though camp as they checked the various sections but they say it could take days to see to everyone the sun was sinking toward the horizon but it would probably be a long night for many of them tending the wounded thousands had been wounded though most woundsfortunatelywere not bad theyd lost some people too many maybe as many as had fallen to the snake bites perrin grunted gaul himself had his arm in a sling hed fended off his spears only to have one of his arrows nearly kill him hed blocked it with his forearm when perrin had asked hed laughed and said that it had been years since hed shot himself with his own arrow aiel humor have we heard back from the whitecloaks perrin asked turning to aravine who walked on his other side yes she said but nothing specific their commander said hed think about giving us more time well hes not the one who will decide perrin said going into the mayener section of camp to check on berelains people im not going to risk a battle with a quarter of my men wounded and my ashaman dead tired from healing we go to this trial when i say so and if damodred disagrees he can just go ahead and attack us gaul grunted his agreement he wore his spears but perrin noticed they were strapped more tightly in place than usual aravine carried a lantern though they hadnt needed to light it yet she was anticipating a late night as well let me know when tarn and elyas get back perrin said to gaul perrin had sent each one separately to visit nearby villages and make certain the people therethe ones who hadnt joined a passing armyhadnt suffered from the bubble of evil berelain had composed herself her hand bandaged she gave the report to him herself from her tent saying how many of her soldiers had been wounded giving the names of the men theyd lost only six from her camp perrin yawned as he left the tent sending aravine to check on the aes sedai gaul had run off to help with carrying some of the wounded and perrin found himself alone as he walked down the path toward alliandres section of camp his hammer hadnt tried to kill him so far as he knew it was the only weapon on anyones person that hadnt responded to the bubble of evil what did it mean he shook his head then hesitated pausing in thought as he heard someone jogging along the path toward him he caught tarns scent and turned to meet the sturdy man as he arrived perrin son tam said out of breath from running something unusual just happened the bubble of evil hit the village perrin asked alarmed were people hurt oh no tam said not that the village was fine they didnt even notice anything was wrong this is something else tam smelled odd thoughtful worried perrin frowned what whats happening i well i have to go son tam said leave the camp i dont know when ill be back is this it has nothing to do with the whitecloaks tam said ive been told i cant say much but its about rand the colors swirled rand walked the hallways of the stone of tear his expression was dark dangerous perrin tam said i think this is something i need to do it involves aes sedai and i have to leave you now i cant say anything else they made me swear it perrin looked into tarns eyes and saw the sincerity there he nodded all right then you need any help someone to go with you wherever youre going ill be all right tarn said he smelled embarrassed what was going on ill try to get you some help son he laid a hand on perrins shoulder youve done well here im proud of you and your father would be too keep it up ill see you at the last battle if not before perrin nodded tarn hurried off toward his tent perhaps to pack it was hard to look regal while being carried atop the caemlyn city wall on a litter but elayne did her best sometimes getting what you wanted was more important than looking regal bed rest for a queen well in order to keep melfane from hovering over her shed given an oath that she would stay off her feet but shed said nothing about staying in her bedroom four guardsmen carried the litter high on their shoulders elayne sat safely between armrests wearing a crimson gown hair carefully brushed the rose crown of andor atop her head the day was muggy the weather turning warm the sky still dark with clouds she spared a moment to feel guilty for making the poor men in dress uniform carry her through this earlysummer heat but these men would ride to battle in her name they could stand a little warm weather how often did guardsmen get the honor of carrying their queen anyway birgitte strode alongside the bed and the bond indicated that she was amused elayne had feared shed try to stop this excursion but instead she had laughed birgitte must have determined that this days activitiesthough bound to upset melfanewere no real risk to elayne or her babes to the warder that meant this was an opportunity to see elayne get paraded through town looking foolish elayne winced what would the people say the queen riding a litter being marched to the outer wall well elayne wasnt about to let rumors keep her from seeing the test firsthand and she wasnt about to be bullied by a tyrannical midwife she had quite a view from the wall the fields leading to aringill lay open to her left the city bustled to her right those fields were too brown reports from around the realm were dire nine fields in ten had failed elaynes porters carried her up to one of the walls tower turrets then hit a snag as they realized the poles on the litter were too long to make the turns on the stairs inside the tower the demonstration was supposed to happen atop it luckily there were alternative short handholds for just such situations they removed the poles switched to the handholds and proceeded while they carried her up she distracted herself by thinking about cairhien the noble houses there all claimed to be eagerly awaiting her arrival to take the throne and yet none offered more than the most flaccid support daes daemar was fully in effect and the posturing for elaynes ascentor her failure to ascendhad begun the moment rand had mentioned that he intended the nation to be hers in cairhien a hundred different political winds always blew in a hundred different directions she didnt have time to learn all of the different factions before she took the throne besides if she was seen as playing the game she could be seen as someone to defeat she had to find a way to seize the sun throne without mixing too much in the local house politics elaynes litter creaked up and crested the lip of the towers turret atop the tower aludra stood with one of her prototype dragons the bronze tube was quite long and set in a framework of wood it was just a dummy for display a second working dragon had been set up atop the next tower down the wall it was far enough away that elayne wouldnt be in danger if something went wrong the slender taraboner woman seemed to take no thought for the fact that she was delivering a potentially worldchanging weapon to the queen of a foreign country all aludra seemed to want was a way to get back at the seanchan or so mat had explained elayne had spent some time with the woman while traveling with lucas menagerie but still wasnt certain how trustworthy she was shed have master norry keep an eye on her assuming of course the dragons worked elayne spared another glance for the people down below only then did she realize how high up she really was light im safe she reminded herself mins viewing not that she said anything like that to birgitte not any longer and she did intend to stop taking so many risks this wasnt a risk not really she turned away before she grew dizzy and inspected the dragon more closely it was shaped like a large bronze bell though longer and narrower like an enormous vase turned on its side elayne had received more than one missive from the citys irate bellfounders aludra insisted that her orders be carried out exactly and had forced the men to recast the tube three times late the previous night a loud crack had sounded across the city as n stone wall had fallen somewhere or a bolt of lightning had struck this morning elayne had received a note from aludra first test a success it had read meet me today on city wall for demonstration your majesty aludra said you are well yes i will be fine aludra elayne said trying to maintain her dignity the dragon is ready it is aludra said she wore a long brown dress her black wavy hair loose coming down to her waist why no braids today aludra didnt seem to care for jewelry and elayne had never seen her wear any a group of five men from mats band of the red hand stood with her one carrying what appeared to be a chimney brush of some sort another had a metal sphere in his hands and another carried a small wooden cask elayne could see a similar group on the next tower over someone there raised a hat into the air and waved at her mat wanted to watch from the tower with the working dragon it seemed foolhardy man what if the thing exploded like a nightflower the demonstration then aludra said we shall begin these men here will show you what is being done on the other tower she hesitated as she regarded elayne her majesty i think we should prop her up so that she can see the display a few minutes later theyd located some small boxes to place beneath the litter and elevate elayne so that she could see over the towers crenelations it appeared that something had been constructed on a distant hillside though it was too far for elayne to make out aludra pulled out several looking glasses and handed one each to elayne and birgitte elayne raised her glass to her eye dressing dummies aludra had set up some fifty of them in ranks on the far hill light where had she gotten so many likely elayne would be getting some wordy missives from gownmakers across the city mat had promised this would be worth practically any cost of course that was mat he wasnt exactly the most reliable person around he s not the one who lost an invaluable terangreal to the shadow she reminded herself she grimaced in her pouch she carried another replica of the foxhead it was one of three shed created so far if she was going to be confined to her bed then she might as well make use of her time it would be a lot less frustrating if she could channel consistently all three of the replica foxhead medallions worked as the first replica had she couldnt channel while wearing one and a powerful weave could overwhelm them she really needed that original back for further study you can see your majesty aludra said in a stiff voice as if unaccustomed to giving a demonstration that weve tried to recreate the conditions under which you might make use of the dragons yes except instead of fifty dressing dummies well have a hundred thousand trollocs elayne thought the next tower you should look at it aludra said gesturing elayne turned the glass to look at the next tower down the wall she could see five members of the band there dressed in uniforms waiting with another dragon mat was looking in the thing right down the tube these have trained somewhat on the dragons aludra continued but they do not have the efficiency i would like they will do for now yes elayne lowered her glass as the men pulled the dummy tube backit was on a set of wheelsand rotated it up a bit toward the sky one poured some black powder in from his cask then another stuffed in a wad of something this was followed by the man with the long pole ramming it down the tube that wasnt a chimney brush he held but some kind of tool used for packing that looks like the powder inside a nightflower birgitte said she felt wary aludra shot the warder a glance and how do you know what is inside a nightflower maerion you do realize how dangerous it is to open one of those yes birgitte shrugged aludra frowned but got no response so took a deep breath and calmed herself the device it is perfectly safe we set up the other dragon to do the firing so there would be no danger yes but there would not be danger anyway the casting is good and my calculations they are perfect elayne birgitte said i still think wed be better off watching from the wall down below even if this one beside us isnt going to be lit after all i went through to get up here elayne asked no thank you aludra you may proceed she ignored birgittes annoyance did aludra really think she could hit one of those dressing dummies with her iron sphere that was a long way to go and the sphere was so small barely wider than a mans outstretched palm had elayne invested all of this effort to get something that would work more poorly than a catapult this dragon sounded as if it could throw its sphere farther but the boulders tossed by a catapult were many times larger the men finished the remaining man touched a small torch to a fuse sticking out of the sphere and rolled it into the tube then they turned the tube to face directly outward you see aludra said patting the dragon three men is best four for safety in case one falls one could do the work if he had to but it would be slow the men stepped back as aludra got out a red flag she held it up in the air signaling the other team on the next tower down the wall elayne focused on them with the glass one carried a small torch mat watched with a curious expression aludra lowered her flag the soldier touched his burning torch to the side of the dragon the explosive sound that followed was so powerful that it made elayne jump the boom was as sharp as a thunderclap and she heard in the distance what sounded like an echo of the explosion she raised a hand to her breast and remembered to draw breath a pocket on the mountainside exploded in a massive spray of dust and earth the ground seemed to tremble it was as if an aes sedai had torn up the earth with a weave but the one power hadnt been used at all aludra seemed disappointed elayne raised her looking glass to her eye the blast had missed the dressing dummies by a good twenty paces but had ripped a hole in the ground five paces wide did the ball explode like a nightflower to cause that this device wasnt merely an improved catapult or trebuchet it was something else something capable of smashing an iron sphere into the ground with such force that it blew open a hole then perhaps exploded on its own why she could line an entire wall with these dragons with all of them firing together aludra raised her flag again elayne watched with her glass as the men on the next tower over cleaned then reloaded the tube mat was holding his ears and scowling which gave elayne a smile he really should have watched from her tower the reloading process took a very short time perhaps three minutes and aludra said she intended to see it happen more quickly aludra wrote a set of orders and sent it by messenger to the men they changed the dragons position slightly she waved her flag elayne steeled herself for another explosion but still jumped when it came this time the blast was deadon hitting in the very center of the rank of dressing dummies their tattered remnants spun through the air the blow destroyed five or six and knocked down a good dozen of them with the ability to fire every two minutes hit so far away and deal such destruction these weapons would be deadly as deadly as damame perhaps birgitte was still looking through her looking glass and while her face was impassive elayne could feel the womans amazement the weapon you find it pleasing aludra asked i find it pleasing aludra elayne said smiling i find it pleasing indeed the resources of the entire city are yours the resources of all andor there are several more bellfounders in andor she glanced at the illuminator but you must keep the plans and designs a secret i will send guards with you we cant afford to let any of the bellfbunders consider the value of leaving home and selling information to our enemies so long as they dont reach the seanchan aludra said i care not well i do elayne said and im the one who will see these things used properly ill need an oath out of you aludra the woman sighed but gave it elayne had no intention of turning them against anyone other than trollocs and seanchan but she would feel much more secure about her nation knowing that she had these at her disposal she smiled as she considered it and found it difficult to contain her excitement birgitte finally lowered her glass she felt solemn what elayne asked as the guards took turns with her glass inspecting the devastation she felt some odd indigestion had she eaten something bad for lunch the world just changed elayne birgitte said shaking her head long braid swinging slightly it just changed in a very large way i have a terrible feeling that its only the beginning chapter men dream here these whitecloaks are a tightlipped group my lady lacile said with a smug smile but theyre still men men who havent seen a woman in a while i think that always makes them lose what few brains they have faile walked the horselines the sky dark lantern held before her perrin was asleep hed retired early these last few days seeking the wolf dream the whitecloaks had reluctantly agreed to delay the trial but perrin still should have been preparing his words to speak there he grumbled that he already knew what he was going to say knowing him hed just tell morgase what had happened straightforward as usual lacile and selande walked on either side of faile other members of cha faile walked behind keeping careful watch for anyone close enough to be within earshot i think the whitecloaks knew we were there to spy selande said the short pale woman walked with hand on her sword the stance didnt seem as awkward as it once had selande had taken her sword training seriously no i doubt they guessed lacile replied she still wore a simple tan blouse and darker brown skirt selande had changed back to breeches and sword immediately upon returningshe still bore a cut on her arm from where that sword had tried to kill herbut lacile seemed to be savoring her time in the skirt they barely said anything of use selande said yes lacile replied but i think theyre merely in that habit our excuse of checking on maighdin and the others was a reasonable one my lady we were able to deliver your note then do a little chatting with the men i teased out enough to be of some use faile raised an eyebrow though lacile fell quiet as they passed a groom working late brushing down one of the horses the whitecloaks respect galad lacile said once out of the grooms earshot though some grumble about the things hes been telling them what things faile asked he wants them to ally with the aes sedai for the last battle lacile explained anyone could have told you they would dislike that idea selande said theyre whitecloaks yes faile said but it means that this galad is more reasonable than his men a useful tip lacile the young woman swelled brushing her short hair back in a modest gesture throwing back the red ribbons she had tied there shed taken to wearing twice as many now since her shaido captivity up ahead a lanky figure stepped between two of the horses he had a thick mustache taraboner style and though he was young he had the air of one who had seen much in his life dannil lewin the man in charge of the two rivers men now that tam had mysteriously decided to depart light send that tam was safe wherever hed gone why dannil faile said what an odd coincidence to see you here coincidence he asked scratching at his head he held his bow in one hand stafflike though he kept glancing at it wary a lot of people did that with their weapons now you asked me to come here it must be a coincidence nonetheless faile said in case anyone asks particularly if that somebody is my husband i dont like keeping things from lord perrin dannil said falling into step with her and youd prefer to risk letting him be beheaded by a group of rabid whitecloaks no none of the men do youve done what i asked then dannil nodded i spoke to grady and neald lord perrin has already ordered them to stay nearby but we talked grady said hed have weaves or air ready and will grab lord perrin and get out if things get ugly neald covering the retreat ive talked to the men from the two rivers a group of archers in the trees will be ready to provide a distraction faile nodded neither ashaman had been wounded in this bubble of evil fortunately each had been carrying a knife but reports said theyd looked at the floating weapons then nonchalantly waved hands and blasted them from the air when messengers with news of failes earththrowing trick had reached the section of camp the ashaman had been in theyd found this area in much less chaos grady and neald striding through camp and felling weapons wherever they saw them part of the reason for the delay before the trial was to take care of healing but another large reason was because perrin wanted to give time to the camps smiths and craftsmen to make replacement weapons for those who had lost theirs just in case the trial turned to a battle and faile was increasingly certain that it would lord perrin wont like being pulled away from fighting dannil said not one bit that tent could turn into a death trap faile said perrin can lead the battle if he wants but from a safer position you will get him out dannil sighed but nodded yes my lady perrin was learning not to fear young bull step by step he learned balance the wolf when the wolf was needed the man when the man was needed he let himself be drawn into the hunt but kept failehis homein his mind he walked the edge of the sword but each step made him more confident today he hunted hopper wily and experienced prey but young bull was quick to learn and having the mind of a man gave him advantages he could think like something or someone that he was not was this how noam had begun where would this path of understanding lead there was a secret to this a secret young bull had to find for himself he could not fail he had to learn it seemed thatsomehowthe more confident he became in the wolf dream the more comfortable he became with himself in the waking world young bull charged through an unfamiliar forest no a jungle with hanging vines and widefronded ferns the underbrush was so thick that a rat would have trouble squeezing through but young bull demanded that the world open before him vines pulled back shrubs bent ferns retracted like mothers pulling their children out of the way of a galloping horse he caught glimpses of hopper bounding ahead his prey vanished young bull didnt break pace charging through that spot and catching the scent of hoppers destination young bull shifted onto an open plain with no trees and an unfamiliar scrub patching the ground his prey was a series of streaking blurs in the distance young bull followed each bound carrying him hundreds of paces within seconds they approached an enormous plateau his prey ran directly up the side of the stone shelf young bull followed ignoring what was right he ran with the ground far below at his back nose toward that boiling sea of black clouds he leaped over clefts in the rock ricocheting between two sides of a rift cresting the top of the plateau hopper attacked young bull was ready he rolled coming up on all fours as his prey leaped over his head passed over the cliffs edge but then vanished in a flash and was back standing on the lip of the cliff young bull became perrin holding a hammer made of soft wood such things were possible in the wolf dream if the hammer hit it would not harm perrin swung the air cracking with the sudden speed of his motion but hopper was equally fast dodging out of the way he rolled then leaped at perrins back fangs glistening perrin growled and shifted so that he was standing a few feet from where he had been hoppers jaws snapped open air and perrin swung his hammer again hopper was suddenly shrouded in a deep mist perrins hammer slammed down through it hitting the ground it bounced off he cursed spinning in the fog he couldnt see couldnt catch hoppers scent a shadow moved in the mist and perrin lunged but it was only a pattern in the air he spun and found shadows moving all around him the shapes of wolves men and other creatures he couldnt see make the world yours young bull hopper sent perrin focused thinking of dry air of the musty scent of dust that was what the air should be like in an arid landscape like this no it wasnt what the air should be like it was how the air was his mind his will his feelings slammed against something else he pushed through the mists vanished evaporating in the heat hopper sat on his haunches a short distance away good the wolf sent you learn he glanced sideways looking toward the north seeming distracted by something then he was gone perrin caught his scent and followed to the jehannah road hopper dashed along outside the strange violet dome they jumped back to this place frequently to see if the dome ever vanished so far it had not perrin continued the chase was the dome meant to trap wolves inside but if that was the case why had slayer not sprung his trap at dragonmount where so many wolves had for some reason gathered perhaps the dome had another purpose perrin memorized a few notable rock formations along the perimeter of the dome then followed hopper to a low shelf of rock the wolf leaped from it vanishing in midair and perrin followed he caught the scent of hoppers destination in midjump then took himself there still in motion he appeared about two feet above a shimmering blue expanse stunned he fell and splashed into the water he swam frantically dropping his hammer hopper stood on top of the water bearing a wolfish expression of disapproval not good the wolf added you still need to learn perrin sputtered the sea grew tempestuous but hopper sat placidly upon the rolling waves again he glanced northward but then turned back to perrin water troubles you young bull i was just surprised perrin said swimming hard why because i didnt expect this why expect hopper sent when you follow another you could end up anywhere i know perrin spat out a mouthful of water he gritted his teeth then imagined himself standing on the water like hopper blessedly he rose out of the sea to stand atop its surface it was a strange sensation the sea undulating beneath him you will not defeat slayer like this hopper sent then i will keep learning perrin said there is little time i will learn more quickly can you we have no other choice you could choose not to fight him perrin shook his head do we run from our prey if we do theyll hunt us instead i will face him and i need to be prepared there is a way the wolf smelled of worry ill do what i have to follow hopper vanished and perrin caught an unexpected scent refuse and mud burning wood and coal people perrin shifted and found himself atop a building in caemlyn he had visited this city only once and briefly and seeing the beautiful inner city before himancient buildings domes and spires rising atop the hill like majestic pines atop a crowned mountaingave him pause he was near the old wall beyond which spread the new city hopper sat at his side looking over the beautiful city much of the city itself was said to be ogierbuilt and perrin could believe it with that marvelous beauty tar valon was said to be more grand than caemlyn perrin had trouble believing that was possible why are we here perrin asked men dream here hopper replied in the real world they did here the place was empty it was light enough to be day despite that storm overhead and perrin felt there should be people crowding the streets women going to and from market nobles atop horses wagons bearing barrels of ale and sacks of grain children scampering slipfmgers searching for marks workers replacing paving stones enterprising hawkers offering meat pies to them all instead there were hints shadows a fallen handkerchief on the street doors that were open one moment then closed the next a thrown horseshoe sticking from the mud of an alleyway it was as if all of the people had been whisked away snatched by fades or some monster from a gleemans dark tale a woman appeared momentarily below she wore a beautiful green and gold dress she stared at the street eyes glazed over then was gone people did occasionally appear in the wolf dream perrin figured it must happen to them when they were asleep part of their natural dreams this place hopper said is not only a place of wolves it is a place of all of all perrin asked sitting down on the rooftiles all souls know this place hopper said they come here when they reach for it when theyre dreaming yes hopper said lying down beside him the feardreams of men are strong so very strong sometimes those terrible dreams come here that sending was an enormous wolf the size of a building knocking aside much smaller wolves who tried to snap at him there was a scent of terror and death about the wolf like a nightmare perrin nodded slowly many wolves have been caught in the pains of these feardreams they appear more commonly where men might walk though the dream lives without those who created it hopper looked at perrin hunting in the feardreams will teach you strength but you might die it is very dangerous i dont have time to be safe anymore perrin said lets do it hopper didnt ask if he was certain he jumped down to the street and perrin followed landing softly hopper began to lope forward so perrin broke into a jog how do we find them perrin asked smell fear hopper sent terror perrin closed his eyes breathing in deeply just as doors flashed open and closed in the wolf dream he could sometimes smell things there for a moment then gone musty winter potatoes the dung of a passing horse a pie baking when he opened his eyes he saw none of these things they werent really there but they almost were they could have been there hopper said vanishing perrin followed appearing beside the wolf outside of a narrow alleyway inside it looked too dark to be natural go in hopper said you will not last long your first time i will come for you remember it is not remember it is false feeling worried but determined perrin stepped into the alleyway the walls to either side were black as if theyd been painted only these walls were too dark to be painted was that a tuft of grass beneath his foot the sky above had stopped boiling and he thought he could see stars peeking down a pale moon far too large appeared in the sky shrouded in clouds it gave a cold glow like ice he wasnt in the city anymore he turned about alarmed to find himself in a forest the trees had thick trunks and were of no species he could recognize their branches were naked the bark was a faint gray lit by the phantom light above and looked like bone he needed to get back to the city out of this terrible place he turned around something flashed in the night and he spun whos there he shouted a woman burst from the darkness running in a mad scramble she wore a loose white robe little more than a shift and she had long dark hair streaming behind her she saw him and froze then turned and made as if to run in a different direction perrin cut her off snatching her hand pulling her back she struggled feet marring the loamy dark ground beneath as she tried to pull away she was gasping in and out in and out she smelled frantic i need to know the way out perrin said we have to return to the city she met his eyes hes coming she hissed her hand slipped from his and she ran vanishing into the night the darkness enfolding her like a shroud perrin took a step forward hand outstretched he heard something behind him he turned slowly to find something enormous a looming shadow that sucked in the moonlight the thing seemed to draw breath away absorbing his very life and will the thing reared up taller it was taller than the trees a hulking monster with arms as thick as barrels its face and body lost in shadow it opened deep red eyes like two huge coals flaring to life need to fight it perrin thought hammer appearing in his hand he took a step forward then thought better of it light that thing was enormous he couldnt fight it not out in the open like this he needed cover he turned and ran through the hostile woods the thing followed he could hear it snapping branches its footsteps making the earth shake ahead of him he saw the woman her thin white gown slowing her as it caught on a branch she pulled free and continued to run the creature loomed it would catch him consume him destroy him he yelled for the woman reaching out toward her she glanced over her shoulder at him and tripped perrin cursed he scrambled to her side to help her up but the thing was so close it was a fight then his heart was thumping as quickly as a woodlark pecking a tree hands sweaty he turned gripping his hammer to face the terrible thing behind he placed himself between it and the woman it reared up growing larger those red eyes blazing with fire light he couldnt fight that could he he needed an edge of some kind what is that thing he desperately asked of the woman why does it chase us its him she hissed the dragon reborn perrin froze the dragon reborn but but that was rand its a nightmare he reminded himself none of this is real i cant let myself be caught up in it the ground trembled as if moaning he could feel the heat of the monsters eyes a scrambling sound came from behind as the woman ran leaving him perrin stood up legs shaking every instinct crying for him to run but no he couldnt fight it either he could not accept this as real a wolf howled then leaped into the clearing hopper seemed to push back the darkness the creature bent down toward perrin reaching a massive hand as if to crush him this was an alley inside of caemlyn it wasnt real it was not the darkness around them faded the enormous dark shadow creature warped in the air like a piece of cloth being stretched the moon vanished a small pocket of groundthe dirty trampled earth of an alleyappeared at their feet then with a snap the dream was gone perrin stood in the alley again hopper at his side no sign of the forest or the terrible creature that someone had viewed as the dragon reborn perrin exhaled slowly sweat dripped from his brow he reached up to wipe it away then willed the sweat away instead hopper vanished and perrin followed finding himself on the same rooftop as before he sat down merely thinking of that shadow made him shiver it felt so real he said a piece of me knew it was a nightmare i couldnt help but try to fight or try to run when i did either it grew stronger didnt it because i accepted it was real yes you must not believe what you see perrin nodded there was a woman in there part of the dream she wasnt real either yes maybe she was the one who dreamed it perrin said the one having the original nightmare caught up in it and trapped here in the world of dreams men who dream do not stay here long hopper sent to him that was the end of the discussion you were strong young bull you did well he smelled proud it helped when she called the thing the dragon reborn that showed it wasnt real helped me believe it wasnt you did well foolish cub hopper repeated perhaps you can learn only if i keep practicing we need to do that again can you find another yes hopper sent there are always nightmares when your kind is near always the wolf turned northward again however perrin had thought that the thing that had been distracting him earlier was the dreams but it didnt seem to have been the case what is up there perrin asked what is it you keep looking toward it comes hopper sent what the last hunt it begins or it does not perrin frowned standing you mean right now the decision will be made soon what decision hoppers sendings were confusing and he couldnt decipher them light and darkness a void and fire a coldness and a terrible terrible heat mixed with wolves howling calling lending strength come hopper stood looking to the northeast hopper vanished perrin shifted after him appearing low down on the slopes of the dragonmount beside an outcropping of stone light perrin said softly looking up in awe the storm that had been brewing for months had come to a head a massive black thunderhead dominated the sky covering the top of the mountain it spun slowly in the air an enormous vortex of blackness emitting bolts of lightning that connected to the clouds above in other parts of the wolf dream the clouds were tempestuous yet distant this felt immediate this was the focus of something perrin could feel it often the wolf dream reflected things in the real world in strange or unexpected ways hopper stood on the outcropping perrin could feel wolves all across the slopes of dragonmount in even greater numbers than hed felt here recently they wait hopper said the last hunt comes as perrin reached out he found that other packs were coming still distant but moving toward dragonmount perrin looked upward at the monstrous peak the tomb of the dragon lews therin it was a monument to his madness to both his failure and his success his pride and his selfsacrifice the wolves perrin said they gather for the last hunt yes if it occurs perrin turned back to hopper you said that it would the last hunt comes you said a choice must be made young bull one path leads to the last hunt and the other perrin asked hopper didnt respond immediately he turned toward dragonmount the other path does not lead to the last hunt yes but what does it lead to to nothing perrin opened his mouth to press further but then the weight of hoppers sending hit him nothing to the wolf meant a vacant den all of the pups taken by trappers a night sky empty of stars the moon fading the smell of old blood dry stale and flaked away perrin closed his mouth the sky continued to churn with that black storm he smelled it on the wind the smell of broken trees and dirt or flooded fields and lightning fires as so often particularly recently those scents seemed to contrast with the world around him one of his senses told him he was in the very center of a catastrophe while the others saw nothing amiss this choice why dont we just make it it is not our choke young bull perrin felt drawn to the clouds above despite himself he began to walk up the slope hopper loped up beside him it is dangerous above young bull i know perrin said but he couldnt stop instead he increased his speed each step launching him just a little farther hopper ran beside him passing trees rocks groups of watching wolves upward perrin and hopper went climbing until the trees dwindled and the ground grew cold with frost and ice eventually they approached the cloud itself it seemed a dark fog shaking with currents as it spun perrin hesitated at the perimeter then stepped inside it was like stepping into the nightmare the wind was suddenly violent the air buzzing with energy leaves and dirt and grit blew in the tempest and he had to raise a hand against it no he thought a small bubble of calm air opened around him the tempest continued to blow just inches from his face and he had to strain to keep from being claimed by it again this storm wasnt a nightmare or a dream it was something more vast something more real this time perrin was the one creating something abnormal with the bubble of safety he pressed forward soon leaving tracks in snow hopper strode against the wind lessening its effect on him as well he was stronger at it than perrin wasperrin barely managed to keep his own bubble up he feared that without it he would be sucked into the storm and tossed into the air he saw large branches rip past in the air and even some smaller trees hopper slowed then sat down in the snow he looked upward toward the peak i cannot stay the wolf sent this is not my place i understand perrin said the wolf vanished but perrin continued he couldnt explain what drew him but he knew that he needed to witness someone did he walked for what seemed like hours focused completely on only two things keeping the winds off him and putting one foot in front of the other the storm grew increasingly violent it was so bad here that he couldnt keep all of the storm off just the worst of it he passed the ridged lip where the mountaintop was broken picking his way alongside it hunkered against the gusts a steep fall on either side wind began to whip at his clothing and he had to squint his eyes against the dust and snow in the air but he continued on striving for the peak which rose ahead rising above the blasted out side of the mountain he knew that atop that point he would find what he searched for this horrible maelstrom was the wolf dreams reaction to something great something terrible in this place sometimes things were more real than in the waking world the dream reflected a tempest because something very important was happening he worried that it was something terrible perrin pressed forward shoving his way through the snows crawling up rock faces his fingers leaving skin sticking to the frigid stones but he had trained well these last few weeks he leapt chasms he shouldnt have been able to leap and climbed rocks that should have been too high for him a figure stood at the very top of the jagged broken tip of the mountain perrin kept pressing onward someone needed to watch someone needed to be there when it happened finally perrin heaved atop one last stone and found himself within a dozen feet of the top he could make out the figure now the man stood at the very heart of the vortex of winds staring eastward motionless he was faint and translucent a reflection of the real world like a shadow perrin had never seen anything like it it was rand of course perrin had known that it would be perrin held to the stone with one ragged hand and pulled his cloak close with the otherhed created the cloak several cliff faces ago he blinked through reddened eyes gazing upward he had to focus most of his concentration on pushing back some of the winds to keep himself from being flung out into the tempest lightning flashed suddenly thunder sounding for the first time since hed begun climbing that lightning began to arc in a dome around the top of the mountain it threw light across rands face that hard impassive face like stone itself where had its curves gone when had rand gained so many lines and angles and those eyes they seemed made of marble rand wore a coat of black and red fine and ornamented with a sword at his waist the winds didnt affect rands clothes those fell unnaturally still as if he really were just a statue carved from stone the only thing that moved was his dark red hair blowing in the wind thrown and spun perrin clung to the rocks for his life cold wind biting into his cheeks his fingers and feet so numb he could barely feel them his beard bristled with dusty ice and snow something black began to spin around rand it wasnt part of the storm it seemed like night itself leaking from him tendrils of it grew from rands own skin like tiny hands curling back and wrapping around him it seemed evil itself given life rand perrin bellowed fight it rand his voice was lost in the wind and he doubted that rand could have heard him anyway the darkness continued to seep out like a liquid tar coming through rands pores creating a miasma of pitch around the dragon reborn within moments perrin could barely see rand through the blackness it enclosed him cutting him off banishing him the dragon reborn was gone only evil remained rand please perrin whispered and thenfrom the midst of the blackness from the center of the uproar and the tempesta tiny sliver of light split through the evil like a candles glow on a very dark night the light shone upward toward the distant sky like a beacon so frail the tempest buffeted it the winds stormed howled and screamed the lightning beat against the top of the rocky peak blasting free chunks of rock scoring the ground the blackness undulated and pulsed but still the light shone a web of cracks appeared down the side of the shell of evil blackness light shining from within another fracture joined it and another something strong was inside something glowing something brilliant the shell exploded outward vaporizing and releasing a column of light so bright so incredible that it seemed to sear the eyes from perrins head but he looked on anyway not raising arm to shade or block the resplendent image before him rand stood within that light mouth open as if bellowing toward the skies above the sunyellowed column shot into the air and the storm seemed to shudder the entire sky itself undulating the tempest vanished that column of fiery light became a column of sunlight streaming down illuminating the peak of dragonmount perrin pulled his fingers free from the rock gazing on with wonder at rand standing within the light it seemed so long so very long since perrin had seen a ray of pure sunlight the wolves began to howl it was a howl of triumph of glory and of victory perrin raised his head and howled as well becoming young bull for a moment he could feel the pool of sunlight growing and it washed over him its warmth banishing the frozen chill he barely noticed when rands image vanished for he left that sunlight behind wolves appeared around perrin flashing into existence midleap they continued to bay jumping at one another exulting and dancing in the wight as it washed over them they yipped and barked tossing up patches of snow as they bounded hopper was among them and he leaped into the air soaring over to perrin the last hunt begins young bull hopper screamed we live we live perrin turned back to the place where rand had stood if that darkn had taken rand but it hadnt he smiled broadly the last hunt has come he screamed to the wolves let it begin they howled their agreement as loud as the storm had been just moments before chapter into the void mat dumped the rest of the wine into his mouth savoring the sweet cool taste he brought the cup down and tossed a handful of five dice they tumbled to the wooden floor of the tavern clacking against one another the air was thick thick with sounds thick with curses thick with scents smoke pungent liquors a steak that had been peppered so much that you could hardly taste the meat that was probably for the best even in caemlyn meat spoiled unpredictably the pungent men around mat watched his dice fall one of the men stank of garlic another of sweat a third of a tannery their hair was stringy their fingers were grimy but their coin was good the game was called koronkos spit and hailed from shienar mat did not know the rules five ones said the man who stank of garlic his name was rittle he seemed unsettled thats a loss no its not mat said softly never mind that he did not know the rules he knew he had won he could feel it his luck was with him good thing too he needed it tonight the man that smelled of a tannery reached for his belt where he carried a wicked knife his name was saddler and he had a chin that could have been used to sharpen swords i thought you said you didnt know this game friend i dont mat said friend but thats a win do we need to ask around the room to see if anyone else can confirm it the three men looked at each other expressions dark mat stood up the inn had walls dark from years of men smoking pipes inside it and the windowsthough of fine glasshad grown opaque with dirt and smoke it was a tradition that they never be cleaned the weathered sign out front had a wagon wheel painted on it and the official name was the dusty wheel everyone called it the rumor wheel instead it was the best place in caemlyn to listen to rumors most of them were untrue but that was half the fun most everyone in the place was drinking ale but mat had taken a fancy to good red wine lately want some more master crimson kati the serving woman asked she was a ravenhaired beauty with a smile so wide it reached halfway to cairhien she had been flirting with him all night never mind that he had told her he was married he had not even smiled at her well not much and hardly his best smile some women could not see the truth of things even if it was written on their own foreheads that was a fact he waved her away only one cup tonight for courage burn him but he needed a little of that with resignation he took the scarf off his neck and dropped it to the side he untucked the foxhead medallionlight but it felt good to be wearing that againand hung it out front of his clothing he wore the new red and silver coat that thorn had bought him mat took his asbandarei from beside the wall and pulled off the cloth cover revealing the blade he set it over his shoulder hey he said in a loud voice anyone in the bloody place know the rules for koronkos spit the three men he had been dicing regarded the weapon the third of them snelle stood up hooking his thumbs into the top of his trousers pushing back his coat and showing the shortsword buckled at his waist most people ignored mat at first conversations rang stories about the borderlander army that had passed about the queens pregnancy about the dragon reborn about mysterious deaths or not so mysterious ones everyone had a rumor to share some of the inns occupants wore little better than rags but some wore the finest of clothing nobles commoners and everything in between came to the rumor wheel a few men by the bar glanced at mat because of the outburst one hesitated blinking mat reached down and took his widebrimmed black hat off the table beside him holding it by the crown then set it on his head the man nudged his companions the sweaty balding man mat had been dicing with raised fingers to his chin rubbing it in thought as if trying to remember something snelle smiled at mat looks like nobody answered you friend guess youll have to trust us you shouldnt have thrown if you didnt ask the rules now are you going to pay or rittles eyes opened wide and he stood hastily and took his friends arm he leaned in whispering something snelle looked down at mats medallion he looked up and met mats eyes mat nodded excuse us rittle said stumbling away the other two joined him they left their dice and coins on the ground mat casually knelt down scooping up the coins and dumping them in his pouch he left the dice they were loaded meant to almost always throw threes he had been able to judge that from a few quick throws before laying down coins whispers moved through the inns common room like a swarm of ants covering a corpse chairs scooted back conversations changed tempo some silencing others becoming urgent mat stood up to go people hastened out of his way mat left a golden crown on the edge of the bar then tipped his hat to hatch the innkeeper the man stood behind the bar wiping a glass his wife next to him she was a pretty one but hatch kept a special cudgel for thumping men who looked too long mat gave her only a short look then mat pulled off his black scarf leaving it on the floor it had a hole in it now anyway he stepped out into the night and the moment he did the dice stopped thundering in his head it was time to get to work he walked out onto the street he had spent all evening with his face uncovered he was certain he had been recognized a few times mostly by men who had slipped out into the night without saying anything as he walked down off the inns front porch people gathered at the windows and doorway mat tried not to feel like all of those eyes were knives sticking into his back light he felt like he was dangling from another noose he reached up and felt at the scar on his neck it had been a long while since he had gone about with his neck uncovered even with tylin he had normally left the scarf on tonight though he danced with jak o the shadows he tied his medallion to the ashandarei he affixed it so that the medallion rested against the flat of the blade and one edge hung out over the tip it would be hard to usehe would have to hit with the flat of the blade in most cases to touch the medallion to fleshbut it gave him much better reach than swinging the medallion by hand medallion in place he picked a direction and began walking he was in the new city a place heaped with manmade buildings a contrast to the fine ogier work elsewhere in caemlyn these buildings were well built but were narrow and thin up close next to one another the first group tried to kill him before he was one street away from the rumor wheel there were four of them as they charged him a group of shadows leaped from a nearby alleyway talmanes at their head mat spun on the killers who pulled up short as his soldiers joined him the street toughs fled in a scramble and mat nodded to talmanes the men of the band faded back into the darkness and mat continued on his way he walked slowly carrying his asbandarei on his shoulder his men had been told to keep their distance unless he was attacked he ended up needing them three more times through the hour each time scaring away a larger group of thugs the last time the band and he actually clashed with the assassins the thugs were no match for trained soldiers even on the darkened streets that were their home the exchange left five of the thugs dead but only one of his men wounded mat sent harvell away with a guard of two it grew later and later mat began to worry that he would have to repeat this act the next night but then he noticed someone standing in the street ahead the paving stones were wet from a misting earlier in the night and they reflected the slivered moon mat stopped lowering his weapon to his side he could not make out details about the figure but the way it stood you think to ambush me the gholam asked sounding amused with your men who squish and rip who die so easily almost at a touch im tired of being chased mat said loudly so you deliver yourself to me what a kind gift sure mat said lowering his asbandarei foxhead on the back catching the moonlight just mind the sharp edges the thing slid forward and mats men lit lanterns the men of the band set the lanterns on the ground then backed away a few of them dashing off to deliver messages they had strict orders not to interfere tonight would probably strain their oaths to him on that mat planted himself and waited for the gholam only a hero charged a beast like that and he was no bloody hero though his men would be trying to clear away anyone on the streets trying to keep the area empty so nobody would scare the gholam away that was not heroism it might have been stupidity though the gholams fluid movements threw lanternlight shadows across the road mat met it with a sweep of his ashandarei but the beast danced to the side easily evading him bloody ashes but the thing was fast it reached out swiping at the front of the ashandarei with the knife it held mat yanked the ashandarei back not letting the monster cut the medallion free it danced around mat and he spun staying inside the ring of lanterns he had chosen a relatively wide street remembering with a shiver that day in the alleyway of ebou dar where the gholam had nearly taken him in close quarters the beast slid forward again and mat feinted drawing it in he almost miscalculated but twisted the ashandarei in time to slap the gholam with the flat of the weapon the medallion let out a hiss as it touched the gholams arm the gholam cursed and backed away wavering lanternlight illuminated its features leaving pockets of darkness and pockets of light it was smiling again despite the wisp of smoke rising from its arm before mat had thought this creatures face unremarkable but in the uneven light and with that smileit took on a terrifying cast more angular reflected lanternlight making its eyes glow like tiny yellow flames consumed by the darkness of its sockets nondescript by day a horror by night this thing had slaughtered tylin while she lay helpless mat gritted his teeth then he attacked it was a bloody stupid thing to do the gholam was faster than he was and mat had no idea if the foxhead could kill it or not he attacked anyway he attacked for tylin for the men hed lost to this horror he attacked because he had no other option when you really wanted to see what a man was worth you backed him into a corner and made him fight for his life mat was in the corner now bloodied and harried he knew this thing would eventually find himor worse find tuon or olver it was the kind or situation where a sensible man would have run but he was a bloody fool instead staying in the city because of an oath to an aes sedai well if he died he would go out with weapon in hand mat became a swirling cyclone of steel and wood yelling as he attacked the gholam seeming shocked actually backed away mat slammed his ashandarei into its hand burning the flesh then spun and knocked the dagger from its fingers the creature leaped away but mat lunged forward ramming the butt of his spear between the things legs it went down its motions were fluid and it caught itself but it did go down as it threw itself to its feet mat slashed the ashandarei blade at its heel he neatly severed the gholam s tendon and if the thing had been human it would have collapsed instead it landed without even a wince of pain and no blood seeped free of the cut it spun and lunged at mat with clawed fingers he was forced to stumble back swinging the ashandarei to ward it away the creature grinned at him then oddly it turned and ran mat cursed had something scared it away but no it was not fleeing it was going for his men retreat mat called at them back burn you you bloody monster im here fight me the members of the band scattered at his orders though talmanes hung back wearing a grim expression the gholam laughed but did not chase down the soldiers instead the thing kicked over the first lantern causing it to wink out it ran around the circle kicking at each one plunging the street into darkness bloody ashes mat chased after the creature if it managed to get all of those lights out with that cloud cover mat would be left fighting it unable to see talmanesblatantly ignoring his own safetyleaped forward and snatched his lantern up to protect it he fled down the street and mat cursed as the gholam chased after mat dashed behind them talmanes had a good lead but the gholam was so quick it nearly got to him and talmanes jerked to the side backing up the steps of a nearby building the monster lunged for him and talmanes stumbled backward as mat ran toward them for all he was worth the lantern fell from talmanes fingers and splashed oil across the front of the building the dry wood came alight tongues of flame rippling across the lamp oil illuminating the gholam it leaped for talmanes mat threw his ashandarei the broadbladed spear was not meant for throwing but he did not have a knife handy he aimed for the gholairis head one would have never known that for he missed pitifully fortunately the weapon dipped down and passed between the gholams legs the monster tripped thudding heavily to the paving stones talmanes scrambled back up the steps of the nowblazing building bless this luck of mine mat thought the gholam stood up and made a motion to follow talmanes but then ooked down at what had tripped it the creature looked at mat with a wicked grin half its face cast in the light of the burning building the creature picked up mats ashandareifoxhead medallion still tied to the frontthen whipped its hand to the side tossing the weapon away the ashandarei crashed through a window and passed into the burning building lamps sparked on inside as if those living there were only now noticing the fight happening in their proximity talmanes gave mat a look and they met eyes the cairhienin man threw himself against the door into the burning building and broke in the gholam spun on mat backlit by the growing flames they blazed quickly and mats heart thumped with alarm as the creature came for him unnaturally fast mat reached into his coat pockets with sweaty fingers right before the gholam reached himhands going for mats neckmat pulled something out with each hand slamming them forward into the gholams palms hissing rang in the air like meat being placed on a grill and the gholam screeched in pain it stumbled wideeyed as it looked at mat who held a foxhead medallion in each hand he whipped them out each held on a long thick chain spinning them the medallions caught firelight seeming to glow as mat whipped them at the gholam striking it on the arm the creature howled backing up another step how it demanded how dont rightly know myself elayne had said her copies werent perfect but it seemed they did the job well enough so long as they hurt the gholam he didnt care about their other abilities mat grinned spinning the second medallion forward guess i just got lucky the gholam glared at him then stumbled up the steps toward the burning building it dashed inside perhaps deciding to flee mat was not about to let it escape not this time he charged it up the steps and ducked through the flaming doorway reaching out a hand as talmanes tossed his ashandarei to him from a side hallway mat caught the weapon leaving the medallions wrapped around his forearms the gholam spun on him the hallway was already burning the heat from the sides and above oppressive smoke lined the ceiling talmanes coughed a kerchief held to his face the gholam turned on mat snarling and attacking mat met the beast in the middle of the wide hallway bringing up his ashandarei to block the gholam clawlike hands the butt of mats ashandarei had been singed from sitting in the fire and the wood smoldered at the end it left a trail of smoke in the air he attacked for all he was worth spinning the ashandarei the back end leaving a whirl of smoke around him the gholam tried to strike at him but mat dropped the ashandarei with one hand and flung one of the medallions like a knife hitting the creature in the face it howled and stumbled back face burned and smoking mat stepped forward slamming the end of the ashandarei against the medallion as it hit the floor flipping it back up and hitting the creature again he pushed forward slashing with the ashandarei and several of the creatures fingers flew free sure it did not bleed and did not seem to feel pain from ordinary wounds but that would slow it a bit the gholam recovered hissing eyes wide with anger its smile was gone now it leaped forward in a blur but mat spun and sliced down the creatures tan shirt exposing its chest then he whipped the second medallion to the side hitting the gholam as it clawed at his arm slicing the skin and spraying blood across the wall mat grunted the gholam howled and stumbled back farther down the burning hallway mat was sweating from the heat from the exertion mat could not fight this creature not for long that did not matter he pushed forward letting his ashandarei become a blur he slapped the flat of it with the medallionagainst the gholam when the beast recovered he flung the second medallion at its face making it duck but then he kicked the third one up to hit it on the neck he left lines of smoke in the air as he spun the ashandarei grabbing it in two hands again the end of his weapon glowed and smoldered he found himself yelling in the old tongue al dival al kiserai al mashi for light glory and love the gholam stepped back snarling at the barrage it looked over its shoulder seeming to notice something behind but mats attack drew its attention back taidaishar true blood of battle mat forced the creature toward an open doorway at the back of the hallway the room beyond was entirely dark no light of the fires reflected off walls there carai manshimaya tylin carai an manshimaya nalesean carai an manshimaya ayendan honor of my blade for tylin honor of my blade for nalesean honor of my blade for the fallen the call of vengeance the gholam backed into the darkened room stepping onto a bone white floor eyes flickering down taking a deep breath mat leaped through the doorway with a final burst of strength and slammed the smoldering butt of his ashandarei into the side of the creatures head a spray of sparks and ash exploded around its face the creature cursed and stumbled to the right and there it nearly stepped off the edge of a platform hanging above an expansive void the gholam hissed in anger hanging with one leg over the void flailing to keep its balance from this side the doorway into the room was ringed by a glowing white lightthe edges of a gateway made for skimming i dont know if vou can die mat said softly i hope to the light that you cant he raised a boot and slammed it into the things back throwing it off the platform into the darkness it fell twisting in the air looking up at him with a horror i hope you cant die mat said because im going to enjoy the thought of you falling through that blackness forever you misbegotten son of a goats droppings mat spit over the side sending a bit of bloody spittle down plummeting after the gholam both disappeared into the blackness below sumeko walked up beside him the stout kinswoman had long dark hair and the air of a woman who did not like being ordered about nearly every woman had that same air shed been standing just inside the gateway to the side where she would be unseen from the hallway she had to be there to maintain the white platform which was in the shape of a large book she raised an eyebrow at him thanks for the gateway mat said shouldering his ashandarei the butt still trailing a thin line of smoke shed made the gateway from inside the palace using it to travel to this point and open the gateway in the hallway theyd hoped that would keep the gholam from feeling her channel as shed made the weaves in the palace sumeko sniffed together the two walked out through the gateway and into the building several of the band were hurriedly putting out the fire talmanes rushed up to mat as the gateway vanished accompanied by another of the kinswomen julanya you sure that darkness goes on forever mat asked julanya was a plump pretty woman who would have fit nicely on mats knee the white in her hair did not detract from her prettiness at all near as we can tell it does sumeko said this was quite nearly bungled matrim cauthon the thing didnt seem surprised by the gateway i think it sensed it anyway still managed to fight it off the platform mat said barely you should have let us deal with the beast wouldnt have worked mat said taking a wetted kerchief from talmanes sumeko glanced at his arm but mat didnt ask for healing that cut would heal right nicely might even have a good scar scars impressed most women so long as they were not on the face what did tuon think of them sumeko sniffed the pride of men do not forget that we lost some of our own to that thing and im glad i could help you get revenge mat said he smiled at her though she was right it had nearly been bungled he was certain the gholam had felt the kinswoman beyond that doorway as they approached fortunately though the thing hadnt seemed to consider woman who could channel to be a threat talmanes handed mat back the two fallen medallions he tucked them away and untied the one on his ashandarei slipping it back onto his neck the kin watched those medallions with a predatory hunger well they could do that all they wanted he intended one for olver and the other for tuon once he could find her captain guybon birgittes secondincommand walked into the building the beast is dead no mat said but close enough for a crown contract crown contract guybon asked frowning you asked the queens aid on this endeavor this wasnt done on her contract actually talmanes said clearing his throat we just rid the city of a murderer who has taken at last count nearly a dozen of her citizens were entitled to combat pay i surmise he said it with a completely straight face bless the man bloody right mat said stopping the gholam and getting paid for it that sounded like a sunny day for a change he tossed his kerchief to guybon and walked away leaving behind the kinswomen who folded their arms and watched with displeasure why was it a woman could look angry with a man even when he had done exactly what he had said he would risking his neck even sorry about the fire mat talmanes said didnt mean to drop the lantern like that i know i was just supposed to lead him into the building worked out fine mat said inspecting the butt of his ashandarei the damage was minor they had not known whereor ifthe gholam would attack him but guybon had done his job well getting everyone out of the nearby buildings then picking a hallway that the kinswoman would make the gateway into hed sent a member of the band to tell talmanes where to go well elayne and birgittes idea with the gateway had worked out even if it hadnt been the way theyd planned it was still better than what mat had been able to come with his only idea bad been to try to stuff one of those medallions down the gholams throat lets collect setalle and olver from their inn mat said and get back to camp excitements over for now about bloody time chapter a storm of light the city of maradon burned violent twisting columns of smoke rose from dozens of buildings the careful city planning kept the fires from spreading too quickly but did not stop them entirely human beings and tinder they went together ituralde crouched inside a broken building rubble to his left a small band of saldaeans to his right hed abandoned the palace early on it had been swarmed with shadowspawn hed left it packed with all the oil theyd been able to find then had the ashaman set it aflame killing hundreds of trollocs and fades trapped inside he glanced out the window of his current hiding place he could have sworn hed seen a patch of bare sky out the window but the ash and smoky haze in the air made it difficult to tell a building nearby burned so intensely that he could feel the heat through the stone he used the smoke and the fire almost everything on a battlefield could be an advantage in this case once yoeli had accepted that the city was lost theyd stopped defending it now they used the city as a killing ground the streets created a maze that ituraldewith the help of the saldaeansknew and his enemies did not every rooftop was a ridge to give high ground every alley a secret escape route every open square a potential trap the trollocs and their commanders had made a mistake they assumed that ituralde cared about protecting the city they mistook him all he cared about now was doing as much damage to them as possible so he used their assumptions against him yes their army was large but any man who had ever tried to kill rats knew that the size of his hammer didnt matter so long as the rats knew how to hide a hesitant group of the creatures shuffled down the blackened street outside ituraldes building the trollocs snapped and hooted warily at one another some sniffed at the air but the smoke ruined their sense of smell they completely missed ituralde and his small band just inside the building hoofbeats rang on the other end of the street the trollocs began to shout arid a group hurried to the front setting wickedly barbed spears down with the butts against the cobbles charging that would be death for cavalry the trollocs were learning to be more careful but they werent learning well enough the cavalry came into view revealing one man leading a group of wounded and exhausted horses a distraction now ituralde said the archers around him sprang up and began shooting out the windows at the trollocs many died others spun and charged and from a side street a cavalry chargethe horses hooves covered with rags to dampen soundgalloped out their approach covered by the louder hooves of the diversionary horses the saldaeans ripped through the trollocs trampling and killing the archers whooped and took out swords and axes to finish off the wounded trollocs no fade with this group bless the light ituralde stood up a wet handkerchief to his face against the smoke his wearinessonce buried deepwas slowly resurfacing he was worried that when it hit him hed drop unconscious bad for morale that no he thought hiding in the smoke while your home burns knowing that the trollocs are slowly penning you in thats bad for morale his men finished off the fist of trollocs then hastened to another predecided building that they could hide in ituralde had about thirty archers and a company of cavalry which he moved among five independent bands of irregular fighters similar to this one he waved his men back into hiding while his scouts brought him information even with the scouts it was difficult to get a good read on the large city he had vague ideas of where the strongest resistance was and sent what orders he could but the battle was spread over too large an area for him to be able to coordinate the fighting effectively he hoped yoeli was well the ashaman were gone escaping at his order through the tiny gatewayonly large enough to crawl throughthat antail had made since theyd goneit was hours ago nowthere had been no sign of whatever rescuers were supposedly coming before the ashaman left hed sent a scout through a gateway to that ridge where the lastriders had been said to watch all that the scout found was an empty camp the fire burning unattended ituralde joined his men inside the new hiding place leaving his handkerchiefnow stained with sooton the doorknob to give the scouts a clue to his location once inside he froze hearing something outside hush he said to the men they stilled their clinking armor footfalls many of them that was a trolloc band for certain his men had orders to move silently he nodded to his soldiers holding up six fingers plan number six theyd hide waiting hoping the creatures would pass them by if they didntif they delayed or started searching the nearby buildingshis team would burst out and broadside them it was the riskiest of the plans his men were exhausted and the cavalry had been sent to another of his group of defenders but better to attack than be discovered or surrounded ituralde sidled up to the window waiting listening breathing shallowly light but he was tired the group marched around the corner outside footfalls in unison that was odd trollocs didnt march so regularly my lord one of his men whispered there arent any hooves ituralde froze the man was right his tiredness was making him stupid thats an army of hundreds he thought he got to his feet coughing despite himself and pushed open the door he stepped outside a gust of wind blew down the street as ituralde s men piled out behind him the wind cleared the smoke for a moment revealing a large troop of infantry kitted out in silvery armor and carrying pikes they seemed ghosts for a momentglowing in a phantom golden light from above a sun he had not seen in months the newcomers began to call as they saw him and his men and two of their officers charged up to him they were saldaean where is your commander one asked the man rodel ituralde i ituralde found himself coughing i am he who are you bless the light one of the men said turning back to the others pass the word to lord bashere weve found him ituralde blinked he looked back at his filthy men faces blackened with soot more than a few had an arm in a sling hed started with two hundred now there were fifty they should be celebrating but most of fhem sat down on the ground closing their eyes ituralde found himself laughing now the dragon sends help now he stumbled then sat down staring up at the burning sky he was laughing and he could not stop soon tears began streaking down his cheeks yes there was sunlight up there ituralde had regained some composure by the time the troops led him into a welldefended sector of the city the smoke here was much less thick supposedly althors troopsled by davram basherehad reclaimed most of maradon what was left of it theyd been putting out the fires it was so odd to see troops with shiny armor neat uniforms clean faces theyd swept in with large numbers of ashaman and aes sedai and an army thatfor nowhad been enough to drive the shadowspawn back to the hillside fortifications above the river althors men led him to a tall building inside the city with the palace burned out mostly destroyed it looked like theyd picked this building as a command center ituralde had been fighting a draining war for weeks now althors troops seemed almost too clean his men had been dying while these men washed and slept and dined on hot food stop it he told himself entering the building it was far too easy to blame others when a battle went wrong it wasnt the fault of these men that their lives had been easier than his recently he labored up the stairs wishing theyd let him be a good nights sleep a wash and then he could meet with bashere but no that wouldnt do the battle wasnt over and althors men would need information it was just that his mind was failing him working very slowly he reached the top floor and followed basheres soldiers into a room to the right bashere stood there wearing a burnished breastplate without the matching helmet hands clasped behind his back as he looked out the window he wore one of those overly large saldaean mustaches and a pair of olive trousers stuffed into kneehigh boots bashere turned and started light you look like death itself man he turned to the soldiers he should be in the healers tent someone fetch an ashaman im all right ituralde said forcing sternness into his voice i look worse than i feel id warrant the soldiers hesitated looking to bashere well the man said at least get him a chair and something to wipe his face with you poor fellow we should have been here days ago outside ituralde could hear the sounds of distant battle bashere had chosen a tall building one from which he could survey the fighting the soldiers brought a chair andfor all his wish to show a strong face to a fellow generalituralde sat with a sigh he looked down and was amazed to see how dirty his hands were as though hed been cleaning a hearth no doubt his face was sootcovered streaked with sweat and there was likely still dried blood on it his clothing was ragged from the blast that had destroyed the wall not to mention a hastily bandaged cut on his arm your defense of this city was nothing short of stunning lord ituralde bashere said there was a formality to his tonesaldaea and arad doman were not enemies but two strong nations could not share a border without periods of animosity the number of trollocs dead compared to the number of men you had and with a gap that large in the wall let me say that im impressed basheres tone implied that such praise was not easily given what of yoeli ituralde asked basheres expression grew grim my men found a small band defending his corpse he died bravely though i was surprised to find him in command and torkumena distant cousin of mine the presumed leader of the citylocked in his rooms and abandoned where the trollocs could have gotten him yoeli was a good man ituralde said stiffly among the bravest ive had the honor of knowing he saved my life brought my men into the city against torkumens orders its a burning shame to lose him a burning shame without yoeli maradon wouldnt stand right now it hardly stands anyway bashere said somberly ituralde hesitated hes uncle to the queenthis city is probably his home the two looked at one another like old wolves leaders of rival packs stepping softly im sorry for your loss ituralde said the city stands as well as it does bashere said because of you im not angry man im saddened but not angry and ill take your word on yoeli to be frank ive never liked torkumen for now ive left him in the room where we found himstill alive thankfullythough ill hear thunder from the queen for whats been done to him shes always been fond of him bah she normally has better judgment bashere nodded to the side when he spoke of torkumen andwith a startituralde realized that he recognized this building this was torkumens home where yoeli had brought ituralde on his first day in the city it made sense to choose this building as a command postit was close enough to the northern wall to have a good view of the outside but far enough away from the blast to have survived unlike the council hall well it would have served torkumen right if the trollocs had gotten him ituralde sat back closing his eyes as bashere consulted with his officers bashere was capable that much was obvious very quickly hed swept the city clean once the trollocs had realized that there was a larger force to fight theyd abandoned the city ituralde could feel pride that in part his tenacity was what had made them so quick to run ituralde continued to listen most of basheres troops had come into the city through gateways after sending in one scout to find safe places to make them fighting in the streets wouldnt work for him as it had ituralde the hitandhide tactic had been devoted to doing as much damage as possible before getting killed it was a losing tactic the trollocs had pulled back into the fortifications but they wouldnt stay there for long as he sat with closed eyes struggling to stay awake ituralde heard bashere and his captains come to the same dire conclusion ituralde had maradon was lost the shadowspawn would wait for night then swarm in again after all this theyd just flee after yoeli had died holding the city after rajabi had been killed by a draghkar after ankaer and rossin had fallen during the skirmishes inside the walls after all the bloodshed they finally saw help arrive only to have it prove insufficient perhaps we could push them off that hilltop one of basheres men said clean out the fortifications he didnt sound very optimistic son ituralde said forcing his eyes open i held that hill for weeks against a superior force your people built it up well and the problem with wellbuilt fortifications is that your enemy can turn them against you youll lose men attacking there a lot of them the room fell silent we leave then bashere said naeff well need gateways yes lord bashere squarefaced and lean of build the man wore the black coat and the dragon pin of an ashaman malain gather the cavalry and organize them outside make it look as if were going to try an assault against their fortifications thatll keep them eager and waiting well evacuate the wounded then well have the cavalry charge in the other direction into by the light and my hope for rebirth a voice suddenly exclaimed everyone in the room turned in shock that wasnt the sort of oath you heard every day a young soldier stood by the window looking out with a looking glass bashere cursed and hurried to the window the others crowding around several taking out looking glasses what now ituralde thought standing despite his fatigue and hurrying over what could they possibly have come up with more draghkar darkhounds he peered out the window and someone handed him a looking glass he raised it and as hed guessed the building was on enough of a rise to look out over the city wall and onto the killing field outside and the beyond the tower positions on the crest of the hill were clustered with ra vens through the glass he could see trollocs clogging the heights holding the upper camp the towers and the bulwarks there beyond the hill surging down through the pass was an awesome force of trollocs many times the number that had assaulted maradon the wave of monsters seemed to continue on forever we need to go bashere said lowering his looking glass immediately light ituralde whispered if that force gets past us there wont be anything in saldaea andor or arad doman that can stop it please tell me the lord dragon made peace with the seanchan as he promised in that a quiet voice said from behind as in so many other things i have failed ituralde spun lowering his looking glass a tall man with reddish hair stepped into the rooma man whom ituralde felt he had never met before despite the familiar features rand althor had changed the dragon reborn had that same selfconfidence that same straight back that same attitude expecting obedience and yet at the same time everything seemed different the way he stood no longer faintly suspicious the way he studied ituralde with concern those eyes cold and emotionless had once convinced ituralde to follow this man those eyes had changed too ituralde had not noted wisdom in them before dont be a thickheaded fool ituralde thought you cant tell if a man is wise by looking at his eyes and yet he could rodel ituralde althor said stepping forward and laying a hand on ituralde s arm i left you and your men stranded and overwhelmed please forgive me i made this choice myself ituralde said oddly he felt less tired than he had just moments ago i have inspected your men althor said there are so few left and they are broken and battered how did you hold this city what you have done is a miracle i do what needs to be done you must have lost many friends i yes what other answer was there to dismiss it as nothing would be to dishonor them wakeda fell today rajabi well a draghkar got him ankaer he lasted until this afternoon never did find out why that trumpeter sounded early rossin was looking into it hes dead too we need to get out of the city bashere said his voice urgent im sorry man maradon is lost no althor said softly the shadow will not have this city not after what these men did to hold it i will not allow it an honorable sentiment bashere said but we dont he trailed off as althor looked at him those eyes so intense they seemed almost alight they will not take this city bashere althor said an edge of anger entering his quiet voice he waved to the side and a gateway split the air the sounds of drums and trollocs yelling grew closer suddenly im tired of letting him hurt my people pull your soldiers back with that althor stepped through the gateway a pair of aiel maidens hurried into the room and he left the gateway open long enough for them to leap through behind him then he let it vanish bashere looked stunned mouth halfopen curse that man he finally said turning to the window again i thought he wasnt going to do this sort of thing any longer ituralde joined bashere raising his looking glass looking out through the enormous gap in the wall outside althor was crossing the trampled ground wearing his brown cloak and followed by the two maidens ituralde thought he could hear the sounds of the howling trollocs their drums beat they saw three people alone the trollocs surged forward charging across the ground hundreds thousands ituralde gasped bashere uttered a quiet prayer althor raised one hand then thrust itpalm forwardtoward the tide of shadowspawn and they started to die it began with waves of fire much like the ones ashaman used only these were far larger the flames burned terrible swaths of death through the trollocs they followed the course of the land seeping up the hill and down into the trenches filling them with whitehot fire searing and destroying clouds of draghkar spun in the sky diving for althor the air above him turned blue and shards of ice exploded outward spraying the air like arrows from the bows of an entire banner of archers the beasts shrieked their inhuman agony carcasses tumbling to the ground light and power exploded from the dragon reborn he was like an entire army of channelers thousands of shadowspawn died deathgates sprang up striking across the ground killing hundreds the ashaman naeffstanding beside basheregasped ive never seen so many weaves at once he whispered i cant track them all hes a storm a storm of light and streams of power clouds began to form and swirl above the city the wind picked up howling and lightning struck from above blasts of thunder overpowered the sounds of drums as trollocs tried in vain to get to althor climbing over the burning carcasses of their brethren the swirling white clouds crashed into the black boiling tempest intermingling wind spun around althor whipping at his cloak the man himself seemed to be glowing was it the reflection of the swaths of fire or perhaps the lightning blasts althor seemed brighter than them all his hand upraised against the shadowspawn his maidens hunched near the ground on either side of him eyes forward shoulders set against the great wind clouds spinning about one another made funnels into the masses of trollocs sweeping across the top of the hill taking up the creatures into the air great waterspouts rose behind made of flesh and fire the beasts rained down falling upon the others ituralde watched with awe the hair on his arms and head rising there was an energy to the very air itself a scream came from nearby within the building in one of the nearby rooms ituralde did not turn away from the window he had to watch this beautiful terrible moment of destruction and power waves of trollocs broke the drums faltering entire legions of them turned and fled stumbling up the hillside and over one another fleeing back toward the blight some remained firmtoo angry too intimidated by those driving them or too stupid to flee the tempest of destruction seemed to come to a peak flashes of light blasting down in time with howling wind thrumming waves of burning flame tinkling shards of ice it was a masterwork a terrible destructive wonderful masterwork althor lifted his hand toward the sky the winds grew faster the lightning strikes larger the fires hotter trollocs screamed moaned howled ituralde found himself trembling althor closed his hand into a fist and it all ended the last of the windseized trollocs dropped from the sky like leaves abandoned by a passing breeze everything fell silent the flames died the black and white clouds cleared and opened to a blue sky althor lowered his hand the field before him was piled with carcasses atop carcasses tens of thousands of dead trollocs smoldering directly before althor a pile a hundred paces wide formed a ridge five feet tall a mound of dead that had nearly reached him how long had it taken ituralde found that he could not gauge the time though looking at the sun at least an hour had passed perhaps more it had seemed like seconds althor turned to walk away the maidens rose on shaky feet stumbling after him what was that scream naeff asked the one nearby in the building did you hear it ituralde frowned what had that been he crossed the room the othersincluding several of basheres officersfollowing many others stayed in the room however staring out at the field that had been cleansed by ice and by fire it was odd but ituralde hadnt been able to spot a single fallen tower atop the hill it was as if althors attacks had somehow affected only the shadowspawn could a man really be that precise the hallway outside was empty but ituralde had a suspicion now of where the scream had come from he walked to lord torkumens door bashere unlocked it and they went inside it seemed empty ituralde felt a spike of fear had the man escaped he pulled out his sword no a figure was huddled in the corner beside the bed fine clothing wrinkled doublet stained with blood ituralde lowered his sword lord torkumens eyes were gone he appeared to have put them out with a writing quill the bloodied implement lay on the ground beside him the window was broken bashere glanced out it lady torkumen is down there she jumped torkumen whispered clawing at his eye sockets fingers covered with blood he sounded dazed that light that terrible light ituralde glanced at bashere i cannot watch it torkumen muttered i cannot great lord where is your protection where are your armies to rend your swords to strike that light eats at my mind like rats feasting on a corpse it burns at my thoughts it killed me that light killed me hes gone mad bashere said grimly kneeling down beside the man better than he deserved judging by those ramblings light my own cousin a darkfriend and in control of the city what is he talking about one of basheres men said a light surely he couldnt have seen the battle none of these windows face the right way im not sure he was talking about the battle vogeler bashere said come on i suspect the lord dragon is going to be tired i want to see that hes cared for this is it min thought tapping the page she sat on her windowsill in the stone of tear enjoying the breeze trying not to think of rand he wasnt hurt but his emotions were so strong anger shed hoped he wouldnt be so angry ever again she shook off the worrying she had work to do was she following the wrong thread was she interpreting in the wrong way she read the line again light is held before the maw of the infinite void and all that he is can be seized her speculation cut off as she saw a light appear from the room across the hall she dropped her book and leaped down to the floor rand was suddenly close she could feel it through the bond two maidens guarded the room across the hall mostly to prevent people from wandering in and getting hurt by gateways the one that had opened now led to a place that smelled of smoke rand stumbled through min ran to him he looked exhausted eyes red face wan he leaned against her with a sigh letting her help him to a chair what happened min demanded of evasni the maiden who came through next she was a lanky woman with dark red hair cut short with a tail in the back like that of most maidens the caracarn is well the woman said though he is like a youth who ran one more lap around the camp than everyone else only to prove that he could he gained much ji today ifeyinathe other maidensaid almost in argument her voice was solemn rand sighed settling back in the chair bashere followed out of the gateway boots hitting stone min heard calls from down belowa group of wounded soldiers being brought through a larger gateway the stones courtyards were alive with activity aes sedai healers running to care for the bloodied sooty men after bashere came a lean domani man in his middle years rodel iturralde he looked much the worse for wear with dried blood on his filthy face his clothing ripped and bearing a clumsy bandage on his arm rand had no visible wounds his clothing was clean though he insisted on still wearing that aged brown cloak but light he looked tired rand min said kneeling down rand are you all right i grew angry rand said softly i had thought myself beyond that she felt a chill it was not a terrible anger like before rand said it was not the anger of destruction though i did destroy in maradon i saw what had been done to men who followed me i saw light in them min defying the dark one no matter the length of his shadow we will live that defiance said we will love and we will hope and i saw him trying so hard to destroy that he knows that if he could break them it would mean something something much more than maradon breaking the spirit of men he thirsts for that he struck far harder than he otherwise would have because he wanted to break my spirit his voice grew softer and he opened his eyes looking down at her and so i stood against him what you did was amazing bashere said standing beside min with his arms folded but did you let him drive you to it rand shook his head i have a right to my anger bashere dont you see before i tried to hold it all hidden within that was wrong i must feel i must hurt for the pains the deaths the losses of these people i have to cling to these things so i know why i am fighting there are times when i need the void but that does not make my anger any less a part of me he seemed to be growing more confident with each word and min nodded well you saved the city bashere said not soon enough rand said min could feel his sorrow and my actions today may still have been a mistake min frowned why it came too close to a confrontation between us rand said that must happen at shayol ghul and at the right time i cannot afford to let him provoke me bashere is right nor can i afford to let the men assume that i will always be able to step in and save them perhaps bashere said but what you did today rand shook his head i am not to fight this war bashere todays battle exhausted me beyond what i should have allowed if my enemies were to come upon me now id be finished besides i can only fight in one place at a time what is coming will be grander than that grander and more terrible than any one man could hope to hold back i will organize you but i must leave you the war will be yours he fell silent and flinn stepped through the gateway letting it slid closed i must rest now rand said softly tomorrow i meet with your niece and the other borderlanders bashere i know not what they will require of me but they must return to their posts if saldaea was in such a state with one of the great captains leading the defense i can only guess what the other borderland nations are suffering min helped him to his feet rand she said softly cadsuane returned and she had someone with her he hesitated take me to her min winced i shouldnt have mentioned it you should rest i will he said dont worry she could still sense his exhaustion but she didnt argue they walked from the room rodel ituralde rand said pausing by the doorway you will wish to accompany me i cannot repay you for the honor you have shown but i do have something i can give the grizzled domani nodded following min helped rand down the corridor worrying about him did he have to push himself this hard unfortunately he does rand althor was the dragon reborn hed be bled dry ground down used up before this was through it was almost enough to make a woman stop trying rand she said ituralde and several maidens trailing them fortunately cadsuane s room wasnt far i will be all right he said i promise have you news of your studies he was trying to distract her unfortunately that question just sent her to another worry have you ever wondered why cailandor is so often called a fearful blade or the blade of ruin in the prophecies its such a powerful saangreal he said maybe its because of the destruction it can cause maybe she said you think its something else theres a phrase min said in the jendai prophecy i wish we knew more of them anyway it says and the blade will bind him by twain two women rand said i need to be in a circle with two women to control it she grimaced what rand said you might as well be out with it min i need to know theres another phrase from the karaethon cycle anyway i think hat callandor might be flawed beyond that i think it might rand i think it might make you weak open you to attack if you use it perhaps thats how ill be killed then you arent going to be killed min said i youll live through this sheepherder she insisted im going to see that you do he smiled at her he looked so tired i almost believe that youll do it min perhaps im not the one the pattern bends around but you he turned then knocked on a door in the hallway it cracked merise peeking out she looked rand up and down you seem as if you can barely stand on your own feet althor true indeed he replied is cadsuane sedai here she has done as you asked merise replied and i might say shes been very accommodating considering how you let him in merise cadsuanes voice said from inside merise hesitated then gave rand a glare as she pulled the door open all the way cadsuane sat in a chair speaking with an older man whose long gray hair fell loose to his shoulders he had a large beak of a nose and regal clothing rand stepped to the side behind them someone gasped rodel ituralde stepped up to the doorway seeming stunned and the man in the room turned he had kindly eyes and coppery skin my liege ituralde cried hastening forward then going down on one knee you live min felt an overwhelming sense of happiness from rand ituralde it appeared was weeping rand stepped back come lets go to my rooms and rest the king of arad doman where did she find him min said how did you know a friend left me a secret rand said the white tower collected mattin stepaneos to protect him well it wasnt too much of a leap to wonder if they might have done that with other monarchs and if they sent sisters to arad doman to seize him months ago before any of them knew of gateways they could have gotten trapped in the snows on their return trip he seemed so relieved graendal never had him i didnt kill him mm one innocent i assumed that id killed still lives thats something a small something but it helps she helped him walk the rest of the way to their rooms contentsfor momentto share in his warm sense of joy and relief chapter siuans soup was surprisingly good she took another sip raising an eyebrow it was simplebroth and vegetables bits of chickenbut when most food tasted stale at best this seemed a wonder she tried the biscuit no weevils delightful nynaeve had just fallen silent her own bowl steaming in front of her newly raised shed taken the oaths earlier in the day they were in the amyrlins study shutters open and spilling in golden light new rugs of green and gold on the floor silently siuan chided herself for getting distracted by the soup nynaeves report demanded consideration shed spoken of her time with rand althor and specifically of events such as the cleansing of course siuan had heard the reports that saidin had been cleansed an ashaman had visited the camp during the division she had remained skeptical but there was little denying it now well the amyrlin said i am very glad for this longer explanation nynaeve though saidin being cleansed does make it less unsettling to consider ashaman and aes sedai bonding one another i wish rand had been willing to speak to me of that during our meeting she said it evenly though siuan knew she looked on men bonding women with as much pleasure as a captain looked on a fire in his hold i suppose nynaeve said lips turning down if it matters rand didnt approve the men bonding women it doesnt matter if he did or not egwene said the asharnan are his responsibility as the aes sedai who chained him and beat him are yours mother nynaeve asked inherited from elaida perhaps egwene said eyes narrowing just slightly she was right to bring nynaeve back siuan thought taking a sip of soup she takes his side far too often for comfort nynaeve sighed taking her spoon to begin her soup i didnt mean that as a challenge mother i just want to show how he thinks light i didnt approve of much of what he did particularly lately but i can see how he got there he has changed though siuan said thoughtfully you said so yourself yes nynaeve said the aiel say hes embraced death ive heard that from them too egwene said but i looked into his eyes and something else has changed something inexplicable the man i saw he didnt seem like one to destroy natrins barrow siuan shivered as she thought of that the man i saw wouldnt need to destroy such a place egwene said those inside would just follow him bend to his wishes because he was the three fell silent egwene shook her head and took a sip of her soup she paused then smiled well i see the soup is good perhaps things arent as bad as i thought the ingredients came from caemlyn nynaeve noted i overheard the serving girls talking oh more silence mother siuan said speaking carefully the women are still worried about the deaths in the tower i agree mother nynaeve said sisters stare at one another with distrust it worries me you both should have seen it before egwene said during elaidas reign if it was worse than this nynaeve said im glad that i didnt she glanced down at her great serpent ring she did that a lot recently as a fisher with a new boat often glanced toward the docks and smiled for all her complaints that she was aes sedai and for all the fact that shed been wearing that ring for a long time now she was obviously satisfied to have passsed the testing and taken the oaths it was terrible egwene said and i dont intend to let it go back to that siuan the plan must be put into motion siuan grimaced ive been teaching the others but i dont think this is a good idea mother theyre barely trained whats this nynaeve asked aes sedai egwene said carefully chosen and given dream terangreal siuan is showing them how telararirhiod works mother that place is dangerous egwene took another sip of soup i believe i know that better than most but it is necessary we must lure the killers into a confrontation ill arrange for a secret meeting among my most loyal aes sedai in the world of dreams and perhaps lay clues that other people of importance will be attending siuan youve contacted the windfinders yes siuan said though they want to know what youll give them to agree to meet with you the loan of the dream terangreal will be enough egwene said dryly not everything has to be a bargain to them it often does nynaeve said but thats beside the point youre bringing windfinden to this meeting to lure mesaana not exactly egwene said ill see the windfinders at the same time in a different place and some wise ones as well enough to hint to mesaanaassuming shes got spies watching the other groups of women who can channelthat she really wants to spy on us in telaranrhiod that day you and siuan will hold a meeting in the hall of the tower but it will be a decoy to draw mesaana or her minions out of hiding with wardsand some sisters watching from hidden placeswell be able to trap them siuan will send for me as soon as the trap is sprung nynaeve frowned its a good plan save for one thing i dont like you being in danger mother let me lead this fight i can manage it egwene studied nynaeve and siuan saw some of the real egwene thoughtful bold but calculating she also saw egwenes fatigue the weight of responsibility siuan knew that feeling well i a admit you have a valid concern egwene said ever since i let myself get captured by elaid as cronies outside of tar valon ive wondered if i become too directly involved too directly in danger exactly nynaeve said however egwene said the simple fact remains that i am the one among us who is most expert at telaranrhiod you two are skilled true but i have more experience in this case i am not just the leader of the aes sedai i am a tool that the white tower must use she hesitated i dreamed this nynaeve if we do not defeat mesaana here all could be lost all will be lost it is not a time to hold back any of our tools no matter how valuable nynaeve reached for her braid but it now came only to her shoulders she gritted her teeth at that you might have a point but i dont like it the aiel dreamwalkers siuan said mother you said youll be meeting with them might they be willing to help id feel much better about having you fight if i knew they were around to keep an eye on you yes egwene said a good suggestion i will contact them before we meet and make the request just in case mother nynaeve said perhaps rand this is a matter of the tower nynaeve egwene said we will manage it very well now egwene continued we need to figure out how to spread the right rumors so that mesaana wont be able to resist coming to listen perrin hit the nightmare running the air bent around him and the city housesthis time of the cairhienin flattopped varietydisappeared the road became soft beneath his feet like mud then turned to liquid he splashed in the ocean water again he thought with annoyance deep red lightning crashed in the sky throwing waves of bloody light across the sea each burst revealed shadowed creatures lurking beneath the waves massive things evil and sinuous in the spasming red lightning people clung to the wreckage of what had once been a ship screaming in terror and crying out for loved ones men on broken boards women trying to hold their babies above the water as towering waves broke over them dead bodies bobbing like sacks of grain the things beneath the waves struck snatching people from the surface and dragging them into the depths with splashes of fins and sparking razorsharp teeth the water was soon bubbling red that didnt come from the lightning whoever had dreamed this particular nightmare had a singularly twisted imagination perrin refused to let himself be drawn in he squelched his fear and did not swim for one of those planks it isnt real it isnt real it isnt real despite his understanding part of him knew that he was going to die in these waters these terrible bloody waters the moans of the others assaulted him and he yearned to try to help them they werent real he knew just figments but it was hard perrin began to rise from the water the waves turning back into ground but then he cried out as something brushed his leg lightning crashed breaking the air a woman beside him slipped beneath the waves tugged by unseen jaws panicked perrin was suddenly back in the water there in a heartbeat floating in a completely different place one arm slung over a piece of wreckage this happened sometimes if he wavered for a momentif he let himself see the nightmare as realit would pull him in and actually move him fitting him into its terrible mosaic something moved in the water nearby and he splashed away with a start one of the surging waves raised him into the air it isnt real it isnt real it isnt real the waters were so cold something touched his leg again and he screamed then choked off as he gulped in a mouthful of salty water it isnt real he was in cairhien leagues from the ocean this was a street hard stones beneath the smell of baked bread coming from a nearby bakery the street lined with small thintrunked ash trees with a bellowing scream he clung to this knowledge as the people around him held to their flotsam perrin knotted his hands into fists focusing on reality there were cobblestones under his feet not waves not water not teeth and fins slowly he rose from the ocean again he stepped out of it and set his foot on the surface feeling solid stone beneath his boot the other foot followed he found himself on a small floating circle of stones something enormous surged from the waters to his left a massive beast part fish and part monster with a maw so wide that a man could walk into it standing upright theteeth were as large as perrins hand and they glittered dripping blood it was not real the creature exploded into mist the spray hit perrin then dried immediately around him the nightmare bent a bubble of reality pressing out from him dark air cold waves screaming people ran together like wet paint tnere was no lightninghe did not see it light his eyelids there was no thunder he could not hear it crashing there were no waves not in the middle of landlocked cairhien perrin snapped his eyes open and the entire nightmare broke apart vanishing like a film of frost exposed to the spring sunlight the buildings reappeared the street returned the waves retreated the sky returned to the boiling black tempest lightning that was bright and white flashed in its depths but there was no thunder hopper sat on the street a short distance away perrin walked over to the wolf he could have jumped there immediately of course but he didnt like the idea of doing everything easily that would bite at him when he returned to the real world you grow strong young bull hopper sent approvingly i still take too long perrin said glancing over his shoulder every time i enter it takes me a few minutes to regain control i need to be faster in a battle with slayer a few minutes might as well be an eternity he will not be so strong as these hell still be strong enough perrin said hes had years to learn to control the wolf dream i only just started hopper laughed young bull you started the first time you came here yes but i just started training a few weeks back hopper continued laughing he was right in a way perrin had spent two years preparing visiting the wolf dream at night but he still needed to learn as much as he could in a way he was glad for the delay before the trial but he could not delay too long the last hunt was upon them many of the wolves were running to the north perrin could feel them passing running for the blight for the borderlands they were moving both in the real world and in the wolf dream but those here did not shift there directly they ran as packs he could tell that hopper longed to join them however he remained behind as did some others come on perrin said lets find another nightmare the rose march was in bloom that was incredible few other plants had bloomed in this terrible summer and those that did had wilted but the rose march was blooming and fiercely hundreds of red explosions twisting around the garden framework voracious insects buzzed from flower to flower as if every bee in the city had come here to feed gawyn kept his distance from the insects but the scent of roses was so pervasive that he felt bathed in it once he finished his walk his clothing would probably smell of the perfume for hours elayne was speaking with several advisors near one of the benches beside a small lilycovered pond she was showing her pregnancy and seemed radiant her golden hair reflected the sunlight like the surface of a mirror atop that hair the rose crown of andor looked almost plain by comparison she often had much to do these days hed heard hushed reports of the weapons she was building the ones she thought might be as powerful as captive damane the bellfounders in caemlyn had been working for straight through the nights from what hed heard caemlyn was preparing for war the city abuzz with activity she didnt often have time for him though he was glad for what she could spare she smiled at him as he approached then waved off her attendants for the moment she walked to him and gave him a fond kiss on the cheek you look thoughtful a common malady of mine lately he said you look distracted a common malady of mine lately she said there is always too much to do and never enough of me to do it if you need to no she said taking his arm i need to speak to you and ive been told that a walk around the gardens once a day will be good for my constitution gawyn smiled breathing in the scents of roses and mud around the pond the scents of life he glanced up at the sky as they walked i cant believe how much sunlight weve been seeing here id nearly convinced myself that the perpetual gloom was something unnatural oh it probably is she said nonchalantly a week back the cloud cover in andor broke around caemlyn but nowhere else but how she smiled rand something he did he was atop dragonmount i think and then suddenly the day seemed darker althor again gawyn spat he follows me even here even here she said with amusement i believe these gardens are where we first met him gawyn didnt reply to that he glanced northward checking the sky in that direction ominous dark clouds hung out there hes the father isnt he if he were elayne said without missing a beat then it would be prudent to hide that fact wouldnt it the children of the dragon reborn will be targets gawyn felt sick hed suspected it the moment hed discovered the pregnancy burn me he said elayne how could you after what he did to our mother he did nothing to her elayne said i can produce witness after witness that will confirm it gawyn mother vanished before rand liberated caemlyn there was a fond look in her eyes as she spoke of him something is happening to him i can feel it feel him changing cleansing he drives back the clouds and makes the roses bloom gawyn raised an eyebrow she thought the roses bloomed because of athor well love could make a person think strange things and when the man she spoke of was the dragon reborn perhaps some irrationality was to be expected they approached the ponds small dock he could remember swimming there as a child then getting an earful for it not from his mother from galad though gawyns mother had given him a stern disappointed look hed never told anyone that hed been swimming only because elayne had pushed him in youre never going to forget that are you elayne asked what he asked you were thinking of the time you slipped into the pond during mothers meeting with house farah slipped you pushed me i did nothing of the sort elayne said primly you were showing off balancing on the posts and you shook the dock i stepped onto it elayne said forcefully im a vigorous person i have a forceful stride a forceful thats a downright lie no im merely stating the truth creatively im aes sedai now its a talent of ours now are you going to row me on the pond or nor i row you when did that come up just now werent you listening gawyn shook a bemused head fine behind them several guardswomen took up posts they were always near often led by the tall woman who fancied herself an image of birgitte from the stories and maybe she did look like birgitte at thatshe went by the name anyway and was serving as captaingeneral the guards were joined by a growing group of attendants and messengers the last battle approached and andor preparedand unfortunately many of those preparations required elaynes direct attention though gawyn had heard a curious story of elayne having been carried up on the city wall in her bed a week or so back so far he hadnt been able to pin her down on whether that was true or not he waved to birgitte who gave him a scowl as he led elayne to the ponds small rowboat i promise not to dump her in gawyn called then under his breath though i might row forcefully and upend us oh hush elayne said settling down pondwater wouldnt be good for the babies speaking of which gawyn said pushing the boat off with his toe then stepping into it the vessel shook precariously until he sat down arent you supposed to be walking for your constitution ill tell melfane i needed to take the opportunity to reform my miscreant brother you can get away with all kinds of things if youre giving someone a proper scolding and is that what im getting a scolding not necessarily her voice was somber gawyn shipped the oars and slipped them into the water the pond wasnt large barely big enough to justify a boat but there was a serenity about being upon the water amid the pondrunners and the butterflies gawyn elayne said why have you come to caemlyn its my home he said why shouldnt i come here i worried about you during the siege i could have used you in the fighting but you stayed away i explained that elayne i was embroiled in white tower politics not to mention the winter snows it burns me that i couldnt help but those women had their fingers on me im one of those women myself you know she held up her hand great serpent ring encircling her finger youre different gawyn said anyway youre right i should have been here i dont know what other apologies you expect me to make though i dont expect any apologies elayne said oh gawyn i wasnt chastising you while i certainly could have used you we managed i also worried about you getting caught between defending the tower and protecting egwene it seems that worked out as well so i ask why have you come here now doesnt egwene need you apparently not gawyn said backing the boat a massive draping willow grew from the side of the pond here hanging down branches like braids to dangle above the water he raised his oars outside those branches and the boat stilled well elayne said i wont presume to pry into thatat least not at the moment you are always welcome here gawyn id make you captain general if you asked but i dont think you want it what makes you say that well youve spent the majority of your time here moping around these gardens i have not been moping ive been pondering ah yes i see youve learned to speak the truth creatively too he snorted softly gawyn you havent been spending time with any of your friends or acquaintances from the palace you havent been stepping into the role of a prince or captaingeneral instead you merely ponder gawyn looked out across the pond i dont spend time with the others because they all want to know why i wasnt here for the siege they keep asking when im going to take my station here and lead your armies its all right gawyn you dont have to be captaingeneral and i can survive with my first prince of the sword absent if i must though ill admit birgitte is rather upset with you for not becoming captaingeneral is that the reason for the glares yes but she will manage shes actually good at the job and if theres anyone id want you protecting it would be egwene she deserves you and what if ive decided i dont want her elayne reached forward resting her hand on his arm her face framed in golden hair topped by that matching crownlooked concerned oh gawyn what has happened to you he shook his head bryne thinks i was too accustomed to succeeding and didnt know how to react when things started to upend on me and what do you think i think its been good for me to be here gawyn said taking a deep breath some women were walking along the path around the pond led by a woman with bright red hair that was streaked with white dimana was some kind of failed student of the white tower gawyn wasnt quite certain about the nature of the kin and their relationship with elayne being here he said reminded me of my life before its been particularly liberating to be free of aes sedai for a time i was sure that i needed to be with egwene when i left the younglings to ride to her it felt like the best choice id ever made and yet she seems to have moved beyond needing me shes so concerned with being strong with being the amyrlin that she doesnt have room for anyone who wont bow to her every whim i doubt that its as bad as you say gawyn egwene well she has to put forward a strong front because of her youth and the way she was raised but shes not arrogant no more so than is necessary elayne dipped her fingers in the water startling a goldenback fish ive felt the way she must be feeling you say she wants someone to bow and scrape for her but what id bet she really wantswhat she really needsis someone she can trust completely someone she can give tasks then not worry about how they will be handled she has enormous resources wealth troops fortifications servants but theres only one of her and so if everything requires her attention directly she might as well have no resources at all i you say you love her elayne said youve told me youre devoted to her that youd die for her well egwene has armies full of those kinds of people as do i what is truly unique is someone who does what i tell them better someone who does what they know id tell them if i had the chance im not sure i can be tht man gawyn said why not of all the men ready to support a woman of power id have thought it would be you its different with egwene i cant explain why well if you wish to marry an amyrlin then you must make this choice she was right it frustrated him but she was right enough about that he said i notice the topic moved away from althor because there was no more to say about him you have to stay away from him elayne hes dangerous elayne waved her hand saidin is cleansed of course he would say that you hate him elayne said i can hear it in your voice this isnt about mother is it he hesitated shed grown so good at twisting a conversation was that the queen in her or the aes sedai he nearly turned the boat back toward the dock but this was elayne light but it felt good to talk to someone who really understood him why do i hate althor gawyn said well theres mother but its not just her i hate what hes become the dragon reborn a tyrant you dont know that gawyn hes a sheepherder what right does he have to cast down thrones to change the world as he does particularly while you huddled in a village hed told her most of what had happened to him in the last few months while he conquered nations you were being forced to kill your friends then were sent to your death by your amyrlin exactly so its jealousy elayne said softly no nonsense i what would you do gawyn elayne asked would you duel him maybe and what would happen if you won and ran him through as youve said you wanted to do would you doom us all to satisfy your momentary passion he had no reply to that thats not just jealousy gawyn elayne said taking the oars from him its selfishness we cant afford to be shortsighted right now she began to row them back despite his protest this he said coming from the woman who personally raided the black ajah elayne blushed he could tell that she wished hed never found out about that event it was needed and besides i did say we you and i we have this trouble birgitte keeps telling me i need to learn to be more temperate well youll need to learn the same thing for egwenes sake and she does need you gawyn she may not realize it she may be convinced she needs to hold up the world herself shes wrong the boat thumped against the dock elayne unshipped the oars and held out a hand gawyn climbed out then helped her up onto the dock she gripped his hand fondly youll sort it out she said im releasing you from any responsibility to be my captaingeneral for now i wont appoint another first prince of the sword but you can hold that title with duties in abeyance so long as you show up for the occasional state function you neednt worry about anything else that might be required of you i will publish it immediately citing a need for you to be doing other work at the advent of the last battle i thank you he said though he wasnt certain he felt it it sounded too much like egwenes insistence that he didnt need to guard her door elayne squeezed his hand again then turned and walked up to the attendants gawyn watched her speak to them in a calm tone she seemed to grow more regal by the day it was like watching a flower blossom he wished hed been in caemlyn to view the process from the start he found himself smiling as he turned to continue his way along the rose march his regrets had trouble taking hold before a healthy dose of elaynes characteristic optimism only she could call a man jealous and make him feel good about it he passed through waves of perfume feeling the sun on his neck he walked where he and galad had played as children and he thought of his mother walking these gardens with bryne he remembered her careful instruction when he misstepped then her smiles when he acted as a prince should those smiles had seemed like the sun rising this place was her she lived on in caemlyn in elaynewho looked more and more like her by the hourin the safety and strength of andors people he stopped beside the pond the very spot where galad had saved him from drowning as a child perhaps elayne was right perhaps althor hadnt had anything to do with morgases death if he had gawyn would never prove it but that didnt matter rand althor was already condemned to die at the last battle so why keep hating the man she is right gawyn whispered watching the hawkflies dance over the surface of the water were done althor from now on i care nothing for you it felt like an enormous weight lifting from his shoulders gawyn let out a long relaxed sigh only now that elayne had released him did he realize how much guilt hed felt over his absence from andor that was gone now too time to focus on egwene he reached into his pocket slipping out the assassins knife and held it up in the sunlight inspecting those red stones he did have a duty to protect egwene supposing she railed against him hated him and exiled him wouldnt it be worth the punishments if he managed to preserve her life by my mothers grave a voice said sharply from behind where did you get that gawyn spun the women hed noticed earlier were standing behind him on the path dimana led them her hair streaked with white her face wrinkled around the eyes wasnt working with the power supposed to stop those signs of aging there were two people with her one was a plump young woman with black hair the other a stout woman in her middle years the second was the one who had spoken she had wide innocentlooking eyes and she seemed horrified what is that marille dimana asked that knife marille said pointing at gawyns hand marille has seen one like it before i have seen it before dimana corrected you are a person and not a thing yes dimana much apologies dimana marille will not make the mistake again dimana gawyn raised an eyebrow what was wrong with this person forgive her my lord dimana said marille spent a long time as a damane and is having difficulty adjusting youre seanchan gawyn said of course i should have noticed the accent marille nodded vigorously a former damane gawyn felt a chill this woman had been trained to kill with the power the third woman remained silent watching with curious eyes she didnt look nearly as subservient we should be moving on dimana said it isnt good for her to see things that remind her of seanchan come marille that is merely a token lord trakand won in battle i suspect no wait gawyn said holding up a hand you recognize this blade marille looked to dimana as if requesting permission to answer the kinswoman nodded sufferingly it is a bloodknife my lord marille said you did not win it in battle because men do not defeat bloodknives they are unstoppable they only fall when their own blood turns against them gawyn frowned what nonsense was this so this is a seanchan weapon yes my lord marille said carried by the bloodknives i thought you said this was a bloodknife it is but that is also who carries them shrouded in the night sent by the empresss willmay she live foreverto strike down her foes and die in her name and glory marille lowered her eyes farther marille speaks too much she is sorry i am sorry dimana said a hint of exasperation in her tone i am sorry marille repeated so these bloodknives gawyn said theyre seanchan assassins he felt a deep chill could they have left behind suicide troops to kill aes sedai yes it made sense the murderer wasnt one of the forsaken yes my lord marille said i saw one of the knives hanging in the room of my mistresss quarters it had belonged to her brother who had borne it with honor until his blood turned against him his family no his blood marille shrank down farther tell me of them gawyn said urgently shrouded in the night marille said sent by the empresss will may she live foreverto strike down her foes and die in yes yes gawyn said you said that already what methods do they use how do they hide so well what do you know of how this assassin will strike marille shrank down farther at each question and began to whimper lord trakand dimana said contain yourself marille doesnt know very much the damane said marille is sorry please punish her for not listening better gawyn pulled back the seanchan treated their damane worse than animals marille wouldnt have been told anything specific of what these bloodknives could do where did you get these damane gawyn asked were any seanchan soldiers captured i need to speak with one an officer preferably dimana pursed her lips these were taken in altara and only the damane were sent to us dimana the other woman said she didnt have a seanchan accent what of the suldam kaisea was of the low blood dimana frowned kaisea is unreliable please gawyn said this could save lives very well dimana said wait here i will return with her she took her two charges toward the palace leaving gawyn to wait anxiously a few minutes later dimana returned followed by a tall woman wearing a pale gray dress without belt or embroidery her long black hair was woven into a braid and she seemed determined to remain precisely one step behind dimanaan action that bothered the kinswoman who seemed to be trying to keep an eye on the woman they reached gawyn and the suldamincrediblygot down on her knees and prostrated herself on the ground head touching the dirt there was a smooth elegance to the bowing for some reason it made gawyn feel as if he were being mocked lord trakand dimana said this is kaisea or at least thats what she insists that we call her now kaisea is a good servant the woman said evenly stand up gawyn said what are you doing kaisea has been told you are the queens brother you are of the blood of this realm and i am a lowly damane damane youre a suldam no longer the woman said i must be collared great lord will you see it done kaisea is dangerous dimana nodded to the side indicating they should speak privately gawyn withdrew with her farther down the rose march leaving kaisea prostrate on the ground shes a suldam gawyn asked or is she a damane all suldam can be trained to channel dimana explained elayne thinks that fact will undermine their entire culture once revealed so shes had us focus on teaching the suldam to access their powers many refuse to admit that they can see the weaves but a few have been honest with us to a woman theyve insisted that they should be made damane she nodded back toward kaisea this one is most troubling we think shes intentionally working to learn the weaves so that she can create an accident and use our own reasoning against usif she does something violent with the one power she can claim that we were wrong to leave her free a woman who could be trained to kill with the one power who was not bound by the three oaths and who had a determination to prove that she was dangerous gawyn shivered we keep some forkroot in her most days dimana said i dont tell you this to worry you but to warn you that what she says and does may not be reliable gawyn nodded thank you dimana led him back and the suldam remained on the ground how may kaisea serve you great lord her actions seemed a parody of marilles subservience what gawyn had originally taken for mockery wasnt that at allinstead it was the imperfect efforts of one who was highborn to imitate the lowly have you ever seen one of these before gawyn asked casually taking out the bloodknife kaisea gasped where did you find that who gave it to you she cringed almost immediately as if realizing that shed stepped out of her assumed role an assassin tried to kill me with it gawyn said we fought and he got away that is impossible great lord the seanchan woman said her voice more controlled why do you say that because if you had fought one of the bloodknives great lord you would be dead they are the most expert killers in all of the empire they fight the most ruthlessly because they are already dead suicide troops gawyn nodded do you have any information about them kaiseas face grew conflicted if i see you leashed gawyn asked will you answer me then my lord dimana said the queen would never allow it ill ask her gawyn said i cant promise that youll be leashed kaisea but i can promise ill intercede with the queen for you you are powerful and strong great lord kaisea said and wise indeed if you will do this thing kaisea will answer you dimana glared at gawyn speak gawyn said to the suldam bloodknives do not live long kaisea said once they are given a duty they do not rest from it they are granted abilities from the empress may she live forever terangreal rings that make them into great warriors those blur their forms gawyn said when they are near shadow yes kaisea said sounding surprised that he knew this they cannot be defeated but eventually their own blood will kill them their own blood they are poisoned by their service once they are given a charge they often will not last more than a few weeks at most they survive a month gawyn held up the knife disturbed so we only need to wait them out kaisea laughed that will not happen before they die they will see their duty fulfilled this one is killing people slowly gawyn said one every few days a handful so far tests kaisea said prodding for weaknesses and strengths learning where they can strike without being seen if only a few are dead then you have not yet seen the full power of the bloodknife they do not leave a handful of dead but dozens unless i stop him gawyn said what are his weaknesses kaisea laughed again weaknesses great lord did i not say that they are the finest warriors in seanchan enhanced and aided by the empresss favor may she live forever fine what about the terangreal then it helps the assassin when he is in shadow how can i stop it from working perhaps light a large number of torches you cannot have light without shadow great lord the woman said create more light and you will create more shadows there has to be a way kaisea is certain that if there is one great lord you will find it the womans response had a smug rone to it if kaisea may suggest great lord count yourself fortunate to have survived fighting a bloodknife you must not have been his or her true target it would be prudent to hide yourself until a month has passed allow the empressmay she live foreverto accomplish her will and bless the omens that you were given warning enough to escape and live thats enough of that dimana said i trust you have what you wish lord trakand yes thank you gawyn said disturbed he barely noticed as kaisea rose and the kinswoman led her charge away count yourself fortunate to have survived you must not truly have been his target gawyn tested the throwing knife in his hands the target was egwene obviously why else would the seanchan expend such a powerful weapon perhaps they thought her death would bring down the white tower egwene had to be warned if it made her angry at him if it flew in the face of what she wanted he had to bring her this information it could save her life he was still standing thereconsidering how to approach egwene when a servant in red and white found him she carried a plate with a sealed envelope on it my lord gawyn whats this gawyn asked taking the letter and using the bloodknife to cut it open along the top from tar valon the servant said bowing it came through a gateway gawyn unfolded the thick sheet of paper inside he recognized silvianas script gawyn trakand it read the amyrlin was thoroughly displeased to discover your departure you were never instructed to leave the city she has asked me to send this missive explaining that you have been given ample time to idle in caemlyn your presence is required in tar valon and you are to return with all haste gawyn read the letter then read it again egwene screamed at him for disturbing her plans all but threw him out of the tower and she was displeased to discover hed left the city what did she expect him to do he almost laughed my lord the servant asked would you like to send a reply there was paper and pen on the tray they implied that one would be expected send her this gawyn said tossing the bloodknife onto the tray he felt so angry suddenly and all thoughts of returning fled his mind flaming woman and tell her he added after a moments thought that the assassin is seanchan and carries a special terangreal that makes him difficult to see in shadows best to keep extra lights burning the other murders were tests gauge our defenses she is the true target emphasize that the assassin is very very dangerousbut not the person she thought it was if she needs proof she can come talk to some of the seanchan here in caemlyn the servant looked perplexed but when he said nothing further the woman retreated he tried to cool his rage he wouldnt go back not now not when it would look as if hed come crawling back at her command she had her careful plans and traps she had said she didnt need him she would have to do without him for a while then chapter judgment i want the scouts out watching perrin said forcefully even during the trial the maidens wont like this perrin aybara sulin said not if it makes them miss the chance to dance the spears theyll do it anyway perrin said walking through camp dannil and gaul at his side behind followed azi and wil alseen his two guards for the day sulin inspected perrin then nodded it will be done she moved off lord perrin dannil asked smelling nervous whats this about i dont know yet perrin said somethings wrong on the wind dannil frowned looking confused well perrin was confused too confused and increasingly certain it seemed a contradiction but it was true the camp was busy his armies gathering to meet the whitecloaks not his army his armies there was so much division among them arganda and gallenne jostling one another for position the two rivers men resenting the newer bands of mercenaries the former refugees mashed between them all and of course the aiel aloof and doing as they wished im going to disband them perrin told himself what does itnatter it bothered him nonetheless it was a disorderly way to run a camp anyway perrins people had mostly recovered from this latest bubble of evil none of the would probably look at their weapons again the same way but the wounded had been healed and the channelers were rested the whitecloaks had not been pleased at the delay which had extended longer than they had probably expected but perrin had needed the time for a number of reasons dannil he said my wife has you mixed up in her plots to protect me i assume dannil started how she needs her secrets perrin said i miss half of them but this one was as plain as day shes not happy about this trial whats she got you doing some plan with the ashaman to get me out of danger something like that my lord dannil admitted ill go if it turns bad perrin said but dont jump to it too early i wont have this turn into a bloodbath because one of the whitecloaks lets out a curse at the wrong time wait for my signal understood yes my lord dannil said smelling sheepish perrin needed to be done with this all free of it now because over these last few days it had begun to feel natural to him im just a he trailed off just a what a blacksmith could he say that anymore what was he up ahead neald sat on a stump near the traveling ground during the last few days the youthful ashaman soldier and gaul had scouted out in several directions at perrins orders to see if gateways worked if one got far enough away from camp sure enough it turned out they did though one had go for hours to escape the effect neither neald nor gaul had noted any sort of change other than the weave for gateways working again there was no barrier or visible indication on this side but if perrin guessed right the area where gateways didnt work matched exactly the area covered by the dome in the wolf dream that was the domes purpose and that was why slayer guarded it it wasnt about hunting the wolves though he surely did that with pleasure something was causing both the dome and the problems with the ashaman neald perrin said walking up to the ashaman latest scouting mission went well yes my lord when grady and you were first telling me about the failing weaves you said it had happened to you before when was that when we tried to open the gateway to retrieve the scouting group from cairhien neald said we tried at first and the weaves fell apart but we waited a little while and tried again that time it worked that was just after the first night i saw the dome perrin thought it came up for a short time then vanished slayer must have been testing it my lord neald said stepping close he was a fop of a man but hed been reliable when perrin needed him whats going on i think someones setting a trap for us perrin said softly boxing us in ive sent some others out to look for the thing causing this its probably some kind of object of the one power he worried that it might be hidden in the wolf dream could something there produce an effect in the real world now youre sure you cant create gateways at all not even to other points nearby inside the effected area neald shook his head the rules are different on this side then perrin thought or at least it works differently on traveling than it does on shifting in the wolf dream neald you said with the larger gatewaysusing a circleyou could move the entire army through in a few hours neald nodded weve been practicing we need to be ready for that perrin said looking at the sky he could still smell that oddity in the air a faint staleness my lord neald said well be ready but if we cant create gateways then it doesnt matter we could march the army out to that point beyond the effect though and escape from there unfortunately perrin suspected that wouldnt do hopper had called this a thing of the deep past that meant there was a good chance slayer was working with the forsaken or he was one of the forsaken himself perrin had never considered that either way the ones planning this trap would be watching if his army tried to escape the enemy would spring its trap or theyd move the dome the forsaken had been fooling the shaido with those boxes and had placed them here and there was his picture being distributed was it all part of this trap whatever it was dangers so many dangers hunting him well what did you expect he thought its tarmon gaidon i wish elyas would return he said hed sent the man on a special scouting mission of his own just be ready neald dannil itd be best if youd go pass my cautions on to your men i dont want any accidents dannil and neald went their separate ways and perrin walked to the horse pickets to find stepper gaul quiet as the wind fell in beside him someones pulling a snare tight perrin thought slowly inch by inch aroundny leg probably waiting for him to fight the whitecloaks afterward his army would be weakened and wounded easy pickings it gave him a chill to realize that if hed gone to battle with damodred earlier the trap might have been sprung right then the trial suddenly took on enormous import perrin had to find a way to forestall a battle until he could get to the wolf dream one more time in it perhaps he could find a way to destroy the dome and free his people you change perrin aybara gaul said whats that perrin said taking stepper from a groom this is a good thing gaul replied it is good to see you stop protesting about being chief it is better to see you enjoy command ive stopped protesting because i have better things to do perrin said and i dont enjoy being in command i do it because i have to gaul nodded as if he thought perrin were agreeing with him aiel perrin swung into the saddle lets go on then the column is starting to march off with you faile said to aravine the army is moving out aravine curtsied and moved to pass the orders to the refugees faile wasnt certain what this day would bring but she wanted those who stayed behind to break camp and be ready to march just in case as aravine left faile noticed aldin the bookkeeper joining her he did seem to be visiting aravine quite often lately perhaps hed finally given up on arrela she hastened toward the tent on her way she passed flann barstere jon gaelin and marek cormer checking over their bowstrings and arrow fletchings all three looked up at her and waved there seemed to be a sense of relief in their eyes which was a good sign once these men had looked ashamed when theyd seen her as if they felt bad for the way perrin had seemingly dallied with berelain during failes absence faile spending time with berelain mixed with the formal denunciation of the rumors was working to convince the camp that nothing inappropriate had happened interesting it seemed that faile saving berelains life during the bubble of evil had had the strongest effect in changing peoples minds they assumed because of that event that there was no grudge between the two women of course faile hadnt saved the womans life just helped her but that wasnt what the rumors said and faile was pleased to see them working in her and perrins favor for once she reached the tent and hurriedly washed up with a damp cloth and their basin she put on some perfume then dressed in her nicest gown a depp graygreen with embroidered vine patterns across the bodice and around the hem finally she checked herself in the mirror good she was hiding her anxiety perrin would be all right he would be she slipped a few knives into her belt and up her sleeves anyway out side a groom had brought daylight for her she climbed upmissing swallow who had been killed by the shaido even her finest dress had skirts divided for riding she wouldnt carry anything else on the road her mother had taught her that nothing destroyed a womans credibility with soldiers more quickly than riding sidesaddle and should the unthinkable happen and perrin fall faile might need to take command of their forces she trotted up to the front of the gathering army perrin sat in his saddle there how dare he look so patient faile didnt let her annoyance show there was a time to be a tempest and a time to be a tender breeze she had already let perrin know in no uncertain terms what she thought of this trial for the moment she needed to be seen supporting him she rode up beside perrin as the aes sedai gathered behind walking like the wise ones no maidens where were they it must be important to keep them from the trial to sulin and the others protecting perrin was a duty given them by their caracarn and it would be a grave matter of toh to them if he fell scanning the camp she noted two gaishain in hooded white robes hurrying to the front of the line gaul who stood beside perrins horse scowled one of the figures bowed to him holding forth a collection of spears freshly sharpened chiad said and newly fletched arrows bain added i have arrows and spears already gaul said yes the women said kneeling before him still holding their offerings what he asked we were simply worried for your safety bain said you prepared those weapons yourself after all she said it earnestly no hint of mockery or insincerity yet the words themselves were close to patronizing gaul started laughing he took the weapons offered and gave the women his own despite the troubles of the day faile found herself smiling there was a devious complexity to aiel interactions what should have pleased gaul regarding his gaishain often seemed to frustrate him and yet that which should have been insulting was met with amusement as bain and chiad retreated faile looked over the gathering army everyone was coming not just captains or token forces most wouldnt be able to watch the trial but they needed to be there in case faile pulled up beside her husband something worries you she said to him the world holds its breath faile he said what do you mean he shook his head the last hunt is here rand is in danger more than any of us he is in danger and i cant go to him not yet perrin youre not making any sense how can you know rand is in danger i can see him any time i mention his name or think on him a vision of him opens to my eyes she blinked he turned toward her his yellow eyes thoughtful im connected to him he pulls at me you see anyway i told myself i was going to be open with you about things like this he hesitated my armies here theyre being herded faile like sheep being driven to the butcher he suddenly remembered his vision from the wolf dream sheep running in front of wolves hed thought himself one of the wolves but could he have been wrong light he had been wrong about that he knew what it meant now i can feel it on the wind he said the problem with gateways its related to something happening in the wolf dream somebody wants us to be unable to escape this place a cold breeze odd in the noonday heat washed over them are you certain faile asked yes perrin said oddly i am thats where the maidens are scouting someone wants to trap us and attack makes most sense to let us clash with the whitecloaks then kill whoever survives but that would require an army of which there is no sign just us and the whitecloaks i have elyas hunting out signs of a waygate in the area but he hasnt found anything yet so maybe theres nothing and im just jumping at shadows lately husband its become likely that those shadows can bite i trust your instincts he looked to her then smiled deeply thank you so what do we do we ride to this trial perrin said and do whatever we can to keep from going to battle with the whitecloaks then tonight i see if i can stop the thing that is preventing the gateways we cant just ride far enough away to escape it the thing can be moved i saw it in two places ill have to destroy it somehow after that we escape she nodded and perrin gave the call to march though the force behind still seemed chaoticlike a rope chat had been tangledthe army began to move the various groups sorted themselves out unraveling they made the short trip down the jehannah road approaching the field with the pavilion the whitecloaks had already arrived they were in formation it looked as if theyd brought their entire army as well this was going to be a tense afternoon gaul ran beside perrins horse and he didnt seem worried nor did he have his face veiled faile knew he thought it honorable for perrin to go to trial perrin either had to defend himself or admit toh and accept judgment aiel had walked freely to their own executions to meet toh they rode down to the pavilion a chair had been set on a low platform at the northern end its back to the distant forest of leatherleaf morgase sat in the elevated chair looking every inch a monarch wearing a gown of red and gold that galad must have found for her how had faile ever mistaken this woman for a simple ladys maid chairs had been placed in front of morgase and whitecloaks filled half of them galad stood beside her makeshift throne of judgment his every lock of hair was in place his uniform without blemish his cloak falling behind him faile glanced to the side and caught berelain staring at galad and blushing looking almost hungry she had not given up on her attempts to persuade perrin to let her go make peace with the whitecloaks galad damodred perrin called dismounting before the pavilion faile dismounted and walked beside him i want you to promise me something before this begins and what would that be the young commander called from the opensided tent vow not to let this turn to battle perrin said i could promise that galad said but of course youd have to promise me that youre not going to run if the judgment falls against you perrin fell silent then he rested his hand upon his hammer not willing to promise it i see galad said i give you this chance because my mother has persuaded me that you should be allowed to speak in your defense but i would sooner die than allow a man who has murdered children to walk away unchallenged if you do not wish this to turn to battle perrin aybara then present your defense well either that or accept punishment faile glanced at her husband he was frowning he looked as if he wanted to speak the requested promise she laid a hand on his arm i should do it he said quietly how can any man be above the law faile i killed those men in andor when morgase was queen i should abide by her judgment and your duty to the people of your army she asked your duty to rand and to the last battle and to me perrin hesitated then nodded youre right then louder he continued lets be on with this perrin strode into the pavilion joined immediately by neald dannil and grady their presence made perrin feel like a coward the way the four stood made it obvious that they had no intention of letting perrin be taken what was a trial if perrin would not abide by its determination nothing more than a sham the whitecloaks watched tensely their officers standing in the shade of the pavilion their army at parade rest they looked as if they had no intention of standing down during the proceedings perrins own forces larger but less orderlyresponded by standing at the ready opposite the whitecloaks perrin nodded and rowan hum moved off to make certain galad had released the captives perrin walked to the front of the pavilion stopping just before morgases elevated seat faile stayed by his side there were chairs for him here and he sat several steps to his left was morgases stand to his right the people sat to watch the trial his back was toward his army failesmelling warysat next to him others filed in berelain and alliandre sat with their guards near him the aes sedai and wise ones stood at the back refusing seats the last few seats were taken by a few of the two rivers men and some of the senior former refugees the whitecloak officers sat down opposite them facing faile and perrin bornhald and byar at the front there were about thirty chairs likely taken from perrins supplies that the whitecloaks had appropriated perrin morgase said from her seat are you certain you want to go through with this i am he said very well she said her face impassive though she smelled hesitant a formally begin this trial the accused is perrin aybara known as perrin goldeneyes she hesitated lord of the two rivers she added galad you will present the charges there are three galad said standing the first two are the unlawful murder of child lathin and the unlawful murder of child yamwick aybara is also accused of being a darkfriend and of bringing trollocs into the two rivers there were angry murmurs from the two rivers men at that ast charge those trollocs had killed perrins own family galad continued the last charge cannot be substantiated yet as my men were forced out of the two rivers before they could gather proof as to the first two charges aybara has already admitted his guilt is this so lord aybara morgase asked i killed those men sure enough perrin said but it wasnt murder then this is what the court will determine morgase said formally and this is the dispute morgase seemed a completely different person from maighdin was this how people expected perrin to act when they came to him for judgment he had to admit she did lend the proceedings a measure of needed formality after all the trial was happening in a tent on a field with the judges chair elevated by what appeared to be a small stack of boxes with a rug thrown over them galad morgase said your men may tell their side of the story galad nodded to byar he stood and another whitecloaka young man with a completely bald headstepped forward to join him bornhald remained seated your grace byar said it happened about two years ago during the spring an unnaturally cold spring i remember we were on our way back from important business at the command of the lord captain commander and we were passing through the wilderness of central andor we were going to camp for the night at an abandoned ogier stedding at the base of what was once an enormous statue the kind of place you assume will be safe perrin remembered that night a chill east wind blowing across him ruffling his cloak as he stood by a pool of fresh water he remembered the sun dying silently in the west he remembered staring at the pool in the waning light watching the wind ruffle its surface holding the axe in his hands that blasted axe he should have thrown it away right then elyas had persuaded him to keep it when we arrived byar continued we found that the campsite had been used recently that concerned us few people knew of the stedding we determined from the single firepit that there were not many of these mysterious wayfarers his voice was precise his description methodical that wasnt how perrin remembered the night no he remembered the hiss of the flames sparks fluttering angrily into the air as elyas dumped the teapots contents int to firepit he remembered a hasty sending from the wolves flooding his mind confusing him the wolves wariness had made it hard to separate himself from them he remembered the smell of fear on egwene the way he fumbled with belas saddle as he cinched it and he remembered hundreds of men who smelled wrong like the whitecloaks in the pavilion they smelled like sick wolves who snapped at anything that got too close the lord captain was worried byar continued he was obviously not mentioning the captains name perhaps to spare bornhald the young whitecloak captain sat perfectly still staring at byar as if he didnt trust himself to look at perrin he thought that maybe the camp had been used by brigands who else would douse their fire and vanish the moment someone else approached thats when we saw the first wolf hiding breath coming in quick short gasps egwene huddled beside him in the dark the scent of campfire smoke rising from her clothing and from his bela breathing in the darkness the sheltering confines of an enormous stone hand the hand of artur hawkwings statue which had broken free long before dapple angry and worried images of men in white with flaming torches wind darting between the trees the lord captain thought the wolves were a bad sign everyone knows they serve the dark one he sent us to scout my team searched to the east looking through the rock formations and shards of the enormous broken statue pain men shouting perrin will you dance with me at sunday if were home by then the wolves started to attack us byar said voice growing hard it was obvious that they were no ordinary creatures there was too much coordination to their assaults there seemed to be dozens of them moving through the shadows there were men among them striking and killing our mounts perrin had watched it with two sets of eyes his own from the vantage of the hand and the eyes of the wolves who only wanted to be left alone they had been wounded earlier by an enormous flock of ravens theyd tried to drive the men away scare them so much fear both the fear of the men and the fear of the wolves it had ruled that night controlling both sides he could remember fighting to remain himself bewildered by the sendings that night stretched long byar said voice growing softer yet full of anger we passed a hillside with a massive flat rock at the top and chid lathin said he thought he saw something in the shadows there we stopped holding forward our lights and saw the legs of a horse beneath the overhang i gave lathin a nod and he stepped forward to order whoever was in there down to identify themselves well that manaybaracame out of the darkness with a young woman he was carrying a wicked axe and he walked calmly right up to lathin ignoring the lance pointed at his chest and then and then the wolves took over it was the first time it had happened to perrin their sendings had been so strong that perrin had lost himself he could remember crushing lathins neck with his teeth the warm blood bursting into his mouth as if hed bitten into a fruit that memory had been hoppers but perrin couldnt separate himself from the wolf for the moments of that fight and then morgase prompted and then there was a fight byar said wolves leaped from the shadow and aybara attacked us he didnt move like a man but like a beast growling we subdued him and killed one of the wolves but not before aybara had managed to kill two of the children byar sat down morgase asked no questions she turned to the other whitecloak who had stood with byar i have little to lend the man said i was there and i remember it exactly the same way i want to point out that when we took aybara into custody he was already judged guilty we were going to that judgment is of no concern to this trial morgase said coldly well then allow my voice to be the testimony of a second witness i saw it all too the bald whitecloak sat down morgase turned to perrin you may speak perrin stood up slowly those two spoke truly morgase thats about how it happened about morgase asked hes nearly right your guilt or innocence hangs on his nearly lord aybara it is the measure by which you will be judged perrin nodded that it does tell me something your grace when you judge someone like this do you try to understand their different pieces she frowned what my master the man who trained me as a blacksmith taught me an important lesson to create something you have to understand it and to understand something you have to know what it is made of a cool breeze blew through the pavilion ruffling cloaks that matched the quiet sounds from the plains outsidemen shifting in armor and horses stamping coughs and ocasional whispers as his words were passed through the ranks ive come to see something lately perrin said men are made up of a lot of different pieces who they are depends on what situation you put them in i had a hand in killing those two men but to understand you have to see the pieces of me he met galads eyes the young whitecloak captain stood with a straight back hands clasped behind his back perrin wished he could catch the mans scent perrin turned back to morgase i can speak with wolves i hear their voices in my mind i know that sounds like the admission of a madman but i suspect that many in my camp who hear it wont be surprised given time i could prove it to you with the cooperation of some local wolves that wont be necessary morgase said she smelled of fear the whispers from the armies grew louder he caught failes scent worry this thing i can do perrin said its a piece of me just as forging iron is just as leading men is if youre going to pass judgment on me because of it you should understand it you dig your own grave aybara bornhald said rising and pointing our lord captain commander said he could not prove you were a darkfriend and yet here you make the case for us this doesnt make me a darkfriend perrin said the purpose of this court morgase said firmly is not to judge that allegation we will determine aybaras culpability for the deaths of those two men and nothing else you may sit child bornhald bornhald sat angrily i have yet to hear your defense lord aybara morgase said the reason i told you what i amwhat i dois to show you that the wolves were my friends he took a deep breath that night in andor it was terrible as byar said we were scared all of us the whitecloaks were scared of the wolves the wolves were scared of the fire and the threatening motions the men made and i was plain scared of the world around me id never been out of the two rivers before and didnt understand why i heard wolves in my head well none of that is an excuse and i dont mean it to be one i killed those men but they attacked my friends when the men went hunting for wolf pelts the wolves fought back he stopped they needed the whole truth to be honest your grace i wasnt in control of myself i was ready to surrender but with the wolves in my head i felt their pain then the whitecloaks killed a dear friend of mine and i had to fight id do the same thing to protect a farmer being harassed by soldiers youre a creature of the shadow bornhald said rising again your lies insult the dead perrin turned toward the man holding his eyes the tent fell silent and perrin could smell the tension hanging in the air have you never realized that some men are different from you bornhald perrin asked have you ever tried to think what it must be like to be someone else if you could see through these golden eyes of mine youd find the world a different place bornhald opened his mouth as if to spit out another insult but licked his lips as if they had grown dry you murdered my father he finally said the horn of valere had been blown perrin said the dragon reborn fought ishamael in the sky artur hawkwings armies had returned to these shores to dominate yes i was in falme i rode to battle alongside the heroes of the horn alongside hawkwing himself fighting against the seanchan i fought on the same side as your father bornhald ive said that he was a good man and he was he charged bravely he died bravely the audience was so still they seemed statues not a one moved bornhald opened his mouth to object again but then closed it i swear to you perrin said under the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth that i did not kill your father nor had i anything to do with his death bornhald searched perrins eyes and looked troubled dont listen to him dain byar said the scent of him was strong stronger than any other in the pavilion frenzied like rotten meat he did kill your father galad still stood watching the exchange ive never understood how you know this child byar what did you see perhaps this should be the trial we hold it is not what i saw lord captain byar said but what i know how else can you explain how he survived yet the legion did not your father was a valiant warrior bornhald he would never have fallen to the seanchan thats foolishness galad said the seanchan have beaten us over and over again even a good man can fall in battle i saw goldeneyes there byar said gesturing toward perrin fighting alongside ghostly apparitions creatures of evil the heroes of the horn byar perrin said couldnt you see that we where fighting alongside the whitecloaks you seemed to be byar said wildly just as you seemed to be defending the people in the two rivers but i saw through you shadowspawn i saw through you the moment i met you is that why you told me to escape perrin said softly when i was confined in the elder lord bornhalds tent following my capture you gave me a sharp rock to cut my bonds and told me that if i ran nobody would chase me byar froze he seemed to have forgotten that until this moment you wanted me to try to get away perrin said so that you could kill me you wanted egwene and me dead very badly is this true child byar galad asked byar stumbled of course of course not i suddenly he spun and turned to morgase atop her simple throne of judgment this trial is not about me but him you have heard both sides what is your answer judge woman you should not speak to my mother so galad said quietly his face was impassive but perrin smelled danger on him bornhald looking very troubled had sat back down and was holding his head with his hand no it is all right morgase said he is right this trial is about perrin aybara she turned from byar to regard perrin he looked back calmly she smelled as if she were curious about something lord aybara do you feel you have spoken adequately for yourself i was protecting myself and my friends perrin said the whitecloaks had no authority to do as they did ordering us out threatening us you know their reputation as well as any i suspect we had good reason to be wary of them and disobey their orders it wasnt murder i was just defending myself morgase nodded i will make my decision then what of having others speak for perrin faile demanded standing that wont be needed lady faile morgase said so far as i can tell the only other person we could interview would be egwene alvere which doesnt seem within the reasonable bounds of this trial but it is enough morgase interrupted voice growing cold we could have a dozen children name him darkfriend and two dozen of his followers laud his virtues neither would serve this trial we are speaking of specific events on a specific day faile fell silent though she smelled furious she took perrins arm not sitting back down perrin felt regretful he had presented the truth but he wasnt satisfied he hadnt wanted to kill those whitecioaks but he had and hed done it in a frenzy without control he could blame the wolves he could blame the whitecioaks but the honest truth was that he had lost control when hed awoken hed barely remembered what he had done you know my answer perrin morgase said i can see it in your eyes do what you must perrin said perrin aybara i pronounce you guilty no faile screamed how dare you he took you in perrin put a hand on her shoulder shed been reaching for her sleeve by reflex aiming for the knives there this has nothing to do with how i personally feel about perrin morgase said this is a trial by andoran law well the law is very clear perrin may feel that the wolves were his friends but the law states that a mans hound or livestock is worth a certain price slaying them is unlawful but killing a man in retribution is even more so i can quote the very statutes to you if you wish the pavilion was silent neald had risen halfway from his chair but perrin met his eyes and shook his head the aes sedai and wise ones wore faces that betrayed nothing berelain looked resigned and sunhaired alliandre had one hand to her mouth dannil and azi althone moved up to perrin and faile and perrin did not force them to back down what does this matter byar demanded hes not going to abide by the judgment other whitecioaks stood and this time perrin couldnt stare down all those on his side who did likewise i have not passed sentence yet morgase said voice crisp what other sentence could there be byar asked you said hes guilty yes morgase said though i believe there are further circumstances relevant to the sentencing her face was still hard and she smelled determined what was she doing the whitecioaks were an unauthorized military group within the confines of my realm morgase said by this light while i do rule perrin guilty of killing your men i rule the incident subject to the kainec protocol is that the law that governs mercenaries galad asked indeed what is this perrin asked galad turned to him she has ruled that our altercation was a brawl between unemployed mercenary groups essentially the ruling states there were no innocents in the clashyou are not therefore charged with murder instead you have killed illegally theres a difference dannil asked frowning one of semantics galad said hands still clasped behind his back perrin caught his scent it was curious yes this is a good ruling mother but the punishment is still death i believe it can be morgase said the code is much more lenient depending on the circumstances then what do you rule perrin asked i do not morgase said galad you are the one responsible for the men killed or the closest we have i will pass sentencing on to you i have given the ruling and the legal definitions you decide the punishment galad and perrin locked eyes across the pavilion i see galad said a strange choice your grace aybara it must be asked again will you abide by the decisions of this trial that you yourself suggested or must this be settled with conflict faile tensed at his side perrin could hear his army moving behind him men loosening swords in their sheaths muttering the word passed through them as a low hum lord perrin named guilty theyre going to try to take him we wont let it happen will we the bitter scents of fear and anger mixed in the pavilion both sides glowering at one another above it all perrin could smell that wrongness to the air can continue to run he thought hounded by that day there were no coincidences with taveren why had the pattern brought him here to confront these nightmares from his past i will abide by it damodred perrin said what faile gasped but perrin said raising a finger only so long as you promise to delay execution of this punishment until after i have done my duty at the last battle youll accept judgment after the last battle bornhald asked sounding befuddled after what may be the end of the world itself after youve had time to escape perhaps betray us what kind of promise is that the only kind i can make perrin said i dont know what the future will bring or if well reach it but were fighting for survival maybe the world itself before that all other concerns are secondary this is the only way i could submot way can submit how do we know youll keep your word galad asked my men name you shadowspawn i came here didnt i perrin asked because we had your people captive and would shadowspawn give one hairs worry about that perrin asked galad hesitated i swear it perrin said by the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth by my love of faile and on the name of my father youll have your chance galad damodred if you and i both survive until the end of this ill submit to your authority galad studied him then nodded very well no byar cried this is foolishness we leave child byar galad said walking to the side of the pavilion my decision has been made mother will you attend me im sorry galad morgase said but no aybara is making his wayback to andor and i must go with him very well galad continued on wait perrin called you didnt tell me what my punishment will be once i submit no galad said still walking i didnt chapter the right thing you understand what you are to do egwene asked walking toward her rooms in the white tower siuan nodded if they do appear egwene said you will not let yourself be drawn into a fight were not children mother siuan said dryly no youre aes sedainearly as bad at following directions siuan gave her a flat look and egwene regretted her words they had been uncalledfor she was on edge she calmed herself she had tried several forms of bait to lure mesaana out but so far there hadnt been any nibbles egwene swore she could almost feel the woman watching her in telaranrhiod yukiri and her group were at a standstill her best hope was the meeting tonight it had to draw her egwene didnt have any time leftthe monarchs shed persuaded were already beginning to move and rands forces were gathering tonight it must happen tonight go egwene said speak with the others i dont want there to be any foolish mistakes yes mother siuan grumbled turning away and siuan egwene called after her the former amyrlin hesitated see to your safety tonight egwene said i would not lose you siuan often gave such concern a crusty reply but tonight she smiled egwene shook her head and hurried on to her rooms where she found silviana waiting gawyn egwene asked there has been no news of him silviana replied i sent a messenger for him this afternoon but the messenger hasnt returned i suspect that gawyn is delaying his reply to be difficult hes nothing if not stubborn egwene said she felt exposed without him that was surprising since shed pointedly ordered him to stay away from her door now she worried about him not being there double my guard and make certain to have soldiers posted nearby if my wards go off they will raise a clatter yes mother silviana said and send gawyn another messenger she said one with a more politely worded letter ask him to return dont order him knowing silvianas opinion of gawyn egwene was sure the original letter had been brusque with that egwene took a deep breath then went into her rooms checked on her wards and prepared to go to sleep shouldnt feel so exhausted perrin thought as he climbed down from stepper i didnt do anything but talk the trial weighed on him it seemed to weigh upon the entire army perrin looked at them as they rode back into camp morgase was there off on her own faile had watched her the whole way back smelling of anger but not speaking a word alliandre and berelain had kept their distance morgase had condemned him but in truth he didnt much care he had deflected the whitecloaks now he needed to lead his people to safety morgase rode through camp seeking out lini and master gill theyd arrived safely together with all the other captives as galad damodred had promised surprisingly hed sent the supplies and carts with them the trial was a victory then perrins men didnt seem to see it that way the soldiers split into groups as they slunk back into camp there was little talking beside perrin gaul shook his head two silver points whats that perrin asked handing stepper to a groom a saying gaul said glancing up at the sky two silver points twice we have ridden to battle and found no foe once more and we lose honor better to find no foe gaul perrin said better no blood be shed gaul laughed i do not say i wish to end the dream perrin aybara but look at your men they can feel what i say you should not dance the spears without purpose but neither should you too often demand that men prepare themselves to kill then give them nobody to fight ill do it as often as i like perrin said gruffly if it means avoiding a battle i a horses hooves thumped the ground and the wind brought him failes scent as he turned to face her a battle avoided indeed perrin aybara gaul said and another invited may you find water and shade he trotted away as faile dismounted perrin took a deep breath all right husband she said striding up to him you will explain to me just what you thought you were doing you let him pass judgment on you you promised to deliver yourself to him i wasnt under the impression that id married a fool im no fool woman he roared back you keep telling me i need to lead well today i took your advice you took it and made the wrong decision there was no right decision you could have let us fight them they intend to fight at the last battle perrin said every whitecloak we killed would be one less man to face the dark one me my men the whitecloaksnone of us matter compared to what is coming they had to live and so did we and this was the only way light but it felt wrong to yell at her yet it actually softened her temper remarkably the soldiers nearby him started to nod as if they hadnt been able to see the truth until hed bellowed it out i want you to take command of the retreat perrin said to faile the trap hasnt sprung yet but i find myself itching more each minute somethings watching us they have taken away our gateways and they intend to see us dead they now know we wont fight the whitecloaks which means theyll attack soon maybe this evening if were lucky theyll delay until tomorrow morning we arent done with this argument she warned whats done is done faile look forward very well she still smelled angry those beautiful dark eyes of hers fierce but she contained it im going to the wolf dream perrin said glancing toward the edge of camp where their tent lay ill either destroy that dome or ill find a way to force slayer to tell me how to make traveling work again get the people ready to march and have the ashaman try to make a gateway on every count of a hundred the moment it works get our people out of here where faile asked jehannah perrin shook his head too close the enemy might be watching ther andor take them to caemlyn actually no whitebridge lets stay away from anywhere they might expect besides i dont want to show up with an army on elaynes doorstep until ive warned her a good plan faile said if you fear attack we should move the carnp followers first rather than moving the armies through and leaving us undefended perrin nodded but get them moving as soon as the gateways work again and if you dont succeed faile had begun to sound determined frightened but determined if i havent restored gateways in one hour start them marching toward the perimeter where neald discovered that he can make gateways i dont think that will work i think slayer will just move the dome always keeping us underneath it but its something faile nodded but her scent became hesitant that will also put us marching rather than in camp much easier to ambush that way i know perrin said that is why i must not fail she took him into her arms head against his chest she smelled so wonderful like faile that was the definition of wonderful to him youve said hes stronger than you are she whispered he is can i do anything to help you face him she asked softly if you watch over them while im gone that will help what happens if he kills you while youre there perrin didnt reply theres no other way she asked he pulled back from her faile im fairly certain that hes lord luc they smell different but theres something similar about them too and when i wounded slayer in the wolf dream before luc bore the wound is that supposed to help me feel better she asked grimacing its all coming back around we finish with maiden and find ourselves within a stones toss of the remnants of the whitecloaks byar and bornhald with them slayer appears in the wolf dream again that man i told you of noam the one who was in the cage do you remember where i found him you said you were chasing rand through ghealdan perrin said it happened not one weeks ride from here an odd coincidence but no coincidences faile not with me im here for a reason hes here for a reason i must face this she nodded he turned to walk toward their tent her hand slipping free of his the wise ones had given him a tea that would let him sleep so he could enter the wolf dream it was time how could you let him go byar said knuckles clenched on the pommel of his sword white cloak flapping behind him he bornhald and galad walked through the middle of their camp i did what was right galad said letting him go free was not right byar said you cant believe child byar galad said softly i find your attitude increasingly insubordinate that troubles me it should trouble you as well byar closed his mouth and said no more though galad could see that it was difficult for him to hold his tongue behind byar bornhald walked silently looking very upset i believe that aybara will keep his oath galad said and if he does not i now have the legal grounds to hunt him and exact punishment it is not ideal but there was wisdom to his words i do believe the last battle is coming and if so it is time to unite against the shadow my lord captain commander byar said managing his tone with all respect that man is of the shadow he will not be fighting beside us but against us if that is true galad said we will still have a chance to face him on the field of battle i have made my decision child byar harnesh strode up to join them and saluted galad nodded child harnesh strike camp my lord captain commander this late in the day yes galad said we will march into the night and put some distance between us and aybara just in case leave scouts make certain he doesnt try to follow us well make for lugard we can recruit and resupply then continue on toward andor yes my lord captain commander harnesh said galad turned to byar as harnesh left the skeletal man gave a salute sunken eyes dangerously resentful then stalked off galad stopped on the field between white tents hands behind his back as he watched messengers relay his orders through camp you are quiet child bornhald galad said after a few moments ate you as displeased with my actions as child byar is i dont know bornhald said ive believed for so long that aybara killed my father and yet seeing how jaret acts remembering his description there is no evidence it frustrates me to admit it galad but i have no proof he did kill lathin and yamwick however he killed children so he is a darkfriend i killed one of the children too galad said and was named darkfriend for it that was different something seemed to be troubling bornhald something he wasnt saying well that is true galad said i do not disagree that aybara should be punished but the days events leave me strangely troubled he shook his head finding answers should be easy the right thing always came to him however whenever he thought hed seized upon the right course of action regarding aybara he found distasteful worries cropping up inside of him life is not so easy as the toss of a coin his mother had said one side or the other your simple illusions he did not like the feeling not at all perrin inhaled deeply flowers bloomed in the wolf dream even as the sky raged silver black and gold the scents were so incongruous baking cherry pie horse dung oil and grease soap a wood fire arrath thyme catfern a hundred other herbs he couldnt name very few of them fit the meadow where he had appeared hed made certain not to appear where his camp was in the wolf dream that would have put him too near slayer the scents were fleeting vanishing too quickly as if theyd never really been there hopper he sent am here young bull the wolf appeared beside him it smells strange scents blend hopper sent like the waters of a thousand streams it is not natural it is not good this place begins to break perrin nodded he shifted appearing knee deep in brown cockleburrs just outside of the violet dome hopper appeared to his right weeds crackling as he moved among them the dome rose ominous and unnatural a wind blew shuffling the weeds and shaking tree limbs lightning flashed silently in the sky he is there hopper sent always perrin nodded did slayer come to the wolf dream the way perrin did and did spending time in it leave him still tired as it did perrin the man never seemed to leave this area he was guarding something there had to be a way in the wolf dream to disable the dome young bull we come the sending was from oak dancer her pack was approaching now only three strong sparks boundless oak dancer herself they had chosen to come here rather than join the wolves running northward the three appeared behind hopper perrin looked to them and sent concern this will be dangerous wolves may die their sending back was insistent slayer must fall for what he has done together we are strong young bull should not hunt such dangerous prey alone he nodded in agreement letting his hammer appear in his hand together they approached the dome perrin walked into it with a slow determined stride he refused to feel weakness he was strong the dome was nothing but air he believed the world to be as he wished it he stumbled but pulled through into the inside of the dome the landscape felt faintly darker here elder trees more dim of bark the dying dogfennel a deeper green or brown hopper and the pack moved through the dome around him we make for the center perrin sent if there is a secret to discover it will probably be there they moved slowly through the brush and stands of trees perrin imposed his will upon the area around him and the leaves stopped crackling weeds remaining silent when he brushed against them that was natural it was the way things should be so it was it would be a long distance to the center so perrin began hopping forward not jumps or steps he simply stopped being in one place appearing in a different location he masked his scent though slayer was not a wolf that has to become my advantage perrin thought as they grew closer and closer to the center he is more experienced than i but i have the wolf within me this place is our dream he is the invader however skilled he may be he is not one of us and that is why i will win perrin smelled something an increasing wrongness in the air he and the wolves crept up to a large hillside then peered around a cleft in the land there a small stand of elder trees stood just ahead perhaps fifty paces away looking up he judged this to be very near the center of the dome using the shifting way of wolves theyd traveled several hours worth of walking in a few minutes that is it perrin sent he looked at hopper the wolfs scent was masked but he was coming to know wolves well enough to read concern in hoppers stare and the way he stood with forelegs bent just a fraction something changed perrin heard nothing he smelled nothing but he felt something a small tremble in the ground go he sent vanishing he appeared ten paces away to see an arrow hit the hillside where hed been standing the shaft split a large stone embedding itself in the rock and earth up to its black fletching slayer stood from a crouch turning to look at perrin across the short expanse of ground his eyes seemed black his square face shadowed his tall body muscular and dangerous as he often did he wore a smile really a sneer he wore leather breeches and a shirt of deep green forearms exposed hand holding his wicked bow of dark wood he wore no quiver he created arrows as he needed them perrin held his eyes stepping forward as if in challenge that was enough of a distraction for the wolves to attack from behind slayer yelled spinning as boundless slammed into him perrin was there in an eyeblink bringing his hammer down slayer vanished and perrin struck only earth but he caught a whiff of where slayer had gone here that scent was of the same place that perrin was alarmed he looked up to see slayer hovering in the air just above drawing an arrow the wind perrin thought it is so strong the arrow loosed but a sudden gust blew it sideways it sank into the earth just beside perrin he did not flinch raising his hands his own bow appearing in them already drawn arrow in place slayers eyes opened wider as perrin loosed slayer vanished appearing on the ground a short distance awayand hopper leaped on him from above pulling him to the ground slayer cursed with a guttural sound then vanished here hopper sent showing a hillside perrin was there in an instant hammer in his hands the pack with him slayer raised a sword in one hand and a knife in the other as perrin and the four wolves attacked perrin hit first swinging his hammer with a roar slayer actually sank into the ground as if it were liquid dropping beneath the axe blow he rammed his knife forwardpiercing oak dancers breast with a splash of scarlet blood as he swung to the side slashing across sparks face oak dancer didnt get time to howl she collapsed to the ground and slayer vanished as perrin brought his hammer back around whimpering sparks sent agony and panic and vanished he would live but oak dancer was dead slayers scent had been this place again perrin turned to smash his hammer into slayers sword as it sought to pierce him from behind again a look of surprise from slayer the man bared his teeth pulling back keeping a wary eye on the two remaining wolves hopper and boundless slayers forearm was bleeding where hopper had bitten him how is the dome created luc perrin said show me and leave i will let you depart bold words cub slayer snarled back for one who just watched me kill one of your pack boundless howled in anger leaping forward perrin attacked at the same time but the ground beneath them trembled shaking no perrin thought his own footing became firm as boundless was knocked to the ground slayer lunged and penin raised his hammer to blockbut slayers weapon turned into smoke and passed right through it solidifying on the other side with a yelp perrin tried to pull back but the blade scored him across the chest cutting through his shirt and leaving a gash from one arm to the other it flared with pain perrin gasped stumbling backward slayer drove forward but something crashed into him from above hopper once again the grizzled wolf bore slayer to the ground growling fangs flashing slayer cursed and kicked the wolf free hopper went flying with a whimper of pain tossed some twenty feet to the side boundless had caused the earth to stop rumbling but had hurt his paw perrin shook himself free of his pain slayer was strong in control over this world perrins hammer felt sluggish whenever he swung as if the air itself were thicker slayer had smiled when hed killed oak dancer perrin moved forward enraged slayer was on his het and retreating back down the hillside toward the trees perrin chased after him ignoring his wound it wasnt bad enough to stop him though he did imagine a bandage in place on it his clothing mended and tight against his chest to stanch the blood he entered the trees just behind slayer the branches closed overhead and vines whipped from the darkened shadows perrin didnt bother fighting them off vines didnt move like that they couldnt touch him sure enough as soon as they grew close they withered and fell still slayer cursed then began to move in bursting steps leaving a blur behind him perrin followed enhancing his own speed perrin didnt consciously make the decision to drop to four legs but in a heartbeat he had done so chasing after slayer as hed hunted the white stag slayer was fast but he was merely a man young bull was part of the land itself the trees the brush the stones the rivers he moved through the forest like a breeze blowing through a hollow keeping pace with slayer gaining on him each log in slayers way was an obstruction but to young bull each was just a part of the pathway young bull leaped to the side paws against the tree trunks pushing him when he turned he soared over stones and rocks leaping from one to the next leaving a blur in the air behind him slayer smelled afraid for the first time he vanished but young bull followed appearing in the field where the army camped beneath the shadow of the large stone sword slayer looked over his shoulder and cursed vanishing again young bull followed the place where the whitecloaks had made camp the top of a small plateau a cavern burrowed into a hillside the middle of a small lake young bull ran upon the surface with ease each place slayer went he followed each moment growing closer there was no time for swords hammers or bows this was a chase and young bull was the hunter this time hehe leaped into the middle of a field and slayer wasnt there he smelled where the man had gone however he followed him and appeared in another place on the same field there were scents of places all around what perrin came to a stop booted feet grinding into the ground he spun bewildered slayer must have hopped quickly through several different places in the same field confusing his trail perrin tried to determine which one to follow but they all faded and intermixed burn him he said young bull a sending came sparks the wolf had been wounded but he hadnt fled as perrin had assumed he sent an image of a thin silver rod two handspans high sprouting from the ground in the middle of a stand of dogfennel perrin smiled and sent himself there the wounded wolf still trailing blood lay beside the object it was obviously some sort of terangreal it ppeared to be made of dozens upon dozens of fine wirelike bits of metal woven together like a braid it was about two handspans long and was driven point first into the soft earth perrin pulled it from the ground the dome didnt vanish he turned the spike over in his hand but had no idea how to make the dome stop he willed the spike to change into something else a stick and was shocked when he was rebuffed the object actually seemed to push his mind away it is here in its reality sparks sent the sending tried to convey something that the item was somehow more real than most things in the dream world perrin didnt have time to wonder about it first priority was to move the dome if he could away from where his people camped he sent himself to the edge where hed entered the dome as hed hoped the center of the dome moved with him he was at the place where hed entered but the edge of the dome had changed positions the center falling wherever perrin was standing the dome still dominated the sky extending far in every direction young bull sparks sent i am free the wrongness is gone go perrin sent ill take this and get rid of it each of you go a different direction and howl confuse slayer the wolves responded a part of perrin the hunter inside of him was frustrated at not having been able to defeat slayer directly but this was more important he tried to shift to someplace distant but it didnt work it appeared that even though he was holding the terangreal he was still bound by the domes rules so instead he shifted as far as he could neald had said it was about four leagues from their camp to the perimeter so perrin shifted that far to the north then did so again and again the enormous dome moved with him its center always appearing directly over his head he would take the spike someplace safe someplace where slayer couldnt find it chapter an invitation egwene appeared in telaranrhiod wearing a pure white gown sewn with golden thread at the seams and in the embroidery tiny bits of obsidianpolished but unshapedsewn in gold along the trim of the bodice a terribly impractical dress to own but that didnt matter here she was in her chambers where shed wanted to appear she sent herself to the hallway outside the yellow ajahs quarters nynaeve was there arms folded her dress a far more sensible tan and brown i want you to be very careful egwene said youre the only one here who has faced one of the forsaken directly and you also have more experience with telaranrhiod than the others if mesaana arrives you are to lead the attack i think i can manage that nynaeve said the corners of her mouth rising yes she could manage it holding nynaeve back from attacking that would have been the difficult task egwene nodded and nynaeve vanished shed remain hidden near the hall of the tower watching for mesaana or black sisters coming to spy on the decoy meeting happening there egwene sent herself to another place in the city a hall where the true meeting would take place between herself the wise ones and the windfinders tar valon had several meeting halls used for musical performances or for gatherings this one known as the musicians way was perfect for her needs it was precisely decorated with leatherleaf wood paneling carved to look like a forest of trees lining the walls the chairs were of a matching wood sung by ogier each one a thing of beauty they were arranged in the round facing a central podium the domed ceiling was inset with marble carved to look like stars in the sky the ornamentation was remarkable beautiful without being gaudy the wise ones had already arrivedamys bair and melaine whose belly was great with the later stages of pregnancy this amphitheater had a raised platform along one side where the wise ones could sit comfortably on the floor yet those seated in the chairs would not look down at them leane yukiri and seaine sat in chairs facing the wise ones each wearing one of elaynes copied dream terangreal looking shadowy and insubstantial elayne was supposed to be there too but she had warned she might have trouble channeling enough to enter telaranrhiod the aes sedai and wise ones inspected one another with a nearly palpable air of hostility the aes sedai considered the wise ones to be poorly trained wilders the wise ones in turn thought the aes sedai full of themselves as egwene arrived a group of women with dark skin and black hair appeared in the very center of the room the windhnders glanced about suspiciously siuan had said from her time teaching them that the sea folk had legends about telaranrhiod and its dangers that hadnt stopped the windhnders from learning everything they could about the world of dreams the moment they discovered that it was real at the head of the windhnders was a tall slender woman with narrow eyes and a long neck numerous medallions on the fine chain connecting her nose to her left ear that would be shielyn one of those nynaeve had told egwene about the three other windfinders included a dignified woman with white locks of hair woven among her black that would be renaile according to the letters theyd sent and nynaeves instruction egwene had been led to believe shed be foremost among them but she seemed subservient to the others had she lost her place as windfinder to the mistress of the ships welcome egwene said to them please sit we will stand shielyn said her voice was tense who are these ones egwene alvere amys asked children should not be visiting telaranrhiod it is not an abandoned sandbadgers den to be explored children shielyn asked you are children here wetlander amys please egwene cut in i lent them terangreal to come here it was necessary we could have met outside the world of dreams bair said choosing the middle of a battlefield might have been safer indeed the windfinders were very unfamiliar with the workings of telaranrhiod their bright clothing periodically changed colorsin fact as egwene watched renailes blouse vanished entirely egwene found herself blushing though elayne had mentioned that when on the waves sea folk men and women both worked wearing not a stitch above the waist the blouse was back a moment later their jewelry also seemed in almost constant flux there are reasons i have done what i have done amys egwene said striding forward and seating herself shielyn din sabura night waters and her sisters have been told of the dangers of this place and have accepted responsibility for their own safety a little like giving a firebrand and a cask of oil to a child melaine muttered and claiming youve given him responsibility for his own safety must we endure this squabbling mother yukiri asked egwene took a calming breath please you are leaders of your separate peoples women with reputations for great wisdom and acuity can we not at least be civil with one another egwene turned to the sea folk windfinder shielyn you have accepted my invitation surely you will now not reject my hospitality by standing through the entire meeting the woman hesitated she had a proud air to her recent interaction between the aes sedai and the sea folk had made her bold egwene shoved down a stab of anger she did not like the details of the bargain regarding the bowl of winds nynaeve and elayne should have known better theyno elayne and nynaeve had done their best and had been under unusual strain besides bargaining with the sea folk was said to be only one step safer than bargaining with the dark one himself shielyn finally gave a curt nod though her blouse changed colors several times while she considered settling on crimson and her jewelry kept vanishing and reappearing very well we are indebted to you for the gift of this place and will agree to your hospitality she sat down in a chair apart from egwene and the other aes sedai and those with her did as well egwene released a soft breath of relief and summoned several small tables with cups of warm fragrant tea the windfinders jumped though the wise ones didnt bat an eye amys did however reach for her cup and change the roseblossom tea to something with a much darker cast perhaps you will tell us the purpose of this meeting bair said sipping her tea the sea folk did not pick up theirs though the aes sedai did began to drink we have guessed it already shielyn said this confrontation is inevitable though i wish to the winds that it were not so well speak up then yukiri said what is it about shielyn focused on egwene for many seasons and tides we hid the nature of our windfmding from the aes sedai the white tower inhales but does not exhalethat which is brought in is never allowed to leave now that you know of us you want us for you cannot stand the thought of women channeling outside of your grasp the aes sedai frowned egwene caught melaine nodding in agreement the words were true enough though only one side of the issue if theyd known how useful white tower training would be and how important it was for the people to know that channelers were being cared for and trained however that thinking felt hollow to her the sea folk had their own traditions and made fine use of their channelers without regulation from the white tower egwene hadnt spent as much time with the sea folk as nynaeve or elayne but shed had detailed reports the windfinders were unskilled with many weaves but their abilities with specific weaves particularly those focusing on airwere far more advanced than those practiced by aes sedai these women deserved the truth was that not what the white tower and the three oaths stood for you are correct shielyn din sabura night waters egwene said and your people may have been wise to keep their abilities hidden from the aes sedai yukiri gasped a quite unaes sedai reaction shielyn froze chain from her ear to nose tinkling softly as the medallions on it hit together her blouse changed to blue what you may have been wise egwene said i would not presume to secondguess the amyrlins who came before me but there is an argument to be made perhaps we have been overly zealous to control women who can wield the one power it is obvious that the windfinders have done well in training themselves i should think that the white tower could learn much from you shielyn settled back scanning egwenes face egwene met the womans eyes and kept her expression calm see that i am resolute she thought see that i mean what i say that is not flattery i am aes sedai speak the truth well shielyn said perhaps we could make a bargain that would allow us to train your women egwene smiled i was hoping that you would see the advantage that to the side the three other aes sedai regarded egwene with measured hostility well they would see the best way to gain the upper hand was to shake expectations like rindwater beetles in a jar and yet egwene said you acknowledge that there are things the white tower knows that you do not otherwise you would not have striven to bargain for our women to train your windflnders we will not rescind that agreement shielyn said quickly her blouse turned pale yellow oh i expect nothing of the sort egwene said it is well that you now have aes sedai teachers those who bargained with you achieved something unexpected true words every one however the way she said them implied something morethat egwene had wanted the aes sedai to be sent to the sea folk ships shielyns frown deepened and she sat back in her chair egwene hoped she was considering whether her peoples grand victory over the bowl of the winds had been a setup from the start if anything egwene continued i feel that the previous agreement was not ambitious enough she turned to the wise ones amys would you agree that the aes sedai have knowledge of weaves that the wise ones do not it would be foolish not to admit aes sedai expertise in these areas amys said carefully they spend much time practicing their weaves but there are things we know that they do not yes egwene said during my time training beneath the wise ones i learned more about leadership than i did during my time in the white tower you also gave me very helpful training in telaranrhiod and dreaming all right bair said out with it weve been chasing a threelegged lizard this entire conversation poking it with a stick to see if it will move any further we need to share what we know with one another egwene said we three groupswomen who can channelneed to form an alliance with the white tower in control i assume shielyn said all i am saying egwene replied is that there is wisdom in sharing and learning from others wise ones i would have accepted from the white tower be sent to train with you it would be particularly useful to have you train them to master telaranrhiod it was unlikely that another dreamer such as egwene would be discovered among the aes sedai though she could hope the talent was very rare still it would be advantageous to have some sisters trained in telaranrhiod even if they did have to enter with terangreal windfinders egwene continued i would send women to you as well particularly those skilled in air to learn to call the winds as you do life for an apprentice windfinder is not easy shielyn said i think your women would find it very different from the soft life in the white tower egwenes backside still remembered the pain of her soft life in the white tower i do not doubt that it will be challenging she said but i do not doubt that it would be very helpful for that very reason well i suspect this could be arranged shielyn said leaning forward sounding eager there would have to be payment of course an equal one egwene said in allowing you to send some of your apprentices to the white tower to train with us we already send women to you egwene sniffed token sacrifices sent so we will not become suspicious of your windfinders your women often seclude themselves or come reluctantly i would have that practice stopthere is no reason to deny potential windfinders to your people well what would be the difference shielyn asked the women you send would be allowed to return to you after their training egwene said wise ones i would have aiel apprentices sent to us as well not reluctantly and not to become aes sedai but to train and learn our ways they too would be allowed to return should they desire it once they are finished it would have to be more than that amys said i worry what would happen to women who become too accustomed to soft wetlander ways surely you wouldnt want to compel them egwene began bair cut in theyd still be apprentice wise ones egwene alvere children who need to complete their training and that is assuming we agree to this plan something about it unsettles my stomach like too much food after a day of fasting if we let the aes sedai set hooks into our apprentices melaine said they will not soon be pulled free do you want them to be egwene said do you see what you have in me melaine an amyrlin seat who was trained by the aiel what sacrifice would it be worth to your people to have more like me aes sedai who understand jietoh and the threefold land who respect wise ones rather than seeing them as rivals or wilders the three aiel settled back at that looking at one another troubled and what of you shielyn egwene said what would it be worth to your people to have an amyrlin seat who having trained with you regards you as friends and who respects your ways that could be valuable shielyn admitted assuming the women you send to us have a better temperament than those whom we have seen so far i have yet to meet an aes sedai who could not benefit from a few days hanging from the high mast that is because you insisted on getting aes sedai egwene said who are set in their ways if we were to send you accepted instead they would be much more pliable instead shielyn said immediately this is not the bargain we were discussing it could be egwene replied if we allow sea folk channelers to return to you instead of requiring that they stay in the tower you will no longer have such a strong need of the aes sedai teachers this must be a different agreement shielyn shook her head and it will not be a bargain to make lightly aes sedai are serpents like those rings you wear what if i offer to include the dream terangreal you were loaned egwene asked shielyn glanced at her hand where in the real world she would be holding the small plate thatwith a channeled bit of spiritlet a woman enter telaranrhiod egwene hadnt given them the terangreal that let one enter without needing to channel of course those were more versatile and therefore more powerful best to keep those a secret in telaranrhiod egwene said leaning forward you can go anywhere you can meet those who are distant without needing to travel there can learn what is hidden and can confer in secret this is a dangerous thing you suggest egwene alvere amys said sternly to let them loose would be like letting a group of wetlander children run wild in the threefold land you cannot keep this place for yourself amys egwene said we are not so selfish the wise one said it is their safety i speak of then perhaps egwene said it would be best if the sea folk sent some of their apprentices to train with you wise onesand perhaps you could send some back to live on ships melaine said aghast what better way to conquer your fears of the water we arent afraid of it amys snapped we respect it you wetlalanders she always spoke of ships as one spoke of a caged lion regardless egwene turned back to the sea folk the terangreal could be yours should we have a bargain you already gave these to us shielyn said they were lent to you shielyn as was made very clear by the women who delivered them and you would give them to us permanently shielyn asked with none of this nonsense about all terangreal belonging to the white tower it is important that there be a rule to prevent terangreal from being kept by those who discover them egwene said that way we can remove a potentially dangerous item from a foolish merchant or farmer but i would be willing to make a formal exception for the windnnders and wise ones so the glass pillars amys said i have wondered if the aes sedai would ever try to lay claim to them i doubt that would happen egwene said but i also suspect that it would ease aiel minds if we were to proclaim it officially that those terangrealand others you possessbelong to you and that sisters cannot claim them that gave the wise ones serious thought still find this agreement odd bair said aiel training in the white tower but not becoming aes sedai it is not the way things have been the world is changing bair egwene said softly back in emonds field there was a patch of fine cultivated emonds glory flowers near a brook my father liked to walk there and loved their beauty but then when the new bridge was built people began traipsing across the patch to get to it my father tried for years to keep them off the patch small fences signs nothing worked and then he thought to build a neat path of river stones through the patch cultivating the flowers to the sides after that people stopped walking on them when change comes you can scream and try to force things to stay the same but youll usually end up getting trampled however if you can direct the changes they can serve you just as the power serves us but only after we surrender to it egwene looked at each woman in turn our three groups should have begun working together long ago the last battle is upon us and the dragon reborn threatens to free the dark one if that werent enough we have another common foeone who would see aes sedai windnnders and wise ones alike destroyed the seanchan melaine said renaile sitting at the back of the windnnders let out a soft hiss at the word her clothing changed and she was wearing armor holding a sword it was gone in a moment yes egwene said together we can be strong enough to fight them apart we must consider this bargain shielyn said egwene noticed a wind blowing through the room likely created by one of the sea folk by accident we will meet again and perhaps make a promise if we make it the terms will be this we will send you two apprentices a year and you will send two to us not your weakest egwene said i want your most promising and you will send the same shielyn said yes egwene said two was a start they would probably wish to move to larger numbers once the plan was proven effective but she would not push for that at the start and us amys said we are part of this bargain as you put it two accepted egwene said in return for two apprentices they train for a period of no less than six months but no more than two years once our women are among you they are to be considered your apprentices and must follow your rules she hesitated at the end of their training all apprentices and accepted must return to their people for at least one year after that if yours decide they want to be aes sedai they can return to be considered the same goes for women among us should they decide to join with you instead bair nodded thoughtfully perhaps there will be women like yourself who seeing our ways will know them superior it is still a shame we lost you my place was elsewhere egwene said will you accept this between us as well shielyn said to the wise ones should we agree to this bargain two for two in a similar manner if the bargain is agreed to bair said looking to the other wise ones we will make it with you as well but we must speak with the other wise ones about it and what of the terangrealt shielyn said turning back to egwene yours egwene said in exchange you will release us from out promise to send sisters to train you and we will let any sea folk currently among us return to their people all of this is subject to the approval of your people and i will have to bring this before the hall of the tower of course as amyrlin her decrees were law if the hall balked however those laws could end up being ignored in this she would need to get their supportand she wanted to particularly considering her stance that the hall should work together with her more and meet in secret less she was reasonably certain she could get approval for this proposal however the aes sedai wouldnt like giving up terangreal but they also did not like the bargain that had been made with the sea folk over the bowl of the winds to be rid of that they would give almost anything i knew you would try to end the sisters training us shielyn said sounding selfsatisfied which would you rather have egwene asked women who are among our weakest members and who see their service as a punishment or instead your own sea folk who have learned the best we can offer and return happily to share egwene had been halftempted to simply send sea folk aes sedai to them to fulfill the bargain anyway it seemed a proper twisting of the situation hopefully however this new bargain would supplant the old one she had a feeling shed lose the sea folk sisters anyway at least the ones who longed to be back with their people the world was changing and now that the windfinders were no longer a secret the old ways need not be maintained we will discuss shielyn said she nodded to the others and they vanished from the room they certainly did learn quickly this dance is a dangerous one egwene alvere amys said standing and adjusting her shawl there was a time when the aiel would have taken pride to have served the aes sedai that time has passed the women you thought you would find are nothing more than a dream amys egwene said real life is often more disappointing than dreams but at least when you find honor in the real world you know it to be more than a fancy the wise one nodded we will likely agree to this bargain we have need to learn what the aes sedai can teach we will pick our strongest women bair added those who will not be corrupted by wetlander softness there was no condemnation in those words calling wetlanders soft was not an insult in bairs mind amys nodded this work you do is a good one so long as you do not presume to tie us in steel bands no amys egwene thought i will not tie you in bands of steel ill use lace instead now bair said you still have need of us this day you indicated a battle yes egwene said or so i hope no word had come that meant nynaeve and siuan hadnt discovered anyone listening had her ploy failed the wise ones nodded to her then walked to the side conferring quietly egwene trailed over to the aes sedai yukiri stood i dont like this mother yukiri said speaking softly and eyeing the wise ones i dont think the hall will agree to this many are adamant that all objects of the one power should belong to us the hall will see reason egwene said weve already returned the bowl of winds to the sea folk and now that elayne has rediscovered the method of crafting terangreal it is only a matter of time before there are so many we cannot keep track of them all but elayne is an aes sedai mother seaine said rising face troubled surely you can keep her in line perhaps egwene said speaking softly but doesnt it strike you odd thatafter all of these yearsso many talents are returning so many discoveries being made my dreaming elaynes terangreal foretelling rare talents seem in abundance an age is ending and the world is changing i doubt that elaynes talent will remain unique what if one of the wise ones or sea folk manifest it the other three sat quietly troubled it still isnt right to give up mother yukiri finally said with effort we could bring the wise ones and windfinders under control and the ashaman egwene said softly unable to keep a hint of discomfort out of her voice will we insist that all angreal and saangreal created for men belong to us though we cannot use them what if there are ashaman who learn to create objects of power will we force them to give up everything they create to us could we enforce that i yukiri said leane shook her head shes right yukiri light but she is the world as it was cannot be ours any longer egwene said softly not wanting the wise ones to overhear was it ever the black tower bonds aes sedai the aiel no longer revere us the windfinders have hidden their best channelers from us for centuries and are becoming increasingly belligerent if we try to hold too tightly to all of this we will either become tyrants or fools depending upon how successful we are i accept neither title we will lead them yukiri we must become a source that women look to all women we achieve that by not holding too tightly by bringing their channelers to train with us and by sending our most talented accepted to become experts in the things they are best at and if they are saying the same thing right now leane asked softly looking over at the wise ones who were speaking in hushed tones on the far side of the room if they try to play us as we play them then we have to play the best egwene said all of this is secondary for now we need unity against the shadow and the seanchan we have toa frazzledlooking siuan appeared in the room her dress singed on one side mother we need you the battle has begun egwene said urgent to the side the wise ones perked up it has siuan said panting it happened right off mother they didnt come to eavesdrop they attacked perrin streaked across the land covering leagues with each step he needed to take the spike someplace away from slayer perhaps the ocean he couldan arrow hissed through the air slicing his shoulder perrin cursed and spun they were on a high rocky hillside slayer stood downhill from him bow raised to his angular face dark eyes alight with anger he released another arrow a wall perrin thought summoning a wall of bricks in front of him the arrow punched several inches into the bricks but stopped perrin immediately sent himself away he couldnt go far though not while carrying the dome perrin changed so that he wasnt going straight north any longer but moving toward the east he doubted that would throw off slayerhe could probably see the dome moving and judge its direction what to do hed planned to toss the spike into the ocean but if slayer was following hed just recover it perrin concentrated on moving as quickly as he could covering leagues with each heartbeat could he outrun his foe the landscape passed him in a blur mountains forests lakes meadows just as he thought he might have gotten ahead a figure appeared just beside him swinging a sword at his neck perrin ducked barely dodging the attack he growled raising his hammer but slayer vanished perrin stopped in place frustrated slayer could move faster than perrin and could get under the dome by jumping ahead of it then waiting for perrin to move it on top of him from there he could jump directly to perrin and attack i cant outrun him perrin realized the only way to be certain the only way to protect faile and the others was to kill slayer otherwise the man would recover the spike from wherever perrin put it then return it to trap his people perrin glanced around getting his bearings he was on a lightly forested slope and could see dragonmount to the north of him he glanced eastward and saw the tip of a large structure peeking out over the treetops the white tower the city might give perrin an advantage make it easier to hide in one of the many buildings or alleys perrin leaped off in that direction carrying the spike with him the dome it created traveling with him as he moved it would come down to a fight after all chapter darkness in the tower gawyn sat on a bench in the caemlyn palace gardens it had been several hours since hed sent egwenes messenger away a gibbous moon hung fat in the sky servants occasionally passed by to see if he needed anything they seemed worried about him he just wanted to watch the sky it had been weeks since hed been able to do that the air was cooling but he left his coat off hung over the back of the bench the open air felt gooddifferent somehow from the same air beneath a cloudy sky with the last light of dusk fading the stars shone like hesitant children peeking out now that the uproar of day had died down it felt so good to finally see them again gawyn breathed in deeply elayne was right much of gawyns hatred of althor came from frustration maybe jealousy althor was playing a role closer to what gawyn would have chosen for himself ruling nations leading armies looking at their lives who had taken on the role of a prince and who the role of a lost sheepherder perhaps gawyn resisted egwenes demands because he wanted to lead to be the one who accomplished the heroic acts if he became her warder he would have to step aside and help her change the world there was honor in keeping someone great alive a deep honor what was the point of great acts the recognition they brought or the better lives they created to step aside hed admired men like sleete for their willingness to do this but had never understood them not truly cant leave her to do it alone he thought have to help her from within her shadow because he loved her but also because it was for the best if two bards tried to play different songs at the same time they both made noise but if one stepped back to give harmony to the others melody then the beauty could be greater than either made alone and in that moment finally he understood he stood up he couldnt go to egwene as a prince he had to go to her as a warder he had to watch over her to serve her see her wishes done it was time to return slinging his coat on he strode down the path toward the palace the opening serenades of various pond frogs cut shortfollowed by splashesas he passed them and entered the building it wasnt a long walk to his sisters rooms she would be up she had trouble sleeping lately during the past few days they had often enjoyed conversation and a cup of warm tea before bed at her doors however he was stopped by birgitte she gave him another glare yes she did not like being forced to act as captaingeneral in his stead he could see that now he felt a little awkward stepping up to her the woman held up a hand not tonight princeling im leaving for the white tower he said id like to say farewell he moved to step forward but birgitte held a hand against his chest gently pushing him back you can leave in the morning he almost reached for his sword but stopped himself light there had been a time when he hadnt reacted that way to everything he had become a fool ask if shell see me he said politely please i have my orders birgitte said besides she couldnt talk to you shes asleep im sure shed like to be awakened its not that kind of sleep birgitte said she sighed it has to do with aes sedai matters go to bed in the morning your sister will probably have word from egwene for you gawyn frowned how would the dreams he realized this is what the aes sedai meant about egwene training them to walk in their dreams so egwenes sleeping as well birgitte eyed him bloody ashes ive probably said too much already off to your rooms gawyn stepped away but not to go to his rooms hell wait for a time of weakness he thought remembering the suldams words and when he strikes hell leave such desolation as you wouldnt believe a single man could create a time of weakness he dashed away from elaynes rooms sprinting through the palace hallways to the traveling room that elayne had set up blessedly a kinswoman was on duty hereblearyeyed but waiting in case emergency messages needed to be sent gawyn didnt recognize the darkhaired woman but she seemed to recognize him she yawned and opened a gateway at his request he ran through and onto the traveling ground of the white tower the gateway vanished right behind him gawyn started spinning with a curse that had nearly closed right on him why had the kinswoman let it vanish so abruptly and so dangerously a split second sooner and it would have taken his foot off or worse there was no time he turned and continued running egwene leane and the wise ones appeared in a room at the base of the tower where a group of anxious women waited this was a guard post that egwene had stipulated as a fallback position report egwene demanded shevan and carlinya are dead mother saerin said grimly the brusque brown was panting egwene cursed what happened we were in the middle of our ploy having a discussion about a fake plot to bring peace to arad doman as youd ordered and then fire morvrin said shivering blasting through the walls women channeling several with incredible power i saw alviarin there others too nynaeve is still up there brendas added stubborn woman egwene said looking at the three wise ones they nodded send brendas out she said pointing at the cooleyed white when you wake go and wake the others here so they will be out of danger leave nynaeve siuan leane and myself yes mother brendas said amys did something that made her form fade away the rest of you egwene said go someplace safe away from the city very well mother saerin said she stayed in place however what egwene said i saerin frowned i cant go something is odd nonsense bair snapped it bair amys said i cant leave something is very wrong the sky is violet yukiri said looking out a small window light it looks like a dome covering the tower and the city when did that happen something is very wrong here bair said we should awaken amys suddenly vanished causing egwene to start she was back in a moment i was able to go to the place where we were before but i cannot leave the city i do not like this egwene alvere egwene tried sending herself to cairhien it didnt work she looked out the window feeling worried but resolute yes there was violet above wake if you must she said to the wise ones i will fight one of the shadowsouled is here the wise ones fell silent we will go with you melaine finally said good you others be away from this place go to the musicians way and stay there until awakened melaine amys bair leane we are going to a place higher in the tower a room with wood paneling and a fourposter bed gauze drapings around it it is my bedroom the wise ones nodded and egwene sent herself there a lamp sat on her nightstand it didnt burn here in telaranrhiod though shed left it burning in the real world the wise ones and leane appeared around her the gauze draping egwene s bed ruffled in the breeze of their appearance the tower shook the fighting continued be careful egwene said we hunt dangerous foes and they know this terrain better than you we will be careful bair replied i have heard that the shadowsouled think themselves masters of this place well we shall see leane egwene said can you handle yourself egwene had been tempted to send her away but she and siuan had spent some measure of time in telaranrhiod certainly she was more experienced than most ill keep my head low mother she promised but there are bound to be more of them than us you need me agreed egwene said the four women winked away why couldnt they leave the tower it was troubling but also useful it would mean she was trapped here but hopefully so was mesaana five doves rose into the air scattering from the ledge of the rooftop perrin spun slayer stood behind him smelling like stone the hardeyed man glanced up at the fleeing birds yours for warning perrin replied i figured youd see through walnut shellls on the ground clever slayer said behind him spread a magnificent city perrin hadnt believed that any city could be as magnificent as caemlyn but if there was such a thing tar valon was it the entire city was a work of art almost every building decked with archways spires engravings and ornamentation even the cobblestones seemed to be arranged artistically slayers eyes flickered down to perrins belt there affixed in a pouch perrin had created to hold it was the terangreal the tip stuck out the top silvery bits wrapping around one another in a complex knotted braid perrin had tried again to destroy the thing by thinking of it but had been rebuffed attacking it with his hammer hadnt so much as bent it whatever this thing was it had been built to resist such attacks youve grown skilled slayer said i should have killed you months ago i believe you tried perrin said raising his hammer resting it on his shoulder who are you really a man of two worlds perrin aybara and one owned by both ill need the dreamspike back step closer and ill destroy it perrin said slayer snorted walking forward you dont have the strength for that boy i dont even have the strength to manage that his eyes flickered unconsciously over perrins shoulder toward what dragonmount perrin thought he must have worried i was coming this way to toss it in was that then an indication of a way perrin could destroy the terangreal or was slayer trying to mislead him dont press me boy slayer said sword and knife appearing in his hands as he walked forward ive already killed four wolves today give me the spike four but hed killed only one that perrin had seen hes trying to goad me you think ill believe that you wont kill me if i give it to you perrin said if i gave this to you youd have to go put it back in ghealdan you know id just follow you there perrin shook his head one of us has to die and thats that slayer hesitated then smiled luc hates you you know hates you deeply and you dont perrin asked frowning no more than the wolf hates the stag you are not a wolf perrin said growling softly slayer shrugged let us be done with this then he dashed forward gawyn charged into the white tower the men on guard barely had time to salute he dashed past mirrored standlamps only one in every two was lit to conserve oil as he reached a ramp upward he heard feet behind him his sword hissed as he pulled it free spinning mazone and celark pulled to a halt the former younglings wore tower guard uniforms now would they try to stop him who knew what kind of orders egwene had left they saluted men gawyn said what are you doing sir celark said lean face shadowed in the patchy lamplight when an officer runs by with a look like that on his face you dont ask if he needs help you just follow gawyn smiled come on he dashed up the ramps the two men following swords at the ready egwene s quarters were some way up and gawyns pulse was racing his breathing forcedby the time they reached her level they hurried down three hallways then gawyn held up his hand he glanced at the nearby shadowed recesses were any of them deep enough to hide a bloodknife you cannot have light without shadow he peeked around the corner toward egwenes door he stood in virtually the same position he been when he had ruined her plans before was he doing the same thing now his two guardsmen stood up close behind him waiting on his command yes he was doing the same thing as before and yet something had changed he would see her protected so that she could do great things he would stand in her shadow and be proud he would do as she askedbut would see her safe no matter what because that was what a warder did he slipped forward waving his men to follow the darkness in that shadowy alcove from before didnt seem to repel his attention as it had last time a good sign he stopped at the door and tried it carefully it was unlocked he took a deep breath then slipped inside no alarms went off no traps caught him and flung him about a few lamps shone on the walls at a faint noise he looked upward a tower maid hung there struggling with wide eyes mouth gagged by an invisible flow of air gawyn cursed dashing across the room and threw open the door to egwenes sleeping chamber her bed one side against the far wall was draped with white gauze curtains and a lamp burned on the stand beside it gawyn crossed the room to her pushing the gauze aside was she sleeping or was she he reached a hand toward her neck but at a faint thump behind gawyn whipped his sword around and blocked the strike coming at his back not one but two blurs of darkness leaped from the shadows he spared a glance for egwene there was no blood but he couldnt tell if she was breathing or not had his entrance interrupted the assassins in time there was no time to check he fell into apple blossoms in the wind and began to shout his men stepped up to the doorway then froze there stunned get more help gawyn said go darkskinned mazone turned to obey while celark looking determined leaped into the fight the bloodknives shifted and undulated gawyn managed to slip into cat on hot sand to test them but each strike hit only air his eyes were already hurting from trying to follow the figures celark attacked from behind but was as ineffective as gawyn gawyn gritted his teeth fighting with his back against the bed he had to keep them away from egwene long enough for help to come if he couldboth figures twisted suddenly striking in tandem at celark the man barely had time to curse before a sword took him in the neck and bright blood spurted out gawyn yelled again falling into lizard in the thornbush striking at the backs of the assassins again his attacks missed it seemed he was off by only a few hairs celark stumbled to the floor with a gurgle his blood reflecting lanternlight and gawyn couldnt step forward to defend him not without exposing egwene one of the assassins turned back to gawyn while the other beheaded celark with a slash thatdespite the shadowslooked a lot like the river undercuts the bank gawyn stepped back trying to keep his eyes off the fallen man defend he only had to defend until help came he edged to the side the seanchan were wary they knew hed fought one of them off before but they had such a strong advantage gawyn wasnt certain he could stand against two of them yes you will he told himself sternly if you fall egivene dies was that a flicker of movement from the other room could help have come gawyn felt a surge of hope and edged to the side from there he could see mazones body on rhe floor bleeding a third shadowed figure glided into the room and shut the door behind locking it that was why the other two had been hesitating theyd wanted to wait until their ally arrived the three of them attacked together perrin let the wolf free for once he didnt worry about what it would do to him he let himself be and as he fought the world seemed to become right around him perhaps that was because it bent to his will young bull leaped from a rooftop in tar valon powerful hind legs springing him into the air terangreal pouch fastened to his back he soared over a street and landed on a white marble roof with groups of statues on its edges he rolled coming up as a manterangreal tied at his waistwith hammer swinging slayer vanished right before the hammer hit then appeared beside perrin perrin vanished as slayer swung then appeared just to the left back and forth they went spinning around one another each disappearing then appearing again struggling to land a blow perrin threw himself out of the cycle sending himself to a place beside one of the roofs large statues a pompouslooking general he swung smashing his hammer into it magnifying the power of the blow chunks of statue exploded toward slayer the wolfkiller appeared expecting to find perrin beside him instead a storm of stone and dust crashed into him slayer bellowed stone chips slicing his skin his cloak immediately became as strong as steel reflecting chunks of stone he whipped it back and the entire building started to shake perrin cursed and leaped free as the roof fell in perrin soared becoming a wolf before landing on a nearby rooftopslayer appeared in front of him bow drawn young bull growled imagining the wind blowing but slayer didnt fire he just stood there as ifas if he were just a statue perrin cursed spinning as an arrow shot past him narrowly missing him at the waist the real slayer stood a short distance off he vanished leaving the remarkably detailed statue hed created to distract perrin perrin took a deep breath and made the sweat leave his brow slayer could come at him from any direction he put a wall at his back and stood refully scanning the rooftop the dome shook overhead hed grown used to thatit moved with him but he wasnt moving he looked down with a panic the pouch was gonethe arrow slayer had fired at his waist had sliced it free perrin dashed forward to the edge of the roof below slayer ran through the street the pouch in his hand a wolf leaped from an alley crashing into slayer tossing him to the ground hopper perrin was there in a moment attacking slayer cursed vanishing from underneath hopper and appearing at the end of the street he began to flee leaving a blur behind him perrin followed hopper joining him how did you find me perrin sent you are two foolish cubs hopper sent very loud like snarling cats easy to find hed deliberately not shown hopper where he was after seeing oak dancer die well this was perrins fight now that the terangreal was away from ghealdan and his people were escaping he didnt want to risk the lives of other wolves not that hopper would go if he told him to growling again perrin barreled after slayer wolf at his side egwene crouched beside the wall of the hallway panting sweat dripping from her brow across from her molten drops of rock cooled from a blast of fire the tower hallway fell still a few lamps flickered on the wall through a window she could see the purple sky above between the tower and the dark clouds shed been fighting for what seemed like hours though it had probably been only fifteen minutes shed lost track of the wise ones she began to creep forward using the antieavesdropping weave to make her footfalls silent until she reached a corner and peered around it darkness in both directions egwene crept forward moving carefully resolutely the tower was her domain she felt invaded as surely as when the seanchan had come however this fight was proving very different from fighting off the seanchan there the enemy had been bold easy to spot faint light appeared under a doorway ahead she shifted herself into the room preparing weaves two women were there speaking in whispers one holding a globe of light evanellein and mestra two of the black sister who had fled the white tower egwene let loose with a ball of fire that destroyed mestra in an inferno evanellein yelped and egwene used a trick nynaeve had taught hershe imagined evanellein being stupid unable to think unable to react the womans eyes glazed over and her mouth opened thought was faster than weaves egwene hesitated now what kill her whiie defenseless her stomach turned at that thought could take her captive go and someone appeared in the room with her the newcomer wore black a magnificent gown with silver trim darkness swirled about her made of spinning ribbons of cloth her skirt rippling the effect was unnatural and impressive possible only here in telararirhiod egwene looked into the womans eyes large and blue set in an angular face with chinlength black hair there was a power to those eyes and egwene immediately knew what she was facing why fight she couldntegwene felt her mind change become accepting she fought it with a burst of panic and in a moment of clarity she sent herself away egwene appeared in her rooms then raised her hand to her head sitting down on the bed light but that woman had been strong something sounded behind her someone appearing in the room egwene leaped to her feet preparing weaves nynaeve stood there eyes wide with fury the woman thrust her hands forward weaves forming but she froze to the gardens egwene said not trusting her quarters she shouldnt have come here mesaana would know this place nynaeve nodded and egwene vanished appearing in the lower tower garden the strange violet dome extended above what was that and how had mesaana brought it here nynaeve appeared a moment later theyre still up there nynaeve whispered i just saw alviarin i saw mesaana egwene said she nearly took me light are you all right egwene nodded mestra is dead i saw evanellein too its black as a tomb up there nynaeve whispered i think they made it that way siuan and leane are all right i saw them a little bit ago sticking together just before that i managed to hit notofi with a blast fire shes dead good the black ajah stole nineteen terangreal that might give us an estimate of how many black ajah we have to contend with she siuan nynaeve leane and the three wise ones were outnumberedbut the rlack ajah didnt seem to have much experience with telaranrhiod have you seen the wise ones theyre up there nynaeve grimaced they seem to be enjoying this they would egwene said i want you and me to go together we will appear in intersections back to back and quickly scan for light or people if you see a black strike if someone sees you say go and well jump back here nynaeve nodded first intersection is the one outside my room egwene said hallway on the south side ill flood it with light you be ready from there well jump down one hallway by the door into the servants ramp then on down the line nynaeve nodded sharply the world winked around egwene she appeared in the hallway and immediately thought of the place lit imposing her will upon it light flooded the entire space a roundfaced woman crouched near the side of the wall wearing white sedore one of the black sisters sedore spun looking angry weaves springing up around her egwene worked faster creating a column of fire right before sedore would have released her own no weaves on egwenes part just the fire egwene saw the blacks eyes open wider as the fire roared around her sedore screeched but that cut off as the heat consumed her her burned corpse collapsed to the floor smoldering egwene let out a relieved breath anyone on your side no nynaeve said who was that you hit sedore really nynaeve said turning she had been a sitter for the yellow egwene smiled next hallway they jumped and repeated their strategy flooding the hallway with light there was nobody there so they moved on the next two hallways were empty egwene was about to leave when a voice hissed foolish child your pattern is obvious egwene spun where she cut off as she saw bair the aged wise one had changed her clothing and even her skin itself to match the white walls and floor tiles she was practically invisible crouching in an alcove you shouldnt bair began a wall beside them exploded outward throwing up chunks of rock six women stood beyond and they released weaves of fire it appeared that the time for sneaking had ended perrin crested the wall surrounding the white tower grounds coming down with a thump the strangeness of the wolf dream continued he now not only smelled odd scents but heard odd sounds as well rumblings from inside the tower he leaped after slayer who crossed the grounds then ran up the outside of the tower itself perrin followed running up into the air slayer stayed just ahead terangreal pouch tied at his waist perrin created a longbow he pulled it back freezing in place standing on the side of the tower he loosed but the wolfkiller leaped up then fell into the tower through a window the arrow passed overhead perrin leaped to the window then ducked inside hopper leaping in after him leaving a blur behind they entered a bedroom hung with brocades of blue the door slammed and perrin charged after slayer he didnt bother to open the door he smashed it with his hammer slayer charged down a hallway follow perrin sent to hopper ill cut him off the wolf raced forward after slayer perrin ran to the right then cut down a hallway he moved quickly the walls speeding past he passed a hallway that appeared to be full of people he was so surprised that he froze the hall lurching around him they were aes sedai and they were fighting the hallway was alight trails of fire flying from one end to the other the sounds hed heard before hadnt been phantoms and he thought yes egwene perrin asked she stood pressed against the wall nearby intently looking down the hallway when he spoke she spun on him hands going up he felt something grab him his mind instantly reacted however pushing the air away egwene started as she failed to snatch him he stepped forward egwene you shouldnt be here this place is dangerous perrin i dont know how you got here perrin said but you need to go please how did you stop me she demanded what are you doing here have you been with rand tell me where he is she spoke with such authority now she almost seemed a different person decades older than the girl hed known perrin opened his mouth to reply but egwene cut him off i dont have time for this she said im sorry perrin ill be back for you she raised a hand and he felt things change around him ropes appeared binding him he looked down amused the ropes slipped free the moment he thought of them being too loose egwene blinked watching them drop to the ground how someone burst out of a room nearby a tall slendernecked woman with raven hair wearing a sleek white dress she smiled raising her hands and a light appeared before her perrin didnt need to know what she was doing he was a wolf he was the ruler of this place weaves were meaningless he imagined the womans attack missing him he knew it would be so a bar of whitehot light shot from the woman perrin raised a hand before himself and egwene the light vanished as if stopped by his palm egwene turned and the wall above the woman burst rock showering down a chunk smashed the woman on the head brutally knocking her to the ground light she was probably dead after a blow like that egwene smelled amazed she spun on him balefire you stopped balefire nothing should be able to do that its just a weave perrin said reaching out for hopper where was slayer its not just a weave perrin its im sorry egwene he said i will speak to you later be careful in this place you probably already know that you need to be but still its more dangerous than you know he turned and ran leaving egwene sputtering it seemed shed managed to become an aes sedai that was good she deserved it hopper he sent where are you his only reply was a sudden terrifying sending of pain gawyn fought for his life against three living shadows of darkness and steel they pressed him to the utmost of his ability leaving him bloodied half a dozen times over on arms and legs he used the cyclone rages and it defended his vitals barely drops of his blood stained the gauze draping egwenes bed if his opponents had already killed egwene then they made a good show of continuing to threaten her he was growing weak and tired his boots left bloody prints when he stepped he couldnt feel the pain his parries were becoming sluggish theyd have him in another moment or two no help came although his voice was hoarse from yelling fool he thought you need to spend more time thinking and less time running straight into danger he should have alerted the entire tower the only reason he was alive was because the three were being careful wearing him down once he fell that suldam had indicated they would go on a rampage through the white tower it would take the aes sedai completely by surprise this night could be a disaster greater than the original seanchan strike had been the three moved forward no gawyn thought as one of them tried the river undercuts the bank he leaped forward dodging between two blades swinging his weapon amazingly he actually struck and a voice cried out in the room blood sprayed across the ground one shadowy form falling the two others muttered curses and all pretense of wearing him down vanished they struck at him weapons flashing amid dark mist exhausted gawyn took another hit on the shoulder blood trickling down his arm beneath his coat shadows how could a man be expected to fight against shadows it was impossible where there is light there must be shadow a last desperate thought occurred to him with a cry he leaped to the side and yanked a pillow from egwenes bed blades cut the air around him as he spun and slammed the pillow on the lantern smothering it plunging the room into darkness no light no shadows equality the darkness evened out everything and in the night you couldnt see color he couldnt see the blood on his arms couldnt see the black shadows of his enemies or the whiteness of egwenes bed but he could hear the men move he raised his blade for a desperate strike using hummingbird kisses the honeyrose predicting where the bloodknives would move he was no longer distracted by their misted figures and his strike hit true sinking into flesh he twisted yanking his blade free the room fell silent save for the fall of the man hed hit gawyn held his breath heartbeat thumping in his ears where was the last assassin no light came in from the room next door celark had fallen beside the doorway blocking the light underneath gawyn was feeling shaky now hed lost too much blood if he had something to throw to create a distraction but no moving would rustle clothing would give him away so gritting his teeth he tapped his foot and raised his blade to protect his neck praying to the light that the attack came low it did cutting deeply into his side he took it with a grunt but immediately lashed out with all he had his sword hissed and with a brief tug it sliced true a thump followed a decapitated head bouncing off the wall followed by the noise of a corpse hitting the ground gawyn slumped against the bed blood gushing from his side he was blacking out although it was hard to tell in the unlit room he reached for where he remembered egwenes hand being but was too weak to find it he hit the floor a moment later his last thought was that he still didnt know whether or not she was dead great mistress katerine said kneeling before mesaana we cannot find the thing you describe half of our women search for it while the other half fight the worms who resist but it is nowhere mesaana folded her arms beneath her breasts as she considered the situation with an offhanded thought she strapped katerines back with lines of air failure needed always be punished consistency was the key in all forms of training the white tower rumbled above her though she was safe here shed imposed her will on this area creating a new room beneath the basements carved as a pocket in the stone the children who fought above obviously nought themselves practiced in this place but children they were she had been coming to telaranrbiod for a century before her imprisonment the tower rumbled again carefully she considered her situation somehow the aes sedai had found a dreamspike how had they located such a treasure mesaana was nearly as interested in gaining control of it as she was in dominating the child amyrlin egwene alvere the ability to forbid gateways into your places of refuge well it was a vital tool particulary when she decided to move against the other chosen it was more effective than wards protecting ones dreams from any intrusion and it stopped all forms of traveling in or out of the area except for those allowed however with the dreamspike in place she also could not move this battle with the children above to a more suitable carefully selected location aggravating but no she would not allow herself to become ernotional about the situation return above and concentrate everything on capturing the woman egwene alvere mesaana said she will know where the device is yes that was clear to her now she would achieve two victories with a single act yes mistress katerine was still cowering straps of air beating against her back ah yes mesaana waved curtly dispelling the weave as she did so a thought occurred to her wait here a moment she said to katerine im going to place a weave upon you perrin appeared on the very top of the white tower slayer held hopper by the scruff of his neck the wolf had an arrow through his side blood ran down his paw wind blew across the rock catching the blood and spraying it across the stones hopper perrin took a step forward he could still sense hoppers mind though it was weak slayer held the wolf up lifting him easily he raised a knife no perrin said you have what you want just go and what was it you said earlier slayer asked that you know where i would go and youd follow the dreamspike is too easy to locate on this side he casually tossed the wolf off the side of the tower no perrin screamed he leaped for the side but slayer appeared beside him grabbing him raising his dagger the leap knocked them both off the side of the tower perrins stomach lurching as they fell he tried to send himself away but slayer had hold of him and he tried very hard to keep them in place they shook for a moment but kept falling slayer was so strong he smelled wrong like staleness and wolfs blood his knife sought perrins throat and the best perrin could do was raise his arm to block thinking of his shirt being as hard as steel slayer pressed harder perrin felt a moment of weakness the wound across his chest throbbing as he and slayer tumbled the knife split perrins sleeve and rammed into his forearm perrin screamed the wind was so loud it had been mere seconds slayer pulled the knife free hopper perrin roared and kicked at slayer pushing him away breaking his grip arm aflame perrin twisted in the air the ground rushed at them he willed himself to another place and he appeared just below hopper catching the wolf and crashing into the ground his knees buckled the ground around him shattered but he lowered hopper safely a blackfletched arrow zipped from the sky and pierced hoppers back passing all the way through the wolf and hitting perrin in his thigh which was bent at the knee just beneath the wolf perrin yelled feeling his own pain mix with a sudden wash of agony from hopper the wolfs mind was fading no perrin sent eyes wet with tears young bull hopper sent perrin tried to send himself away but his mind was fuzzy another arrow would soon fall he knew it he managed to roll out of the way as it struck the ground but his leg no longer worked and hopper was so heavy perrin pitched to the ground dropping the wolf rolling slayer landed a short distance away long wicked black bow in hand goodbye aybara slayer raised his bow looks like i kill five wolves today perrin stared up at the arrow everything was blurry i cant leave faile i cant leave hopper i wont as slayer released perrin desperately imagined himself strong not faint he felt his heart become hale again his veins filling with energy he yelled head clearing enough to make himself vanish and appear standing behind slayer he swung with his hammer mayer turned casually and blocked it with his arm which was enormously strong perrin fell to one knee the pain in his leg still there he gasped you cant heal yourself slayer said there are ways but simply imaging yourself well does not work you do seem to have figured out how to replenish your blood however which is useful perrin smelled something terror was it his own no no there behind slayer was a doorway open into the white tower inside was blackness not just shadow blackness perrin had done enough practice with hopper to recognize what it was a nightmare as slayer opened his mouth to say something perrin growled and threw all of his weight forward ramming into slayer his leg scream in pain they tumbled directly into the blackness of the nightmare chapter wounds spurts of fire flashed through the dark hallways of the white tower leaving trails of smoke that curled in the air thick and pungent people screamed and yelled and cursed the walls shook as blasts took them chips and chunks of rock sprayed off weaves of air crafted for protection there egwene noted a place where several black sisters were lobbing fire down the hallway evanellein was there egwene sent herself into the room next to the one where they were standing she could hear them on the other side of the wall she opened her hands and released a powerful blast of earth and fire directly at the wall blowing it outward the women beyond stumbled and fell evanellein collapsing bloodied the other woman was quick enough to send herself away egwene checked to see that evanellein was dead she was egwene nodded with satisfaction evanellein was one of those that shed been most eager to find now if she could only track down katerine or alviarin channeling behind her egwene threw herself to the ground as a blast of fire sprayed over her head mesaana black cloth swirling about her egwene gritted her teeth and sent herself away she didnt dare face the woman directly egwene appeared in a storage room not far away then stumbled as a blast shook the area she waved a hand making a window in the door and saw amys charging past the wise one wore cadinsor and carried spears her shoulder was bleeding and blackened another blast hit near her but she vanished that blast made the air outside swelter melting egwenes window and forcing her to step back saerins research had been correct despite the open battle mesaa had not fled or hid as moghedien might have perhaps she was confident perhaps she was frightened likely she needed egwenes death to prove a victory before the dark one egwene took a deep breath and prepared to return to the fighting she hesitated however thinking of perrins appearance hed acted as if she were a novice how had he grown so confident so strong she hadnt been surprised by the things hed done so much as by the fact that he had been the one doing them his appearance was a lesson egwene had to be very careful not to rely on her weaves bair couldnt channel but she was as effective as the others however it did seem that for some things weaves were better blowing the wall outward for instance had seemed easier with a weave than by imagining it where imposing her will against so large and thick surface might have been difficult she was aes sedai and she was a dreamer she had to use both egwene cautiously sent herself back to the room where shed seen mesaana it was empty though the wall was still rubble blasts sounded from the right and egwene peeked around balls of fire shot back and forth in that direction weaves flying in the air egwene sent herself behind one of the fighting groups and created a thick cylinder of glass around her for protection the tower was broken and scarred here the walls smoldering egwene caught sight of one figure stooping beside a section of rubble wearing a blue dress nicola egwene thought with anger how did she get here i thought i could trust her now the fool girl must have gotten a dream terangreal from one of the others who had awakened egwene prepared to jump over and send the girl away but the ground suddenly ripped up beneath nicola fire blazing nicola screamed as she was tossed into the air bits of molten rock spraying around her egwene yelled sending herself there imagining a strong wall of stone beneath nicola the girl fell and landed on it bloodied eyes unseeingegwene cursed kneeling the girl wasnt breathing no egwene said egwene alvere beware melaines voice egwene turned with alarm as a wall appeared beside her made or hick granite blocking several blasts of fire that had come from behind melaine appeared next to egwene dressed in all black her very skin colored dark shed been hiding in the shadows beside the hallway this place grows too dangerous for you melaine said leave it to us egwene looked down nicolas corpse faded away foolish child she seeked around the wall to see two black sistersalviarin and ramola standing backtoback and sending destructive weaves in different directions there was a room behind them egwene could do as she had several times before jumping into the room destroying the wall and hitting the two of them foolish child bair had said your pattern is obvious that was what mesaana wanted her to do the two black sisters were bait egwene jumped into the room but put her back to the wall she emptied her mind waiting tense mesaana appeared as she had before that swirling black cloth was impressive but it was also foolish it took thought to maintain egwene stared into the womans surprised eyes and saw the weaves the woman had prepared those ivill not hit me egwene thought confident the white tower was hers mesaana and her minions had invaded killing nicola shevan and carlinya weaves shot forward but they bent around egwene in a moment egwene was wearing the clothing of a wise one white blouse brown skirt shawl on her shoulders she imagined a spear in her hand an aiel spear and she threw it with a precise motion the spear pierced the weaves of fire and air blasting them away then hit something thick a wall of air before mesaana egwene refused to allow it that wall didnt belong here it did not exist the spear stopped slowing and shot forward taking mesaana in the neck the womans eyes opened wide and she slumped backward blood spurting from the wound the black strips swirling around her vanished completely as did the dress so it had been a weave mesaanas darkened face turned into that of katerine egwene frowned mesaana had been katerine all along but shed been black and fled the tower she hadnt remained and that meantno egwene thought ive been had shes aat that moment egwene felt something snap around her neck something cold and metallic something familiar and terrifying the source fled her in a moment for she was no longer authorized to hold it she spun in terror a woman with chinlength dark hair and deep blue eyes stood beside her she did not look very imposing but she was very strong in the power and her wrist held a bracelet connected by a leash to the band around egwenes neck an adam excellent mesaana said such unruly children you are she clicked her tongue in disapproval in a moment she shifted somewhere else taking egwene with her a chamber with no windows looking as if it were cut directly from stone there wasnt even a doorway alviarin waited here wearing a dress of white and red the woman immediately knelt before mesaana though she spared a satisfied glance for egwene egwene barely noticed she stood stiff a tide of panicked thoughts flooding her mind she was trapped again she could not stand it she would die before she allowed this to happen images flashed in her head trapped in a room unable to move more than a few feet without being overcome by the adam treated like an animal a creeping sense that she would eventually break would eventually become exactly what they wanted her to be oh light she could not suffer this again not this tell those above to withdraw mesaana was saying to alviarin her voice calm egwene barely registered the words fools they are and their showing here was pathetic punishments will be administered this was how moghedien had been captured by nynaeve and elayne she was kept captive forced to do as they demanded egwene would suffer the same indeed mesaana would probably use compulsion on her the white tower would be fully in the hands of the forsaken the emotions welled up egwene found herself clawing at the collar which got a look of amusement from mesaana as alviarin vanished to relay her order this could not be happening it was a nightmare ayou are aes sedai a quiet piece of her whispered the words yet for all their softness they were strong and they were deep within her the voice was deeper than the terror and fear now mesaana said we will speak of the dreamspike where might i find it an aes sedai is calmness an aes sedai is control regardless of the situation egwene lowered her hands from the collar she had not gone through the testing and she had not planned to but if she had what if she had been forced to face a situation like this would she have broken proven herself unworthy of the mantle she claimed to carry not speaking i see mesaana said well that can be changed these adam such lovely devices semirhage was so delightfully wonderful in bringing them to my attention even if she did so accidentally pity she died before i could place one on her neck pain shot through egwenes body like fire beneath her skin her eyes watered from it but she had suffered pain before and laughed while being beaten she had been captive before in the white tower itself and captivity had not stopped her but this is different the larger part of her was terrified this is the adam i cannot withstand it an aes sedai must the quiet piece of her replied an aes sedai can suffer all things for only then can she be truly a servant of all now mesaana said tell me where you have hidden the device egwene controlled her fear it was not easy light but it was hard but she did it her face became calm she defied the adam by not giving it power over her mesaana hesitated frowning she shook the leash and more pain flooded egwene she made it vanish it occurs to me mesaana egwene said calmly that moghedien made a mistake she accepted the adam what are you in this place an adam is as meaningless as the weaves it prevents egwene said it is only a piece of metal and it only will stop you if you accept that it will the adam unlocked and fell free of her neck mesaana glanced at it as it dropped to the ground with a metallic ring her face grew still then cold as she looked up at egwene impressively she did not panic she folded her arms eyes impassive so you have practiced here egwene met her gaze you are still a child mesaana said you think that you can best me have walked in telaranrhiod longer than you can imagine you are what twenty years old i am the amyrlin egwene said an amyrlin to children an amyrlin to a tower that has stood for thousands of years egwene said thousands of years of trouble and chaos yet most of your life you lived in a time of peace not strife curious that you should think yourself so strong when much of your life was so easy easy mesaana said you know nothing neither broke her gaze egwene felt something press against her as it had before mesaanas will demanding her subservience her supplication an attempt to use telaranrhiod to change the very way that egwene thought mesaana was strong but strength in this place was a matter of per spective mesaanas will pressed against her but egwene had defeated the adam she could resist this you will bend mesaana said quietly you are mistaken egwene replied voice tense this is not about me egwene alvere is a child but the amyrlin is not i may be young but the seat is ancient neither woman looked away egwene began to push back to demand that mesaana bow before her before the amyrlin the air began to feel heavy around them and when egwene breathed it in it seemed thick somehow age is irrelevant egwene said to an extent even experience is irrelevant this place is about what a person is the amyrlin is the white tower and the white tower will not bend it defies you mesaana and your lies two women gazes matched egwene stopped breathing she did not need to breathe all was focused on mesaana sweat trickled down egwenes temples every muscle in her body tense as she pushed back against mesaanas will and egwene knew that this woman this creature was an insignificant insect shoving against an enormous mountain that mountain would not move indeed shove against it too hard and something snapped softly in the room egwene breathed in with a gasp as the air returned to normal mesaana dropped like a doll made of strips of cloth she hit the ground with her eyes still open and a little bit of spittle dribbled from the corner of her mouth egwene sat down dazed breathing in and out in gasps she looked to the side where the adam lay discarded it vanished then she looked back at mesaana who lay in a heap her chest was still rising and lowering but she stared with sightless eyes egwene lay for a long moment recovering before standing and embracing the source she wove lines of air to lift the unresponsive forsaken then shifted both herself and the woman back to the upper floors of the tower women turned toward her with a start the hallway here was strewn with rubble but everyone egwene saw was one of hers the wise ones spinning on her nynaeve picking through some rubble siuan and leane the latter bearing several blackened cuts on her face but looking strong mother siuan said with relief we had feared who is that melaine asked walking up to mesaana hanging limply in the weaves of air and staring at the ground the woman cooed suddenly like a child eyes watching a bit of burning fire on the remnants of a tapestry it is her egwene said tired mesaana melaine turned to egwene eyes wide with surprise light leane exclaimed what have you done i have seen this before bair said inspecting the woman sammana a wise one dreamer from my youth she encountered something in the dream that broke her mind she hesitated she spent the rest of her days in the waking world drooling and needing her linen changed she never spoke again at least nothing more than the words of a babe who can barely walk perhaps it is time to stop thinking of you as an apprentice egwene alvere amys said nynaeve stood with hands on hips looking impressed but still clinging to the source her braid was full length again in the dream the others have gone she said mesaana ordered them to flee egwene said they couldnt have gone far siuan said that dome is still there yes bair said but it is time for this battle to end the enemy has been defeated we will speak again egwene alvere egwene nodded i agree on both points bair amys melaine thank you for your muchneeded aid you have gained much ji in this and i am in your debt melaine eyed the forsaken as egwene sent herself out of the dream i believe it is us and the world itself who are in your debt egwene alvere the others nodded and as egwene faded from telaranrhiod she heard bair muttering such a shame she didnt return to us perrin ran through crowds of terrified people in a burning city tar valon aflame the very stones burned the sky a deep red the ground trembled like a wounded buck kicking as a leopard bled its neck perrin stumbled as a chasm opened before him flames blazing upward singeing the hairs on his arms people screamed as some fell into the terrible rift burning away into nothing bodies suddenly littered the ground to his right a beautiful building with arched windows began to melt the rock turning liquid lava bleeding from between stones and out of openings perrin climbed to his feet its not real tarmon gaidon people yelled the last battle has come it ends light it ends perrin stumbled pulling himself up against a chunk of rock trying to stand his arm hurt and his fingers wouldnt grip but the worst wound was in his leg where the arrow had hit his trousers and coat were wet with blood and the scent of his own terror was powerful in his nose he knew this nightmare was not real and yet how could one not feel the horror of it to the west dragonmount was erupting plumes of angry smoke billowing into the sky the entire mountain seemed aflame rivers of red surging down its sides perrin could feel it shaking dying buildings cracked trembled melted shattered people died crushed by stones or burned to death no he would not be drawn in the ground around him changed from broken cobbles to neat tiles the servants entrance to the white tower perrin forced himself to his feet creating a staff to use in limping he didnt destroy the nightmare he had to find slayer in this terrible place perrin might be able to gain an advantage slayer was very practiced in telaranrhiod but perhapsif perrin had luck on his sidethe man was skilled enough to have avoided nightmares in the past perhaps he would be startled by this one taken in reluctantly perrin weakened his resolve letting himself be drawn into the nightmare slayer would be close perrin stumbled across the street staying far from the building with the lava boiling from its windows if was hard to keep himself from giving in to the screams of horror and pain the calls for help there perrin thought reaching an alley slayer stood inside head bowed a hand up against one wall the ground beside the man ended in a rift boiling magma at the bottom people clung to the edge of the gap screaming slayer ignored them where his hand touched the wall it started to change from whitewashed brick to the gray stone of the white towers interior the terangreal still hung at slayers waist perrin had to move quicklythe wall is melting from the heat perrin thought focusing on the wall beside slayer it was easier here to change things like thatit was playing into the world the nightmare created slayer cursed pulling his hand back as the wall grew redhot the ground beneath him rumbled and his eyes opened wide in alarm he spun as a rift opened beside him projected there by perrin in that moment perrin saw that slayer believedfor just a fraction of a sectionthat the nightmare was real slayer stepped away from the rift raising a hand against its heat believing it real slayer vanished in the blink of an eye appearing beside those hanging above the rift the nightmare incorporated him sucking him into its whims making him play a role in its terrors it nearly took perrin too he felt himself waver nearly responding to the heat but no hopper was dying he would not fail perrin imagined himself as someone else azi althone one of the two rivers men perrin put himself in clothing like that hed seen on the street a vest and a white shirt finer trousers than any man would wear while working in emonds field this step was almost too much for him his heart beat faster and he stumbled as the ground rumbled if he let himself be caught up completely in the nightmare hed end up like slayer no perrin thought forcing himself to hold to his memory of faile in his heart his home his face might change the world might shake but that was still home he ran to the edge of the rift above the heat acting as if he were just another part of the nightmare he screamed in terror reaching down to help those who were falling though he reached for someone else slayer cursed and grabbed his arm using it to heave himself upward and as he passed perrin grabbed the terangreal slayer crawled over him reaching the relative safety of the alley covertly perrin made a knife in his other hand burn me slayer growled i hate these things the area around them suddenly changed to tiles perrin stood up holding a staff to steady himself and trying to appear terrifiedit wasnt hard he began to stumble past slayer in that moment the hardfaced man looked down and saw the terangreal in perrins angers his eyes opened wide perrin rammed his hand forward plunging the knife into slayers stomach the man screamed lurching backward hand to his belly blood soaked his fingers slayer clenched his teeth the nightmare bent around him it would burst soon slayer righted himself lowering his bloodied hand eyes alight with anger perrin felt unsteady on his feet even with the staff hed been wounded so badly the ground trembled a rift opened in the ground next to him steaming with heat and lava like perrin started like dragonmount he looked down at the terangreal in his fingers the feardreams of people are strong hoppers voice whispered in perrins mind so very strong as slayer advanced on him perrin gritted his teeth and hurled the terangreal into the river of lava no slayer screamed reality returning around him the nightmare burst its last vestiges vanishing perrin was left kneeling on the cold tiled floor of a small hallway a short distance to his right a melted lump of metal lay on the ground perrin smiled like slayer the terangreal was here from the real world and like a person it could be broken and destroyed here above them the violet dome had vanished slayer growled then stepped forward and kicked perrin in the stomach his chest wound flared another kick followed perrin was growing dizzy go young bull hopper sent his voice so weak flee i cant leave you and yet i must leave you no you have found your answer seek boundless he will explain that answer perrin blinked through tears as another kick landed he screamed raggedly as hoppers sendingso comforting so familiarfaded from his mind gone perrin screamed in anguish voice ragged eyes stained with tears perrin willed himself out of the wolf dream and away fleeing like an utter coward egwene awoke with a sigh eyes still closed she breathed in the battle with mesaana had left her mind feeling strainedindeed she had a splitting headache she had quite nearly been defeated there her plans had worked but the weight of what had happened left her feeling contemplative even a little overwhelmed still it had been a great victory she would have to do a search of the white tower and find the woman who when awakened now had the mind of a child she knew somehow that this was not something mesaana would recover from shed known it even before bair had spoken her words egwene opened her eyes to a comfortably dark room making plans to gather the hall and explain why shevan and carlinya would never awaken she spared a moment to mourn for them as she sat up shed explained to them the dangers but still she felt as if shed failed them and nicola always trying to go faster than she should she shouldnt have been there itegwene hesitated what was that smell hadnt she left a lamp burning it must have gone out egwene embraced the source and wove a ball of light to hang above her hand she was stunned by the scene it revealed the translucent curtains of her bed had been sprayed red with blood and five bodies littered the floor three were in black one was an unfamiliar young man in the tabard of the tower guard the last wore a fine white and red coat and trousers gawyn egwene threw herself from the bed and knelt beside him ignoring the pain of her headache he was breathing shallowly and had a gaping wound in his side she wove earth spirit and air into a healing but she was far from talented in this area she worked on in a panic some of his color returned and the wounds began to close but she couldnt do nearly enough help she yelled the amyrlin needs help gawyn stirred egwene he whispered his eyes fluttering open hush gawyn youre going to be fine aid to the amyrlin you didnt leave enough lights on he whispered what the message i sent we never got a message she said be still help nobody is near i yelled the lamps it is good you didnt he smiled dazedly i love you lie still she said light she was crying the assassins werent your forsaken though he said words slurring i was right and he had been what were those unfamiliar black uniforms seanchan i should be dead she realized if gawyn hadnt stopped these assassins shed have been murdered in her sleep and would have vanished from telaranrhiod shed never have killed mesaana suddenly she felt a fool any sense of victory completely evaporating im sorry gawyn said closing his eyes for disobeying you he was slipping its all right gawyn she said blinking away tears im going to bond you now its the only way his grip on her arm became slightly more firm no not unless you want fool she said preparing the weaves of course i want you as my warder i always have swear it i swear it i swear that i want you as my warder and as my husband she rested her hand on his forehead and laid the weave on him i love you he gasped suddenly she could feel his emotions and his pain as if they were her own and in return she knew that he could feel the truth of her words perrin opened his eyes and took a deep breath he was crying did people cry in their sleep when they dreamed normal dreams light be praised faile said he opened his eyes and found that she knelt next to him as did someone else masuri the aes sedai grabbed perrins head in her hands and perrin felt the icy cold of a healing wash across him the wounds in his leg and across his chest closed we tried to heal you while you slept faile said cradling perrins head in her lap but edarra stopped us it is not to be done wouldnt work anyway that was the wise ones voice perrin could hear her in the tent somewhere he blinked his eyes he lay on his pallet it was dim outside its been longer than an hour he said you should have left by now hush faile said gateways are working again and almost everyone is through only a few thousand soldiers remainaiel and two rivers men mostly you think theyd leave you think id leave without you he sat up wiping his brow it was damp with sweat he tried to make it vanish as he had in the wolf dream he failed of course edarra stood by the far wall behind him she watched him with a measuring gaze he turned to faile we have to get away he said voice ragged slayer will not be working alone there will be a trap probably an army someone with an army they might try to strike at any moment can you stand faile asked yes he felt weak but he managed with failes help the flap rustled and chiad entered with a waterskin perrin took it gratefully drinking it slaked his thirst but pain still burned inside of him hoopper he lowered the waterskin in the wolf dream death was final where would hoppers soul go i must keep going perrin thought see my people to safety he walked to the tent flaps his legs were already more steady i see your sorrow my husband faile said walking beside him hand on his arm what happened i lost a friend perrin said softly for the second time hopper she smelled fearful yes oh perrin im sorry her voice was tender as they stepped out of the tent it stood alone on the meadow that had once held his forces the brown and yellow grass still bore the impressions of tents paths worn down to the mud in a large crisscross pattern it looked like a layout for a town sections stamped down for buildings lines cut to become roadways but it was nearly empty of people now the rumbling sky was dark chiad held a lantern up to illuminate the grass in front of them several groups of soldiers waited maidens raised their spears high when they saw him then banged them on their shields a sign of approval the two rivers men were there as well gathering around as word spread how much could they guess of what hed done tonight two rivers men cheered and perrin nodded to them though he felt on edge the wrongness was still there in the air hed assumed that the dreamspike was causing it but he had apparently been wrong the air smelled like the blight the ashaman stood where the center of the camp had once stood they turned when perrin approached saluting hands to chests they looked to be in good shape despite just having moved almost the entire camp get us out of here men perrin said to them i dont want to spend another minute in this place yes my lord grady said sounding eager he got a look of concentration on his face and a small gateway opened beside him ihrough perrin said waving to the two rivers men they crossed with a quick step the maidens and gaul waited with perrin as did elyas light perrin thought scanning the field where theyd camped i feel like a mouse being eyed by a hawk i dont suppose you could give us some light perrin said to neald standing beside the gateway the ashaman cocked his head and a group of glowing globes appeared around him they zipped up into the air around the meadow they illuminated nothing just the abandoned campsite the last of the troops finally filed through perrin and faile crossed gaul elyas and the maidens going after him finally the channelers passed through walking in a cluster the air on the other side of the gateway was cool and smelled refreshingly clean perrin hadnt realized how much the evil smell had been bothering him he inhaled deeply they were on a rise some distance from a splash of lights beside the river that was probably whitebridge his troops cheered as he stepped through the great camp was already mostly set up guard posts in place the gateway had been opened into a large area marked off with posts near the back theyd escaped the cost had been great but theyd escaped graendal sat back in her chair the leather cushions were stuffed with the down of the fledgling kallir which during this age lived only in shara she barely noticed the luxury the servantone moridin had loaned herwas on one knee before her his eyes were tempestuous and only halflowered this one was under control but barely he knew he was unique he also seemed to know that his failure would fall upon her shoulders graendal did not sweat she was too controlled for that the shutters on the window in the wide redtiled room burst open suddenly a cold sea wind blowing through the chamber and putting out several of the lamps tendrils of smoke wove up from their wicks she would not fail prepare to spring the trap anyway she commanded but the servant said do it and do not speak back to one of the chosen dog the servant lowered his eyes though there was still a rebellious spark to them never mind she still had one tool left to her one she had positioned so very carefully one she had prepared for a moment such as this it had to be done carefully aybara was taveren and so strongly one as to be frightening arrows fired from afar would miss and in a time of peacful contemplation he would be alerted and escape she needed a tempest with him at the center of it and then the blade would fall this is not done yet fallen blacksmith not by an inch or by a league chapter in the threefold land aviendha felt right again there was a calming perfection to the threefold land wetlanders thought the landscapes uniform colors drab but aviendha found them beautiful simple browns and tans they were familiar and dependable not like the wetlands where both the landscape and the weather were different every time you turned around aviendha ran forward in the darkening night each foot falling on dusty ground for the first time in many months she felt alone in the wetlands she always felt as if she was being watched by some enemy she could not see or attack not that the threefold land was safer far from it that shadowed patch beneath the nadrascruh was the den of a lethal snake if one brushed the spindly branches the snake would strike she had seen five men die from those bites the den was merely one of the many hazards she passed during her run to rhuidean but those dangers were understandable she could see them measure them and avoid them if she died from the snakes bite or fell to the lands heat the fault would be her own it was always preferable to face the enemy or the danger you could see than to fear the one that hid behind the faces of lying wetlanders she continued running despite the dimming light it was good to sweat again people didnt sweat enough in the wetlands perhaps that was what made them so unusual instead of letting the sun warm them they sought refreshment instead of going to a proper sweat tent to get clean they submersed themselves in water that couldnt be healthy she would not lie to herself aviendha herself had partaken of those luxuries and she had come to enjoy those baths and the fine dresses elayne forced upon her one had to acknowledge ones weaknesses before one could defeat them now as she ran across the gently sloping earth of the threefold land aviendhas perspective was restored finally she slowed as tempting as it was to travel in the dark and sleep through the days heat it was not wise a misstep in the dark could end your life she quickly collected some dead talbrush and some inata bark then made herself a camp at the side of a tremendous stone soon she had a fire burning the orange light reflecting off the rock that towered over her shed slain a small shellback earlier and she unwrapped it skinned it then set it up on a spit not the most delicate of meals but satisfactory aviendha settled down watching the fire crackle smelling the meat yes she was glad she hadnt traveled directly to rhuidean instead taking the timeprecious though that time wasto run in the threefold land it helped her see what she had been and what she had become aviendha the maiden was gone she had embraced her path as a wise one and that brought her honor back she had purpose again as a wise one she could help lead her people through their most trying time once this was through her people would need to return to the threefold land each day in the wetlands made them weaker she herself was an excellent example she had grown soft there how could one not grow soft in that place it would have to be abandoned soon she smiled settling back and closing her eyes for a moment letting the days fatigue melt away her future seemed so much more clear she was to visit rhuidean pass through the crystal columns then return and claim her share of rands heart she would fight at the last battle she would help preserve the remnant of the aiel who survived then bring them home where they belonged a sound came from outside her camp aviendha opened her eyes and jumped up embracing the source a piece of her was pleased that she now instinctively looked to the one power rather than spears that were not there she wove a globe of light a woman stood in the darkness nearby wearing aiel garb not cadinsor or the garb of a wise one but normal clothing a dark skirt and a tan blouse and shawl a kerchief on her graying hair she was middleaged and carried no weapons she was still aviendha glanced to the sides was this an ambush or was this woman a specter one of the dead walking why hadnt aviendha heard her approach greetings wise one the woman said bowing her head might i share water with you i am traveling far and saw your fire the woman had furrowed skin and she could not channelaviendha could sense that easily i am not yet a wise one aviendha said wary i currently take my second path into rhuidean then you will soon find much honor the woman said i am nakomi i promise that i mean you no harm child suddenly aviendha felt foolish the woman had approached without weapons drawn aviendha had been distracted by her thoughts that was why she hadnt heard nakomi approach of course please thank you nakomi said stepping into the light and setting down her pack beside the small fire she clicked her tongue then drew some small branches out of her pack to build up the flames she removed a pot for tea might i have some of that water aviendha got out a waterskin she could hardly spare a dropshe was still several days from rhuideanbut it would give offense not to respond to the request after offering to share shade nakomi took the waterskin and filled her teapot which she then set beside the fire to warm it is an unexpected pleasure nakomi said rifling through her pack to cross the path of one on her way to rhuidean tell me was your apprenticeship long too long aviendha said though primarily because of my own stubbornness ah nakomi said you have the air of a warrior about you child tell me are you from among those who went west the ones who joined the one named the caracarn he is the caracarn aviendha said i did not say that he was not nakomi said sounding amused she got out some tea leaves and herbs no she hadnt said so aviendha turned her shellback and her stomach rumbled shed need to share her meal with nakomi as well may i ask nakomi said what do you think of the caracarn i love him aviendha thought immediately but she couldnt say that i think he has much honor and though he is ignorant of the proper ways he is learning you have spent time with him then some aviendha said then to be more honest she added more than most he is a wetlander nakomi said thoughtful and caracarn tell me are the wetlands as glorious as so many say rivers so wide you cannot see the other side plants so full of water they burst when squeezed the wetlands are not glorious aviendha said they are dangerous they make us weak nakomi frowned who is this woman it was not unusual to find aiel traveling the waste even children learned to protect themselves but should nakomi not be traveling with friends family she did not wear the clothing of a wise one but there was something about her nakomi stirred the tea then repositioned aviendhas shellback placing it over the coals to cook it more evenly from inside her pack she drew forth several deepearth roots aviendhas mother had always cooked those nakomi placed them in a small ceramic baking box then slid this into the coals aviendha hadnt realized the fire had grown so warm where had all those coals come from you seem troubled nakomi said far be it for me to question an apprentice wise one but i do see worry in your eyes aviendha stifled a grimace she would have preferred to be left alone and yet she had invited this woman to share her water and shade i am worried about our people dangerous times come the last battle nakomi said softly the thing the wetlanders speak of yes i worry about something beyond that the wetlands corrupting our people making them soft but the wetlands are part of our destiny are they not the things the caracarn is said to have revealed they link us to the wetlands in curious ways assuming what he said was true he would not lie about this aviendha said a small wake of buzzards cawed and flapped past in the dark night air aviendhas peoples historythe things rand althor had revealedstill caused many of the aiel grief in rhuidean aviendha would soon see this history for herself that the aiel had broken their vows aviendhas people had once followed then abandoned the way of the leaf interesting thoughts you raise apprentice nakomi said pouring the tea our land here is called the threefold land threefold for the three things it did to us it punished us for sin it tested our courage it formed an anvil to shape us the threefold land makes us strong so by leaving it we become weak but if we had to come here to be forged into something of strength nakomi said does that not suggest that the tests we were to facein the wetlandswere as dangerous as the threefoldland itself so dangero and difficult that we had to come here to prepare for them she shook her head ah but i should not argue with a wise one not even an apprentice i have toh there is never toh for speaking wise words aviendha said tell me nakomi where is it you travel which sept is your own i am far from my roof the woman said wistful yet not far at all perhaps is far from me i cannot answer your question apprentice for it is not my place to give this truth aviendha frowned what kind of answer was that it seems to me nakomi said that by breaking our ancient oaths to do no violence our people have gained great toh yes aviendha said what did you do when your entire people had done something so awful this realization was what had caused so many of the aiel to be taken by the bleakness they had thrown down their spears or refused to remove the white of gaishain implying that their people had such great toh it could never be met but they were wrong the aiel toh could be metit had to be met that was the purpose of serving the caracarn the representative of the ones to whom the aiel had originally sworn their oaths we will meet our toh aviendha said by fighting in the last battle the aiel would therefore regain their honor once you paid toh you forgot it to remember a fault that had been repaidwas arrogant they would be finished they could return and no longer feel shame for what had happened in the past aviendha nodded to herself and so nakomi said handing over a cup of tea the threefold land was our punishment we came here to grow so that we could meet our toh yes aviendha said it felt clear to her so once we have fought for the caracarn we will have met that toh and therefore will have no reason to be punished further if that is the case why would we return to this land would that not be like seeking more punishment once toh is met aviendha froze but no that was silly she did not want to argue with nakomi on the point but the aiel belonged in the threefold land people of the dragon nakomi said sipping her tea that is what we are serving the dragon was the point behind everything we did our customs our raids on each other our harsh training our very way of life yes aviendha said and so nakomi said softly once sightblinder is defeated what is left for us perhaps this is why so many refused to follow the caracarn because they worried at what it meant why continue the old ways how do we find honor in raiding in killing one another if we are no longer prenaring for such an important task why grow harder for the sake of being hard itself i im sorry nakomi said ive let myself ramble again i am prone to it i fear here let us eat aviendha started surely the roots werent done yet however nakomi pulled them out and they smelled wonderful she cut the shellback fishing a pair of tin plates from her pack she seasoned the meat and roots then passed a plate to aviendha she tasted hesitantly the food was delicious wonderful even better than many a feast shed had in fine palaces back in the wetlands she stared at the plate amazed if youll excuse me nakomi said i need to see to nature she smiled rising then shuffled off into the darkness aviendha ate quietly disturbed by what had been said was not a wonderful meal like this cooked over a fire and made from humble ingredients proof that the luxury of the wetlands wasnt needed but what was the purpose of the aiel now if they did not wait for the caracarn what did they do fight yes and then continue to kill one another on raids to what end she finished her meal then thought for a long time too long nakomi did not return worried aviendha went to search for her but found no trace of the woman upon returning to the fire aviendha saw that nakomis pack and plate were gone she waited up for a time but the woman did not return eventually aviendha went to sleep feeling troubled chapter a making perrin sat alone on a tree stump eyes closed and face to the dark sky the camp was situated the gateway closed and reports taken perrin finally had time to rest that was dangerous resting let him think thinking brought him memories memories brought pain he could smell the world on the wind layers of scents swirling together the camp around him sweaty people spices for cooking soaps for cleaning horse dung emotions the hills around them dried pine needles mud from a stream the carcass of a dead animal the world beyond hints of dust from the distant road a stand of lavender that somehow survived in the dying world there was no pollen there were no wolves both seemed terrible signs to him he felt sick physically ill as if his stomach were filled with muddy swamp water rotting moss and bits of dead beetles he wanted to scream he wanted to find slayer and kill him pound fists on the mans face until the blood engulfed it footsteps approached faile perrin do you want to talk he opened his eyes he should be crying screaming but he felt so cold cold and furious those two didnt go together for him his tent had been set up nearby its flaps fluttered in the wind nearby gaul reclined against a leatherleaf sapling in the distance one of the farriers worked late soft peals in the night i failed faile perrin whispered you got the terangreal she said kneeling beside him you saved the people and still slayer beat us he said bitterly a pack of five of us together werent enough to fight him perrin had felt this way when hed found his family dead killed by trollocs how many was the shadow going to take from him by the time this was done hopper should have been safe in the wolf dream foolish cub foolish cub had there even really been a trap for perrins army slayers dreamspike could have been meant for another purpose entirely just a coincidence there are no coincidences for taveren he needed to find something to do with his anger and his pain he stood turning and was surprised to see how many lights still shone in camp a group of people waited nearby far enough away from him that he hadnt made out their scents specifically alliandre in a golden gown berelain in blue both sat on chairs beside a small wooden travel table set with a lantern elyas sat on a rock beside them sharpening his knife a dozen of the two rivers menwil alseen jon ayellin and grayor frenn among themhuddled around a firepit glancing at him even arganda and gallenne were there speaking softly they should be sleeping perrin said theyre worried about you faile said she smelled worried as well and theyre worried you will send them away now that gateways work again fools perrin whispered fools to follow me fools not to hide youd really have them do that faile said angry cower someplace while the last battle happens didnt you say every man would be needed she was right every man would be needed he realized that part of his frustration was that he didnt know what hed escaped hed gotten away but from what for what had hopper died not knowing the enemys plan made perrin feel blind he walked away from the stump over to where arganda and gallenne were talking bring me our map he said of the jehannah road arganda called over hirshanin and told him where to find one hirshanin ran off and perrin began to walk through camp toward the sound of metal hitting metal the farrier working perrin seemed drawn to it the scents of camp swirled around him the sky rumbling above him the others trailed after him faile berelain and alliandre the two rivers men elyas gaul the group grew other two rivers men joining it nobody spoke and perrin ignored them until he came to aemin working at an anvil one of the camps horsepulled forges set up beside him and burning with a red light hirshanin caught up to perrin as he arrived carrying the map perrin unrolled it holding it before him as aemin stopped his work smellin curious arganda gallenne perrin said tell me if you were going to set up the best ambush for a large group moving along this road toward lugard where would you place it here arganda said without hesitation pointing to a location several hours from where theyd been camping see here the road turns to follow an old driedout streambed an army passing through there would be totally exposed to an ambush youd be able to attack them from the heights here and here gallenne nodded yes this is marked as an excellent place for a large group to camp at the base of that hill where the road bends but if someones on the heights above with a mind to do you harm you might not wake up in the morning arganda nodded the heights rose flattopped to the north of the road the old riverbed had cut a wide level pathway that was washed out to the south and west you could fit an army on those heights what are these perrin asked pointing to some marks south of the road old ruins arganda said nothing of relevance theyve degraded too far to provide cover theyre really just a few mosscovered boulders perrin nodded something was coming together for him are grady and neald asleep he asked no berelain said they said they wanted to stay awake just in case i think your mood gave them a fright send for them perrin said to nobody in particular one of them needs to check on the whitecloak army i remember someone telling me they had broken camp he didnt wait to see if the order was followed he stepped up to the forge laying a hand on aemins shoulder get some sleep aemin i need something to work on horseshoes is it the man nodded looking perplexed perrin took the mans apron and gloves and aemin departed perrin got out his own hammer the hammer hed been given in tear a hammer that had been used to kill but hadnt been used to create in such a long time the hammer could be either a weapon or a tool perrin had a choice just as everyone who followed him had a choice hopper had a choice the wolf had made that choice risking more in defense of the light than any humansave perrinwould ever understand perrin used the tongs to pull a small length of metal from the coals then placed it on the anvil he raised his arm and began to pound it had been a long time since hed found his way to a forge in fact the last he could remember doing any substantial work at one was back in tear on that peaceful day when hed left his responsibilities for a short time and worked at that smithy you are like a wolf husband faile had told him that referring to how focused he became that was a thing of wolves they could know the past and the future yet keep their attention on the hunt could he do the same allow himself to be consumed when needed yet keep balance in other parts of his life the work began to absorb him the rhythmic beating of hammer on metal he flattened the length of iron occasionally returning it to the coals and getting out another one working on several shoes at once he had the measurements nearby for the sizes of what was needed he slowly bent the metal against the side of the anvil shaping it his arms began to sweat his face warmed by the fire and the work neald and grady arrived along with the wise ones and masuri as perrin worked he noticed them sending sulin through a gateway to check on the whitecloaks she returned a short time later but delayed her report since perrin was busy with his work perrin held up a horseshoe then frowned this wasnt difficult enough work it was soothing yes but today he wanted something more challenging he felt a need to create as if to balance the destruction hed seen in the world the destruction hed helped create there were several lengths of unworked steel stacked beside the forge finer material than what was used for shoes they were probably waiting to be turned into swords for the former refugees perrin took several of those lengths of steel and set them into coals this forge wasnt as nice as what he was accustomed to though he had a bellows and three barrels for quenching the wind cooled the metal and the coals didnt get as hot as hed like he watched with dissatisfaction i can help you with that lord perrin neald said from the side heat the metal up if you want perrin eyed him then nodded he plucked out a length of steel holding it up with his tongs i want it a nice yellowred not so hot it goes white mind you neald nodded perrin set the bar on the anvil took out his hammer and began to pound again neald stood at the side concentrating perrin lost himself in the work foige the steel all else faded the rhythmic pounding of hammer on metal like the beating of his heart that shimmering metal warm and dangerous in that focus he found clarity the world was cracking breaking further each day it needed help right now once a thing shattered you couldnt put it back together neald gradys voice said it was urgent but distant to perrin neald what are you doing i dont know neald replied it feels right perrin continued to pound harder and harder he folded the metal flattening pieces against one another it was wonderful the way the ashaman kept it at exactly the right temperature that freed perrin from needing to rely on only a few moments of perfect temperature between heatings the metal seemed to flow almost as if shaped by his will alone what was he making he took the other two lengths out of the flames then began to switch between the three the firstand largesthe folded upon itself molding it using a process known as shrinking where he increased its girth he made it into a large ball then added more steel to it until it was nearly as large as a mans head the second he drew making it long and thin then folded it into a narrow rod the final smallest piece he flattened he breathed in and out his lungs working like bellows his sweat was like the quenching waters his arms were like the anvil he was the forge wise ones i need a circle neald said urgently now dont argue i need it sparks began to fly as perrin pounded larger showers with each blow he felt something leaking from him as if each blow infused the metal with his own strength and also his own feelings both worries and hopes these flowed from him into the three unwrought pieces the world was dying he couldnt save it that was rands job perrin just wanted to go back to his simple life didnt he no no he wanted faile he wanted complexity he wanted life he couldnt hide any more than the people who followed him could hide he didnt want their allegiance but he had it how would he feel ii someone else took command and then got them killed blow after blow sprays of sparks too many as if he were pounding against a bucket of molten liquid sparks splashed in the air exploding from his hammer flying as high as treetops and spreading tens of paces the people watching withdrew all save the ashaman and wise ones who stood gathered around neald i dont want to lead them perrin thought but if i dont who will if i abandon them and they fall then it will be my fault perrin saw now what he was making what hed been trying to make all along he worked the largest lump into a brick shape the long piece beame a rod thick as three fingers the flat piece became a capping bracket a piece of metal to wrap around the head and join it to the shaft a hammer he was making a hammer these were the parts he understood now he grew to his task blow after blow those beats were so loud each blow seemed to shake the ground around him rattling tents perrin exulted he knew what he was making he finally knew what he was making he hadnt asked to become a leader but did that absolve him of responsibility people needed him the world needed him and with an understanding that cooled in him like molten rock forming into a shape he realized that he wanted to lead if someone had to be lord of these people he wanted to do it himself because doing it yourself was the only way to see that it was done right he used his chisel and rod shaping a hole through the center of the hammers head then grabbed the haft andraising it far over his head slammed it down into place he took the bracket and laid the hammer on it then shaped it mere moments ago this process had fed off his anger but now it seemed to draw forth his resolution his determination metal was something alive every blacksmith knew this once you heated it while you worked it it lived he took his hammer and chisel and began to shape patterns ridges modifications waves of sparks flew from him the ringing of his hammer ever stronger ever louder pealing like bells he used his chisel on a small chunk of steel to form a shape then placed it down on top of the hammer with a roar he raised his old hammer one last time over his head and beat it down on the new one imprinting the ornamentation upon the side of the hammer a leaping wolf perrin lowered his tools on the anvilstill glowing with an inner heatwas a beautiful hammer a work beyond anything hed ever created or thought that he might create it had a thick powerful head like a maul or sledge but the back was formed crossface and flattened like a blacksmiths tool it was four feet from bottom to top maybe longer an enormous size for a hammer of this type the haft was all of steel something hed never seen on a hammer before perrin picked it up he was able to lift it with one hand but barely it was heavy solid the ornamentation was of a crosshatch pattern with the leaping wolf stamped on one side it looked like hopper perrin touched it with a cal lused thumb and the metal quieted it still felt warm to the touch but did not burn him he turned to look and was amazed at the size of the crowd watching him the two rivers men stood at the front jori congar azi althone wil alseen and hundreds more ghealdanin cairhienin andorans mayeners watching quiet the ground around perrin was blackened from the falling sparks drops of silvery metal spread out from him like a sunburst neald fell to his knees panting his face coated with sweat grady and the women of the circle sat down looking exhausted all six wise ones had joined in what had they done perrin felt exhausted as if all of his strength and emotion had been forged into the metal but he could not rest wil weeks ago i gave you an order burn the banners that bore the wolfhead did you obey did you burn every one wil alseen met his eyes then looked down ashamed lord perrin i tried but light i couldnt do it i kept one the one id helped sew fetch it wil perrin said his own voice sounded like steel wil ran smelling frightened he returned shortly bearing a folded cloth white with a red border perrin took it then held it in a reverent hand hammer in the other he looked at the crowd faile was there hands clasped before her she smelled hopeful she could see into him she knew i have tried to send you away perrin announced to the crowd you would not go i have failings you must know this if we march to war i will not be able to protect you all i will make mistakes he looked across the crowd meeting the eyes of those who stood there each man or woman he looked at nodded silently no regrets no hesitations they nodded perrin took a deep breath if you wish this i will accept your oaths i will lead you they cheered him an enormous roar of excitement goldeneyes goldeneyes the wolf to the last battle taishar manetheren wil perrin bellowed holding up the banner raise this banner high dont take it down again until the last battle has been won i march beneath the sign of the wolf the rest of you rouse the camp get every soldier ready to fight we have another task tonight the young man took the banner and unfurled it jori and azi joining him and holding it so it didnt touch the ground they raised it high running to get a pole the group broke up men running this way and that shouting the summons perrin took faile by the hand as she walked up to him she smelled satisfied thats it then no more complaining he promised i dont like it but i dont like killing either ill do what must be done he looked down at the anvil blackened from his work his old hammer now worn and dented lay across it he felt sad to leave it but he had made his decision what did you do neald he asked as the ashamanstill looking pale stumbled up to his feet perrin raised the new hammer showing the magnificent work i dont know my lord neald said it just well it was like i said it felt right i saw what to do how to put the weaves into the metal itself it seemed to draw them in like an ocean drinking in the water of a stream he blushed as if he thought it a foolish figure of speech that sounds right perrin said it needs a name this hammer do you know much of the old tongue no my lord perrin looked at the wolf imprinted on the side does anyone know how you say he who soars i i dont mahalleinir berelain said stepping up from where shed been watching mahalleinir perrin repeated it feels right sulin what of the whitecloaks they have made camp perrin aybara the maiden replied show me he said gesturing to argandas map she pointed out the location a piece of land on the side of a hill heights running to the north of it roadway coming in from the northeast wrapping around the south of the heightsfollowing the ancient riverbedand then bending southward when it hit the campsite by the hill from there the road headed toward lugard but the campsite was protected from wind on two sides it was a perfect campsite but also a perfect place for an ambush the one arganda and gallenne had pointed out he looked at that passageway and campsite thinking of what had happened the last few weeks we met travelers said that the muds to the north were almost completely impassable with wagons or carts a flock of sheep running before the pack into the jaws of a beast faile and the others walking toward a cliff light grady neald perrin said im going to need another gateway can you manage i think so neald said just give us a few minutes to catch our breath very well position it here perrin pointed to the heights above the whitecloaks camp gaul as usual the aiel man waited nearby he loped up i want you to go speak with dannil arganda gallenne i want the entire army to cross through as quickly as possible but they are to keep quiet we move with as much stealth as an army this size can manage gaul nodded running off gallenne was still nearby gaul started by speaking with him faile watched perrin smelling curious and a little anxious what are you planning husband its time for me to lead perrin said he looked one last time at his old hammer and laid fingers on its haft then he hefted mahalleinir to his shoulder and strode away feet crackling on drops of hardened steel the tool he left behind was the hammer of a simple blacksmith that person would always be part of perrin but he could no longer afford to let him lead from now on he would carry the hammer of a king faile ran her fingers across the anvil as perrin strode away calling further orders to prepare the army did he realize how hed looked standing amid those showers of sparks each blow of his hammer causing the steel before him to pulse and flare to life his golden eyes had blazed as brightly as the steel each peal of the hammer had been nearly deafening it has been many centuries since this land has seen the creation of a powerwrought weapon berelain said most others had left to follow perrins orders and the two were alone save for gallenne standing nearby and studying the map while rubbing his chin it is a strong talent the young man just displayed this will be of use perrins army will have powerwrought blades to strengthen them the process seemed very draining faile said even if neald can repeat what he did i doubt we will have time to make many weapons every small advantage helps berelain said this army your husband has forged it will be something incredible taveren is at work here he gathers men and they learn with amazing speed and skill perhaps faile said walking around the anvil slowly keeping her eyes on berelain who strolled around it opposite her what was berelains game here then we must speak with him berelain said turn him from this course of action this course of action faile asked genuinely confused berelain stopped her eyes alight with something she seemed tense shes worried faile thought worried deeply about something lord perrin must not attack the whitecloaks berelain said please you must help me persuade him hes not going to attack them faile said she was reasonably certain of that hes setting up a perfect ambush berelain said ashaman to use the one power two rivers bowmen to shoot from the heights down on the camp of the children cavalry to ride down and sweep up after she hesitated seeming pained hes set them up perfectly he told them that if he and damodred both survived the last battle hed submit to punishment but perrin is going to make certain the whitecloaks dont reach the last battle he can keep his oath that way but also avoid turning himself in faile shook her head hed never do that berelain can you be certain berelain asked absolutely certain faile hesitated perrin had been changing lately most of the changes were good ones such as his decision to finally accept leadership and the ambush berelain spoke of would make a kind of perfect ruthless sense but it was also wrong terribly wrong perrin wouldnt do that no matter how much hed changed of that faile could be certain yes she said giving a promise to galad then slaughtering the whitecloaks in this way it would rip perrin apart he doesnt think that way it wont happen i hope that you are right berelain said i had hoped some sort of accommodation could be reached with their commander before we left a whitecloak light couldnt she have picked one of the noblemen in camp to give her attentions to one who wasnt married you arent very good at picking men are you berelain the words just slipped out berelain turned back to faile eyes widening in either shock or anger and what of perrin a terrible match for you faile said with a sniff youve shown that tonight by what you think he is capable of how good a match he was is irrelevant i was promised him by whom the lord dragon berelain said what i came to the dragon reborn in the stone of tear she said but he would not have mehe even grew angry with my advances i realized that he the dragon reborn intended to marry a much higher lady probably elayne trakand it makes sensehe cannot take every realm by the sword some will have to come to him through alliances andor is very powerful is ruled by a woman and would be advantageous to hold through marriage perrin says rand doesnt think like that berelain faile said not so calculating its my inclination too from what i know of him and you say the same thing about perrin youd have me believe theyre all so simple without a wit in their heads i didnt say that and yet you use the same old protests tiring well i realized what the lord dragon was implying so i turned my attentions toward one of his close attendants perhaps he did not promise them to me that was a poor choice of words but i knew he would be pleased if i made a union with one of his close allies and friends indeed i suspect that he wished me to do itafter all the lord dragon did place me and perrin together for this mission he could not be frank about what he desired however so as to not offend perrin faile hesitated on one hand what berelain said was purely foolish but on the other she could see what the woman might have seen or perhaps what she wished to see to her breaking apart a husband and wife was nothing immoral this was politics and logically rand probably should have wanted to tie nations to him through bonds of marriage to those closest to him that didnt change the fact that neither he nor perrin regarded matters of the heart in such a way i have given up on perrin berelain said i hold to my promise there but it leaves me in a difficult situation i have long thought that a connection to the dragon reborn is mayenes only hope in maintaining independence in the coming years marriage isnt only about claiming political advantages faile said and yet the advantages are so obvious that they cannot be ignored and this whitecloak faile asked halfbrother of the queen of andor berelain said blushing slightly if the lord dragon does intend to marry elayne trakand this will give me a link to him it was much more than that faile could see it in the way berelain acted in the way she looked when she spoke of galad damodred but if she wanted to rationalize a political motivation for it faile had no reason to dissuade her so long as it helped distract her from perrin i have done as you asked berelain said and so now i ask your aid if it appears that he is going to attack them please join me in trying to dissuade him together perhaps we can manage it very well faile said perrin rode at the head of an army that felt unified for the first time the flag of mayene the flag of ghealdan the banners of noble houses from among the refugees even a few banners the lads had made up representing the parts of the two rivers above them all flapped the wolfhead lord perrin he would never get used to that but maybe that was a good thing he trotted stepper over to the side of the open gateway as the troops marched past saluting they were lit by torches for now hopefully the channelers would be able to light the battlefield later a man came up beside stepper and perrin smelled animal pelts loam and rabbits blood elyas had gone hunting while he waited for the army to gather it took quite a keen hunter to catch rabbits at night elyas said it was a better challenge you said something to me once elyas perrin said you told me that if i ever grew to like the axe i should throw it away that i did i think it applies to leadership too the men who dont want titles should be the ones who get them it seems so long as i keep that in mind i think i might do all right elyas chuckled the banner looks good hanging up there it fits me always has i just havent always fit it deep thoughts for a blacksmith perhaps perrin pulled the blacksmiths puzzle from his pocket the one hed found in maiden he still hadnt managed to get the thing apart has it ever struck you as odd that blacksmiths seem like such simple folk yet theyre the ones who make all of these blasted puzzles that are so hard to figure out never thought of it like that so youre one of us finally no perrin said putting the puzzle away i am who i am finally he wasnt certain what had changed within him but perhaps trying to think it through too much had been the problem in the first place he knew that hed found his balance he would never become like noam the man who had lost himself to the wolf and that was enough perrin and elyas waited for a time watching the army pass these larger gateways made it much easier to travel theyd have all of the fighting men and women through in under an hour men raised hands to perrin smelling proud his connection to the wolves did not frighten them in fact they actually seemed less worried now that they knew the specifics of it before there had been speculation questions now they could begin to grow comfortable with the truth and proud of it their lord was no ordinary man he was something special i need to leave perrin elyas said tonight if i can i know the last hunt has begun go with them elyas we will meet in the north the aging warder laid a hand on perrins shoulder if we dont see one another there perhaps well meet in the dream my friend this is the dream perrin said smiling and we will meet again i will find you if you are with the wolves hunt well long tooth hunt well young bull elyas vanished into the darkness with barely a rustle perrin reached down to the warm hammer at his side he had thought that responsibility would be another weight upon him and yet now that he had accepted it he actually felt lighter perrin aybara was just a man but perrin goldeneyes was a symbol created by the people who followed him perrin didnt have a choice about that all he could do was lead the best he could if he didnt the symbol wouldnt vanish the people would just lose faith in it as poor aram had im sorry my friend he thought you i failed most of all there was no point in looking backward at that he would simply have to continue forward and do better im perrin goldeneyes he said the man who can speak to wolves and i guess thats a good person to be he kicked stepper through the gateway unfortunately perrin goldeneyes had some killing to do tonight galad awoke as soon as his tent flap rustled he drove away the vestiges of his dreama silly thing of him dining with a darkhaired beauty with perfect lips and cunning eyesand reached for his sword galad a voice hissed it was trom whats wrong galad asked hand still on his sword you were right trom said about what aybaras army is back galad theyre on the heights just above us we only caught sight of them by accident our men were watching along the road as you told us galad cursed sat up and reached for his smallclothes how did they get up there without us seeing dark powers galad byar was right you saw how fast their camp emptied their scouts had returned an hour before theyd found aybaras campsite eerily empty as if it had been populated by ghosts nobody had seen them leave along the road now this galad dressed quickly rouse the men see if you can do it quietly you were wise to bring no light that might have alerted the enemy have the men put on their armor inside their tents yes my lord captain commander trom said a rustling accompanied his departure galad hurried to dress what have i done every step of the way hed been confident in his choices yet this was where they had led him aybara positioned to attack galads men asleep ever since morgase had returned galad had felt his world crumbling what was right was no longer clear to him not as it had once been the way ahead seemed clouded we should surrender he thought affixing his cloak in place over his mail but no children of the light never give in to darkfriends how could i think that they had to die fighting but what would that accomplish the end of the children dead before the last battle began his tent flaps rustled again and he had his sword out ready to strike galad byar said youve killed us all respect was gone from his voice the accusation set galad on edge those who walk in the light must take no responsibility for the actions of those who follow the shadow a quote from lothair mantelar i have acted with honor you should have attacked instead of going through that ridiculous trial we would have been slaughtered he had aes sedai aiel men who can channel more soldiers than us and powers we dont understand the light would have protected us and if that is true it will protect us now galad said confidence strengthening no byar said voice an angry whisper we have led ourselves to this if we fall it will be deserved he left with a rustle of the flaps galad stood for a moment then buckled on his sword recrimination and repentance would wait he had to find a way to survive this day if there was a way counter their ambush with one of their own he thought have the men stay their tents until the attack starts then surprise aybara by rushing out in force and no aybara would start with arrows raining death on the tents it would be the best way to take advantage of his high ground and his long bowmen the best thing to do was get the men armored then have them break from their tents together on a signal and run for their horses the arnadicians could form a pikewall at the base of the heights aybara might risk running cavalry down the steep slope leading up to the rise but pikemen could upset that maneuver archers would still be a problem shields would help a little he took a deep breath then strode into the night to give the orders once the battle begins perrin said i want you three to retreat to safety i wont try to send you back to andor i know you wouldnt go but youre not to participate in the battle stay behind the battle lines and with the rear guard faile glanced at him he sat his mount eyes forward they stood atop the heights the last of his army emerging from the gateways positioned behind jori congar held a shielded lantern for perrin it gave the area a very faint light of course my lord berelain said smoothly ill have your oaths on it then perrin said eyes still forward you and alliandre berelain faile ill simply ask and hope you have my oath my lord alliandre said perrins voice was so firm and that worried faile could berelain be right was he going to attack the whitecloaks they were an unpredictable element for all their professions of wanting to fight in the last battle they could cause more harm than help beyond that alliandre was perrins liege woman and the whitecloaks were in her realm who knew what damage they would cause before they left beyond that there was the future sword of galads judgment my lord berelain said sounding worried please dont do this im only doing what i must perrin said looking along the roadway that ran toward jehannah that wasnt the direction of the whitecloaks they were just south of perrins position perrin faile said glancing at berelain what are you a man suddenly emerged from the shadows making no sound despite the dried underbrush perrin aybara gaul said the whitecloaks know were here are you certain perrin asked he didnt seem alarmed they are trying not to let us know gaul said but i can see it the maidens agree they are preparing for battle the grooms unhobbling the horses guards moving from tent to tent perrin nodded he nudged stepper forward through the brush riding right up to the edge of the heights faile moved daylight up behind him berelain staying close to her the land sloped steeply down to the ancient riverbed that flanked the roadway below the road ran from the direction of jehannah until it passed the base of these heights and took a turn in the direction of lugard right at the bend was the hollow sheltered against the hill where the whitecloaks had arranged their circles of tents the clouds were thin allowing pale moonlight to coat the land in silvery white a low fog was rolling in staying mainly in the riverbed deep and thick perrin scanned the scene he had a clear view of the road in both directions suddenly shouts rang out below men bursting from the whitecloak tents and sprinting toward horselines torches flared to life archers forward perrin bellowed the two rivers men scrambled to the edge of their elevated position infantry ready behind the archers perrin yelled arganda on the left flank gallenne on the right ill call if i need you to sweep for us he turned to the foot soldiersmainly former refugees keep in a tight formation boys keep your shields up and your spear arms flexed archers arrows to bow faile felt herself start to sweat this was wrong surely perrin wasnt going to he still wasnt looking at the whitecloaks below them he was staring at the riverbed on the other side perhaps a hundred yards or so beyond the heights which ended in a steep dropoff because of the ancient rivers washing perrin looked as if seeing something the rest of them werent and with those golden eyes of his perhaps he was doing just that my lord berelain said moving her horse up beside him sounding desperate if you must attack could you spare the commander of the whitecloaks he might be useful for political reasons what are you talking about perrin said the whole reason im here is to keep damodred alive you what berelain asked my lord grady suddenly exclaimed riding nearby i sense channeling whats that there jori congar yelled pointing something in the fog its faile squinted there just below the army in the former riverbed figures began to rise as if from the ground misshapen creatures with animal heads and bodies half again as tall as perrin bearing brutish weapons moving among them were sleek eyeless figures in black fog streamed around them as they strode forward trailing wisps the creatures continued to appear dozens of them hundreds thousands an entire army of trollocs and myrddraal grady neald perrin bellowed light brilliant white globes appeared in the air and hung there more and more trollocs were rising from the fog as if it were spawning them but they seemed bewildered by the lights they looked up squinting and shielding their eyes perrin grunted how about that they werent ready for us they thought theyd have an easy shot at the whitecloaks he turned looking down the lines of surprised soldiers well men you wanted to follow me to the last battle were going to get a taste of it right here archers loose lets send those shadowspawn back to the pit that birthed them he raised his newly forged hammer and the battle began chapter an unexpected ally galad ran with his shield raised high bornhald joined him also holding a shield and tossing aside his lantern as those unnatural lights flared in the air neither spoke the hail of arrows would begin momentarily they reached the horse pickets where a pair of nervous grooms handed over their horses galad lowered his shield feeling terribly exposed as he swung onto stouts back he turned the horse and got the shield back up he could hear the familiar twang of bows distant arrows snapping as they rained down none fell near him he hesitated the lights hanging in the air made it bright as a night with a full moon maybe brighter whats going on bornhald said horse dancing nervously beneath him they missed those arrows are falling well outside of camp trollocs a shout from camp there are thousands of them coming down the roadway monsters a terrified amadician yelled monsters of the shadow light theyre real galad glanced at bornhald they galloped their horses to the of camp white cloaks streaming behind them and looked up the road at a slaughter waves of arrows fell from the heights crashing into the mob of shadowspawn the creatures howled and screeched some trying to run for galads camp others to climb toward the archers troilocs exploded suddenly into the air the ground heaving beneath them and fire fell from above aybaras channelers had joined the fight galad took it in foot form a shieldwall on this side of the camp he bellowed crossbowmen to those ruins there split the legions into eight cavalry companies and prepare to sally bowmen get ready the children were primarily a cavalry force his men would ride out hit the troilocs in waves one company at a time then retreat back behind the foots defensive shieldwall crossbowmen to weaken the trolloc lines before the heavy cavalry hit them with lances archers to cover them as they returned behind their defenses the orders were passed quickly the children moving more efficiently than the amadicians bornhald nodded this was a mostly defensive posture but that made the most sense at least until galad could sort through what was happening hoofbeats announced byar galloping up he reared his horse then turned eyes wide troilocs how its aybara hes brought an army of shadowspawn if he did galad said hes treating them to a slaughter byar edged closer its exactly like the two rivers dain you remember what he did troilocs attack aybara rallies a defense and therefore earns support what would be the point bornhald said to trick us by killing as many troilocs as it gains him in followers bornhald frowned it it makes no sense if aybara can command thousands of troilocs why would he need us his mind is sick twisted byar said if he didnt have something to do with the appearance of the troilocs then how did both show up right now at the same time well there was a grain a truth in that galad had to admit for now he said it gains us the time we need to form up bornhald byar help pass my orders i want the riders ready to sally as soon as the crossbowmen finish he hesitated but let the men know that we are not to expose our flanks to aybara keep some foot with pikes at the base of those heights just in case troilocs fell screaming under the arrows still more continued to appear and many of the beasts didnt fall until they had multiple arrows in them the shadowspawn were preparing for a rush up the incline toward perrins forces if they did hed have his foot hold for a timethen pull them back and run the cavalry sweep along in front of them how did you know faile asked softly he glanced at her its time for you three to retreat behind to the rear guard he glanced at berelain whitefaced on her horse as if seeing the trollocs had unhinged her he knew her to be of stronger steel than that however why did she smell so worried i will go faile said but i have to know it made sense perrin said that dome was meant to keep us from fleeing by gateway but it was also to encourage us along the road to keep us from traveling directly to andor it seemed odd to us that master gill would turn along the road disobeying ordersbut it happened because he was convinced by people coming from the north that the way was impassible plants by our enemies i suspect to lure us this direction we were being herded all along they werent waiting for us to engage the whitecloaks they were waiting for us to make for lugard as fast as we could if wed tried to go crosscountry ill bet something would have happened to turn us back they desperately wanted us walk into their ambush galads force probably wasnt part of ithe was a burr that got under their saddle but the trollocs where i think it must be a portal stone perrin said i knew some kind of attack was going to come here didnt know how i half thought it would be draghkar from the sky or a waygate wed missed but those ruins arganda pointed out seem like they might be a good place for a portal stone it must be buried having fallen under the river when it changed its course the trollocs arent coming out of the ground i think theyre appearing from the stone this was the trap they probably would have attacked us much earlier but the whitecloaks were in the way they had to wait for us to deal with them and then we left so so they attacked damodred and his men faile said after setting up the trap they at least wanted to do some damage to those who might fight later on i suspect one of the forsaken is behind this perrin said turning toward grady one of the forsaken alliandre said voice rising we cant fight one of the forsaken perrin glanced at her what did you think you were signing up to do alliandre when you joined me you fight for the dragon reborn in tarmon gaidon itself well have to face the forsaken sooner or later she paled but to her credit she nodded grady perrin called to the ashaman who was firing blasts down at the trollocs you still sense channeling only off and on my lord grady called back whoever it is theyre not terribly strong and theyre not joining the battle i think they must be doing something to bring the trollocs jumping in with fists of them then jumping away immediately to fetch more watch for him perrin said see if you can take him down yes my lord grady said saluting so it wasnt one of the forsaken bringing the trollocs directly that didnt mean this wasnt the work of one of them just that they hadnt decided to commit themselves directly back with you three perrin said to faile berelain and alliandre hefting his hammer the trollocs had begun charging up the rise many dropping to arrows but there were enough that some would reach the top soon it was time to fight you dont know how many of them there are my husband faile said softly they keep coming what if they overwhelm us well retreat through a gateway if things turn poor for us but im not letting them have the whitecloaks without a fighti wont leave any man to the trollocs not even their lot they ignored the two rivers when we were attacked well i wont do the same and thats that faile suddenly leaned over to kiss him thank you for what for being the man that you are she said turning her mount and leading the other two away perrin shook his head he had been worrying that hed need to have grady wrap her up in air and tow her away he turned back to the approaching trollocs the two rivers men werent making it easy for them to get up the incline the men were running out of arrows though perrin hefted mahalleinir a part of him felt sorry to bathe the weapon in blood so soon after its birth but the greater part of him was pleased these trollocs and those who led them had caused hoppers death a fist of trollocs crested the hilltop a fade moving in behind them led by another fade with a black sword perrin let out a roar and charged forward hammer held high galad cursed turning stout and chopping his sword down into the neck of trolloc with the head of a bear dark thick blood spurted out in a noisome gush but the beasts were terribly difficult to kill galad had heard the stories had trained with men who had fought shadowspawn still their resilience surprised him he had to hack at the creature three more times before it dropped already galad s arm was aching there was no finesse to fighting monsters like this he used horseback sword forms but often the most direct and brutal of them woodsman strips the branch arc of the moon striking the spark his men werent faring well they were boxed in and there was no longer room for lances the sallying attacks had worked for a time but the heavy cavalry had been forced to retreat back to the foot lines and his whole force was being pushed east the amadicians were being overwhelmed and the force of the attack was too great to allow further cavalry charges all the children on horseback could do was swing their weapons wildly in an attempt to stay alive galad turned stout but two snarling trollocs leaped for him he quickly took one across the neck with heron snatches the silvernsh but the creature fell forward onto stout causing the horse to lurch away another brute slashed a catchpole at the horses neck the horse fell galad barely managed to throw himself free hitting the ground in a heap as stout collapsed legs jerking neck spurting blood across his white shoulder galad rolled sword twisted to the side but he had landed wrong his ankle wrenched in pain ignoring the pain he brought his sword up in time to deflect the hook of a brownfurred monster nine feet tall that stank of death galads parry sent him off balance again galad figures in white crashed into the trollocs reeking blood sprayed in the air white figures tumbled to the ground but the trollocs were driven back bornhald stood panting sword out shield dented and sprayed with dark blood he had four men with him two others had fallen thank you galad said your mounts cut down bornhald said they must have orders to go after the horses dont want us escaping galad said or rallying a charge he glanced down the line of beleaguered soldiers twenty thousand had seemed a grand army but the battle lines were a mess and the trollocs continued to come wave after wave the northern section of the childrens line was breaking and the trollocs were pushing forward there with a pincer movement surround galads force theyd cut them off on the north and south to ram them against the hill light rally to the northern foot line galad yelled he ran in that direction as quickly as he could his ankle protesting but still functioning men joined with him their clothing was no longer white galad knew that most generals like gareth bryne didnt fight on the front lines they were too important for that and their minds were needed for organizing the fight perhaps that was what galad should have done it was falling apart his men were good solid but they were inexperienced with trollocs only nowcharging across muddy ground on a dark night lit by globes hanging in the airdid he see how inexperienced many of them were he had some veterans but the larger group had fought mostly against unruly bandits or city militias the trollocs were different the howling grunting snarling monsters were in a frenzy what they lacked in military discipline they made up for in strength and ferocity and hunger the myrddraal amid them were terrible enough to break a formation all on their own galads soldiers were buckling hold galad bellowed reaching the breaking section of the line he had bornhafd and about fifty men not nearly enough we are the children of the light we do not give before the shadow it didnt work watching the disaster play out his entire framework of understanding started to crack the children of the light were not protected by their goodness they were falling in swaths like grain before the scythe worse than that some did not fight valiantly or hold with resolve too many yelled in terror running the amadicians he could understand but a lot of the children themselves were little better they werent cowards they werent poor fighters they were just men average that wasnt how it was supposed to be thunder sounded as gallenne brought his horsemen around in another charge they hammered into the trolloc line and forced many of them off the edge tumbling them back down the incline perrin slammed maballeinir into a trollocs head the force of the blow tossed the creature to the side andoddlyits skin sizzled and smoked where the hammer had hit this happened with each blow as if the touch of mahalleinir burned them though perrin felt only a comfortable warmth from the hammer gallennes charge punched through the trolloc ranks separating them into two cohorts but there were so many carcasses it was getting difficult for his lancers to charge gallenne withdrew and a contingent of two rivers men moved in and shot arrows at the trollocs cutting them down in a wave of screaming howling reeking death perrin pulled stepper back foot soldiers forming around him very few of his men had fallen among the trollocs of course even one was too many arganda trotted up on his horse hed lost his helmets plumes somewhere but was smiling broadly ive rarely had such a pleasing battle aybara he said enemies to fell that you need not feel a sting of pity for a perfect staging area and defensible position archers to dream of and ashaman to stop the gaps ive laid down over two dozen of the beasts myself for this day alone im glad we followed you perrin nodded he didnt point out that one of the reasons they were having an easy time of it was that most of the trollocs were focused on the whitecloaks trollocs were nasty monstrous things and they had a fiercely selfish streak charge up the hillside at balls of fire and longbowmen only to try and seize ground from two full contingents of cavalry better to seek the easier foe and it made tactical sense too focus on the easier battle first when you had two fronts to fight on they were trying to crush the whitecloaks back against the hillside as quickly as possible and had swarmed them not leaving them room to ride their cavalry in charges separating groups of them the person leading this understood tactics this wasnt the work of trolloc minds lord perrin jori congars voice rose above the din of howling trollocs he scrambled up to steppers side you asked me to watch and tell you how they were doing well youll want to look maybe perrin nodded raising his fist then making a chopping motion grady and neald stood behind him on a rock formation that could look down toward the roadway their main orders were to take down any myrddraal they spotted perrin wanted to keep as many of those things as possible off the heights it could cost dozens of lives to kill a single myrddraal with the sword or axe best to kill with fire from a distance besides sometimes killing one of the fades would mean killing a complement of trollocs linked to it the ashaman aes sedai and wise ones saw perrins signal they began a full assault on the trollocs fire flying from hands lightning blasting from the sky pushing the trollocs back down the incline perrins for soldiers pulled back for a few moments rest perrin nudged stepper to the edge looking down the slope to the south holding mahalleinir down by his leg below damodreds force was doing even worse than perrin had worried the trollocs had drilled forward nearly dividing the whitecloaks into two sections the monsters were surging around the sides entrapping galad making the whitecloaks fight on three fronts their backs were to the hillside and many groups of cavalry had been cut off from the main body of fighting gallenne trotted up beside perrin the trollocs are still appearing id guess fifty thousand of the beasts so far the ashaman say theyve only sensed the one channeler and he isnt engaging the one leading the shadowspawn wont want to commit their channelers perrin guessed not with us having the high ground theyll leave the trollocs to do what damage they can and see if they gain the upper hand if they do we will see channelers come out gallenne nodded damodreds force is in trouble yes gallenne said you positioned us well to help them but it appears we werent enough im going down for them perrin decided he pointed the trollocs are surrounding him boxing him in against the hillside we could sweep down and surprise the beasts with a broadside breaking through and freeing damodreds men to get themselves up on the plateau here gallenne frowned pardon lord perrin but i must ask what is it that you feel you owe them i would have sorrowed if indeed wed come here to attack themthough i would have seen its logic but i see no reason to help them perrin grunted its just the right thing to do that is a subject of debate gallenne said shaking his helmeted head fighting the trollocs and fades is excellent for every one that falls is one fewer to face at the last battle our men get practice fighting them and can learn to control their fears but that slope is steep and treacherous if you try to ride down to damodred you could destroy our advantage im going anyway perrin said jori go get the two rivers men and the ashaman ill need them to soften the trollocs for my charge he looked down again memories of the two rivers flooded his mind blood death mahalleinir grew warmer in his fist i wont leave them to it gallenne not even them will you join me you are a strange man aybara gallenne hesitated and one of true honor yes i will good jori get moving we must reach damodred before his lines break a shock rippled through the mass of trollocs galad hesitated sword ripped in sweaty fingers his entire body ached moans came from all round him some guttural and snarlingtrollocs dyingsome piteous from fallen men the children near him were holding barely the night was dim even with those lights it felt like fighting nightmares but if the children of the light could not stand against darkness who could the trollocs began howling more loudly those in front of him turned speaking to one another in a crude snarling tongue that caused him to pull back in revulsion trollocs could speak he hadnt known that what had drawn their attention and then he saw it a hail of arrows falling from above ripped into ranks of the nearby trollocs the two rivers bowmen lived up to their reputation galad wouldnt have trusted most archers to shoot like that not without stray arrows falling on the whitecloaks these archers were precise however the trollocs screamed and howled then from the top of the rise a thousand horsemen charged lights flashed around them fires fell from above arcing down like redgolden lances they illuminated the horsemen in silver it was an incredible maneuver the incline was steep enough that horses could have tripped fallen tumbled the entire force into a useless mass of bodies but they didnt fall they galloped surefooted lances gleaming and at their front rode a bearded monster of a man with a large hammer held high perrin aybara himself above his head a banner flapping carried by a man riding just behind the crimson wolfhead despite himself galad lowered his shield at the sight aybara almost seemed aflame from the tongues of fire that surrounded him galad could see those wide golden eyes like fires themselves the horsemen crashed into the trollocs that had surrounded galads force aybara let out a roar over the din then began to lay about him with the hammer the attack forced the trollocs back assault galad yelled press the attack force them into the cavalry he charged northward toward the face of the heights bornhald at his side nearby trom rallied what was left of his legion and brought it around to attack the trollocs opposite aybara the fray grew increasingly chaotic galad fought furiously above incredibly aybaras entire army poured down the incline giving up the high ground they fell upon the trollocs tens of thousands of men yelling goldeneyes goldeneyes the attack put galad and bornhald into the trollocs ranks the creatures tried to pull back from aybara surging in all directions the men near galad and bornhald were soon fighting desperately to stay alive galad finished off a trolloc with ribbon in the air but spun and immediately found himself facing a ramfaced behemoth ten feet tall horns curled around the sides of its enormous square face but the eyes were human and the lower jaw as well galad ducked when it swung its catchpole then rammed his sword up into its gut the creature screamed and bornhald hamstrung it from the side galad yelled and leaped backward but his twisted ankle finally failed him it got caught in a cleft in the ground and galad heard a terrible snap as he fell the dying monster crashed down on him pinning him to the ground pain shot up his leg but he ignored it he dropped his sword trying to shove the carcass free bornhald swearing fended off a trolloc that had the snout of a boar it made a horrid grunting sound galad heaved off the stinking carcass to the side he could see men in whitetrom with byar at his side fighting desperately to reach galad there were so many trollocs and those children immediately nearby had mostly fallen galad reached for his sword just as a mounted figure burst through the shadows and trollocs just to the north aybara he rode up and pounded that massive hammer of his into a boar trolloc sending it crashing to the ground aybara leaped off his horse as bornhald scrambled over to help galad to his feet you are wounded aybara asked my ankle galad said on my horse aybara said galad didnt protest it made sense he did however feel embarrassed as bornhald helped him up aybaras men filled in around them pushing the trollocs back now that aybaras army had joined the fray galads men were rallying rushing down the slope had been a dangerous gamble but as soon as galad was astride aybaras horse he could see that the gamble had worked the massive charge had broken the trollocs apart and some groups started fleeting tongues of flame fell from above burning myrddraal and dropping entire fists of trollocs linked to them there was still a great deal of fighting to do but the tide was turning aybaras forces carved out a section around their leader giving himand by extension galadsome breathing room to consider the next stage of the attack galad turned to aybara who was studying the trollocs with keen eves i assume you think that saving me will influence my decision about your judgment galad said it had better aybara muttered galad raised an eyebrow it wasnt the response hed been expecting my men find it suspicious that you appeared so soon before the trollocs well they can think that if they want aybara said i doubt anything i say will change their minds in a way this is my fault the trollocs were here to kill me i just got away before they could spring their trap be glad i didnt leave you to them you whitecloaks have caused me nearly as much grief as they have oddly galad found himself smiling there was a straightforward air about this perrin aybara a man could ask for little more in an ally are we allies then galad thought nodding to trom and byar as they approached perhaps for now he did trust aybara yes perhaps there were men in the world who would put together an intricate plot like this one all to trick his way into galads favor valda had been like that aybara wasnt he really was straightforward if hed wanted the children out of his way hed have killed them and moved on then so be it perrin aybara galad said i name your punishment here this night at this moment perrin frowned turning away from his contemplation of the battle lines what now i deem as punishment that you pay blood price to the families of the dead children in the amount of five hundred crowns i also order you to frght in the last battle with all the strength you can muster do these things and i pronounce you cleansed of guilt it was an odd time for him to give this proclamation but he had made his decision they would still fight and perhaps one would fall galad wanted aybara to know the judgment in case aybara studied him then nodded i name that fair galad damodred he held up his hand creature of darkness someone moved behind aybara a figure pulling free his sword a hiss a flash of metal byars eyes alight with anger hed positioned himself right where he could strike aybara in the back aybara spun galad raised his sword both were too slow but jaret byars blow did not fall he stood with his weapon upraised frozen blood dribbling from his lips he fell to his knees then flopped onto the ground right at aybaras feet bornhald stood behind him eyes wide with horror he looked down at his sword i it wasnt right to strike a man in the back after he saved us it he dropped his sword stumbling back from byars corpse you did the right thing child bornhald galad said with regret he shook his head he was a fine officer unpleasant at times perhaps but also brave i am sorry to lose him aybara glanced to the sides as if looking for other children who might strike him from the beginning that one was looking for an excuse to see me dead bornhald looked at aybara eyes still hateful then cleaned his sword and rammed it into its sheath he walked away toward the area where the wounded had been taken the area around galad and aybara was increasingly safe the trollocs pushed back more solid battle lines forming made of aybaras men and the remaining children that one still thinks i killed his father aybara said no galad replied i think he believes that you did not but he has hated you for very long lord aybara and has loved byar longer he shook his head killing a friend it is sometimes painful to do what is right aybara grunted you should get to the wounded he said hefting his hammer and looking toward where the fighting was still thick i am well enough to fight if i have your mount well then lets be on with it aybara eyed him ill stay by you though just in case it looks like you might fall thank you im fond of the horse smiling galad joined him and they waded back into the melee chapter stronger than blood once again gawyn sat in the small unadorned room of egwenes quarters he was exhausted which wasnt surprising considering what hed been through healings included his attention was consumed by the new awareness inside of him that wonderful blossoming in the back of his mind that link to egwene and her emotions the connection was a wonder and a comfort sensing her let him know she was alive able to anticipate her approach he stood up as the door opened gawyn she said as she stepped in you shouldnt be standing up in your condition please sit im fine he said but did as commanded she pulled over the other stool sitting down in front of him she was calm and serene but he could sense that she was overwhelmed by events during the night servants were still dealing with the bloodstains and the bodies while chubain was holding the entire tower at alert checking on each and every sister one other assassin had turned up theyd lost two soldiers and a warder killing her yes he could feel her emotional tempest behind that calm face during the past few months gawyn had begun to think that maybe aes sedai lerned not to feel anything at all the bond gave him proof otherwise egwene did feel she merely didnt let her emotions touch her features looking at her face and feeling the storm inside gawyn was givenfor the first timeanother perspective on the warder and aes sedai relationship warders werent just bodyguards they were the onesthe only oneswho saw the truth of what happened within the aes sedai no matter how proficient the aes sedai became at hiding emotions her warder knew there was more than the mask you found mesaana he asked yes though it took some time she was impersonating an aes sedai named danelle of the brown ajah we found her in her room babbling like a child she had already soiled herself im not sure what we will do with her danelle i didnt know her she kept to herself egwene said which is probably why mesaana picked her they sat in silence for a few moments longer so egwene finally said how do you feel you know how i feel gawyn said honestly it was simply a means of beginning the conversation he smiled i feel wonderful amazing at peace and concerned and worried anxious like you something must be done about the seanchan i agree but thats not what is worrying you youre bothered by how i disobeyed you and yet you know it was the right thing to do you didnt disobey egwene said i did tell you to return the moratorium on guarding your room had not been lifted i could have unhinged plans caused a disturbance and scared off the assassins yes she said her emotions grew more troubled but instead you saved my life how did they get in gawyn asked shouldnt you have awakened when the maid tripped your alarms she shook her head i was deep within the dream fighting mesaana tower guards were within range to hear the alarms egwene said they have all been found dead it sounds like the assassins were expecting me to come running they had one of their members hiding in the entry room to kill me after i captured the other two she grimaced it might have worked i was anticipating the black ajah or maybe a gray man i sent warning the messenger has been found dead as well she eyed him you did the right thing tonight but it still has me worried well work it out galad said you let me protect you egwene and ill obey you in anything else i promise it egwene hesitated then nodded well ill need to go speak with the hall theyll be ready to break down my door and demand answers by now how could tell that on the inside she was grimacing it may help he said if you imply that my return was always part of the plan it was egwene said though the timing wasnt anticipated she hesitated when i realized how silviana had phrased my request that you return i was worried that you wouldnt come back at all i nearly didnt what made the difference i had to learn how to surrender its something ive never been good at egwene nodded as if understanding ill leave orders for a bed to be brought into this room i was always planning this to be my warders station gawyn smiled sleep in another room underneath it all there was still some of the conservative innkeepers daughter remaining egwene blushed as she sensed his thoughts why dont we get married gawyn said right here today light egwene youre amyrlinyour word is as good as law in tar valon speak the words and wed be wedded she paled odd how that would unsettle her this night gawyn felt a stab of anxiety shed said she loved him didnt she want tobut no he could feel her emotions she did love him then why egwene sounded aghast when she spoke you think i could face my parents if i got married without them knowing about it light gawyn well at least have to send for them and what about elayne youd marry without telling her he smiled youre right of course ill contact them i can egwene youre the amyrlin seat the weight of the world itself is on your shoulders let me make arrangements very well she said she stepped outside where silviana waitedshe had one of her glowers for gawyn egwene sent some servants for a bed for him then she and her keeper moved off a pair of chubains soldiers following gawyn would have liked to go with her there might still be assassins about unfortunately she was right to send him to sleep he was having trouble remaining upright he stood on unsteady legs then noticed a line of sheetcovered bodies outside they wouldnt be removed until sisters had a chance to look them over right now rinding mesaanaand looking for other assassinshad been more pressing gritting his teeth he forced himself to walk over and pull back the sheet revealing celarks and mazones lifeless facescelarks unfortunately sitting beside his body separated from it at the heck you did well men he said ill see that your families know that you saved the life of the amyrlin it made him angry to lose such good men burn those seanchan he thought egwene is right about them something needs to be done he glanced to the side to where the three assassins lay beneath sheets of their own blackslippered feet sticking out the bottom two women and a man wonder he thought then crossed to where they lay guards glanced at him as he pulled back the sheet but nobody forbade him the terangreal were easy to pick out though only because hed been told what to look for identical black stone rings worn on the middle fingers of their right hands the rings were carved in the shape of a vine with thorns apparently none of the aes sedai had recognized them for what they were at least not yet gawyn slipped all three rings off then tucked them into his pocket lan could feel something a distinct difference to the emotions in the back of his mind hed grown accustomed to ignoring those and the woman they represented lately those emotions had changed more and more he was certain that nynaeve had taken his bond he could identify her by the way she felt how could one not know her that sense of passion and kindness it felt remarkable he stared down the roadway it twisted around the side of a hill before turning straight toward a distinctive fortress ahead the border between kandor and arafel was marked by the silverwall keeps a large fortification built on two sides of firchon pass it was an extremely impressive fortressreally two of them each one built up the straight wall of the narrow canyonlike pass like two sides of an enormous doorway getting through the pass required traveling a considerable distance between large stone walls pocked with arrowslits and it would be effective at stopping armies moving in either direction they were all allies the borderlanders were but that didnt stop the arafellin from wanting a nice fortress blocking the way up to shol arbela camped in front of that fortress was a gathering of thousands of people clustered in smaller groups the flag of malkierthe golden craneflew over some of the groups others flew flags of kandor or arafel which of you broke your oath lan asked looking back at the caravan the men there shook their heads nobody needed to break his oath andere said what else would you do cut through the broken lands the uncapped hills it is here or nowhere they know this and so they wait for you lan growled it was probably true we are a caravan he said loudly remember if any ask you may admit that we are malkieri you may say you wait for your king that is truth you may not mention that you have found him the others seemed troubled but they made no objection lan led the way down the slope their caravan of twenty wagons warhorses and attendants following this was what hed always worried would happen reclaiming malkier was impossible they would die no matter how large their force an assault on the blight ridiculous he could not ask that of them he could not allow that of them as he continued down the road he became more resolute those brave men flying those flags they should join with the shienaran forces and fight in a battle that meant something he would not take their lives death is lighter than a feather rakim had thrown that at him several times during their ride he had followed lan decades ago during the aiel war duty is heavier than a mountain lan was not running from duty he was running toward it still sight of the camps stirred his heart as he reached the bottom of the slope then rode forward the waiting men wore simple warriors garb hadori in place women marked with a kisain on their foreheads some of the men wore coats with the golden crown on the shouldersthe mark of the royal guard of malkier they would have donned those only if their fathers or grandfathers had served in that guard it was a sight that would have made bukama cry he had thought the malkieri gone as a people broken shattered absorbed by other nations yet here they were gathering at the faintest whisper of a call to arms many were olderlan had been but a babe when his kingdom fell and those who remembered that day as men would now be in their seventh or eighth decade they had gray hair but they were still warriors and theyd brought their sons and grandsons taishar malkier a man cried as lans group passed the call went up a dozen two dozen times as they saw his hadori none seemed to recognize him for who he was they assumed that he had come for the reason they had come the last battle comes lan thought must i deny them the right to fight alongside me yes he must best he passed unnoticed and unrecognized he kept his eyes forward his hand on his sword his mouth closed but each call of taishar malkier made him want to sit up straighter each seemed to strengthen him push him forward the gates between the two fortress keeps were open though soldiers checked every man who went through lan halted mandarb and his people stopped behind him could the arafellin have orders to watch for him what other choice did he have but to go forward going around would take weeks his caravan waited its turn then stepped up to the guard post purpose asked the uniformed arafellin hair in braids traveling to fal moran lan said because of the last battle youre not going to wait here like the rest the guard said waving a gauntleted hand at the gathered malkieri for your king i have no king lan said softly the soldier nodded slowly rubbing his chin then he waved for some soldiers to inspect the goods in the wagons there will be a tariff on that i plan to give it to shienarans to fight in the last battle lan said no price asked the guard raised an eyebrow you have my oath on it lan said softly meeting the mans eyes no tariff then taishar malkier friend taishar arafel lan kicked his horse forward he hated riding through the silverwalls they made him feel as though a thousand archers were drawing on him the trollocs would not easily get through here if the arafellin were forced to retreat back this far there were times that had happened and they had held here each time as in the days of yakobin the undaunted lan practically held his breath the entire way he reached the other side gratefully and urged mandarb out onto the roadway to the northeast allan mandragoran a voice yelled sounding distant lan froze that call had come from above he turned looking back at the leftmost keep a head was sticking from a window there light be praised it is you the voice called the head ducked back inside lan felt like bolting but if he did this person would surely call back to the others he waited the figure came running out one of the fortress doorways lan recognized him a boy not yet grown into a man wearing red with a rich blue cloak kaisei noramaga grandson of the queen of kandor lord mandragoran the youth said trotting up you came when i heard that the golden crane was raised i have not raised it prince kaisei my plan was to ride alone of course i would like to ride alone with you may i this is not a wise choice your highness lan said your grandmother is in the south i assume your father rules in kandor you should be with him what are you doing here prince kendral invited me kaisei said and my father bade me come we both plan to ride with you kendral too lan asked aghast the grandson of the arafellin king your places are with your people our ancestors swore an oath the young man said an oath to protect to defend that oath is stronger than blood lord mandragoran it is stronger than will or choice your wife told us to wait here for you she said that you might try to pass without greeting us how did you notice me lan asked containing his anger the horse kaisei said nodding to mandarb she said you might disguise yourself but you would never leave the horse burn that woman lan thought as he heard a call being raised through the fortress hed been outmaneuvered curse nynaeve and bless her too he tried to send a sense of love and frustration through the bond to her and then with a deep sigh he gave in the golden crane flies for tarmon gaidon lan said softly let any man or woman who wishes to follow join it and fight he closed his eyes as the call went up it soon became a cheer then a roar chapter some tea and these ashaman claim they are free of the taint galad asked as he and perrin aybara picked their way through the aftermath of the battle they do perrin said and ive a mind to trust them why would they lie galad raised an eyebrow insanity perrin nodded at that this perrin aybara was an interesting man others often responded with anger when galad said what he thought but he was coming to realize that he didnt need to hold himself back with perrin this man responded well to honesty if he was a darkfriend or shadowspawn he was a very odd sort the horizon was starting to grow brighter light had night already passed bodies littered the ground most of them trollocs the stench was of burned flesh and fur nauseating as it mixed with that of blood and mud galad felt exhausted hed allowed an aes sedai to heal him once youve committed your reserves theres no use holding back your scouts gareth bryne was fond of saying if he was going to let aes sedai save his men then he might as well accept their healing once accepting aes sedai healing hadnt bothered him nearly so much perhaps perrin said perhaps the ashaman are mad and the taint isnt cleansed but theyve served me well and i figure theyve earned the right to be trusted until they show me otherwise you and your men might well owe your lives to grady and neald and they have my thanks galad said stepping over the hulking body of a trolloc with a bears snout though few of my men will express that emotion they arent certain what to think of your intervention here aybara still think i set them up somehow perhaps galad said either you are a darkfriend of unsurpassed cunning or yu really did as you saidcoming to save my men despite your treatment at our hands in that case you are a man of honor letting die would have made your life much easier i believe no perrin said every sword is needed at the last battle galad every one galad grunted kneeling beside a soldier with a red cloak and turning him over it wasnt a red cloak it was a white one soaked in blood ranun sinah would not see the last battle galad closed the young mans eyes breathing a prayer to the light in his name so what now for you and yours perrin asked we continue on galad said rising north to my estates in andor to prepare you could perrin froze then he turned trotting across the battlefield galad hurried after him perrin reached a heap of trollocs then began pushing bodies aside galad heard a very faint sound moaning he helped move a dead hawkheaded beast its toohuman eyes staring lifelessly beneath it a young man looked up blinking it was jerum nus one of the children oh light the young man croaked it hurts i thought i was dead dead his side was cut open perrin knelt hastily lifting the boys head giving him a drink of water as galad took a bandage from the bag he carried and used it to wrap the wound that cut was bad the unfortunate youth would die for certain heno galad realized we have aes sedai it was hard to get used to thinking that way jerum was crying with joy holding to perrins arm the boy looked delusional he didnt seem to care one bit about those golden eyes drink son perrin said voice soothing kindly its all right we found you youre going to be fine it seemed like i yelled for hours the youth said but i was so weak and they were on top of me how how did you find me i have good ears perrin said he nodded to galad and together they lifted the youth perrin beneath the arms galad taking the legs they carefully carried him across the battlefield the youth continued mumbling consciousness slipping at the side of the battlefield the aes sedai and aiel wise ones were healing the wounded as galad and perrin arrived alighthaired wise onea woman who looked not a day older than galad but spoke with the authority of an aged matronhustled over she began chastising them for moving the lad as she reached out to touch his head do you give permission galad damodred she asked this one is too far gone to speak for himself galad had insisted that each child be given the choice to refuse healing regardless of the nature of their wound the aes sedai and wise ones hadnt liked it but perrin had repeated the order they seemed to listen to him odd galad had rarely met aes sedai who would listen to the orders or even opinions of a man yes galad said heal him the wise one turned to her work most children had refused healing though some had changed their minds once galad himself accepted it the youths breathing steadied his wound closing the wise one didnt heal him completelyonly far enough that hed survive the day when she opened her eyes she looked haggard even more tired than galad felt the channelers had fought all night followed by performing healings galad and perrin moved back onto the field they werent the only ones searching for wounded of course perrin himself could have gone back to camp to rest but he hadnt i can offer you another option perrin said as they walked as opposed to staying here in ghealdan weeks from your destination i could have you in andor tonight my men would not trust this traveling theyd go if you ordered them perrin said youve said that youll fight alongside aes sedai well i dont see anything different between that and this come with me youd let us join you then perrin nodded id need an oath from you though what manner of oath ill be frank with you galad i dont think we have much time left a few weeks maybe well i fancy well need you but rand wont like the idea of whitecloaks in the battle lines unsupervised so i want you to swear youll accept me as your commander until the battle is through galad hesitated dawn was close now in fact it might have arrived behind those clouds do you realize what an audacious suggestion you make the lord captain commander of the children of the light obeying the orders of any man would be remarkable but to you a man i just recently saw judged a killer a man most of the children are convinced is a darkfriend perrin turned to him you come with me now and ill get you to the last battle without me who knows what will happen you said every sword was needed galad replied youd leave us yes if i dont have that oath i will rand may come back for you himself though in me you know what youre getting ill be fair to you all ill ask is that your men stay in line then fight where theyre told when the battle comes rand well you can say no to me youll find it much harder to say it to him and i doubt youll like the result half as much either once you end up saying yes galad frowned youre an oddly compelling man perrin aybara we have a bargain perrin held out a hand galad took it it wasnt the threat that did it it was remembering perrins voice when hed found jerum wounded that compassion no darkfriend could feign that you have my oath galad said to accept you as my military commander until the end of the last battle he suddenly felt weaker than he had before and he released a breath then sat on a nearby rock and you have my oath perrin said ill see your men cared for like the others sit here and rest a spell ill search that patch over there the weakness will pass soon weakness perrin nodded i know what its like to be caught up in the needs of a taveren light but i do he eyed galad you ever wonder why we ended up here in this same place my men and i assumed it was because the light had placed you before us galad said so we could punish you perrin shook his head thats not it at all truth is galad i apparently needed you and thats why you ended up here with that he headed off alliandre carefully folded the bandage then passed it to a waiting gaishain his fingers were thick and callused his face hidden beneath the hood of his robe she thought it might be niagen the brotherless that lacile had been taking after that still irked faile but ailiandre couldnt fathom why an aiel man would probably match lacile well ailiandre began rolling another bandage she sat with other women in a small clearing near the battlefield surrounded by scraggly scatterhead and stands of leatherleaf the cool air was quiet save for the nearby groan of the wounded she cut another length of cloth in the morning light the cloth had been a shirt now it was bandages not a great loss it hadnt been a very good shirt by the looks of it the battle is through berelain said softly she and faile worked nearby sitting on stools across from one another as they cut yes it appears that it is faile replied both fell silent ailiandre raised an eyebrow but did not say anything something was going on between those two why suddenly start pretending they were the greatest of friends the act seemed to fool many of the men in camp but ailiandre could see the truth in the way their lips tightened when they saw one another it had lessened after faile had saved berelains life but not vanished entirely you were right about him berelain said you sound surprised i am not often wrong when it comes to men my husband is not like other men it faile cut off she looked toward ailiandre eyes narrowing bloody ashes ailiandre thought shed sat too far away which made her strain turning to eavesdrop that was suspicious the two of them fell silent again and ailiandre held up a hand as if inspecting her nails yes she thought ignore me i dont matter im just a woman in over her head and struggling to keep up faile and berelain didnt think that of course any more than the two rivers men had ever thought perrin had been unfaithful if you sat them down and asked themreally made them think about ittheyd come to the conclusion that something else must have happened but things like superstition and bias ran deeper than mere thoughts what the other two thought about ailiandre and what they instinctively felt were different besides ailiandre really was a woman who was in over her head and struggling to keep up best to know what your strengths were ailiandre turned back to cutting bandages faile and berelain had insisted on staying to help ailiandre couldnt go not with the two of them acting so bloody fascinating lately besides she didnt mind the work compared to their captivity by the aiel this was really quite pleasant unfortunstely the two didnt go back to their conversation in fact berelain rose looking frustrated and walked toward the other side of the clearing alliandre could practically feel the frost coming off the woman berelain stopped over where others were rolling the strips of cloth alliandre stood up carrying her stool scissors and cloths over to faile i dont believe ive ever seen her this unsettled alliandre said shes not fond of being wrong faile noted she took a deep breath then shook her head she sees the world as a network of halftruths and inferences ascribing complex motivations to the simplest of men i suspect it makes her very good at court politics but i wouldnt want to live that way shes very wise alliandre said she does see things faile she understands the world she merely has a few blind spots like most of us faile nodded absently the thing i pity most is the fact that despite all of this i dont believe she was ever in love with perrin she chased him for sport for political advantage and for mayene in the end it was more the challenge than anything else she may be fond of him but nothing more i could perhaps understand her if it had been for love alliandre kept her tongue after that cutting bandages she ran across a fine blue silk shirt in the pile surely there could be something better done with that she stuffed it between two others and set those beside her as if in a pile she intended to cut perrin eventually tramped into the clearing followed by some workers in bloodied clothing he made instantly for faile sitting down on berelains stool setting his marvelous hammer down in the weeds beside him he looked exhausted faile got him something to drink and then rubbed his shoulder alliandre excused herself leaving perrin and his wife she made her way over to where berelain stood at the edge of the clearing sipping a cup of tea taken from the pot on the fire berelain eyed her alliandre poured herself a cup of tea then blew on it for a moment they are good for one another berelain she said i cannot say im sorry to see this result every relationship deserves to be challenged berelain replied and if she had fallen in maidenan outcome all too possiblehe would have needed someone it is not a great loss to me however to take my eyes off perrin aybara i would have liked to make a connection to the dragon reborn through him but there will be other opportunities she seemed far less frustrated now than she had moments ago in fact she seemed to have returned to her calculating self alliandre smiled clever woman faile needed to see her rival completely beaten down so that she would consider rhe threat passed this was why berelain let some of her frustration show more than she normally would have alliandre sipped her tea marriage seems nothing to you other than a calculation then the advantages gained theres also the joy of the hunt the thrill of the game and what of love love is for those who do not rule berelain said a woman is worth far more than her ability to make a match but i must care for mayene if we enter the last battle without my having secured a husband that puts the succession in danger and when mayene has a succession crisis tear is all too quick to assert itself romance is an unaffordable distraction i she trailed off suddenly her expression changing what was going on alliandre turned to the side frowning until she saw the cause galad damodred had entered the clearing he had blood on his white uniform and he looked exhausted yet he stood upright straightbacked and his face was clean he almost seemed too beautiful to be human with that perfectly masculine face and graceful lean figure and those eyes like deep dark pools he practically seemed to glow i what was i saying berelain asked eyes on damodred that there is no place for romance in a leaders life yes berelain said sounding distracted its just not reasonable at all not at all i berelain began but damodred turned toward them she cut off as their eyes met alliandre suppressed a smile as damodred crossed the clearing he executed another set of perfect bows one for each of them though he barely seemed to notice alliandre my lady first he said lord aybara says that when he first approached this battle you pled to him on my behalf foolishly berelain said i feared he would attack you if fearing that makes one a fool damodred said then we two are fools together in it i was certain that my men would soon fall to aybara she smiled at him that quickly she seemed to have forgotten everything shed been saying previously would you like some tea damodred said speaking a little abruptly as he reached for the teacups which sat on a cloth away from the fire im drinking some she noted some more then he asked hastily kneeling and pouring a cup er he stood up holding the cup then seeing that she already had one in her hands there are still bandages to cut berelain said perhaps you could help perhaps he said he handed the cup hed poured over to alliandre berelainher eyes still holding hishanded hers over as well seeming oblivious to what she was doing alliandre smiled deeplynow holding three teacupsas the two of them walked over to the stack of cloths to be cut this might turn out well indeed at the very least it would get those blasted whitecloaks out of her kingdom she walked back toward faile and perrin as she did so she slipped the blue silk shirt from the pile of cloth shed set aside to cut it really would make a nice sash chapter a backhanded request morgase stepped out of her hillside tent and looked out at andor whitebridge lay below blessedly familiar although she could see that it had grown the farms were failing the last of the winter stores spoiling so people made for the cities the landscape should have been green instead even the yellowed grass was dying off leaving scars of brown it wouldnt be long before the entire land was like the waste she longed to take action this was her nation or it had once been she left her tent looking for master gill on the way she passed faile who was speaking with the quartermaster again morgase nodded showing deference faile nodded back there was a rift between the two of them now morgase wished it could be otherwise she and the others had shared a sliver of their lives when hope had been weaker than a candles flame it had been faile who had encouraged morgase to use the one power squeezing every last drop from her pathetic abilityto signal for help while they were trapped the camp was already well set up and amazingly the whitecloaks had joined them but perrin hadnt yet decided what to do or at least if he had decided he wasnt sharing that decision with morgase she walked to the wagon lines past farriers and grooms looking for the best pasture people arguing in the supply dump soldiers grudgingly digging trenches for waste everyone had their place except morgase servants backed away halfbowing uncertain how to treat her she wasnt a queen but neither was she simply another noblewoman she certainly wasnt a servant anymore though her time with galad had reminded her what it was to be a queen she was thankful for what she had learned as maighdin that hadnt been as bad as she had feared there had been advantages to being a ladys maid the camaraderie of the other servants the freedom from the burdens of leadership the time spent with tallanvor that life was not hers it was time to be done with pretending she eventually found basel gill packing the cart lini supervising lamgwin and breane helping faile had released breane and lamgwin from her service so they could serve morgase morgase had kept silent about faile so graciously granting her back her servants tallanvor wasnt there well she couldnt moon over him like a girl any longer she had to get back to caemlyn and help elayne your majes master gill said bowing he hesitated i mean my lady pardon me dont mind it master gill i have trouble remembering myself you sure you want to go forward with this lini folded her thin arms yes morgase said it is our duty to return to caemlyn and offer elayne what assistance we can if you say so lini said me i think that anyone who allows two roosters in the same barnyard deserves the ruckus they get morgase raised an eyebrow noted but i think youll find that i am quite capable of helping without usurping authority from elayne lini shrugged she had a point morgase had to be careful staying in the capital for too long could throw a shadow across elayne but if there was one thing morgase had learned from her months as maighdin it was that people needed to be doing something productive even if it was something as simple as learning to serve tea morgase had skills that elayne could use for the dangerous times ahead if she began to overshadow her daughter however she would move out of caemlyn to her holdings in the west the others worked quickly loading up and morgase had to fold her arms to keep from helping there was a certain fulfillment to caring for oneself as she waited she noticed someone riding up the path from whitebridge tallanvor what had he been doing in the city he saw her and approached then bowed his lean square face a model of deference my lady you visited the city did you get lord aybaras permission perrin hadnt wanted a sudden flood of soldiers and refugees going into the city causing trouble my lady i have family there tallanvor said climbing from the saddle his voice was stiff and formal i felt it wise to investigate the information discovered by lord aybaras scouts is that so guardsmanlieutenant tallanvor morgase said if he could act in such a formal way then so could she lini passing with an armload of linens to pack gave a quiet snort at morgase s tone yes my lady tallanvor replied my lady if i may make a suggestion speak by reports your daughter still assumes you dead im certain if we speak to lord aybara he will command his ashaman to make a gateway for us to return to caemlyn an interesting suggestion morgase said carefully ignoring the smirk on linis face as she walked back by in the other direction my lady tallanvor said eyeing lini might we speak in private morgase nodded stepping off to the side of the camp tallanvor followed a short distance away she turned to look at him well my lady he continued in a softer voice the andoran court is certain to hear that you still live now that aybaras entire camp knows if you dont present yourself and explain that youve renounced the throne the rumors of your survival could erode elaynes authority morgase didnt reply if the last battle truly is coming tallanvor said we cant afford oh hush she said curtly ive already given lini and the others the order to pack up didnt you notice what they were doing tallanvor flushed as he noticed gill hauling a chest over and setting it on the cart i apologize for my forwardness with your leave my lady tallanvor nodded to her and turned to go must we be so formal with one another tallanvor the illusion has ended my lady he walked away morgase watched him go and felt her heart twist curse her stubbornness curse galad his arrival had reminded her of her pride of her royal duty it was bad for her to have a husband shed learned that from taringail for all of the stability her marriage to him had brought each and every advantage had come with a threat to her throne that was why shed never made bryne or thorn her official consort and gaebril only proved that she had been right to worry any man who married her could potentially be a threat to elayne as well as andor her children if she had any more would be rivals to elaynes morgase couldnt afford to love tallanvor stopped a short distance away and her breath caught he turned then walked back to her he drew his sword and bent down placing it reverently at her feet as she stood in weeds and scrub i was wrong to threaten to leave before he said softly i was hurt and pain makes a man stupid you know that i will always be here morgase ive promised it to you before and i mean it these days i feel like a biteme in a world of eagles but i have my sword and my heart and both are yours forever he stood to go tallanvor she said almost in a whisper youve never asked me you know if i would have you i cant put you into that position it wouldnt be right to force you to do what we both know you must now that you have been exposed and what must i do turn me down he spat obviously growing angry for the good of andor must i she asked i keep telling myself that tallanvor but still i question it what good am i to you he asked at the very least you should marry to help elayne secure the loyalty of one of the factions you offended and so i go to marriage without love she said again how many times must i sacrifice my heart for andor as many times as required i suppose he sounded so bitter clenching his fists not angry at her but at the situation he always had been a man of such passion she hesitated then shook her head no she said not again tallanvor look at that sky above youve seen the things that walk the world felt the dark ones curses strike us this is not a time to be without hope without love but what of duty duty can bloody gtt in line its had its share of me everyones had their share of me tallanvor everyone but the man i want she stepped over his sword still lying in the cockleburrs then couldnt stop herself in a blink she was kissing him all right you two a stern voice said from behind were going to see lord aybara right now morgase pulled away it was lini what morgase tried to regain some composure youre getting married lini declared if i have to pull you to it by the ears i will make my own choice morgase said perrin tried to get me to im not him lini said this is best done before we return to elayne once youre in caemlyn there will be complications she turned her eyes on gill who had the trunk stowed and you unpack my ladys things but lini morgase protested were going to caemlyn tomorrow will be soon enough child tonight you celebrate she eyed them and until the marriage is done i dont think its safe to trust you two alone morgase flushed lini she hissed im not eighteen anymore no when you were eighteen you were married proper do i need to seize your ears i morgase said were coming lini tallanvor said morgase glared at him he frowned what you havent asked he smiled then held her close morgase trakand will you be my wife yes she replied now lets find perrin perrin tugged on the oak branch it broke off powdery wood dust puffing out as he held the branch up sawdust streamed out of the end onto the brown grass happened last night my lord kevlyn torr said holding his gloves the entire stand of hardwood over there dead and dried in one night nearly a hundred trees id guess perrin dropped the branch then dusted off his hands its no worse than what weve seen before but dont worry about this perrin said send some men to harvest this wood for fires looks as if it will burn really well kevlyn nodded then hurried off other woodsmen were poking through the trees looking disturbed oak ash elm and hickory trees dying overnight was bad enough but dying then drying out as though dead for years that was downright unsettling best to take it in stride though not let the men grow afraid perrin walked back toward camp in the distance anvils rang theyd bought up raw materials every bit of iron or steel they could get from whitebridge the people had been eager to trade for food and perrin had obtained five forges with men to move them and set them up along with hammers tools and coal he might just have saved some in the city from starving for a little while at least smiths continued to pound hopefully he wasnt working neald and the others too hard powerwrought weapons would give his people a critical advantage neald hadnt been able to figure out exactly what hed done in helping forge mahalleinir but perrin hadnt been surprised that night had been unique he rested a hand on the weapon feeling its faint warmth thinking of hopper now neald had figured out how to make blades that wouldnt dull or break the more he practiced the sharper edges he was able to create the aiel had already begun to demand those edges for their spears and perrin had given neald the order to see to them first it was the least he owed them on the traveling ground at the edge of the large increasingly entrenched camp grady stood in a circle with annoura and masuri holding open a gateway this was the last group of noncombatants who wanted to leave him the group traveling to caemlyn among them hed sent a messenger to elayne hed need to meet with her soon he wasnt certain if he should be worried or not time would tell some others were coming back through the gateway bringing a few carts of food purchased in caemlyn where supplies were still available eventually he caught sight of faile picking her way through the camp toward him he raised a hand drawing her over everything all right with bavin perrin asked shed been at the quartermasters tent all is well perrin rubbed his chin ive been meaning to tell you for some timei dont think hes particularly honest ill keep special watch on him she said smelling amused berelains been spending more time with the whitecloaks perrin said seems she has eyes for damodred shes been leaving me alone entirely is that so yes and she published that proclamation condemning the rumors about me and her light but people actually seem to believe it i was worried theyd see it is a sign of desperation faile smelled satisfied he laid a hand on her shoulder i dont know what you did but thank you do you know the difference between a hawk and a falcon perrin size mostly he said wing shape too the falcon has a more arrowlike look to it the falcon faile said is a better flyer it kills with the beak and can fly fast and quick the hawk is slower and stronger it excels at getting prey that is moving along the ground it likes to kill with the claw attacking from above all right perrin said but doesnt that mean that if both see a rabbit below the hawk will be better at snatching it thats exactly what it means she smiled the hawk is better at hunting the rabbit but you see the falcon is better at hunting the hawk you sent the messenger to elayne women hed never make sense of them for once though that seemed a good thing i did hopefully well be able to meet with her soon there is already talk in camp of whom you might bring with you why would there be talk perrin said itll be you youll be best at knowing how to deal with elayne though having alliandre along probably wont hurt and berelain she can stay in camp perrin said watch over things here she got to go last time faile smelled even more satisfied we should she cut off frowning well it looks like the last leaf finally fell what perrin said turning she was looking toward a group coming at them aged lini and trailing behind her morgase and tallanvor gazing at one another like a couple just back from their first bel tine together i thought she didnt like him he said or if she did she wasnt going to marry him anyway minds change faile said much more quickly than hearts her scent was faintly angry though she smothered it she hadnt completely forgiven morgase but she was no longer outright hostile perrin aybara morgase said you are the closest thing to a lord this camp has other than my stepson but it wouldnt be right for a son to smelled angry as well perrin sighed fight among themselves though they might they were always eager to pounce on a man who said the wrong thing even if it was the truth however morgase calmed down im sorry i did not mean to insult your authority its all right he said i suppose you have reason to question no morgase said standing up taller light but she could look like a queen when she wanted how had they missed it before you are a lord perrin aybara your actions show it the two rivers is blessed because of you and perhaps andor as well so long as you remain part of her i intend to perrin promised well if you would do this thing for me she said looking to tallanvor then i would be willing to speak on your behalf with elayne arrangements can be made and titlesproper titlescan be bestowed we will take your offer of speaking for us faile said speaking quickly before perrin could but we will decide with her majesty whether bestowing titles is the proper course at this point perrin eyed her she wasnt still considering splitting the two rivers off into its own kingdom was she theyd never discussed it in such frank terms but shed encouraged him to use the flag of manetheren well theyd have to see about that nearby he could see galad damodred walking toward them berelainas always latelyat his side it appeared that morgase had sent a messenger for him galad was tucking something into his pocket a small letter it appeared with a red seal where had he gotten that he looked troubled though his expression lightened as he arrived he didnt seem surprised by the news of the marriage he had a nod for perrin and a hug for his mother then a sterneyedbut cordialgreeting for tallanvor what kind of ceremony would you like perrin asked morgase i only know the two rivers way i believe simple oaths before you will suffice morgase said im old enough to be tired of ceremony sounds appropriate to me perrin said galad stepped to the side and morgase and tallanvor clasped hands martyn tallanvor she said ive had more from you than i deserve for longer than ive known that ive had it youve claimed that the love of a simple soldier is nothing before the mantle of a queen but i say the measure of a man is not in his title but in his soul ive seen from you bravery dedication loyalty and love ive seen the heart of a prince inside of you the heart of a man who would remain true when hundreds around him failed i swear that i love you and before the light i swear not to leave you i swear to cherish you forever and have you as my husband berelain took out a kerchief and dabbed the corners of her eyes well women always wept at things like weddings though perrin well he felt a little water in his eyes too might have been the sunlight morgase trakand tallanvor said i fell in love with you for the way you treated those around you as queen i saw a woman who took duty with not just a sense of responsibility but with a passion even when you didnt know me from any other guard you treated me with kindness and respect you treated all of your subjects that way i love you for your goodness your cleverness your strength of mind and will one of the forsaken couldnt break you you escaped him when he thought you completely under control the most terrible of tyrants couldnt break you even when he held you in his palm the shaido couldnt break you another would be hateful in your place if they had been through what you had but you you have grown increasingly into someone to admire cherish and respect i swear that i love you and before the light i swear that i will never never leave you i swear to cherish you forever and have you as my wife i swear it morgase though part of me fails to believe that this could really be happening and then they stood like that staring into one anothers eyes as if perrin werent even there he coughed well so be it then youre married should he give advice how did one give advice to morgase trakand a queen with children his own age he just shrugged off with you then beside him faile smelled amused and faintly dissatisfied lini snorted at perrins performance but ushered morgase and tallanvor away galad nodded to him and berelain curtsied they walked away berelain remarking on the suddenness of it faile smiled at him youll have to get better at that they wanted it simple everyone says that faile replied but you can have an air of authority while keeping things brief well talk about it next time youll do a much better job next time he shook his head as faile turned and walked toward the camp where are you going perrin asked to bavin i need to requisition some casks of ale for what the festivities faile said looking over her shoulder ceremony can be skimped if needed but the celebration should not be skimped she glanced upward particularly at times like this perrin watched her go disappearing into the enormous camp soldiers farmers craftsmen aiel whitecloaks refugees almost seventy thousand strong despite those who had left or fallen in battle how had he ended up with such a force before leaving the two rivers hed never seen more than a thousand people gathered in one place the largest portion was the group of former mercenaries and refugees who had been training under tarn and dannil the wolf guard they were calling themselves whatever that was supposed to mean perrin began walking to check on the supply carts but something small struck him softly on the back of the head he froze turning scanning the forest behind him to the right it stood brown and dead to his left the tree cover dwindled he couldnt seen anyone have i been pushing myself too hard he wondered rubbing his head as he turned to continue walking imagining things thatanother little strike on the back of his head he spun and caught sight of something dropping to the grass frowning he knelt down and picked it up an acorn another one smacked him in the forehead it had come from the forest perrin growled and strode into the trees one of the camps few children perhaps ahead was a large oak tree the trunk thick and wide enough to hide someone once he grew close he hesitated was this some kind of trap he laid his hand on his hammer and inched forward the tree was downwind and he couldnt catch the scent ofa hand suddenly jutted out from behind the trunk holding a brown sack i caught a badger a familiar voice said want to let it go on the village green perrin froze then let out a bellowing laugh he rounded the trees trunk and found a figure in a highcollared red coattrimmed with goldand fine brown trousers sitting on the trees exposed roots the sack squirming near his ankles mat was chewing idly on a long length of jerk and wore a broadbrimmed black hat a black polearm with a broad blade at the top leaned against the tree beside him where had he gotten such fine clothing hadnt he once complained about rand wearing outfits like that mat perrin asked nearly too stunned to speak what are you doing here catching badgers mat said shaking the sack bloody hard to do you know particularly on short notice the sack rustled and perrin heard a faint growl from inside he could smell that there was indeed something alive in that sack you actually caught one call me nostalgic perrin didnt know whether to chastise mat or laugh at himthat particular mix of emotions was common when mat was around no colors fortunately spun in perrins eyes now that they were near one another light that would have been confusing perrin did feel a tightness however the longlimbed man smiled setting the sack down and standing offering a hand perrin took it but pulled mat into a hearty hug light mat perrin said it seems like its been forever a lifetime mat said maybe two i lose count anyway caemlyn is already is buzzing with news of your arrival figured the only way to get in a word of welcome was to slip through that gateway and find you before everyone else mat picked up his spear and rested it on his shoulder blade to the back what have you been doing where have you been is thom with you what about nynaeve so many questions mat said how safe is this camp of yours safe as any place not safe enough mat grew solemn look perrin weve got some mighty dangerous folks after us i came because i wanted to warn you to take extra care assassins will find you soon enough and youd best be ready for them we need to catch up but i dont want to do it here where then meet me in an inn called the happy throng in caemlyn oh and if you dont mind ill be wanting to borrow one of those blackcoated fellows of yours for a few shakes need a gateway for what purpose ill explain but later mat tipped his hat turning to jog back toward the stillopen gateway to caemlyn really he said turning and joggmg backward for a moment be careful perrin with t hat he ducked past a few refugees and thtough the gateway how had he gotten past grady light perrin shook his head to himself then bent to untie the sack and ease the poor badger mat had captured chapter a reunion elayne woke in her bed blearyeyed egwene she said disoriented what the last memories of the dream were dissolving like honey consumed by warm tea but egwene s words remained firm in elaynes mind the serpent has fallen egwene had sent your brothers return was timely elayne sat up feeling a surge of relief she had spent the entire night trying to channel enough to make her dream terangreal work to no avail when shed found out that birgitte had turned away gawynwhile elayne sat inside furious but unable to attend the meeting with egwene shed been livid well mesaana had been defeated it seemed and what was that about her brother she smiled perhaps he and egwene had worked out their problems morning light peeked through the drapes elayne sat back feeling the powerful warmth through the bond with rand that had appeared there light but that was a wonderful sensation the moment shed begun feeling it the cloud cover around andor had broken it had been about a week since the testing of the dragons and shed put all of the bellfounders in her nation to work on creating them these days one could hear a steady sound in caemlyn repeating booms as members or the band trained with the weapons in the hills outside of the city so far she had let only a few of the weapons be used for training the different teams rotated practicing on them shed gathered the larger number in a secret warehouse inside caemlyn for safekeeping she thought about the dream sending again she hungered for specifics well egwene would probably send a messenger by gateway eventually the door cracked and melfane looked in your majesty the short roundfaced woman asked is everything all right i thought i heard a cry of pain ever since lifting her ban on elayne remaining in bed the midwife had decided to sleep in the antechamber outside elaynes bedroom to keep a careful watch on her that was an exclamation of joy melfane elayne said a greeting for the wonderful morning that has come to us melfane frowned elayne tried to act cheerful around the woman to persuade her that more bed rest wasnt needed but perhaps that last part had been a little much elayne couldnt afford to appear as if she were forcing herself to be happy even if she was insufferable woman melfane walked in and pulled open the drapessunlight was good for a woman with child shed explained part of elaynes treatment lately had been to sit in her bed with the covers drawn back letting the spring sunlight bake her skin as melfane moved elayne felt a little tremble from inside oh there was another theyre kicking melfane come feel i wont be able to feel it yet your majesty not until theyre stronger she began the normal daily routine listen to elaynes heartbeat then listen for the babes melfane still wouldnt believe there were twins after that she inspected and prodded elayne performing all of the tests in her secretive list of annoying and embarrassing things to do to women finally melfane placed hands on hips regarding elayne who was doing up her nightgown i think youve been straining yourself too much lately i want you to be certain to take proper rest my cousin tesss daughter had a child not two years ago who was birthed barely breathing light be thanked that the child survived but she had been working the fields late through the day before and not taking proper meals imagine take care of yourself my queen your babies will be thankful for it elayne nodded relaxing wait she said sitting up babies yes melfane said walking to the door there are two heartbeats in your womb sure as i have two arms dont know how you knew it you heard the heartbeats elayne exclaimed elated yes theyre there sure as the sun melfane shook her head and left sending in naris and sephanie to dress her and brush her hair elayne endured the process in a state of amazement melfane believed she couldnt stop herself from smiling an hour later she settled into her small sitting room windows all thrown open to let in the sunlight sipping warm goats milk master norry entered on long spindly legs tufts of hair sticking up behind the backs of his ears face long and peaked leather folder under his arm he was accompanied by dyelin who didnt usually attend the morning meeting elayne raised an eyebrow at the woman i have the information you requested elayne dyelin said pouring herself some morning tea today it was cloudberry i hear melfane heard heartbeats she did indeed my congratulations your majesty master norry said he opened his folder and began arranging his papers on the tall narrow table beside her chair he rarely sat down in elayne s company dyelin took one of the other comfortable chairs beside the hearth what information had elayne requested of the woman she didnt recall asking for anything specific the question distracted her as norry went over the daily reports on the various armies in the area there was a list of altercations between sellsword groups he also talked of food problems despite the kinswomen making gateways to rands lands to the south for supplyand despite the caches of unexpected food stores that had been discovered in the citycaemlyn was running low finally as for our um guests norry said messengers have arrived with the anticipated responses none of the three houses whose nobility had been captured could afford to pay ransom once the arawn sarand and marne estates had been among the most productive and extensive in andorand now they were destitute their coffers dry their fields barren and elayne had left two of them without leadership light what a mess norry moved on she had a letter from talmanes agreeing to move several companies of soldiers from the band of the red hand to cairhien she ordered norry to send him a writ with her seal authorizing the soldiers to lend aid restoring order that was of course nonsense no order needed to be restored but if elayne was ever going to move for the sun throne shed need to make some preliminary moves in that direction this is what i wanted to discuss elayne dyelin said as norry began to pack up his papers arranging each one with meticulous care light help them if one of those precious pages tore or got a stain on it the situation in cairhien is complex dyelin said when is it not elayne asked with a sigh youve information on the political climate there its a mess dyelin said simply we need to talk about how youre going manage the maintenance of two nations one in absence we have gateways elayne said true but you must to find a way to take the sun throne without letting it look as if andor is subsuming cairhien the nobility there might accept you as their queen but only if they see themselves as equals to the andorans otherwise the moment theyre out of your sight the schemes will grow like yeast in a warm bowl of water they will be the equals of the andorans elayne said they wont see it that way if you go in with your armies dyelin said the cairhienin are a proud people to think of themselves living conquered beneath andors crown they lived beneath rands power with all due respect elayne dyelin said he is the dragon reborn you are not elayne frowned but how did one argue with that master norry cleared his throat your majesty lady dyelins advice is not born of idle speculation i um have heard things knowing of your interests in cairhien hed been growing better at gathering informants shed turn him into a regular spymaster yet your majesty norry continued voice lower rumors are claiming that youll soon come to seize the sun throne there is already talk of rebellion against you idle speculation im certain but the cairhienin could see rand althor as an emperor dyelin said not a foreign king that is a different thing well we dont need to move armies to take the sun throne elayne said thoughtfully i am not certain of that your majesty norry said the rumors are quite pervasive it seems that as soon as the lord dragon announced the throne was to be yours some elements in the nation began working very subtlyto prevent it from happening because of these rumors many people worry that you will seize the titles of the cairhienin nobility and give them to andorans instead others claim you will relegate any cairhienin to a secondary state of citizenship nonsense elayne said thats plain ridiculous obviously norry said but there are many rumors they do tend to um grow like chokevines the sentiment is strong elayne gritted her teeth the world was fast coming to be a place for those with strong alliances knit together with bonds of both blood and paper she had the best chance of uniting cairhien and andor that any queen had had in generations do we know who has been starting the rumors that has been very difficult to ascertain my ladyf norry said who stands to benefit most elayne asked thats the first place we should look for the source norry glanced at dyelin any number of people could benefit dyelin said stirring her tea i would guess that those with the greatest chance of taking the throne themselves would benefit the most those who resisted rand elayne guessed perhaps dyelin said or perhaps not the strongest of the rebellious elements received great attention from the dragon and many of them were either converted or broken so his alliesthose he trusted most or who professed greatest allegiance to himare the ones we should probably suspect this is cairhien after all daes dae mar yes it would make sense for rands allies to resist her ascent to the throne those who had been favored by rand would be favored for the throne should elayne prove incapable however those people would also have undermined their chances by professing allegiance to a foreign leader i should think elayne said thoughtfully that those in the best position for the throne would be those in the middle anyone who didnt oppose rand and so didnt earn his ire but also someone who didnt support him too wholeheartedlysomeone who can be viewed as a patriot who can reluctantly step in and take power once ive failed she eyed the other two get me the names of anyone who has risen sharply in influence recently a nobleman or woman who fits those criteria dyelin and master norry nodded eventually she would probably have to build a stronger network of eyesandears as neither of these two was perfectly suited to leading them norry was too obvious and he already had enough to do with his other duties dyelin was well elayne wasnt certain what dyelin was she owed much to dyelin who seemed to have taken it upon herself to act as a surrogate mother to elayne a voice of experience and wisdom but eventually dyelin would have to take a few steps back neither of them could afford to encourage the notion that dyelin was the real power behind the throne but light what would she have done without the woman elayne had to steel herself against the sudden surge of feeling blood and bloody ashes when was she going to get over these mood swings a queen couldnt afford to be seen crying on a whim elayne dabbed her eyes dyelin wisely said nothing this will be for the best elayne said firmly to distract attention f rom her treacherous eyes im still worried about the invasion dyelin said nothing to that she didnt believe that chesmal had been talking of a specific invasion of andor she thought that the black sister had been speaking of the trolloc invasion of the borderlands birgitte took the news more seriously beefing up soldiers on the andoran borders still egwene would very much like to have control of cairhien if trollocs were to march on andor through her sister realm would be one of the avenues they might use before the conversation could go further the door to the hallway opened and elayne would have jumped in alarm had she not felt that it was birgitte the warder never knocked she strode in wearing a sword reluctantlyand her kneehigh black boots over trousers oddly she was followed by two cloaked figures their faces hidden by hoods norry stepped back raising a hand to his breast at the irregularity of it everyone knew that elayne didnt like to see visitors in the small sitting room if birgitte was bringing people here mat elayne guessed hardly a familiar voice said firm and clear the larger of the figures lowered his hood revealing a perfectly beautiful masculine face he had a square jaw and a set of focused eyes that elayne remembered well from her childhoodmostly when he had noticed her doing something wrong galad elayne said surprised at the warmth she felt for her halfbrother she rose holding out her hands toward him shed spent most of their childhood frustrated with him for one reason or another but it was good to see him alive and well where have you been i have been seeking truth galad said bowing with an expert bow but he did not approach to take her hands he rose and glanced to the side i found that which i did not expect steel yourself sister elayne frowned as the second shorter figure lowered her hood elaynes mother elayne gasped it was her that face that golden hair those eyes that had so often looked at elayne as a child judging her measuring hernot merely as a parent measured her daughter but as a queen measured her successor elayne felt her heart beating in her chest her mother her mother was alive morgase was alive the queen still lived morgase locked eyes with elayne thenoddlymorgase looked down your majesty she said with a curtsy still remaining beside the door elayne controlled her thoughts controlled her panic she was queen or she would have been queen or light shed taken the throne and she was at least the daughterheir but now her own mother came back from the bloody dead please sit elayne found herself saying gesturing morgase toward the seat beside dyelin it did elayne good to see that dyelin wasnt dealing with the shock any better than elayne she sat with her hand gripping her cup of tea knuckles white eyes bulging thank you your majesty morgase said walking forward galad joining her and resting a hand on elaynes shoulder in a comforting way he then fetched himself a seat from the other side of the room morgases tone was more reserved than elayne remembered and why did she continue to call elayne that title the queen had come in secret with hood drawn elayne regarded her mother putting the pieces together as she sat you renounced the throne didnt you morgase gave a stately nod oh thank the light dyelin said letting out a loud breath hand raised to her breast no offense morgase but for a moment there i imagined a war between trakand and trakand it wouldnt have come to that elayne said virtually at the same time that her mother said something similar their eyes met and elayne allowed herself to smile we would have found a reasonable accommodation this will do though i certainly wonder at the circumstances of the event i was being held by the children of the light elayne morgase said old pedron niall was a gentleman in most respects but his successor was not i would not let myself be used against andor bloody whitecloaks elayne muttered under her breath light theyd actually been telling the truth when theyd written claiming to have morgase in their possession galad eyed her raising an eyebrow he placed the chair hed brought over then undid his cloak revealing the brilliant white uniform underneath with the sunburst on the breast oh thats right elayne said exasperated i almost forgot that intentionally the children had answers elayne he said sitting light but he was frustrating it was good to see him but he was frustrating i dont wish to discuss it elayne said how many whitecloaks have come with you the entire force of children accompanied me to andor galad said i am their lord captain commander elayne blinked then glanced at morgase the elder trakand noddedwell elayne said i see we have much to catch up on galad took that as a requesthe could be very literaland began explaining how hed come by his station he was quite detailed about it and elayne occasionally glanced at her mother morgases expression was unreadable once galad was done he asked after the succession war conversing with galad was often like this an exchange more formal than familiar once it had frustrated her but this time she found thatagainst her better wishesshed actually been missing him so she listened with fondness eventually the conversation wound down there was more to talk about with him but elayne was dying for a chance to speak just with her mother galad elayne said id like to talk further would you be amenable to an early dinner this evening you may take refreshment in your old quarters until then he nodded standing that would be well dyelin master norry elayne said my mothers survival will lead to some delicate issues of state we will need to publish her abdication officially and quickly master norry ill leave the formal document to you dyelin please inform my closest allies of this news so that they will not be taken by surprise dyelin nodded she glanced at morgasedyelin wasnt one of those whom the former queen had embarrassed during the days of rahvin s influence but she had undoubtedly heard the stories then dyelin withdrew with galad and master norry morgase glanced at birgitte as soon as the door closed the warder was the only other one in the room i trust her like a sister mother elayne said an insufferable older sister sometimes but a sister nonetheless morgase smiled then rose and took elayne by the hands pulling her up into an embrace ah my daughter she said tears in her eyes look at what youve done queen in your own right you trained me well mother elayne said she pulled back and you re a grandmother or soon will be morgase frowned looking down at her yes i thought as much from looking at you who rand elayne said blushing though its not widely known and id rather it stay that way rand althor morgase said her mood darkening that mother elayne said raising a hand to grasp hers hes a good man and i love him what you have heard is exaggeration or bitter rumor but hes elayne a man who can channel the dragon reborn and still a man elayne said feeling his knot of emotions in the back of her mind so warm just a man for all that is demanded of him morgase drew her lips into a thin line i shall withhold judgment though in a way i still feel that i should have thrown that boy in the palace dungeons the moment we found him skulking in the gardens i didnt like how he looked at you even then mind you elayne smiled then gestured back to the seats morgase sat and this time elayne took the seat directly beside her still clutching her mothers hands she sensed amusement from birgitte who stood with her back against the far wall one knee bent so that the sole of her boot rested against the wood paneling what elayne asked nothing birgitte said its good to see you two acting like mother and child or at least woman and woman rather than staring at each other like two posts elayne is queen morgase said stiffly her life belongs to her people and my arrival threatened to upset her succession it still might muddy things mother elayne said your appearance could open old wounds i will have to apologize morgase said perhaps offer reparations she hesitated i had intended to stay away daughter it would be best if those who hated me still thought me dead but no elayne said quickly squeezing her hands this is for the best we simply will have to approach it with skill and care morgase smiled you make me proud you will be a wonderful queen elayne had to force herself to stop beaming her mother had never been free with compliments but tell me before we go further morgase said voice growing more hesitant i have heard reports that gaebril was rahvin elayne said nodding its true mother i hate him for what he did i can see him using me driving spikes through the hearts and loyalty of my dearest friends and yet there is a part of me that longs to see him irrationally he used compulsion on you elayne said softly there is no other explanation we will have to see if any from the white tower can heal it morgase shook her head whatever it was it is faint now and maneable i have found another to give my affection elayne frowned i will explain that at another point morgase said im not certain i understand it yet first we must decide what to do about my return that is easy elayne said we celebrate yes but but nothing mother elayne said you have returned to us the city the entire nation will celebrate she hesitated and after that we will find an important function for you something that takes me away from the capital so i cast no unfortunate shadows but a duty that is important so that you are not thought of as having been put out to pasture elayne grimaced perhaps we can give you charge of the western quarter of the realm i have little pleasure in the reports of what is happening there the two rivers morgase asked and lord perrin aybara elayne nodded he is an interesting one perrin is morgase said thoughtfully yes perhaps i could be of some use there we have something of an understanding already elayne raised an eyebrow he was behind my safe return to you morgase said he is an honest man and honorable as well but also a rebel despite his good intentions you will not have an easy time of it if you come to blows with that one id rather avoid it she grimaced the easiest way to deal with it would be to find him and execute him but of course she wasnt going to do that even if reports had her fuming enough to almost wish that she could well we shall begin working on a way morgase smiled it will help you to hear of what happened to me oh and lini is safe i dont know if youve worried over her or not to be honest i didnt elayne said grimacing feeling a spike of shame it seems that the collapse of dragonmount itself couldnt harm lini morgase smiled then began her story elayne listened with awe and not a little excitement her mother lived light be blessed so many things had gone wrong recently but at least one had gone right the threefold land at night was peaceful and quiet most animals were active near dusk and dawn when it was neither sweltering nor freezing aviendha sat on a small rock outcropping legs folded beneath her looking down upon rhuidean in the lands of the jenn aiel the clan that was not once rhuidean had been shrouded in protective mists that was before rand had come hed broken the city in three very important very discomforting ways the first was the simplest rand had taken away the mist the city had shed its dome like an algaidsiswai unveiling his face she didnt know how rand had caused the transformation she doubted that he knew himself but in exposing the city he had changed it forever the second way rand had broken rhuidean was by bringing it water a grand lake lay beside the city and phantom moonlight filtered through clouds above made the waters shine the people were calling the lake tsodrelleaman tears of the dragon though the lake should be called tears of the aiel rand althor had not known how much pain he would cause in what he revealed such was the way with him his actions were often so innocent the third way rand had broken the city was the most profound aviendha was slowly coming to understand this one nakomis words worried her unnerved her they had awakened in her shadows of memories things from potential futures chat aviendha had seen in the rings during her first visit to rhuidean but that her mind could not quite recall at least not directly she worried that rhuidean would stop mattering very soon once the citys ultimate purpose had been to show wise ones and clan chiefs their peoples secret past to prepare them for the day when theyd serve the dragon that day had come so who should come to rhuidean now sending the aiel leaders through the glass columns would be reminding them of toh they had begun to meet this bothered aviendha in ways that itched beneath her skin she didnt want to acknowledge these questions she wanted to continue with tradition but she could not get them out of her head rand caused so many problems still she loved him she loved him for his ignorance in a way it allowed him to learn and she loved him for the foolish way he tried to protect those who did not want to be protected most of all she loved him for his desire to be strong aviendha had always wanted to be strong learn the spear fight and earn ji be the best she could feel him now distant from her they were so alike in this way her feet ached from running shed rubbed them with the sap of a segade plant but she could still feel them throbbing her boots sat on the stone beside her along with the fine woolen stockings that elayne had given her she was tired and thirstyshe would fast this night contemplating then refill her waterskin at the lake before going into rhuidean tomorrow tonight she sat and thought preparing the lives of the aiel were changing it was strength to accept change when it could not be avoided if a hold was damaged during a raid and you rebuilt it you never made it exactly the same way you took the chance to fix the problemsthe door that creaked in the wind the uneven section of floor to make it exactly as it had been would be foolishness perhaps traditionssuch as coming to rhuidean and even living in the threefold land itselfwould need to be reexamined eventually but for now the aiel couldnt leave the wetlands there was the last battle and then the seanchan had captured many aiel and made wise ones into damane that could not be allowed and the white tower still assumed that all aiel wise ones who could channel were wilders something would have to be done about that and herself the more she thought of it she realized that she couldnt go back to her old life she had to be with rand if he survived the last battleand she intended to fight hard to make certain he didhe would still be a wetlander king and then there was elayne aviendha and she were going to be sisterwives but elayne would never leave andor would she expect rand to stay with her would that mean aviendha would need to as well so troubling both for herself and her people traditions should not be maintained just because they were traditions strength was not strength if it had no purpose or direction she studied rhuidean such a grand place of stone and majesty most cities disgusted her with their corrupt filth but rhuidean was different domed roofs halffinished monoliths and towers carefully planned sections with dwellings the fountains flowed now and though a large section still bore the scars of when rand had fought there much of that had been cleaned up by the families who lived here aiel who had not gone to war there would be no shops no arguments in streets no murderers in alleys rhuidean might have been deprived of meaning but it would remain a place of peace i will go on she decided pass through the glass columns perhans her worries were true and the passage was now far less meaningful but she was genuinely curious to see what the others had seen besides knowing ones past was important in order to understand the future wise ones and clan chiefs had been visiting this location for centuries they returned with knowledge maybe the city would show her what to do about her people and about her own heart chapter working leather androl carefully took the oval piece of leather from the steaming water it had darkened and curled he moved quickly picking it up in his callused fingers the leather was springy and flexible now he quickly sat down at his bench a square of sunlight coming in through the window on his right side he wrapped the leather around a thick wooden rod about two inches across then poked holes around the edges from there he began stitching the leather to another piece hed prepared earlier a good stitching around the outside would keep it from fraying a lot of leatherworkers were casual about stitching not androl the stitching was what people saw first it stood out like paint on a wall as he worked the leather dried and lost some of its springiness but it was still flexible enough he made the stitches neat and even he pulled the last few tight and used them to tie the leather around the wooden rod hed cut those last once the leather dried stitching done he added some ornaments a name across the top pounded into place using his small mallet and lettertopped pins the symbols of the sword and dragon came next hed made those plates himself based on the pins the ashaman wore at the bottom using his smaller letter pins he stamped the words defend guard protect as the leather continued to dry he got out his stain and gauze to carefully color the letters and the designs for contrast there was a tranquility to this kind of work so much of his life was about destruction these days he knew that had to be hed come to the black tower in the first place because he understood what was to come still it was nice to create something he left his current piece letting it dry while working on some saddle straps he measured the straps with the marks on the side of his table then reached for his shears in the tool pouch that hung from the side of his tablehed made that himself he was annoyed to discover that they werent in their place burn the day word got out that i had good shears in here he thought despite taims supposedly strict rules for the black tower there was a distressing amount of chaos large infractions were punished with harsh measures but the little thingslike wandering into a mans workshop and borrowing his shearswere ignored particularly if the borrower was one of the mhaels favorites androl sighed his belt knife was waiting at cuellars place for sharpening well he thought taim does keep telling us to look for excuses to channel androl emptied himself of emotion then seized the source it had been months since hed had trouble doing thatat first hed been able to channel only when he was holding a strap of leather the mhael had beaten that out of him it had not been a pleasant process saidin flooded into him sweet powerful beautiful he sat for a long moment enjoying it the taint was gone what a wonder that was he closed his eyes and breathed in deeply what would it be like to draw in as much of the one power as the others could at times he thirsted for that he knew he was weakweakest of the dedicated in the black tower perhaps so weak he should never have been promoted from soldier logain had gone to the lord dragon about it and made the promotion happen against taims express wishes androl opened his eyes then held up the strap and wove a tiny gateway only an inch across it burst alive in front of him slicing the strap in two he smiled then let it vanish and repeated the process some said that logain had forced androls promotion only as a dig against taims authority but logain had said that it was androl s incredible talent with gateways that had earned him the title of dedicated logain was a hard man broken around the edges like an old scabbard that hadnt been properly lacquered but that scabbard still held a deadly sword logain was honest a good man beneath the scuff marks androl eventually finished with the straps he walked over and snipped the string holding the oval piece of leather in place it retained its shape and he held it up to the sunlight inspecting the stitching the leather was stiff without being brittle he fit it onto his forearm yes the molding was good he nodded to himself one of the tricks to life was paying attention to the small details focus make the small things right if each stitch was secure on an armguard then it wouldnt fray or snap that could mean the difference between an archer lasting through a barrage or having to put away his bow one archer wouldnt make a battle but the small things piled up one atop another until they became large things he finished the armguard by affixing a few permanent ties to its back so one could bind it in place on the arm he took his black coat off the back of his chair the silver sword pin on the high collar glimmered in the windows sunlight as he did up the buttons he glanced at himself in the glasss reflection making certain the coat was straight small things were important seconds were small things and if you heaped enough of those on top of one another they became a mans life he put the armguard on his arm then pushed open the door to his small workshop and entered the outskirts of the black towers village here clusters of twostoried buildings were arranged much like any small town in andor peaked roofs thatched with straight wooden walls some stone and brick as well a double line of them ran down the center of the village looking only at those one might have thought he was strolling through new braem or grafendale of course that required ignoring the men in black coats they were everywhere running errands for the mhael going to practice working on the foundations of the black tower structure itself this place was still a work in progress a group of soldiersbearing neither the sword pin nor the redandgold dragonused the power to blast a long trough in the ground beside the road it had been decided that the village needed a canal androl could see the weavesmostly earthspinning around the soldiers in the black tower you did as much with the power as you could always training like men lifting stones to build their strength light how logain and taim pushed those lads androl moved out onto the newly graveled roadway much of that gravel bore melted edges from where it had been blasted they had brought in bouldersthrough gateways on weaves of airthen shattered them with explosive weaves it had been like a war zone rocks shattering spraying chips with powerand traininglike that the ashaman would be able to reduce city walls to rubble androl continued on his way the black tower was a place of strange sights and melted gravel wasnt nearly the strangest of them neither were the soldiers tearing up ground following androl s own careful surveying lately the strangest sight to him was the children they ran and played jumping into the trough left behind by the working soldiers sliding down its earthen sides then scrambling back up children playing in the holes created by saidin blasts the world was changing androls own grammaso ancient shed lost every tooth in her mouthhad used stories of men channeling to frighten him into bed on nights when he tried to slip outside and count the stars the darkness outside hadnt frightened him nor had stories of trollocs and fades but men who could channel that had terrified him now he found himself here grown into his middle years suddenly afraid of the dark but completely at peace with men who could channel he walked down the road gravel crunching beneath his boots the children came scrambling up out of the ditch and flocked around him he idly brought out a handful of candies purchased on the last scouting mission two each he said sternly as dirty hands reached for the candies and no shoving mind you hands went to mouths and the children gave him bobbed heads in thanks calling him master genhald before racing away they didnt go back to the trench but invented a new game running off toward the fields to the east androl brushed off his hands smiling children were so adaptable before them centuries of tradition terror and superstition could melt away like butter left too long in the sun but it was good that theyd chosen to leave the trench the one power could be unpredictable no that wasnt right saidin was very predictable the men who wielded it however well they were a different story the soldiers halted their work and turned to meet him he wasnt a full ashaman and didnt merit a salute but they showed him respect too much he wasnt sure why they deferred to him he was no great man particularly not here in the black tower still they nodded to him as he passed most of these were among the men who had been recruited from the two rivers sturdy lads and men eager though many were on the young side half of them didnt need to shave but once a week androl walked up to them then inspected their work eyeing the line of string hed tied to small stakes he nodded in approval angle is good lads he said but keep the sides steeper if you can yes master genhald said the one leading the team jaim torfinn was his name a spindly young man with dusty brown hair he still held he power that raging river of strength was so enticing rare was the man who could release it without a sense of loss the mhael encouraged them to keep hold of it said that holding it taught them to control it but androl had known seductive sensations somewhat like saidin beforethe exhilaration of battle the intoxication of rare drinks from the isles of the sea folk the heady feeling of victory a man could be swept up in those feelings and lose control of himself forgetting who he was and saidin was more seductive than anything else hed experienced he said nothing to taim about his reservations he had no business lecturing the mhael here androl said let me show you what i mean by straight he took a deep breath then emptied himself of feeling he used the old soldiers trick to do thathed been taught it by his first instructor in the sword old onearmed garfin whose heavy rural illianer accent had been virtually incomprehensible of course androl himself had a faint taraboner accent he was told it had faded over the years since hed last been home within the nothingthe voidandrol could feel the raging force that was saidin he grabbed it as a man grabbed the neck of a horse running wild hoping to steer in some small way but mostly just trying to hold on saidin was wonderful yes it was more powerful than any intoxicant it made the world more beautiful more lush holding that terrible power androl felt as if hed come to life leaving the dry husk of his former self behind it threatened to carry him away in its swift currents he worked quickly weaving a tiny trickle of earththe best he could manage for earth was where he was weakestand carefully shaved the sides of the canal if you leave too much jutting out he explained as he worked then the canal flow will stay muddy as it washes away the earth on the sides the straighter and more firm the sides the better you see the soldiers nodded sweat had beaded on their brows flakes of dirt sticking to their foreheads and cheeks but their black coats were clean particularly the sleeves you could judge a mans respect for his uniform by whether or not he used the sleeve to wipe his brow on a day like this the two rivers lads used handkerchiefs the more senior ashaman of course rarely sweated at all it would take these lads more practice to get that down while concentrating so much good men androl said standing up and glancing over them androl laid a hand on jaims shoulder you lads are doing a fine job here the two rivers it grows men right the lads beamed it was good to have them particularly compared to the quality of men taim had been recruiting lately the mhaels scouts claimed they took whoever they could find yet why was it that most they brought back had such angry unsettling dispositions master genhald asked one of the soldiers yes trost androl asked have you have you heard anything of master logain the others looked hopeful androl shook his head he hasnt returned from his scouting mission im sure hell be back soon the lads nodded though he could see that they were beginning to worry they had a right to androl had been worrying for weeks now ever since logain had left in the night where had he gone why had he taken donalo mezar and welynthree of the most powerful dedicated loyal to himalong and now there were those aes sedai camped outside supposedly sent with authority from the dragon to bond ashaman taim had given one of his halfsmiles at that the kind that never reached his eyes and told them the group from the white tower had first pick since theyd come first the others waited impatiently the mhael one of the two rivers men said expression growing dark he keep your heads on your shoulders androl interrupted and dont make waves not yet we wait for logain the men sighed but nodded distracted by the conversation androl almost didnt notice when the shadows nearby began creeping toward him shadows of men lengthening in the sunlight shadows within the trough shadows of rocks and clefts in the earth slowly deviously they turned toward androl androl steeled himself but couldnt dispel the panic this one terror he could feel despite the void they came whenever he held saidin for too long he released it immediately and the shadows reluctantly crept back to their places the two rivers lads watched him discomfort in their faces could they see the wild cast to androls eyes nobody spoke of the irregulateries that afflicted men of the black tower it just wasnt done like whispering dirty family secrets the taint was cleansed these lads would never have to feel the things that androl did eventually he and the others who had been in the tower before the cleansing would become rarities light but he couldnt understand why anyone would listen to him weak in the power and insane to boot and the worst part was he knewdeeply down to his very centerthat those shadows were real not just some madness concocted by his mind they were real and they would destroy him if they reached him they were real they had to be oh light he thought gritting his teeth either option is terrifying either im insane or the darkness itself wants to destroy me that was why he could no longer sleep at nights without huddling in fear sometimes he could go hours holding the source without seeing the shadows sometimes only minutes he took a deep breath all right he said satisfied that his voiceat leastsounded in control you best get back to work keep that slope moving the right direction mind you well have a mess and a half to deal with if the water overflows and floods this area as they obeyed androl left them cutting back through the village near the center stood the barracks five large thickstoned buildings for the soldiers a dozen smaller buildings for the dedicated right now this little village was the black tower that would change a tower proper was being built nearby the foundation already dug he could visualize what the place might someday look like hed once worked with a master architectone of a dozen different apprenticeships hed held in a life that sometimes seemed to have lasted too long yes he could see it in his minds eye a domineering black stone tower powerbuilt strong sturdy at its base would be blockish square structures with crenelated tops this village would grow to become a town then a large city as vast as tar valon the streets had been built to allow the passing of several wagons at a time new sections were surveyed and laid it bespoke vision and planning the streets themselves whispered of the black towers destiny androl followed a worn pathway through the scrub grass distant booms and snaps echoed across the plains like the sounds of a whip being cracked each man had his own reasons for coming revenge curiosity desperation lust for power which was androls reason all four perhaps he left the village and eventually rounded a line of trees and came to the practice rangea small canyon between two hills a line of men stood channeling fire and earth the hills needed to be leveled to make land for farming an opportunity to practice these men were mostly dedicated weaves spun in the air much more skillful and powerful than those the two rivers lads had used these were streamlined like hissing vipers or striking arrows rocks exploded and bursts of dirt sprayed into the air the blasting was done in an unpredictable pattern to confuse and disorient foes androl could imagine a group of cavalry thundering down that slope only to be surprised by exploding earth a single dedicated could wipe out dozens of riders in moments androl noted with dissatisfaction that the working men stood in two groups the tower was beginning to split and divide those loyal to logain shunned and ostracized on the right canler emarin and nalaam worked with focus and dedication joined by jonneth dowtrythe most skilled soldier among the two rivers lads on the left a group of taims cronies were laughing among themselves their weaves were more wild but also much more destructive coteren lounged at the back leaning against a leafy hardgum tree and overseeing the work the workers took a break and called for a village boy to bring water androl walked up and arlen nalaam saw him first waving with a broad smile the domani man wore a thin mustache he was just shy of his thirtieth year though he sometimes acted much younger androl was still smarting from the time nalaam had put tree sap in his boots androl nalaam called come tell these uncultured louts what a retashen dazer is a retashen dazer androl said its a drink mix of mead and ewes milk foul stuff nalaam looked at the others proudly he had no pins on his coat he was only a soldier but he should have been advanced by now you bragging about your travels again nalaam androl asked unlacing the leather armguard we domani get around nalaam said you know the kind of work my father does spying for the crown last week you said your father was a merchant canler said the sturdy man was the oldest of the group his hair graying his square face worn from many years in the sun he is nalaam said thats his front for being a spy arent women the merchants in arad doman jonneth asked rubbing his chin he was a large quiet man with a round face his entire familyhis siblings his parents and his grandfather buelhad relocated to the village rather than letting him come alone well theyre the best nalaam said and my mother is no exception we men know a thing or two though besides since my mother was busy infiltrating the tuathaan my father had to take over the business oh now thats just ridiculous canler said with a scowl who would ever want to infiltrate a bunch of tinkers to learn their secret recipes nalaam said its said that a tinker can cook a pot of stew so fine that it will make you leave house and home to travel with them its true ive tasted it myself and i had to be tied in a shed for three days before the effect wore off canler sniffed however after a moment the farmer added so did she find the recipe or not nalaam launched into another story canler and jonneth listening intently emarin stood to the side looking on with amusementhe was the other soldier in the group bearing no pins he was an older man with thin hair and wrinkles at his eyes his short white beard was trimmed to a point the distinguished man was something of an enigma hed arrived with logain one day and had said nothing of his past he had a poised bearing and a delicate way of speaking he was a nobleman that was certain but unlike most other noblemen in the black tower emarin made no attempt at asserting his presumed authority many noblemen took weeks to learn that once you joined the black tower your outside rank was meaningless that made them sullen and snappish but emarin had taken to life in the tower immediately it took a nobleman with true dignity to follow the orders of a commoner half his age without complaint emarin took a sip of water from the serving boy thanking the lad then stepped up to androl he nodded toward nalaam who was still talking to the others that one has the heart of a gleeman androl grunted maybe he can use it to earn some extra coin he still owes me a new pair of socks and you my friend have the soul of a scribe emarin laughed you never forget a thing do you androl shrugged how did you know what a retashen dazer was i consider myself quite educated in these matters yet id heard not a word of it i had one once androl said drank it on a bet yes but where retash of course but thats leagues off shore in a cluster of islands not even the sea folk often visit androl shrugged again he glanced over at taims lackeys a village boy had brought them a basket of food from taim though the mhaei claimed not to play favorites if androl asked hed find that a boy was supposed to have been sent with food for the others too but that lad would have become lost or had forgotten or made some other innocent mistake taim would have someone whipped and nothing would change this division is troubling my friend emarin said softly how can we fight for the lord dragon if we cannot make peace among ourselves androl shook his head emarin continued they say that no man favored of logain has had the dragon pin in weeks there are many like nalaam there who should have had the sword pin long agobut are denied repeatedly by the mhael a house whose members squabble for authority will never present a threat to other houses wise words androl said but what should we do what can we do taim is mhael and logain hasnt returned yet perhaps we could send someone for him emarin said or maybe you could calm the others i fear that some of them are near to snapping and if a fight breaks out i have little doubt who would see the rough side of taims punishments androl frowned true but why me youre far better with words than i am emarin emarin chuckled yes but logain trusts you androl the other men look to you they shouldnt androl thought ill see what i can think of nalaam was winding up for another story but before he could begin androl gestured to jonneth holding up the armguard i saw your old one had cracked try this jonneth s face brightened as he took the armguard youre amazing androl i didnt think anyone had noticed its a silly thing i know but his smile broadened and he hurried to a nearby tree beside which sat some of the mens equipment including jonneths bow these two rivers men liked to have them handy jonneth returned stringing the bow he put on the armguard fits like a dream he said and androl felt himself smiling small things they could mean so much jonneth took aim and launched an arrow the shaft streaking into the air bowstring snapping against the armguard the arrow soared far striking a tree on a hill better than two hundred paces away canler whistled aint ever seen anything like those bows of yours jonneth never in my life they were fellow andorans though canler had come from a town much closer to caemlyn jonneth looked at his shot critically then drew againfletching to cheekand loosed the shaft fell true and hit the very same tree androl would guess that the shafts were less than two handspans apart canler whistled again my father trained on one of those nalaam noted learned the art from a two rivers man whom he rescued from drowning in illian has the bowstring as a memento canler raised an eyebrow but he seemed taken with the tale at the same time androl just chuckled shaking his head mind if i have a go jonneth im a pretty dead shot with a tairen bow and theyre a little longer than most surely the lanky man said unstrapping the armguard and handing over the bow androl donned the armguard and lifted the bow it was of black yew and there wasnt as much spring to the string as he was used to jonneth handed him an arrow and androl mimicked the mans pull drawing to his cheek light he said at the weight of the pull those arms of yours are deceptively small jonneth how do you manage to aim i can barely keep it steady jonneth laughed as androls arms trembled and he finally loosed unable to keep the bow drawn for a breath longer the arrow hit the ground far off target he handed the bow to jonneth that was fairly good androl jonneth said a lot of men cant even get the string back give me ten years and i could have you shooting like one born in the two rivers ill stick to shortbows for now androl said youd never be able to shoot a monster like that from horseback i wouldnt need to jonneth said what if you were being chased if there were fewer than five of them jonneth said id take them all down with this before they got to me if there were more than five then what am i doing shooting at them i should be running like the dark one himself was after me the other men chuckled though androl caught emarin eyeing him probably wondering how androl knew to shoot a bow from horseback he was a keen one that nobleman androl would have to watch himself and what is this a voice asked you do be trying to learn to shoot a bow pageboy is this so you can actually defend yourself androl gritted his teeth turning as coteren sauntered up he was a bulky man his black oily hair kept long and loose it hung around a blunt face with pudgy cheeks his eyes were focused dangerous he smiled the smile of a cat that had found a rodent to play with androl quietly undid the armguard handing it to jonneth coteren was full ashaman a personal friend of the mhael he outranked everyone here by a long stride the mhael will hear of this coteren said you do be ignoring your lessons you have no need for arrows or bowsnot when you can kill with the power we arent ignoring anything nalaam said stubbornly quiet lad androl said mind your tongue coteren laughed listen to the pageboy you lot the mhael will hear of your impudence also he focused on androl seize the source androl obliged reluctantly the sweetness of saidin flowed into him and he glanced nervously to the side there was no sign of the shadows so pathetic coteren said destroy that stone over there it was far too large for him but hed dealt with bullies before and coteren was a bully of the most dangerous typeone with power and authority the best thing to do was to mind embarrassment was a small punishment that was something few bullies seemed to understand androl wove the requisite weave of fire and earth striking at the large stone the thin weave held almost all of the power he could manage but it only flaked a few chips off the large stone coteren laughed heartily as did the group of dedicated eating beneath the nearby tree bloody ashes but youre useless coteren said forget what i said earlier pageboy you need that bow androl released the one power coteren had had his laugh he would be satisfied unfortunately androl felt men seize the source behind him jonneth canler and nalaam stepped up beside androl each of them filled with the one power and bristling with anger the men who had been eating stood up each holding the source as well there were twice as many of them as there were of androl s friends coteren smirked androl eyed canler and the others now lads he said raising a hand ashaman coteren was just doing what the mhael ordered him he s trying to make me mad so ill push myself the two groups hesitated the intensity of their locked gazes rivaled that of the power within them then jonneth released the source this caused nalaam to do likewise and finally gruff canler turned away coteren laughed i dont like this canler muttered as the group of them walked off he shot a glance over his shoulder dont like it at all whyd you stop us androl because theyd have made rubble of us faster than you can curse canler androl snapped light man i can barely channel worth a bean and emarin hasnt been here a month yet jonneths learning fast but we all know hes never actually fought with the power before and half of coterens men saw battle beneath the lord dragon you really think you and nalaam could handle ten men virtually on your own canler continued to bristle muttering but let the argument drop makashak na famalashten morkase nalaam mumbled delf takaksaki mere he laughed to himself eyes wild it wasnt a language androl knewit wasnt the old tongue that was for certain it probably wasnt even a language at all none of the others said anything nalaam occasionally cackled to himself in gibberish if asked about it hed claim hed spoken in plain ordinary words the outburst seemed to discomfit emarin and jonneth a great deal they hadnt ever seen friends go mad and kill those around them light send that theyd never have to see it now whatever else androl thought of the lord dragon for leaving them alone the cleansing earned althor redemption channeling was safe now or at least it was safer channeling would never be safe particularly now with taim pushing them more and more people are taking those burning personal lessons from taim nalaam muttered as they walked to the shade of the trees nensens success has the men eager weve lost a good dozen to taims side in the last tew weeks soon there wont be anyone left besides us here im afraid to talk to half the men i used to trust norley is trustworthy canler said evin hardlin too thats a small list nalaam said too small the two rivers men are with us jonneth said to a man still a small list nalaam said and not a full ashaman among us they all looked to androl he glanced back at taims lackeys laughing among themselves again what androl nalaam asked not going to chastise us for talking like that like what androl asked looking back at them like its us against them i didnt want you lads to get yourselves killed or imprisoned but that doesnt mean i dont see a problem he glanced back at them aye theres trouble here brewing like a storm the men who take taims private lessons learn too quickly nalaam said nensen was barely powerful enough to be considered for dedicated just a short time ago now hes full ashaman something very strange is going on and those aes sedai why did taim agree to let them bond us you know hes protected all of his favorites by stopping the aes sedai from choosing any man with the dragon pin burn me but i dont know what ill do if one chooses me im not going to be put on some aes sedai s string there were several mutters about that taims men spread rumors among the newcomers jonneth said softly they talk about the lord dragon and how he drove good men to turn traitor they say hes abandoned us and that hes gone mad the mhael doesnt want those rumors pointing back to him but burn me if he isnt the source of them all maybe hes right canler said the others looked at him sharply and the leathery man scowled im not saying that im going to go jump into taims camp but the lord dragon what has he done for us seems like hes forgotten about this place maybe he is mad hes not emarin said shaking his head i met him just before i came here the others looked at him surprised he impressed me emarin said young but with a powerful will i trust him light i barely spoke with him a halfdozen times but i trust him the others slowly nodded burn me canler said i suppose thats good enough for me but i wish hed listen i heard logain cursing that the lord dragon wont hear him when he gives warnings about taim and if we gave him evidence jonneth asked what if we could find something that proves that taim is up to no good something is strange about nensen nalaam repeated and that kash where did he even come from and how did he grow so powerful so quickly what if when logain returned we had information for him or if we could take it to the lord dragon directly the group turned to androl why did they look to him the weakest of them all he could do was create gateways that was where coterens nickname for androl had come from pageboy the only thing he was good for was delivering messages taking people places but the others looked to him for one reason or another they looked to him all right androl said lets see what we can find bring evin hardlin and norley into this but dont tell anyone else not even the other two rivers lads dont rile taim or his men but if you do find something bring it to me and ill see if i can find a way to contact logain or at least find where he went each man nodded somber light help us if were wrong androl thought looking back at taims favorites and light help us more if were right chapter a teaching chamber faile sat impatiently atop daylight trying to keep herself from twitching as the gateway split the air a browning meadow lay on the other side gaul and the maidens immediately slipped through to scout are you certain you dont want to come perrin asked galad who stood nearby watching the procession with arms clasped behind his back no galad said my meal with elayne was sufficient for us to catch up suit yourself perrin said he turned to faile and gestured to the gateway she kicked daylight into motion it was time at long last to face the queen of andor and she had to work to contain her nervousness perrin passed through the gateway with her on the other side caemlyn was close the grand city topped by peaked towers and banners of red and white palace rising in the center low caemlyn which sprawled outside the city walls was a growing city of its own perrin s procession followed them out of the gateway it had been carefully planned to look impressive but not hostile alliandre with a hundred guardsmen a hundred two rivers archers with unstrung longbows carried like staves a hundred representatives of the wolf guard including a large contingent of minor cairhien nobility the colored slashes on their uniforms created from cloth purchased in whitebridge and of course gaul and the maidens grady came last the man wore a neatly pressed black coat his dedicated pin polished and gleaming on the high collar he immediately looked westward toward the black tower hed tried to make a gateway there earlier in the day when perrin had given him permission it hadnt worked perrin was disturbed by that he intended to investigate soon tonight or tomorrow night at the latest gaul and the maidens formed up around perrin and faile and the procession moved down onto the road arganda and a squad of perrins wolf guards riding ahead to announce them the rest of them moved along the road at a regal pace caemlyns sprawling growth was even worse than that of whitebridge several armies camped near low caemlyn probably supported by the various lords who had supported elaynes ascent to the throne there was a distinct irregularity here the clouds broke around caemlyn the cloud cover had been so universal elsewhere that faile started upon seeing this the clouds formed an open circle above the city eerily even arganda and the wolf guards returned they will receive us my lord my lady he announced faile and perrin rode in silence as the group made its way down the road they had discussed the coming meeting dozens of times over there wasnt anything more to say perrin had wisely given her the lead in the diplomatic negotiations the world could not afford war between andor and the two rivers not now as they passed through the city gates perrin and the aiel grew more alert she suffered their overprotectiveness in silence how long would her capture by the shaido loom over her life at times it seemed perrin was loath to let her use the privy without four dozen guards inside the walls the streets teemed with people the buildings and markets packed refuse was beginning to pile up and a frightening number of urchins moved through the crowds criers yelled about the dangerous times some perhaps in the employ of the merchants encouraging people to hoard perrins people had bought food here but it was expensive soon elayne would need to subsidize it if she hadnt already how good were the royal stores they passed through the new city then entered the inner city climbing the hill to the palace itself the queens guard stood at attention in their redandwhite tabards and burnished plateandmail outside the palace gates in the pristine white palace walls once past the gates they dismounted a force of one hundred continued on with perrin and faile into the palace all of the aiel and a smaller honor guard from each contingent the palace hallways were wide but that many people still made faile feel crowded the path she and perrin were led along was a different way to the throne room than shed taken before why not use the direct way it seemed that little had changed about the palace since rands time ruling it there were no aiel nowsave for the ones perrin had brought the same narrow red rug ran down the middle of the hallway the same urns at the corners the same mirrors on the walls to give an illusion of greater size a structure like this could stand unaltered over the centuries paying little attention to whose feet trod the rugs and whose backside warmed the throne in one years time this palace had known morgase one of the forsaken the dragon reborn and finally elayne in fact faile halfexpectedas they rounded the corner to the throne roomto find rand lounging on his dragon throne that strange halfspear held in the crook of his arm a glimmer of madness in his eyes however the dragon throne had been removed and the lion throne again held its queen rand had set that throne aside and protected it like a flower he intended to present to a future love the queen was a younger version of her mother true elaynes face had angles that were more delicate than morgases but she had that same redgold hair and that same stunning beauty she was tall and was showing her pregnancy at the belly and through the chest the throne room was suitably ornate with gilded wood trim and narrow pillars in the corners probably ornamental elayne kept the room better lit than rand had standlamps burning brightly morgase herself stood at the base of the throne on the right side and eight members of the queens guard stood on the left some lesser nobles lined the sides of the room watching with keen attention elayne leaned forward on her throne as perrin faile and the others entered faile curtsied of course and perrin bowed not a low bow but a bow nonetheless by arrangement alliandre curtsied deeper than faile had that would immediately set elayne thinking the official purpose of this visit was a commendation by the crown a thanks to perrin and faile for bringing back morgase that was just an affectation of course their real reason for meeting was to discuss the future of the two rivers but that was the sort of delicate goal that neither could speak of outright at least not at first merely stating the objective would reveal too much to the other side let it be known elayne said with a musical voice that the throne welcomes you lady zarine ni bashere taybara queen alliandre maritha kigaarin perrin aybara no use of title for him let it be proclaimed in person our gratitude to you for returning our mother your diligence in this matter earns you the crowns deepest appreciation thank you your majesty perrin said with his usual gruffness faile had spoken to him at length about not trying to dispense with the formality or ceremony we will declare a day of celebration for my mothers safe return elayne continued and for her restoration to proper status well that pause meant elayne was displeased to know that her mother had been treated as a servant she had to realize that perrin and faile hadnt known what they were doing but a queen could still claim indignation for such an event it was an edge that perhaps she planned to use perhaps faile was reading too much into the comments but she couldnt help it in many ways being a lady was much like being a merchant and she had been trained well for both roles finally elayne said we come to the purpose of our meeting lady bashere master aybara is there a boon you would ask in return for the gift you have given to andor perrin rested his hand on his hammer then looked to faile questioningly obviously elayne expected them to ask for him to be named formally a lord or perhaps to ask forbearance for impersonating one along with a formal pardon either direction could be a result of this conversation faile was tempted to demand the first it would be a simple answer but perhaps too simple there were things faile had to know before they could proceed your majesty faile said carefully might we discuss this boon in a more intimate setting elayne gave that some thoughtat least thirty seconds worth which seemed an infinity very well my sitting room is prepared faile nodded and a servant opened a small door on the lefthand wall of the throne room perrin walked toward it then held up a hand to gaul sulin and arganda wait here he hesitated glancing at grady you too none of them seemed to like that but they obeyed theyd been warned this might happen faile contained her nervousnessshe didnt like leaving the ashaman their best means of escape particularly since elayne undoubtedly had spies and guards hidden inside the sitting room ready to spring out should matters turn dangerous faile would have liked a similar protection but bringing a male channeler in to speak with the queen well this was how it would have to be they were in elaynes domain faile took a deep breath joining perrin alliandre and morgase in the small side room chairs had been arranged elayne had foreseen this possibility they waited for elayne to enter before sitting faile couldnt see any place for guards to be hiding elayne entered and waved a hand the great serpent ring on her finger glittered in the lamplight faile had nearly forgotten that she was aes sedai perhaps there werent any guardsmen lurking around to help a woman who could channel was as dangerous as a dozen soldiers which of the rumors regarding the father of elaynes child were to be believed surely not the ones about that fool of a man in her guardthat was most likely obfuscation could it possibly be rand himself morgase entered after elayne she wore a subdued gown of deep red she sat down beside her daughter watching carefully remaining silent so elayne said explain to me why i shouldnt just execute you both as traitors faile blinked in surprise perrin however snorted i dont think rand would think very highly of that move im not beholden to him elayne said you expect me to believe that he was behind you seducing my citizens and naming yourself a king you have a few of your facts backward your majesty faile said testily perrin never named himself king oh and did he raise the flag of manetheren as my informants tell me he did elayne asked i did that perrin said but i put it away of my own choice well thats something elayne replied you may not have called yourself a king but holding up that banner was essentially the same thing oh sit down all of you she waved a hand a tray lifted off the far table and floated over to her it bore goblets and a pitcher of wine as well as a teapot and cups fetching it with the one power faile thought its a reminder of her strength a rather unsubtle one still elayne said i will do the best for my realm regardless of the cost i doubt that upsetting the two rivers alliandre said hesitantly would be best for your realm executing their leader would undoubtedly throw the region into rebellion so far as im concerned elayne said pouring several cups of tea theyre already in rebellion we came to you peacefully faile said hardly the action of rebels elayne took a sip of the tea first as was the custom to prove it wasnt poisoned my envoys to the two rivers have been refused and your people here gave me a messageand i quotethe lands of lord perrin goldenves refuse your andoran taxes taishar mamtberen alliandre paled perrin groaned softly a sound that came out faintly like a growl faile took her cup and sipped her teamint with cloudberries it was good the two rivers folk had pluck that was certain these are passionate times your majesty faile said surely you can see that the people might be concerned the two rivers has not often been a priority for your throne thats putting it mildly perrin added with a snort most of us grew up not knowing we were part of andor you ignored us that was because the area wasnt rising in rebellion elayne sipped her tea rebellion isnt the only reason men might need the attention of the queen who claims them perrin said i dont know if youve heard but last year we faced trollocs on our own and without a whisker of help from the crown youd have helped if youd known but the fact that there were no troops nearbynone capable of knowing our dangersays something elayne hesitated the two rivers has rediscovered its history faile said carefully it couldnt rest forever not with tarmon gaidon looming not after sheltering the dragon reborn during his childhood part of me wonders if manetheren had to fall if the two rivers had to rise to provide a place for rand althor to be raised among farmers with the bloodand obstinacyof kings which makes it all the more important that i quiet things now elayne said i offered you a boon so that you could ask for forgiveness id pardon you and ill be certain to send troops so that your people are protected accept this and we can all go back to life the way it should be that isnt going to happen perrin said softly the two rivers will have lords now i fought it for a time you may too but it wont change anything perhaps elayne said but recognizing you would be to agree that a man can just claim a title within my nation then keep it by stubbornly gathering an army it makes for a terrible precedent perrin i dont think you realize the predicament youve put me in well muddle through perrin said in that stubborn tone he used when he wasnt going to budge im not stepping down youre doing a poor job of persuading me you will accept my authority elayne snapped not good faile thought opening her mouth to jump in a clash here would not serve them well before she could speak however another voice cut in daughte morgase said softly drinking her tea if you plan to dance with taveren be sure that you know the proper steps ive traveled with this man ive seen the world bend around him ive seen bitter enemies become his allies to fight the pattern itself is to try to move a mountain with a spoon elayne hesitated looking at her mother please forgive me if i overstep myself morgase continued but elayne i promised these two that i would speak for them i told you i would andor is strong but i fear it could break itself against this man he does not want your throne i promise it and the two rivers does need supervision would it be such a terrible thing to let them have the man they themselves have chosen the small room fell silent elayne eyed perrin sizing him up faile held her breath all right elayne said i assume youve come with demands lets hear them so we can discover if theres anything that can be done no demands faile said an offer elayne raised an eyebrow your mother is right faile said perrin does not want your throne what you two want may be irrelevant once your people get an idea in their minds faile shook her head they love him your majesty they respect him theyll do what he says we can and will put down ideas of manetheren rising again and why would you do that elayne asked i know how fast the two rivers is growing with those refugees coming in over the mountains nations could rise and fall with the coming of the last battle you have no reason to give up the chance to form your own kingdom actually faile said we have good reason andor is a strong nation and prosperous the towns in the two rivers may be growing rapidly but the people have barely begun to want a lord theyre still farmers at heart they dont want glory they want their crops to survive faile paused perhaps youre right perhaps there will be another breaking but thats only more reason to have allies nobody wants civil war in andor least of all the two rivers folk what do you propose then elayne said nothing really that doesnt exist already faile said give perrin an oficial title and make him high lord over the two rivers and what do you mean by high lord elayne asked hed rank higher than other noble houses in andor but beneath the queen i doubt the others would like that elayne said what of taxes the two rivers is exempt faile said as elaynes expression soured she continued quickly your majesty the throne ignored the two rivers for generations not protecting them from bandits or sending workers to improve their roads not giving them anything in the way of magistrates or justices they didnt need it elayne said they governed themselves fine she left unsaid that the two rivers folk would probably have tossed out tax collectors magistrates or justices sent by the queenbut she seemed to know it well faile said nothing needs change then the two rivers governs itself you could have tarifffree trade with them alliandre said something i already have elayne said so nothing changes faile said again except that you gain a powerful province to the west perrin as your ally and subject lord will agree to marshal troops in your defense he will also call up his sworn monarchs to your allegiance elayne glanced at alliandre shed probably heard of alliandres swearing from morgase but also would want to hear it for herself i swore fealty to lord perrin alliandre said ghealdan had long lacked strong allies i meant to change that your majesty faile said leaning forward tea cupped in her hands before her perrin spent several weeks with some seanchan officers they have created a great pact of nations allied beneath one banner rand althor though you may trust him as a friend has done the same tear illian and maybe now arad doman are beneath his rule nations join rather than split these days andor looks smaller by the hour thats why i did what i did alliandre said well in failes view alliandre had been caught up by perrin as a taveren there hadnt been much planning but alliandre might see it otherwise your majesty faile continued there is much to gain here through my marriage to perrin you gain a tie to saldaea through alliandres oaths yu gain ghealdan berelain also follows perrin and has often mentioned her desire to find strong allies for mayene if we were to speak with her i suspect she might be willing to make an alliance with us we could create our own pact five nations if you count the two rivers as onesix if you do take the sun throne as rumor claims you will we are not the most powerful nations but the many are stronger than the one and you would be at our head elaynes face had lost almost all of its hostility saldaea what are you in its line of succession im second faile admitted which elayne probably already knew perrin shifted in his chair she knew he was still uncomfortable with that fact well he would simply have to get used to it second is too close elayne replied what if you end up with the throne of saldaea i could lose the two rivers to another country that way this is easy to fix alliandre said if faile were to ascend one of her and perrins children could continue as lord of the two rivers another could take the throne of saldaea put it in writing and you will be protected i could accept such an arrangement elayne said i dont have problems with it faile replied looking at perrin i suppose i should like one of them myself elayne said thoughtfully one of your children i mean to marry into the andoran royal line if the two rivers is to be ruled by a lord with as much power as this treaty would give him then i would love to have blood connections to the throne i wont promise that perrin said my children will make their own choices it is sometimes the way of nobility elayne said it would be unusual but not unheard of for children like ours to be engaged from birth we wont do it that way in the two rivers perrin said stubbornly ever faile shrugged we could offer encouragement your majesty elayne hesitated then nodded that will be fine but the other houses wont like this high lord business thered need to be a way around it give the two rivers to the dragon reborn morgase said elaynes eyes lit up yes that would work if i gave the area to him to be his seat in andor faile opened her mouth but elayne cut her off with a wave of the hand this isnt negotiable ill need some way to convince the other lords and ladies that im right to give the two rivers so much autonomy if the lands are granted to the dragon reborn giving him a title in andor and making the two rivers his seat then it will make sense for your home to be treated differently the noble houses of andor will accept this since the two rivers is where rand came from and andor does owe him a debt well have him ppoint perrins line as his stewards instead of capitulating to rebels within my borders ill be seen allowing the dragon reborn the man i love to elevate his good friend it might also give us some ground against the illiantear pact you mentioned who are bound to claim that their ties to rand give them the right of conquest she grew thoughtful tapping the side of her cup that seems reasonable perrin said nodding steward of the two rivers i like the sound of that yes well faile said i guess its settled then the taxes elayne said as if she hadnt heard you put them into a trust to be administered by perrin and his line with the understanding that if the dragon ever returns he can call upon them yes that gives us a legal excuse for your exemption of course perrin will have authority to dip into those funds to improve the two rivers roads food stores defenses elayne looked at faile then smiled taking a long drink of tea im beginning to think it was a good idea not to execute you thats certainly a relief alliandre said smiling as the least powerful one in the union she stood to gain a lot from the alliances your majesty faile said call me elayne she said pouring a goblet of wine for faile very well elayne faile said smiling and putting aside her tea then accepting the wine i need to ask do you know what is happening with the dragon reborn oxbrained lummox elayne said shaking her head the bloody mans got egwene all riled up egwene perrin asked shes amyrlin finally elayne said as if the fact had been inevitable perrin nodded though faile found herself amazed how had that happened and why wasnt perrin surprised by it whats he gone and done perrin asked he says hes going to break the remaining seals of the dark ones prison elayne said frowning well need to stop him of course foolish plan you could help with that egwenes gathering a force to persuade him i think i could be of help perrin said do you know where he is currently faile asked perrin had a good idea from his visions but she wanted to know what elayne knew i dont know elayne said but i do know where he will be fortuona athaem devi paendrag ruler of the glorious seanchan empire marched into her teaching chamber she wore a magnificent gown of golden cloth cut after the highest imperial fashion the skirt split at the front to just above the knees and was so long that it took five dacovale to carry the sides and train she wore an ornate headdress of gold and crimson silk with beautiful silken wings shaped like those of an owl taking flight and her arms glittered with thirteen bracelets each of a different gemstone combination she wore crystal at her throat in a long strand she had heard an owl above her window the last night and it had not flown away when she looked out an omen indicating great care should be taken that the next days would be ones of important decisions the proper response was to wear jewelry with powerful symbolism when she entered the chamber those inside prostrated themselves only the deathwatch guardmen in armor of blood red and deep greenwas exempt they bowed but kept their eyes up watching for danger the large chamber was windowless lines of stacked pottery stood at one end a place for damane to practice weaves of destruction the floor was covered in woven mats where stubborn damane were sent to the ground writhing in pain it would not do for them to be harmed physically damane were among the most important tools the empire had more valuable than horses or raken you did not destroy a beast because it was slow to learn you punished it until it learned fortuona crossed the chamber to where a proper imperial throne had been set up she commonly came here to watch the damane being worked or broken it soothed her the throne was atop a small dais she climbed the steps train rustling as her dacovale carried it she turned to face the room allowing the servants to arrange her dress they took her by her arms and lifted her back into the throne draping her long golden skirts down the front of the dais like a tapestry those skirts were sewn with the writings of imperial power the empress is seanchan the empress will live forever the empress must be obeyed she sat as a living banner to the might of the empire selucia took her position on the lower steps of the dais this done the courtiers raised themselves the damane of course remained kneeling there were ten of them with heads bowed their suldam holding their leashes andin a few casespatting them affectionately on the heads king beslan entered hed shaved most of his head leaving only a dark strip on the top and seven of his fingernails had been lacquered one more fingernail than anyone on this side of the ocean excepting fortuona herself he still wore altaran clothinga uniform of green and white rather than seanchan robes she had not pressed him on this so far as she knew since his raising beslan hadnt made any plans to have her assassinated remarkable any seanchan would have immediately begun scheming some would have tried an assassination others would have decided to make only plans but remain supportive but all would have considered killing her many on this side of the ocean thought differently shed never have believed it if not for her time with matrim that was obviously one reason why fortuona had been required to go with him she just wished shed interpreted the omens earlier beslan was joined by captaingeneral lunal galgan and a few members of the low blood galgan was a wideshouldered fellow with a crest of white hair atop his head the other members of the blood deferred to him they knew he had her favor if things went well here and with the reclamation of seanchan there was a good chance shed raise him to the imperial family the ranks of the family would need to be refilled after all once fortuona returned and restored order undoubtedly many had been assassinated or executed galgan was a valuable ally hed not only worked openly against suroth but had suggested the assault on the white tower which had gone well extremely well melitene fortuonas dersuldam stepped forward and bowed again the stout graying woman led a damane with dark brown hair and bloodshot eyes apparently this one wept often melitene had the presence to look embarrassed at the weeping and bowed extra low fortuona chose not to notice that the damane was acting so displeasingly this one was a fine catch despite her petulance fortuona made a series of gestures to selucia instructing her in what to say the woman watched with keen eyes half of her head covered in cloth while she waited for the hair to grow there the other half shaved fortuona would eventually have to choose another voice as selucia was now her truthspeaker show us what this woman can do selucia said voicing the words fortuona had signed to her melitene patted the damane on the head suffa will show i empressmay she live foreverthe power of slicing the air please suffa said looking pleadingly toward fortuona please listen to me i am the amyrlin seat melitene hissed and suffas eyes opened wide obviously feeling a blast of pain through the adam the damane continued anyway i can offer great bounty powerful empress if i am returned i will give you ten women to take my place twenty the most powerful the white tower has i she broke off moaning and collapsed to the ground melitene was sweating she looked to selucia speaking quickly nervously please explain to the empress of us allmay she live forever that my eyes are lowered for not having trained this one properly suffa is amazingly stubborn despite how quick she is to weep and offer others in her place fortuona sat for a moment letting melitene sweat eventually she signed for selucia to speak the empress is not displeased with you selucia voiced these marattidamane who call themselves aes sedai have all proven stubborn please express my gratitude to the greatest one melitene said relaxing if it pleases she whose eyes look upward i can make suffa perform but there may be further outbursts you may continue selucia voiced melitene knelt beside suffa speaking sharply at first then consolingly she was very skilled at working with former marathdamane of course fortuona considered herself good with damane as well she enjoyed breaking marathdamane as much as her brother halvate had enjoyed training wild grolm shed always found it a pity that he had been assassinated he was the only one of her brothers who shed ever been fond of suffa finally got back onto her knees fortuona leaned forward curious suffa bowed her head and a line of lightbrilliant and purecut the air in front of her that line turned sideways along a central axis opening a hole directly in front of fortuonas throne trees rustled beyond and fortuonas breath caught as she saw a hawk with a white head streak away from the portal an omen of great power the normally unflappable selucia gasped though whether it was at the portal or the omen fortuona did not know fortuona covered her own surprise so it was true traveling wasnt a myth or a rumor it was real this changed everything about the war beslan walked forward bowing to her looking hesitant she waved fot him and galgan to come to where they could see the forest glade through the opening beslan stared mouth hanging open galgan clasped his hands behind his back he was a curious one hed met with assassins in the city and had inquired about the cost for having fortuona killed then hed had each of the men who quoted him a price executed a very subtle maneuverit was meant to show that she should consider him a threat as he was not afraid of meeting with assassins however it was also a visible sign of loyalty follow you for now the move said but i am watching and i am ambitious in many ways his careful maneuvering was more comforting to her than beslans apparently unwavering loyalty the first she could anticipate the second well she wasnt certain what to make of it yet would matrim be equally loyal what would it be like to have a prince of the ravens whom she did not have to plot against it seemed almost a fantasy the type of tale told to common children to make them dream of an impossible marriage this is incredible beslan said greatest one with this ability his station made him one of the only people able to speak directly to her the empress wishes to know selucia voiced reading fortuonas fingers if any of the captured marathdamane spoke of the weapon tell the highest empressmay she live foreverthat they did not melitene said sounding worried and if i may be so bold i believe that they are not lying it seems that the explosion outside the city was an isolated accidentthe result of some unknown terangreal used imprudently perhaps there is no weapon it was possible fortuona had already begun to doubt the validity of those rumors the explosion had happened before fortuona had arrived in ebou dar and the details were confusing perhaps this had all been a ploy by suroth or her enemies captaingeneral selucia voiced the greatest one wishes to know what you would do with a power such as this traveling ability that depends galgan said rubbing his chin what is its range how large can she make it can all damane do this are there limitations on where a hole can be opened if it pleases the greatest one i will speak with the damane and get these answers it does please the empress selucia voiced this is troubling beslan said they could attack behind our battle lines they could open a portal like this into the empresss own chambers may she live forever with this everything we know about war will change the members of the deathwatch guard shuffleda sign of great discomfort only furyk karede did not move if anything his expression grew harder fortuona knew that he would soon be suggesting a new rotating location of her sleeping quarters fortuona thought for a moment staring at that rent in the air that rent in reality itself then contrary to tradition she stood up on her dais fortunately beslan was there one she could address directlyand let the others hear her commands reports say fortuona announced that there are still hundreds of marathdamane in the place called the white tower they are the key to recapturing seanchan the key to holding this land and the key to preparing for the last battle the dragon reborn will serve the crystal throne we have been provided with a way to strike let it be said to the captaingeneral that he should gather his finest soldiers i want each and every damane we control to be brought back to the city we will train them in this method of traveling and then we will go in force to the white tower before we struck them with a pinprick now we will let them know the full weight of our sword all of the marathdamane must be leashed she sat back down letting the room fall still it was rare that the empress made such announcements personally but this was a time for boldness you should not allow word of this to spread selucia said to her voice firm she was now speaking in her role as truthspeaker yes another would have to be chosen to be fortuonas voice you would be a fool to let the enemy know for certain we have this traveling fortuona took a deep breath yes that was true she would make certain each in this room was held to secrecy but once the white tower was captured they would talk of her proclamation and would read the omens of her victory upon the skies and world around them we will need to strike soon selucia signed yes fortuona signed back our previous attack will have them gathering arms our next move will have to be decisive then selucia signed but think delivering thousands of soldiers into the white tower through a hidden basement room striking with the force of a thousand hammers against a thousand anvils fortuona nodded the white tower was doomed dont know that theres much more to say perrin thorn said leaning back in his chair tabac smoke curling out of his longstemmed pipe it was a warm night and they didnt have a fire in the hearth just a few candles on the table with some bread cheeses and a pitcher of ale perrin puffed on his own pipe only he thorn and mat were in the room gaul and grady waited out in the common room mat had cursed perrin for bringing those twoan aiel and an ashaman were rather conspicuous but perrin felt safer with those two than with an entire company of soldiers hed shared his story with mat and thorn first speaking of maiden the prophet alliandre and galad then they had filled him in on their experiences it stunned perrin how much had happened to the three of them since their parting empress of the seanchan eh perrin said watching the smoke twist above him in the dim room daughter of the nine moons mat said its different and youre married perrin grinned matrim cauthon married you didnt have to share that part you know mat said to thom oh i assure you i did indeed for a gleeman you seem to leave out most of the heroic parts of the things i do mat said at least you mentioned the hat perrin smiled contented he hadnt realized how much hed missed sitting with friends to spend the evening chatting a carved wooden sign hung outside the window dripping with rainwater it depicted faces wearing strange hats and exaggerated smiles the happy throng there was probably a story behind the name the three of them were in a private dining chamber paid for by mat theyd brought in three of the inns large hearth chairs they didnt fit the table but they were comfortable mat leaned back putting his feet up on the table he took up a hunk of ewes milk cheese and bit off a piece then balanced the rest on his chair arm you know mat perrin said your wife is probably going to expect you to be taught table manners oh ive been taught mat said i just never learned id like to meet her perrin said shes something interesting thom replied interesting mat said yeah he looked wistful anyway youve heard the lot of it now perrin that bloody brown brought us here havent seen her in over two weeks now can i see the note perrin asked mat patted a few pockets then fished out a small white piece of paper folded closed and sealed with red wax he tossed it onto the table the corners were bent the paper smudged but it hadnt been opened matrim cauthon was a man of his word at least when you could pry an oath out of him perrin lifted the note it smelled faintly of perfume he turned it over then held it up to a candle doesnt work mat said perrin grunted so what do you think it says dont know mat said bloody insane aes sedai i mean theyre all odd but verins fallen completely off her stone dont suppose youve heard from her i havent hope shes all right mat said she sounded worried something might happen to her he took the note back then tapped it on the table you going to open it mat shook his head ill open it when i get back i a knock came at the door then it creaked open revealing the innkeeper a younger man named denezel he was tall with a lean face and a head he kept shaved the man was all but dragonsworn from what perrin had seen even going so far as to have a portrait of rand commissioned and hung in the common room it wasnt a bad likeness i apologize master crimson denezel said but master goldens man insisted on speaking with him its all right perrin said grady poked his weathered face into the room and denezel retreated ho grady mat said waving blown up anyone interesting lately the tanned ashaman frowned looking to perrin my lord lady faile asked me to remind you when midnight arrived mat whistled see this is why i left my wife in another kingdom gradys frown deepened thank you grady perrin said with a sigh i hadnt realized the time well be going soon the ashaman nodded then withdrew burn him mat said cant the man at least smile flaming sky is depressing enough without people like him trying to imitate it well son thorn said pouring some ale some just dont find the world particularly humorous lately nonsense mat said the worlds plenty humorous the whole bloody place has been laughing at me lately im telling you perrin with those drawings of us about you need to keep your head low i dont see how i can perrin said ive got an army to lead people to care for i dont think youre taking verins warning seriously enough lad thom said shaking his head you ever heard of the banath people no perrin said looking at mat they were a group of savages who roamed what is now almoth plain thorn said i know a couple fine songs about them see their various tribes always painted the skin of their leader red to make him stand out mat took another bite of his cheese bloody fools painted their leader red that would make him a target for every soldier on the field that was the point thorn said it was a challenge you see how else would their enemies be able find him and test their skill against him mat snorted id have painted a few decoy soldiers red to distract them from me then had my archers feather their leader with arrows while everyone was trying to hunt down the fellows they thought were leading my army actually thom said taking a sip of his ale thats exactly what villiam bloodletter did during his first and last battle with them the song of a hundred days talks about it brilliant maneuver im surprised youve heard of that songits very obscure and the battle happened so long ago most history books dont even remember it for some reason the comment made mat smell nervous youre saying that were making ourselves targets perrin said im saying thom replied that you boys are getting harder and harder to hide everywhere you go banners proclaim your arrival people talk about you im halfconvinced you have only survived this long because the forsaken didnt know where to find you perrin nodded thinking of the trap his army had nearly fallen into assassins in the night would come so what should i do mats been sleeping in a different tent each night thom said and sometimes in the city you should try something like that grady can make gateways right why not have him make one for you into the middle of your tent each night sneak out and sleep someplace else then travel back in the morning everyone will assume youre in your tent if assassins strike you wont be there perrin nodded thoughtfully even better i could leave five or six aiel inside on alert waiting perrin mat said thats downright devious he smiled youve changed for the better my friend from you ill try to accept that as a compliment perrin said he paused then added it will be difficult thom chuckled hes right though youve changed what happened to the softspoken unsure boy i helped escape the two rivers he passed through the blacksmiths fire perrin said softly thorn nodded seeming to understand and you mat perrin said can i do something to help you maybe let you travel between tents no ill be fine how are you going to protect yourself with my wits planning to find some of those then perrin said about time mat snorted what is it with everyone and my wits lately ill be fine trust me remind me to tell you about the night when i first figured out i could win whatever dice game i wanted to its a good story involves falling off bridges one bridge at least well you could tell us now perrin said not the right time anyway it doesnt matter see im leaving soon thorn smelled excited perrin you will lend us a gateway wont you mat asked hate to leave the band theyll be inconsolable without me at least they have those dragons to blow things up but where are you going perrin asked suppose i should explain it mat said that was the reason for meeting with you aside from the amiable discourse and all he leaned in perrin moiraine is alive what its true mat said or well we think it is she sent thorn a letter claiming shed foreseen the battle with lanfear and knew that she would well anyway theres this tower west of here on the river arinelle its made all of metal it the tower of ghenjei perrin said softly yes i know of it mat blinked you do burn me when did you get to be a scholar ive merely heard some things mat that place is evil well moiraine is inside mat said captured i mean to get her back i have to beat the snakes and the foxes bloody cheats snakes and foxes perrin said thorn nodded the childrens game is named after the things that live in the tower so we think ive seen them mat said and well theres really not time for that now if youre going to rescue her perrin said perhaps i could come or at least send one of the ashaman ill take a gateway gladly mat said but you cant come perrin moraine explained it in her letter only three can come and i know already who they have to be he hesitated olver is going to bloody kill me for not taking him you know mat perrin said shakmg his head youre not makmg any sense mat sghed let me tell you the whole story then he eyed the pitcher of ale were going to need more of that and youd better tell grady youll be some time yet chapter near avendesora aviendha took one final step and was out of the forest of glass pillars she took a deep breath then glanced back at the path she had taken the central plaza of rhuidean was an aweinspiring sight smooth white flagstones carpeted the entire square save for the absolute center there stood an enormous tree branches spread wide like arms reaching to embrace the sun the massive tree had a perfection she could not explain it had a natural symmetryno missing branches no gaping holes in its leafy upper reaches it was particularly impressive since when shed last seen it it had been blackened and burned in a world where other plants were dying without explanation this one healed and flourished faster than ever should have been possible its leaves rustled soothingly in the wind and its gnarled roots poked through the ground like the aged fingers of a wise elder the tree made her want to sit and bask in the simple peace of the moment it was as if this tree were the ideal the one after which all other trees were patterned in legend it was called avendesora the tree of life to the side sat the glass columns there were dozens of them perhaps hundreds forming concentric rings spindly and thin they reached high into the sky as purelyeven superlativelynatural as avendesora was these columns were equally natural they were so thin and tall logic said that the first gust of wind should have toppled them it wasnt that they were aberrant merely artificial when she had first entered days before there had been gaishain in white carefully picking up fallen leaves and twigs they had retreated as soon as they had seen her was she the first to go through the glass pillars since rhuideans transformation her own clan had sent no one and she was certain she would have heard of it if the others had that left only the shaido but they had rejected rands claims about the aiel oast aviendha suspected that if any shaido had come they would not have been able to bear what was shown here they would have passed into the center of the glass columns and never returned that had not been the case for aviendha she had survived indeed everything shed seen had been expected almost disappointingly so she sighed walking over to avendesords trunk then looking up through its web of branches once this plaza had been cluttered with other terangreal this was where rand had first discovered the access keys he had used to cleanse saidin that wealth of terangreal was gone now moiraine had claimed many pieces for the white tower and the aiel who lived here must have taken the others away that left only the tree the columns and the three rings that women went through on their first trip here the trip that made them apprentice wise ones she remembered some of her trip through those rings which had showed her lifeher many possible livesto her really only bits and pieces remained in her memory her knowledge that she would love rand that she would have sisterwives included in that knowledge was the impression that shed return here to rhuidean she had known though only stepping into this courtyard again had sparked some of those memories to life in her mind she sat down crosslegged between two of the great trees roots the soft wind was soothing the air dry and familiar the dusty scent of the threefold land reminding her of her childhood her trip through the columns had certainly been immersive she had expected to see the origins of the aiel perhaps witness the day when they hadas a peopledecided to take up the spears and fight shed anticipated a noble decision where honor overcame the inferior lifestyle dictated by the way of the leaf she had been surprised to see how mundanealmost accidentalthe true event had been no grand decision only a man who had been unwilling to let his family be murdered there was honor in wanting to defend others but he had not approached his decision with honor she rested her head back against the trunk of the tree the aiel did deserve their punishment in the threefold land and they did have tohas a peopleto the aes sedai she had seen everything she had expected but many of the things she had been hoping to learn had been absent aiel would continue to visit this place for centuries as they had for centuries and each of them would learn something that was now common knowledge that bothered her deeply she looked upward watching branches quiver in the breeze several leaves falling and drifting down toward her one passed her face brushing her cheek before alighting on her shawl passing through the glass columns was no longer a challenge originally this terangreal had provided a test could the potential leader face and accept the aiels darkest secret as a maiden aviendha had been tested in body and strength becoming a wise one tested a person emotionally and mentally rhuidean was to be the capstone of that process the final test of mental endurance but that test was gone now more and more she was coming to believe that tradition for the sake of tradition was foolishness good traditionsstrong aiel traditionstaught the ways of jietoh methods of survival aviendha sighed standing the forest of columns looked like the strange lines of frozen water she had seen during winter in the wetlands icicles elayne had called them these grew up from the ground pointing toward the sky things of beauty and power it was sad to witness their lapse into irrelevance something occurred to her before she had left caemlyn she and elayne had made a remarkable discovery aviendha had manifested a talent in the one power the ability to identify terangreal could she determine exactly what the glass pillars did they couldnt have been created specifically for the aiel could they most things of great power like this hailed from very ancient days the pillars would have been created during the age of legends then adapted to the purpose of showing the aiel their true past there was so much they didnt know about terangreal had the ancient aes sedai really understood them the same way aviendha understood exactly how a bow or spear worked or had they themselves been mystified by the things they created the one power was so wondrous so mysterious that even working practiced weaves often made aviendha feel like a child she stepped up to the nearest glass pillar careful not to pass inside the ring if she touched one of the rods perhaps her talent would let her read something about them it was dangerous to experiment with terangreal but she had already passed their challenge and was unscathed hesitantly she reached out and laid fingers on the slick glassy surface it was about a foot thick she closed her eyes trying to read the pillars function she sensed the powerful aura of the pillar it was far more potent than any of the terangreal she had handled with elayne indeed the pillars seemed alive somehow it was almost as if she could sense an awareness from them that gave her a chill was she touching the pillar or was it touching her she tried to read terangreal as she had done before but this one was vast incomprehensible like the one power itself she inhaled sharply disoriented by the weight of what she felt it was as if she had suddenly fallen into a deep dark pit she snapped her eyes open pulling her hand away palm quivering this was beyond her she was an insect trying to grasp the size and mass of a mountain she took a breath to steady herself then shook her head there was nothing more to be done here she turned from the glass pillars and took a step she was malidra eighteen but scrawny enough to appear much younger she crawled in the darkness careful quiet it was dangerous to get this close to the lightmakers hunger drove her forward it always did the night was cold the landscape barren malidra had heard stories of a place beyond the distant mountains where the land was green and food grew everywhere she didnt believe those lies the mountains were just lines in the sky jagged teeth who could climb something so tall maybe the lightmakers could they did come from that direction usually their camp was ahead of her glowing in the darkness that glow was too steady to be fire it came from the balls they carried with them she inched closer crouching bare ket and hands dusty there were a few men and women of the folk with her grimy faces stringy hair ragged beards on the men a mishmash of clothing tattered trousers garments that might once have been shirts anything to keep the sun off during the day because the sun could kill and did malidra was the last of four sisters two dead by the sun and hunger one dead from the bite of a snake but malidra survived anxiously she survived the best way was to follow the lightmakers it was dangerous but her mind barely noticed danger anymore that was what happened when virtually anything could kill you malidra passed a bush watching the lightmaker guards two sentries carrying their long rodlike weapons malidra had found one on a dead man once but she hadnt been able to make it do anything the lightmakers had magics the same magics that created their food and their lights magics that kept them warm in the bitter cold at night the two men wore strange clothing trousers that fit too well coats covered with pockets and glistening bits of metal both had hats though one wore his back held around his neck by a thin leather strap the men chatted they didnt have beards like the folk did their hair was darker one of the other folk got too close and malidra hissed at her the woman shot back a glare but moved away malidra stayed at the edge of the light the lightmakers wouldnt see her their strange glowing orbs ruined their night vision she rounded their massive wagon there were no horses only the wagon large enough to house a dozen people it moved magically during the daylight rolling on wheels nearly as wide as malidra was tall she had heardin the hushed broken communication of folkthat in the east the lightmakers were creating a massive roadway it would pass directly through the waste it was made by laying down strange pieces of metal they were too big to pry up though jorshem had shown her a large nail he had found he used it to scrape meat off bones it had been quite a while since she had eaten wellnot since theyd managed to kill that merchant in his sleep two years ago she could still remember that feast digging into his stores eating until her stomach ached such an odd feeling wondrous and painful most lightmakers were too careful for her to kill them in their sleep she didnt dare face them when they were awake they could make one such as her vanish with a stare nervously trailed by a couple of other folk she rounded the wagon and approached it from the back sure enough here the lightmakers had tossed some of the leavings from their earlier meal she scuttled forward and began to dig through the trash there were some cuttings of meat strips of fat she snatched these up eagerlyholding them close before the others could seeand stuffed them into her mouth she felt dirt grind against her teeth but meat was food she hurriedly picked through the waste some more a bright light shone on her she froze hand halfway to her mouth the other two folk screamed scrambling away she tried to do likewise but tripped there was a hiss of soundone of the lightmaker weaponsand something popped against her back it felt like shed been hit with a small rock she collapsed the pain sudden and sharp the light faded slightly she blinked eyes adjusting even as she felt her life seeping out and around her hands i told you a voice said two shadows moved in front of the light she had to run she tried to rise but only managed to thrash weakly blood and char flern a second voice said a silhouette knelt beside her poor thing almost a child she wasnt doing any harm flern snorted no harm ive seen these creatures try to slit a sleeping mans throat all for his trash bloody pests the other shadow looked at her and she caught sight of a grim face twinkling eyes like stars the man sighed rising next time we bury the trash he retreated back toward the light the second man flern stood watching her was that her blood all over her hands warm like water that had been sitting in the sun for too long death did not surprise her in a way shed been expecting it for most of her eighteen years bloody aiel flern said as her sight faded aviendhas foot hit the flagstone in rhuideans square and she blinked in shock the sun had changed in the sky above hours had passed what had happened the vision had been so real like her viewings of the early days of her people but she could make no sense of it had she gone even farther back into history that seemed like the age of legends the strange machines clothing and weapons but that bad been the waste she could remember distinctly being malidra she could remember years of hunger of scavenging of hatredand fearof the lightmakers she remembered her death the terror trapped and bleeding that warm blood on her hands she raised a hand to her head sick and unsettled not by the death everyone woke from the dream and while she did not welcome it she would not fear it no the horrible thing about the vision had been the complete lack of honor shed seen killing men in the night for their food scavenging for halfchewed meat in the dirt wearing scraps shed been more an animal than a person better to die surely the aiel couldnt have come from roots like those long ago the aiel in the age of legends had been peaceful servants respected how could they have started as scavengers perhaps this was merely one tiny group of aiel or maybe the man had been mistaken there was little way to tell from this single vision why had she been shown it she took a hesitant step away from the glass columns and nothing happened no further visions disturbed she began to walk from the plaza then she slowed hesitantly she turned back the columns stood in the dimming light quiet and alone seeming to buzz with an unseen energy was there more that one vision seemed so disconnected from the others shed seen if she passed into the columns midst again would she repeat what shed been given before or had she perhaps changed something with her talent in the centuries since rhuideans founding those columns had shown the aiel what they needed to know about themselves the aes sedai had set that up hadnt they or had they simply placed the terangreal and allowed it to do what it pleased knowing it would grant wisdom aviendha listened to the trees leaves rustle those pillars were a challenge as sure as an enemy warrior with his spear in hand if she passed into their midst again she might never come out nobody visited this terangreal a second time it was forbidden one trip through the rings one through the columns but she had come seeking knowledge she would not leave without it she turned andtaking a deep breathwalked up to the pillars then took a step she was norlesh she held her youngest child close to her bosom a dry wind tugged at her shawl her baby garlvan started to whimper but she quieted him as her husband spoke with the outlanders an outlander village stood in the near distance built of shacks against the foothills of the mountains they wore dyed clothing and strangely cut trousers with buttoning shirts they had come for the ore how could rocks be so valuable that they would live on this side of the mountains away from their fabled land of water and food away from their buildings where light shone without candles and their carts that moved without horses her shawl slipped and she pulled it up she needed a new one this one was ragged and she didnt have any more thread left for patching garlvan whimpered in her arms and her only other living childmeiseheld to her skirts meise hadnt spoken for monrhs now not since her older brother had died from exposure please said her husbandmetalanto the outlanders there were three of them two men and a woman all wearing trousers rugged folk not like the other foreigners with their delicate features and toofine silks illuminated ones those others sometimes called themselves these three were more ordinary please metalan repeated my family he was a good man or he had been once back when hed been strong and fit now he seemed a shell of that man his cheeks sunken his oncevibrant blue eyes stared absently much of the time haunted that look came from watching three of his children die in eighteen months time though metalan was a head taller than any of the outlanders he seemed to grovel before them the lead outlandera man with a bushy beard and wide honest eyesshook his head he returned to metalan the sack full of stones the raven empress may she always draw breath forbids it no trading with aiel we could be stripped of our charter for talking to you we have no food metalan said my children are starving these stones contain ore i know that it is the type for which you search i spent weeks gathering it give us a bit of food something please sorry friend the lead outlander said it isnt worth trouble with the ravens go on your way we dont want an incident several outlanders approached from behind one carrying an axe two others with hissstaves her husband slumped days of travel weeks of searching for the stones for nothing he turned and walked back to her in the distance the sun was setting once he reached her she and meise joined him walking away from the outlander camp meise began to sniffle but neither of them had the will or strength to carry her about an hour away from the outlander camp her husband found a hollow in a rock shelf they settled in not making a fire there was nothing to burn norlesh wanted to cry but feeling anything seemed difficult im so hungry she whispered i will trap something in the morning her husband said staring up at the stars we havent caught anything in days she said he didnt reply what are we going to do she whispered we havent been able t keep a home for our people since my greatmother tavas day if we gather they attack us if we wander the waste we die off they wont trade with us they wont let us cross the mountains what are we going to do his response was to lie down turning away from her her tears did come then quiet weak they rolled down her cheeks as she undid her shirt to nurse garlvan though she had no suck for him he didnt move he didnt latch on she lifted his small form and realized that he was no longer breathing somewhere along the walk to the hollow he had died without her realizing it the most frightening part was how difficult she found it to summon any sorrow at the death aviendhas foot hit the flagstones around her the forest of glass columns shimmered with prismatic color it was like standing in the middle of an illuminators firework the sun was high in the sky cloud cover remarkably gone she wanted to leave the square forever she had been prepared for the knowledge that the aiel had once followed the way of the leaf that knowledge wasnt very disturbing they would soon fulfill their toh but this these scattered and broken wretches people who didnt stand up for themselves who begged who didnt know how to survive off the land to know that these were her ancestors was a shame she nearly could not bear it was good that rand althor had not revealed this past to the aiel could she flee run from the plaza and see no more if it grew any worse the shame would overwhelm her unfortunately she knew that there was only one way out now that shed begun gritting her teeth she took a step forward she was tava fourteen years old and screaming in the night as she ran from her burning house the entire valleyreally a canyon with steep sideswas in flames every building in the fledgling hold had been set afire nightmarish creatures with sinuous necks and wide wings flapped in the night above bearing riders with bows spears and strange new weapons that made a hissing sound when they fired tava cried searching for her family but the hold was a mass of chaos and confusion some few aiel warriors resisted but anyone who raised a spear fell moments later killed by arrow or by one of the invisible shots from the new weapons an aiel man fell before her corpse rolling on the ground tadvishm had been his name a stone dog it was one of the few societies which still maintained an identity most warriors no longer held to a society they made brothers and sisters of those with whom they camped all too often those camps were scattered anyway this hold was to have been different secret deep within the waste how had their enemies found them a child of only two years was crying she dashed to him snatching him from where he lay near the flames their homes burned the wood had been scavenged with difficulty from the mountains on the eastern edge of the waste she held the child close and ran toward the deeper recesses of the canyon where was her father with a sudden whoosh of sound one of the nightmarish creatures landed before her the burst of wind making her skirt flap a fearsome warrior sat upon the creatures back helmet like that of an insect mandibles sharp and jagged he lowered his hissing staff toward her she cried out in terror huddling around the crying child and closing her eyes the hissing sound never came at a grunt and a sudden screech from the serpentine beast she looked up and saw a figure struggling with the outlander the firelight showed the face of her father cleanshaven as the old traditions dictated the beast beneath the two men lurched throwing both to the ground a few moments later her father rose holding the invaders sword in his hands its length stained dark the invader did not move and behind them the beast leaped into the air howling tava looked up and saw that it was following the rest of the pack the invaders were withdrawing leaving a broken people with burning homes she looked down again the scene horrified her so many bodies dozens lay bleeding on the ground the invader that her father had killed appeared to be the only enemy that had fallen gather sand her fatherrowahnroared quench the flames talleven for an aielwith striking red hair he wore the old clothing of brown and tan boots tied high to his knees that clothing marked one as aiel therefore many had abandoned it being known as aiel meant death her father had inherited his clothing from his grandfather along with a charge follow the old ways remember jietoh fight and maintain honor though he had been in the hold for only a few days the others listened when he yelled for them to put out the fires tava returned the child to a grateful mother and then helped gather sand and dirt a few hours later a tired and bloodied people gathered in the center of the canyon regarding with dull eyes what they had worked for months to build it had been wiped out in a single night her father still carried the sword he used it to direct the people some of the old ones said that a sword was bad luck but why would they say that it was only a weapon we must rebuild her father said surveying the wreckage rebuild said a sootstained man the granary was the first to burn there is no food we will survive her father said we can move deeper into the waste there is nowhere else to go another man said the raven empire has sent word to the far ones and they hunt us at the eastern border they find us whenever we gather another cried it is a punishment her father said but we must endure the people looked at him then in pairs or small groups they began to walk away wait her father said raising his hand we must stay together keep fighting the clan we are not a clan an ashen man said i can survive better on my own no more fighting they beat us when we fight her father lowered the sword its tip hitting the ground tava moved up beside him worried as she watched the others walk their ways into the night the air was still thick with smoke the departing aiel were shadows melting into darkness like swirls of dust blown on the wind they didnt pause to bury their dead her father bowed his head and dropped the sword to the ashcovered ground there were tears in aviendhas eyes there was no shame at crying over this tragedy she had feared the truth and she could no longer deny it those had been seanchan raiders riding atop raken the raven empire the lightmakers from her first vision were the seanchanand they hadnt existed until the middle of the current age when artur hawkwings armies had crossed the oceans she was not seeing the deep past of her people she was seeing their future her first time through the pillars each step had taken her backward moving her through time toward the age of legends it appeared that this time the visions had started at a distant point in the future and were working back toward her day each vision jumping back a generation or two tears streaking her face she took the next step chapter court of the sun she was ladalin wise one of the taardad aiel how she wished that she had been able to learn to channel that was a shameful thought wishing for a talent one did not have but she could not deny it she sat in the tent feeling regretful if shed been able to work with the one power perhaps she could have done more to help the wounded she could have remained young to lead her clan and perhaps her bones would not ache so old age was a frustration when there was so much to do the tent walls rustled as the remaining clan chiefs settled down there was only one other wise one in the room mora of the goshien aiel she could not channel either the seanchan were particularly determined when it came to killing or capturing all aielmale or femalewho showed any talent with the one power it was a sorry group gathered in the tent a onearmed young soldier entered with a warm brazier and set it in the middle of them then retreated ladalins mother had spoken of the days when there had still been gaishain to do such work had there really been aiel man or maiden who had not been needed for the war against the seanchan ladalin reached forward to warm her hands at the brazier fingers knotted with age shed held a spear as a young woman most women did before they married how could a woman remain behind when the seanchan used female soldiers and their damane with such effectiveness shed heard stories about her mother and greatmothers days but they seerned incredible the war was all ladalin had ever known her first memories as a little girl were of the almoth strikes her youth had been spent training she had fought in the battles focused around the land that had been known as tear ladalin had married and raised children but had focused every breath on the conflict aiel or seanchan both knew that eventually only one of the two would remain it was looking more and more like the aiel would be the ones forced out that was another difference between her day and her mothers day her mother had not spoken of failure ladalins lifetime was filled with milestones of withdrawal and retreat the others seemed absorbed in their thoughts three clan chiefs and two wise ones they were all that remained of the council of twentytwo highland winds seeped through the tent flaps chilling her back tamaav was the last to arrive he looked as old as she felt his face scarred and his left eye lost in battle he sat down on the rock the aiel no longer carried rugs or cushions only the essentials could be transported the white tower has fallen he said my scouts informed me not an hour ago i trust their information he had always been a blunt man and a good friend to her husband who had fallen last year then with it goes our last hope said takai the youngest of the clan chiefs he was the third chief of the miagoma in as many years speak not so ladalin said there is always hope they have pushed us all the way to these cursed mountains takai said the shiande and the daryne are no more that leaves only five clans and one of those is broken and scattered we are beaten ladalin tamaav sighed shed have lain a bridal wreath at his feet had the years been earlier and the times different her clan needed a chief her son still thought to become the one but with the recent seanchan capture of rhuidean the clans were uncertain how to choose new leaders we must retreat into the threefold land mora said in her soft matronly voice and seek penance for our sins what sins takai snapped the dragon wanted peace she replied the dragon left us takai said i refuse to follow the memory of a man my greatfathers barely knew we made no oaths to follow his foolish pact we peace takai jorshem said the last of the three clan chiefs was a small hawkfaced man with some andoran blood in him from his greatfather only the threefold land holds any hope for us now the war against the ravens has been lost the tent fell still they said theyd hunt us takai said when they demanded surrender they warned us against retreat you know that they said they would destroy any place where three aiel gathered we will not surrender ladalin said firmly more firmly than she felt to be honest surrender would make us gaishain tamaav said they used the word to mean one without honor though that was not the way ladalins mother had used it ladalin what is your advice the other four looked at her she was of the lineage of the dragon one of the last living the other three lines had been killed off if we become slaves to the seanchan the aiel as a people will be no more she said we cannot win so we must retreat we will return to the threefold land and build up our strength perhaps our children can fight where we cannot silence again they all knew her words to be optimistic at best after decades of war the aiel were a bare fraction of the number they had once been seanchan channelers were brutal in their effectiveness though the wise ones and dragon blooded used the one power in battle it was not enough those cursed adam each channeler the aiel lost to capture was eventually turned against them the real turning point in the war had been the entry of the other nations after that the seanchan had been able to seize wetlander peoples and cull more channelers from their ranks the ravens were unstoppable now that tar valon had fallen every realm in the wetlands was subject to the seanchan only the black tower still fought though the ashaman did so in secret as their fortress had fallen years before aiel could not fight in secret there was no honor to that of course what did honor matter now after deaths numbering in the hundreds of thousands after the burning of cairhien and the scouring ofillian it had been twenty years since the seanchan had gained the andoran war machines the aiel had been tumbling toward defeat for decades it was a testament to their tenacious nature that they had lasted so long this is his fault takai said still looking sullen the caracarn could have led us to glory but he abandoned us his fault ladalin said understandingperhaps for the first timewhy that statement was wrong no aiel take responsibility for themselves this is our fault and not that of my distant greatfather we have forgotten who we are we are without honor our honor was taken from us takai said sighing as he stood people of the dragon indeed what is the good of being his people we were drafted to be a spear the legends say forged in the threefold land he used us then cast us away what is a discarded spear to do but go to war what indeed ladalin thought the dragon had demanded peace thinking that it would bring happiness to the aiel but how could they be happy when the lightcursed seanchan were in the land her hatred of the invaders ran deep perhaps that hatred had destroyed the aiel she listened to the wind howl as takai stalked from the tent on the morrow the aiel would return to the threefold land if they would not accept peace themselves it seemed they would have to have it forced upon them aviendha took another step forward shed nearly reached the very center of the columns and shards of light sparkled around her her tears flowed freely now she felt like a child being ladalin had been worse than the others for in her aviendha had seen hints of true aiel ways but corrupted as if to make mockery the woman had thought of war and associated it with honor but hadnt understood what honor was no gaishain retreat there had been no mention of toh this was battle stripped completely of point or reason why fight for ladalin it had been about hatred of the seanchan there was war because there had always been war how how had this happened to the aiel aviendha took a step forward she was oncala maiden of the spear she would eventually give the spear up and marry just as her mother had and her mothers mother before her but now was the time to fight she strode through the streets of caemlyn her nearsister carrying the banner of the dragon to announce her lineage next to oncala was the man for whom she would likely give up her spears hehyal dawn runner had killed more seanchan than any of his society gaining much ji he had been granted permission to travel to rhuidean last year to become clan chief rhuidean the city was besieged by seanchan oncala sneered seanchan had no honor they had been told that rhuidean was a place for peace the aiel did not assault the palace in ebou dar the seancha should not attack rhuidean they were lizards it was a source of constant frustration that after decades of war the battle lines remained nearly the same as they had been after her greatfather went to shayol ghul she and hehyal were accompanied by two thousand spears as a guard of honor queen talana knew to expect them and so the white andoran palace gates were open hehyal waved for fifty spears preselected to walk with them through the fine halls lushness abounded here in the palace each tapestry each vase each golden frame seemed an insult to oncala forty years of war and andor had not been touched it lay safe basking in the protection the aiel defense gave them well andor would see the aiel had grown stronger through their fighting once their prowess had been legendary now it was greater when the aiel had destroyed the seanchan the world would see what the aiel had learned the wetland rulers would wish they had been more generous the throne room doors were open oncala and hehyal entered leaving their escort the banner of the dragon flew here too a reminder that the andoran royal line also carried the lineage of the caracarn one more reason for oncala to hate them the andoran nobility thought themselves her equals queen talana was a middleaged woman with deep lustrous red hair not very pretty but very regal she was speaking quietly with one of her advisors and she waved for the aiel to wait an insult deliberate oncala fumed finally they were summoned to approach the lion throne talanas brother her protector stood behind her in court clothinga vest and coathand on his sword oncala could have killed him while barely breaking a sweat ah queen talana said the taardad aiel again you still carry the spear oncala oncala folded her arms but said nothing she knew she was not good with people when she spoke insults were too common better to let the clan chief take the lead i assume youre here to beg for aid again talana said hehyal flushed and oncala wishedfor a momentshe hadnt left her spear outside we have something for you hehyal said taking out a leather pouch and handing it to one of the queens guards the man opened it inspecting the papers inside another insult must they be treated like assassins oncala did not like the queen true but her family and talanas were sworn to allegiance because of their greatmothers who had been firstsisters the soldier handed the queen the papers talana perused them face growing concerned and thoughtful talana like most of the rulers beneath the dragons peace worried about the seanchan the raven empires techniques and skill with shaping the one power were growing the aiel had them held at a stalemate for now what would happen if the seanchan won would they hold to their oaths how much could the seanchan be trusted hehyals agents had spent a great deal of time over the last decade seeding that very question among the great courts of the world he was a wise man even before he had become chief he had realized that this war could not be won by the aiel alone they needed these soft wetlanders and that was the final reason oncala hated them where did you get these talana asked from the seanchan palace hehyal said they should not have struck at rhuidean by honor that allowed us to reciprocatethough our attack was done quietly to recover these i had long suspected where they were located and only my honor in not breaching the seanchan sacred palace held me back talanas face grew hard youre certain these are authentic you question me hehyal asked queen talana shook her head looking troubled she knew that the aiel did not lie we have been patient with you hehyal said we have come to you and explained what will happen if we cannot hold off the seanchan the dragons peace what care do they have for the dragon hehyal asked they are invaders who forced him to bow to their empress she is considered above him they will not keep promises they made to an inferior queen talana looked down again the documents were seanchan plans for attacking andor along with a detailed plot for the assassination of the queen underneath that were similar plans for dealing with the rulers of tear the two rivers and illian i must have time to consult with my advisors talana said we have her oncala thought smiling oncala already knew what the queens answer would be the trick had been to get her to consider action hehyal nodded and the two of them withdrew oncala had to keep herself from yelling in victory if andor entered the war the other nations would as well particularly those in the pact of the griffin and those in the court of the sun they looked to the andoran queen much as the other aiel clans looked to oncala the blood of rand althor held much weight is this right hehyal asked as they walked their spears surrounding them to keep away prying ears oncala started it was your plan he nodded frowning nothing he had said to the queen had been untrue their honor was unsoiled however hehyal had left out one of the sheets theyd discovered that one had explained that the other sheets were contingency plans the descriptions of andors military forces suggestions on how to use gateways and dragons to attack caemlyn the very plot to assassinate queen talanathese had been drawn up only in case andor entered the war they were meant as a preemptive study on a potential enemy not an actual plan to attack it was virtually the same thing the seanchan were snakes they would seize andor eventually and by then the aiel might be unable to help if this war went badly her people would go to the threefold land and leave the foolish wetlanders to be conquered the seanchan would find it impossible to fight the aiel in their homeland much better for queen talana to enter the war now for her own good it was best she never saw that other sheet it is done hehyal said there is no room for question now oncala nodded the seanchan would fall and the aiel would take their rightful place the blood of the dragon reborn was in her veins she deserved to rule it would not be the raven empire that rose at the end of this all but the dragon empire i dont want to go on aviendha said to the empty forest of glass the breeze had fallen still her comment was met with silence her tears had marked the dust by her feet like fallen drops of rain that creature had no honor she said she has ruined us the worst part was the womanoncalahad thought of her mothers mother her greatmother inside ocalas head there had been a face attached to that title aviendha had recognized it as her own cringing closing her eyes she stepped forward into the very center of the radiant columns she was padra daughter of the dragon reborn proud maiden of the spear she yanked her weapon from the neck of a dying seanchan then watched the rest flee through their gateway light curse the one who taught the seanchan traveling padra thought even if their weaves arent very elegant she was convir ced that no living person understood the one power as she and her siblings did shed been able to weave since shed been a child and her brothers and sister were the same to them it was natural and all others who channeled seemed awkward by comparison she was careful not to speak that way aes sedai and wise ones didnt like being reminded of their shortcomings it was true nonetheless padra joined her spearsisters they left one of their number dead on the grass and padra mourned for her tarra of the taardad aiel she would be remembered but honor was theirs for they had slain eight seanchan soldiers she wove a gatewayfor her it happened as fast as she could think she held the one power perpetually even while she slept shed never known what it was like not to have that comforting surging power in the back of her mind others said they feared being consumed by it but how was that possible saidar was a piece of her like her arm or her leg how could one be consumed by ones own flesh bone and blood the gateway led to the aiel camp in the land called arad doman the camp wasnt a city aiel didnt have cities but it was a very large camp and it had not moved in almost a decade padra strode across the grass and aiel in cadinsor showed her deference padra and her siblings as children of the dragon had become something to the aiel not lordsthat concept made her sick but she was more than an ordinary algaidsiswai the clan chiefs looked to her and her siblings for advice and the wise ones took special interest in them they allowed her to channel though she was not one of them she could no sooner stop channeling than she could stop breathing she dismissed her spearsisters then made her way directly to ronams tent the clan chiefson of rhuarcwould need to hear her report she entered and was surprised to see that ronam was not alone a group of men sat on the rug clan chiefs every one her siblings were sitting there as well ah padra ronam said you have returned i can come back another time ronam she said no you were wanted for this meeting sit and share my shade padra bowed her head at the honor he showed her she sat between alarch and janduin her brothers though the four siblings were quadruplets they looked very dissimilar alarch took more after their wetlander side and had dark hair janduin was blond and tall beside him marinna their sister small of build with a round face i should report padra said to ronam that the seanchan patrol was where we thought we engaged them there were uncomfortable mumbles about that it is not against the dragons peace for them to enter arad doman said tavalad clan chief of the goshien aiel nor is it wrong for us to kill them for getting too close clan chief padra replied the aiel are not bound by the dragons peace if the seanchan wish to risk inspecting our camp then they need to know that it is a risk several of the othersmore than she would have expectednodded at that comment she glanced at janduin and he raised an eyebrow she covertly raised two fingers two seanchan dead by her spear she would have liked to take them captive but the seanchan did not deserve to become gaishain they also made terrible prisoners better to spare them the shame and let them die we should speak what we came to say said alalved chief of the tomanelle aiel padra did a quick count all eleven chiefs were accounted for including those who had blood oaths against one another a meeting like this hadnt been seen in years not since her father had been preparing for the last battle and what did we come to say asked one of the others alalved shook his head the spears grow restless the aiel are not meant to grow fat in lush lands tending crops we are warriors the dragon asked for peace tavalad said the dragon asked others for peace alalved replied he excluded the aiel that is true said darvin chief of the reyn do we return to raiding one another after all of these years of holding our blood feuds in abeyance ronam asked softly he was an excellent clan chief much as rhuarc had been wise yet not afraid of battle what would be the point asked shedren chief of the daryne aiel others nodded but that raised a larger problem one her mother had often spoken of what was it to be aiel now that their duty to the past had been fulfilled their toh as a people cleansed how long can we wait alalved said knowing that they have aiel women captive with those bracelets of theirs it has been years and they still continue to refuse all offers of payment and barter they return our civility with rudeness and insults we are not meant to beg said aged bruan the aiel will soon become milkfed wetlanders all nodded at his words wise bruan had lived through the last battle if only the seanchan empress ronam shook his head and she knew what he was thinking the old empress the one who had ruled during the days of the last battle had been considered a woman of honor by ronams father an understanding had nearly been reached with her so it was said but many years had passed since her rule regardless ronam continued the spears clash our people fight when they meet it is our nature if the seanchan wont listen to reason then what cause do we have to leave them be this peace of the dragons will not last long anyway alalved said skirmishes between the nations are common though none speak of them the caracarn required promises of the monarchs but there is no enforcement many wetlanders cannot be held at their word and i worry that the seanchan will devour them while they squabble there were many nods only darvin and tavalad did not seem convinced padra held her breath they had known this was coming the skirmishes with the seanchan the restlessness of the clans she had dreamed of this day but feared it as well her mother had gained great ji in battle padra had had few chances to prove herself a war with the seanchan the prospect invigorated her but it would also mean much death what say the dragons children ronam asked looking at the four of them it still seemed strange that these elders looked to her she checked on saidar comfortable in the back of her mind and drew strength from it what would she do without it i say that we must reclaim our own who are held by the seanchan said marinna she was training to become a wise one alarch seemed uncertain and he glanced at janduin alarch often deferred to his brother the aiel must have a purpose janduin said nodding we are useless as we are and we made no promise not to attack it is a testament to our patience and respect for my father that we have waited this long eyes turned to padra they are our enemies she said one by one the men in the room nodded it seemed such a sirnple event to end years of waiting go to your clans ronam stood up prepare them padra remained seated as the others said their farewells some somber others excited seventeen years was too long for the aiel to be without battle soon the tent was empty save for padra she waited staring at the rug before her war she was excited but another part of her was somber she felt as if she had set the clans on a path that would change them forever padra a voice asked she turned to see ronam standing in the entryway to the tent she blushed and stood though he was ten years her senior he was quite handsome shed never give up the spear of course but if she did you seem worried he said i was simply thinking about the seanchan about my father she replied ah ronam nodded i remember when he first came to cold rocks hold i was very young what was your impression of him he was an impressive man ronam said nothing else he shook his head im sorry padra but i did not spend much time with him my path led me elsewhere i heard things from my father though she cocked her head ronam turned and looked out the open tent flaps toward the green grass beyond my father called rand althor a clever man and great leader but one who did not know what to do with the aiel i remember him saying that when the caracarn was among us he did not feel like one of us as if we made him uncomfortable ronam shook his head everyone else was planned for but the aiel were left adrift some say we should have returned to the threefold land she saidno ronam said no that would have destroyed us our fathers knew nothing of steamhorses or dragon tubes were the aiel to return to the waste we would have become irrelevant the world would pass us by and we would vanish as a people but war padra said is it right i do not know ronam said softly we are aiel it is what we know how to do padra nodded feeling more certain the aiel would ride to war again and there would be much honor in it aviendha blinked the sky was dark she was exhausted her mind was drained her heart openedas if bleeding out strength with every beat she sat down in the midst of the dimming columns her children she remembered their faces from her first visit to rhuidean she had not seen this not that she remembered at least is it destined she asked can we change it there was no answer of course her tears were dry how did one react to seeing the utter destructionno the utter decayof ones people each step had seemed logical to the people who took it but each had taken the aiel toward their end should anyone have to see such terrible visions she wished shed never stepped back into the forest of pillars was she to blame for what was to happen it was her line that would doom her people this was not like the events she had seen when passing into the rings during her first visit to rhuidean those had been possibilities this days visions seemed more real she felt almost certain that what she had experienced was not simply one of many possibilities what she had seen would occur step by step honor drained from her people step by step the aiel turned from proud to wretched there had to be more angry she stood up and took another step nothing happened she walked all the way to the edge of the pillars then turned furious show me more she demanded show me what i did to cause this it lis my lineage that brought us ruin what is my part in it she walked into the pillars again nothing they seemed dead she reached out and touched one but there was no life no hum no sense of power she closed her eyes squeezing one more tear from the corner of each eye the tears trailed down her face leaving a line of cold wetness on her cheeks can i change it she asked if i cant she thought will that stop me from trying the answer was simple no she could not live without doing something to avert that fate she had come to rhuidean seeking knowledge well she had received it in more abundance than she had wanted she opened her eyes and gritted her teeth aiel took responsibility aiel fought aiel stood for honor if she was the only one wh knew the terrors of their future then it was her dutyas a wise oneto act she would save her people she walked from the pillars then broke into a run she needed to return to consult with the other wise ones but first she needed quiet out in the threefold land time to think chapter choosing enemies elayne sat anxiously hands in her lap listening to the distant booms shed intentionally chosen the throne room rather than a less formal audience chamber today she needed to be seen as a queen the throne room was imposing with its majestic pillars and lavish ornamentation golden standlamps burned in a long double row on either side of the room breaking only for the pillars guardsmen in white and red stood in front of them burnished breastplates gleaming the marble columns were matched by the thick crimson rug woven with the lion of andor in gold at its center it led toward elayne wearing the rose crown her gown was after a traditional fashion rather than those favored in court right now the sleeves were wide with the cuffs designed to droop down to a goldembroidered point beneath her hand that pattern was echoed by the bodice which was high enough to be modest but low enough to remind all that elayne was a woman one still unmarried her mother had married a man from cairhien early in her reign others might wonder if elayne would do the same to cement her hold there another distant boom sounded the noise of the dragons firing was growing familiar not quite a clap of thunderlower more regular elayne had been taught to conceal her nervousness first by her tutors and then by the aes sedai whatever some people thought elayne trakand could control her temper when she needed to she kept her hands in her lap and forced her tongue to be still showing nervousness would be far worse than anger dyelin sat in a chair near the throne the stately woman wore he golden hair unbound around her shoulders and she was working quietly at a hoop of embroidery dyelin said it relaxed her providing something for the hands to do while the mind was busy elaynes mother was not in attendance today she might be too much of a distraction elayne couldnt afford herself dyelins same luxury she needed to be seen leading unfortunately leading often took the form of sitting on her throne eyes forward projecting determination and control while she waited surely the demonstration was done by now another boom perhaps not she could hear soft chat in the sitting chamber to the side of the throne room those high seats still in caemlyn had received a royal invitation to meet with the queen in a discussion of sanitation requirements for those staying outside the city that meeting would happen at the strike of five but the invitations had hinted the high seats were to arrive two hours early the wording of the message should have been obvious elayne was going to do something important today and she was inviting the high seats early so that they could enjoy some sanctioned eavesdropping they were kept well supplied with drinks and small dishes of meats and fruits in the sitting room likely the chat she overheard was speculation about what she was going to reveal if they only knew elayne kept her hands in her lap dyelin continued her needlework clicking her tongue to herself as pulled out a wrong stitch after a nearly insufferable wait the dragons stopped sounding and elayne felt birgitte returning to the palace sending her with the group was the best way to know when it was returning the timing today needed to be handled with absolute care elayne breathed in and out to still her nerves there birgitte was surely in the palace now elayne nodded to captain guybon it was time to bring in the prisoners a group of guards entered a moment later leading three individuals sniffling arymilla was still plump despite her captivity the older woman was pretty or might have been had she been wearing more than rags her large brown eyes were wide with fright as if she thought elayne might still execute her elenia was far more in control she like the others had been stripped or her fine dress and wore a tattered gown instead but she had cleaned her face and dressed her gold hair in a neat bun elayne didnt starve or abuse her prisoners her enemies though they were they werent traitors to andor elenia regarded elayne that vulpine face of hers was thoughtful calculating did she know where her husbands army had vanished to that face felt like a hidden knife pressed to elaynes back none of her scouts had been able to discover its location light problems atop problems the third woman was naean arawn a slim pale woman whose black hair had lost much of its luster during her captivity this one had seemed broken before elayne had taken her captive and she kept back from the other two women the three were prodded to the foot of the thrones dais then forced down on their knees in the hallway the cairhienin nobles were returning noisily from the demonstration of the dragons they would assume that theyd happened upon elaynes display by accident the crown acknowledges naean arawn elenia sarand and arymilla marne elayne said in a loud voice that stilled the outside conversations both those of the andoran nobles in the sitting room and the cairhienin outside in the hallway of the three only elenia dared glance up elayne met the gaze with one as hard as stone and the woman blushed before looking down again dyelin had put away her needlework and was watching closely the crown has given much thought to you three elayne pronounced your misguided war against trakand has left you destitute and requests for ransom have been turned away by your heirs and scions your own houses have abandoned you her words rang in the grand throne room the women before her bowed down further this leaves the crown with a conundrum elayne said you vex us with your troubling existences perhaps some queens would have left you to prison but i find that reeks of indecision you would drain my resources and make men whisper of ways to free you the hall fell silent save for the husky breathing of the prisoners this crown is not prone to indecisiveness elayne pronounced on this day houses sarand marne and arawn are stripped of title and estate their lands forfeit to the crown in retribution for their crimes elenia gasped looking up arymilla groaned slouching down on the lioncentered rug naean did not respond she seemed numb murmuring rose immediately from the sitting room this was worse than an execution when nobles were executed they were at least executed with their titlesin a way an execution was an acknowledgment of a worthy foe the title and lands passed on to the heir and the house survived but this this was something few queens would ever attempt if elayne were seen as seizing land and money for the throne the other noble would unite against her she could guess the conversations in the othe room her power base was shaky her allies who had stood with her befor the siege and faced the possibility of execution themselves might very well now begin to question best to move on quickly elayne gestured and the guards pulled the three prisoners to their feet and then led them to the side of the room even defiant elenia seemed stunned in essence this proclamation was a proclamation of death as soon as possible they would commit suicide rather than face their houses birgitte knew her cue she entered leading the group of cairhienin nobles they had been invited to a display of andors new weapon for defending against the shadow and were a mixed band the most important in the group was probably either bertome saighan or lorstrum aesnan bertome was a short man with a kind of handsomeness though elayne was not fond of the way the cairhienin shaved and powdered their foreheads he wore a large knife at his beltswords had been forbidden in the queens presenceand seemed disturbed by elaynes treatment of the prisoners as well he should have been his cousin colavaere had received a similar punishment from rand though that had not affected her entire house shed hanged herself rather than face the shame her death had elevated bertome and while hed been very careful not to make public waves against rands rule elaynes sources picked him out as one of the major private critics of rand in cairhien lorstrum aesnan was a quiet thin man who walked with his hands behind his back and tended to look down his nose like the others in the group he wore dark clothing after the cairhienin fashion his coat striped with the colors of his house he had risen to prominence following rands disappearance from cairhien desperate times made for quick advances and this man had not moved against rand too quickly yet also hadnt allied with him that middle ground gave him power and some whispered that he was considering seizing the throne other than those two the cairhienin here were a smattering of other nobility ailil riatin was not the head of her house but since the disappearance of her brothera disappearance that was looking more and more like deathshe had assumed power riatin was a powerful house the slim middleaged woman was tall for a cairhienin and wore a dark blue dress slashed with colors her dress shaped by hoops through the skirts her family had held the sun throne recently if only for a relatively short time and she was known to be a vocal supporter of elayne lord and lady osiellin lord and lady chuliandred lord and lady hamarashle and lord mavabwin had gathered behind those of more importance all were of middling power and allfor one reason or another were likely roadblocks to elayne they were a cluster of carefully done hair and powdered foreheads wide dresses on the women coats and trousers on the men lace at the cuffs my lords and ladies elayne said naming each house in turn you have enjoyed andors demonstration indeed we have your majesty lanky lorstrum said bowing his head graciously those weapons are quite intriguing he was obviously digging for information elayne blessed her tutors for their insistence that she understand the game of houses we all know that the last battle quickly approaches elayne said i thought that cairhien should best be apprised of the strength of its greatest and closest ally there will be times in the near future when we will need to rely upon one another indeed your majesty lorstrum said your majesty bertome said stepping forward the short man folded his arms i assure you cairhien exults in andors strength and stability elayne eyed him was he offering her support no it seemed he was also digging wondering if elayne would declare herself a candidate for the sun throne her intentions should have been obvious by nowsending some of the band to the city had been an obvious move nearly too obvious for the subtle cairhienin would that cairhien had similar stability elayne said carefully several of them nodded no doubt hoping she intended to offer one of them the throne if she threw andors support behind one of these it would guarantee him or her victory and it would give her a sympathizer as king or queen another might have made that ploy not her that throne would be hers the taking of a throne is a very delicate business lorstrum said it has proven dangerous in the past and so many are hesitant indeed elayne said i do not envy cairhien the uncertainty that it has known these last months and now the moment elayne took a deep breath faced with the strength in andor one might think this would be an obvious time to have strong alliances in fact the throne recently acquired several estates of no small means it occurs to me that these estates have no stewards all grew quiet the whispers in the other room stopped had they heard correctly had elayne offered estates in andor to foreign nobility she hid her smile slowly some of them got it lorstrum gave a sly smile and he nodded to her ever so slightly cairhien and andor have long shared fellowship elayne continued as if the idea were only now occurring to her our lords have married your ladies our ladies your lords and we share many common bonds of blood and affection i should think the wisdom of a few cairhiehin lords would be a great addition to my court and perhaps educate me upon my heritage on my fathers side she locked eyes with lorstrum would he bite his lands in cairhien were small and his influence great for a timebut that could tip the estates shed seized from the three prisoners were among the most enviable in her country he had to see it if she took the throne of cairhien by force the people and the nobility would rebel against her that was partially lorstrums fault if her suspicions were true but what if she gave lands within andor to some of the cairhienin nobility what if she created multiple bonds between their countries what if she proved that she would not steal their titlesbut would instead be willing to give some of them greater holdings would that be enough to prove that she didnt intend to steal the lands of the cairhien nobility and give them to her own people would that ease their worries lorstrum met her eyes i see great potential for alliances bertome was nodding in appreciation i too think this could be arranged neither would give up their lands of course they simply planne to gain estates in andor wealthy ones the others shared glances lady osiellin and lord mavabwin were the first two to figure it out they spoke at the same time offering alliances elayne stilled her anxious heart sitting back in the throne i have but one more estate to give she said but i believe it could be divided she would give some to ailil also to curry favor and reward her support now for the second part of the ploy lady sarand elayne called toward the back of the room elenia stepped forward wearing her rags the crown is not without mercy elayne said andor cannot forgive you for the pain and suffering you caused but other countries have no such memories tell me if the crown were to provide you with an opportunity for new lands would that opportunity be taken new lands your majesty elenia asked of which lands do you speak a unification between andor and cairhien would offer many oppotunities elayne said perhaps you have heard of the crowns alliance with ghealdan perhaps you have heard of the newly revitalized lands in the west of realm this is a time of great opportunity if i were to find you and your husband a place to form a new seat in cairhien would you take what is given i would certainly consider it your majesty elenia said showing a glimmer of hope elayne turned to the cairhienin lords for any of this to take effect she said i would need authority to speak for both andor and cairhien how long do you suspect might it take for such a situation to be arranged return me to my homeland through one of those strange portals lorstrum said and give me one hour i need only a half an hour your majesty bertome put in glancing at lorstrum one hour elayne said holding up her hands prepare well all right birgitte said as the door to the smaller chamber closed what in the name of the dark ones bloody left hand just happened elayne sat down it had worked or it seemed as if it would the plush chair was a comfort after the stiffness of the lion throne dyelin took a seat to her right morgase sat to her left what happened morgase said is that my daughter is brilliant elayne smiled in gratitude birgitte however frowned elayne could feel the womans confusion she was the only one in the room with them they had to wait one hour to see the true results of elaynes plotting all right birgitte said so you gave up a bunch of andors land to cairhienin nobility as a bribe dyelin said she didnt seem as convinced as morgase a clever maneuver your majesty but dangerous dangerous birgitte said blood and ashes will someone please explain to the idiot over here why bribery is brilliant or clever its hardly elayne who discovered it this was more than a gift morgase said incongruously she took to pouring tea for those in the room elayne couldnt ever recall seeing her mother pour tea before the major obstacle blocking elayne from cairhien was that she would be viewed as a conqueror yes so birgitte asked so she made bonds between the two nations dyelin said accepting a cup of tremalking black from morgase by giving that group some land in andor she shows that shes not going to ignore or impoverish the cairhienin nobility beyond that morgase said she makes herself less of an oddity if shed taken the throne shed have gained its landsand become the only person to have holdings in both countries now shell be one of many but its dangerous dyelin repeated lorstrum didnt give in because of the bribe he didnt birgitte said frowning but shes right elayne said sipping her tea he gave in because he saw that i was handing him the chance for both thrones the room fell silent bloody ashes birgitte finally swore dyelin nodded you have created enemies who could overthrow you elayne if something were to happen to you there is a good chance that either lorstrum or bertome could make a play for both countries im counting on it elayne said theyre the two most powerful noblemen in cairhien right now particularly since dobraine hasnt returned from wherever rand took him with them actively supporting the idea of a common monarch we actually have a chance at this theyll only be supporting you because they see a chance of taking both thrones for themselves dyelin said better to choose your enemies than remain in ignorance elayne said ive essentially limited my competition they saw the dragons and those made them envious then i offered them the chance not only to gain access to those weapons but to double their wealth and on top of that i gave them the seed of possibility that one day they might be named king so theyll try to kill you birgitte said flatly perhaps elayne said or perhaps theyll try to undermine me but not for many yearsa decade id guess to strike now would be to risk the nations dividing again no first theyll establish themselves and enjoy their wealth only once theyre certain that things are secureand that ive grown laxwill they move fortunately there are two of them and that will let me play them against one another and for now we have gained two staunch alliesmen who keenly want my bid for the sun throne to succeed they will hand the crown right to me and the prisoners dyelin said elenia and the other two do you really intend to find them lands yes elayne said what ive done for them is actually very kind the crown will assume their debts then give them a fresh start in cairhien this works it will be good to have andoran nobility taking lands there though i will ptobably have to give them land out of my own cairhenin youll leave youtself surrounded by enemies birgitte said shaking her head as usual elayne said fortunately i have you to watch over me she smiled at the warder bur knew that birgitte could sense her nervousness this was going to be a long hours wait chapter a testing the hair on mins neck rose as she held the crystal sword callandor shed heard stories of this weapon since she was a child wild tales of distant tear and the strange sword that is not a sword now she held it in her own fingers it was lighter than shed expected its crystalline length caught and played with the lamplight it seemed to shimmer too much the light inside changing even when she didnt move the crystal was smooth but warm it almost felt alive rand stood in front of her looking down at the weapon they were in their rooms inside the stone of tear accompanied by cadsuane narishma merise naeff and two maidens rand reached out touching the weapon she glanced at him and a viewing sprang to life above him a glowing sword callandor being gripped in a black hand she gasped what did you see rand asked softly callandor held in a fist the hand looks to be made of onyx any idea what it means she shook her head we should hide it away again cadsuane said she wore brown and green today earthy colors lightened by her golden hair ornaments she stood with arms folded back straight phaw getting the object out now is foolhardy boy your objection is noted rand said he took the saangreal from min then slid it over his shoulder into a sheath on his back at his side he once again wore the ancient sword with the redandgold dragons painted on the sheath hed said before that he considered that to be a kind of symbol it represented the past to him and callandorsomehowrepresented the future rand min said taking his arm my research remember callandor seems to have a deeper flaw than weve discovered this viewing only reinforces what i said before i worry it may be used against you i suspect that it will rand said everything else in this world has been used against me narishma a gateway please weve kept the borderlanders waiting long enough the ashaman nodded bells in his hair tinkling rand turned to naeff naeff there has still been no word from the black tower no my lord the tall ashaman said i have been unable to travel there rand said that implies great trouble worse than i had feared use this weave it can disguise you travel to a place a days ride outside and ride in hiding yourself see what you can discover help if you can and when you find logain and those loyal to him deliver him a message for me what message my lord rand looked distant tell them that i was wrong tell them that were not weapons were men perhaps it will help take care this could be dangerous bring me word i will need to fix things there but i could easily stumble into a trap more dangerous than any ive avoided so far problems so many problems that need fixing and only one of me go in my place naeff for now i need information i yes my lord he seemed confused but he ducked out of the room to obey rand took a deep breath then rubbed the stump of his left arm lets go are you certain you dont want to bring more people min asked yes rand said cadsuane be ready to open a gateway and get us out if needed were going into far madding boy cadsuane said surely you havent forgotten that we are prevented from touching the source while there rand smiled and youre wearing a full paralisnet in your hair which includes a well im certain you keep it full and that should be enough to create a single gateway cadsuanes face grew expressionless ive never heard of a paralisnet cadsuane sedai rand said softly your net has a few ornaments i dont recognizei suspect it is a breakingera creation but i was there when the first ones were designed and i wore the original male version the room fell still well boy cadsuane finally said you are you ever going to give up that affectation cadsuane sedai rand asked calling me boy i no longer mind though it does feel odd i was four hundred years old on the day i died during the age of legends i suspect that would make you my junior by several decades at the least i show you respect perhaps it would be appropriate for you to return it if you wish you may call me rand sedai i am so far as i know the only male aes sedai still alive who was properly raised but who never turned to the shadow cadsuane paled visibly rands smile turned kindly you wished to come in and dance with the dragon reborn cadsuane i am what i need to be be comforted you face the forsaken but have one as ancient as they at your side he turned away from her eyes growing distant now if only great age really were an indication of great wisdom as easy to wish that the dark one would simply let us be he took min by the arm and together they walked through narishmas gateway beyond a small cluster of maidens waited inside a wooded clearing guarding a group of horses min climbed into her saddle noting how reserved cadsuane looked as well she should when rand spoke like that it troubled min more than she wanted to admit they rode out of the small thicket down toward far madding an impressive city set on an island in the middle of a lake a large armyflying hundreds of bannersspread out around the lake its always been a city of importance you know rand said from beside min his eyes distant the guardians are newer but the city was here long ago aren deshar aren mador far madding always a thorn in our side aren deshar was the enclave of the incastarthose afraid of progress afraid of wonder turns out they had a right to be afraid how i wish i had listened to gilgame rand min said softly it drew him out of his reverie yes is it really as you said are you four centuries old im nearly four and a half i suppose do my years in this age add to those i had before he looked at her youre worried arent you that im no longer me the man you knew the foolish sheepherder youve got all of this in your mind so much past memories only rand said but youre him too you talk like you were the one who tried to seal the bore like you knew the forsaken personally rand rode in silence for a time i suppose i am him but min what youre missing is this i may be him now but he was always me as well i was always him im not going to change just because i rememberi was the same im me and i always have been me lews therin was mad at the end rand said and yes he made mistakes made mistakes i grew arrogant desperate but theres a difference this time a great one what difference he smiled this time i was raised better min found herself smiling as well you know me min well i promise you i feel more like myself now than i have in months i feel more like myself than i ever did as lews therin if that makes any kind of sense its because of tam because of the people around me you perrin nynaeve mat aviendha elayne moiraine he tried very hard to break me i think if id been the same as i was so long ago he would have succeeded they rode across the meadow surrounding far madding as everywhere else the green here had departed leaving yellow and brown it was getting worse and worse pretend that it slumbers min told herself the land isnt dead its waiting through the winter a winter of storms and war narishma hissed softly riding behind min glanced at him the ashamans face had gone hard apparently theyd passed inside the bubble of the guardians influence rand gave no indication hed noticed he didnt seem to be having the trouble with sickness when he channeled any longer which relieved her or was he just covering it she turned her mind to the task at hand the borderlander armies had never explained why theyd defied custom and logic by marching south to find rand they were needed desperately rands intervention at maradon had saved what was left of the city but if that sort of thing was happening all across the border with the blight twenty soldierslances upheld with narrow bloodred banners flapping from them like streamersintercepted rands group long before it reached the army rand stopped and let them approach rand althor one of the men announced we are representatives of the unity of the border we will provide escort rand nodded and the procession started forward again this time with guards they didnt call you lord dragon min whispered to rand he nod ded thoughtfully perhaps the borderlanders did not believe he was th dragon reborn do not be arrogant here rand althor cadsuane said trotting up to ride beside him but do not back down most borderlanders will respond to strength when they see it so cadsuane called rand by name instead of naming him boy it seemed a victory and it made min smile i will have that gateway ready cadsuane continued more softly but it will be very small the well will only give me enough to make one wed have to crawl through we shouldnt need it these people will fight for you they will want to fight for you only bumbling foolishness could keep them from it there is more to it than that cadsuane sedai rand replied his voice hushed something drove them southward this is a challenge one i am uncertain how to meet but your advice is appreciated cadsuane nodded eventually min picked out a line of people waiting at the forefront of the army there were thousands of soldiers behind standing in rows saldaeans with their bowed legs shienarans in topknots arafellin each soldier with two swords strapped to his back kandori with forked beards the group at the head stood on the ground without mounts they wore fine clothing two women and two men all with what were obviously aes sedai at their sides some with an attendant or two behind the one at the front is queen ethenielle cadsuane whispered she is a stern woman but fair she is known for meddling in the affairs of the southern nations and i suspect the others will let her take the lead today the handsome man beside her is paitar nachiman king of arafel handsome min asked inspecting the balding older arafellin him it depends on ones perspective child cadsuane said without missing a beat he was once known widely for his face and he is still known for his sword beside him is king easar togita of shienar so sad rand said softly who did he lose min frowned easar didnt look particularly sad to her solemn perhaps hes a borderlander cadsuane said hes fought the trollocs all his life id suspect hes lost many a person dear to him his wife did die some years back hes said to have the soul of a poet but he is an austere man if you could earn his respect it would mean much the last one is tenobia then rand said rubbing his chin still wish i had bashere with us bashere had said that his face might fuel tenobias anger and rand had listened to reason on that count tenobia cadsuane said is a wildfire young impertinent and reckless dont let her draw you into an argument rand nodded min tenobia has a spear hovering over her head min said bloody but shining in the light ethenielle will soon be wedi see that by white doves she plans to do something dangerous today so be careful the other two have various swords shields and arrows hovering about them both will fight soon in the last battle rand asked i dont know she admitted it could be here today their escort led them up to the four monarchs rand slid out of the saddle patting taidaishar on the neck as the horse snorted min moved to dismount as did narishma but rand held up a hand to stop them blasted fool cadsuane muttered from beside min low enough that nobody else could hear he asks me to be ready to get him out then leaves us he likely meant that you should get me away min said softly knowing him hes more worried about me than himself she paused blasted fool cadsuane shot her a glance then smiled slightly before turning back to watch rand he stepped up to the four monarchs and stopped raising his arms to the sides as if to ask what is it you wish of me ethenielle took the lead as cadsuane had guessed she was a plump woman her dark hair pulled away from her face and tied at the back she strode up to rand a man walking beside her and carrying a sheathed sword in his arm hilt pointed toward her nearby the maidens rustled they stepped up beside rand as usual they assumed that commands to stay back didnt include them ethenielle raised a hand and slapped rand across the face narishma cursed the maidens raised their veils and drew spears min nudged her horse forward breaking through the line of guards stop rand said raising his hand he turned looking at the maidens min stilled her mare patting her on the neck she was skittish as might be expected the maidens reluctantly backed down though cadsuane did take the opportunity to move her horse up beside mins rand turned back to ethenielle and rubbed his face i hope thats some traditional kandori greeting your majesty she raised an eyebrow then gestured to the side and king easar of shienar stepped up to rand the man backhanded rand across the mouth the force of it causing rand to stumble rand righted himself again waving the maidens down he met easars eyes a trickle of blood ran down rands chin the shienaran studied him for a moment then nodded and stepped back tenobia came next she slapped rand with her left hand a strong blow that cracked in the air min felt a flash of pain from rand tenobia shook her hand afterward king paitar came last the aging arafellin with only a fringe of hair walked with his hands behind his back contemplative he stepped up to rand and reached over and dabbed at the blood on rands cheek then he backhanded rand with a blow that sent him to his knees a spray of blood flying from his mouth min couldnt sit by any longer rand she said jumping down from her saddle and running to him she reached his side steadying him while glaring at the monarchs how dare you he came to you peacefully peacefully paitar said no young woman he did not come to this world in peace he has consumed the land with terror chaos and destruction as the prophecies said that he would cadsuane said walking up as min helped rand back to his feet you lay before him the burdens of an entire age you cannot hire a man to rebuild your house then reproach him when he must knock down a wall to do the job that presumes that he is the dragon reborn tenobia said folding her arms we she cut off as rand stood then carefully slid callandor from its sheath glittering blade rasping he held it forth do you deny this queen tenobia shield of the north and sword of the blightborder high seat of house kazadi will you look upon this weapon and call me a false dragon that quieted her to the side easar nodded behind them ranks of silent troops watched with lances pikes and shields held high as if in salute or as if in preparation to attack min looked up and could faintly make out people lining the walls of far madding to watch let us proceed easar said ethenielle very well the woman said i will say this rand althor even if you do prove to be the dragon reborn you have much to answer for you may take your price from my skin ethenielle rand said softly sliding callandor back into its sheath but only once the dark one has had his day with me rand althor paitar said i have a question for you how you answer will determine the outcome of this day what kind of question cadsuane demanded cadsuane please rand said holding up his hand lord paitar i see it in your eyes you know that i am the dragon reborn is this question necessary it is vital lord althor paitar replied it drove us here though my allies did not know it from the start i have always believed you to be the dragon reborn that made my quest here even more vital min frowned the aging soldier reached down to his sword hilt as if ready to draw the maidens grew more alert with a start min realized paitar was still standing close to rand too close he could have that sword out and swinging for rands neck in an eyeblink she realized paitar placed himself there to be ready to strike rand didnt break his gaze from the monarch ask your question how did tellindal tirraso die who min asked looking at cadsuane the aes sedai shook her head confused how do you know that name rand demanded answer the question easar said hand on his hilt body tense around them ranks of men prepared themselves she was a clerk rand said during the age of legends demandred when he came for me after founding the eighty and one she fell in the fighting lightning from the sky her blood on my hands how do you know that name ethenielle looked to easar then to tenobia then finally to paitar he nodded then closed his eyes letting out a sigh that sounded relieved he took his hand from his sword rand althor ethenielle said dragon reborn would you kindly sit down and speak with us we will answer your questions why have i never heard of this socalled prophecy cadsuane asked its nature required secrecy king paitar said they all sat on cushions in a large tent in the middle of the borderlander army it made cadsuane shoulders itch being surrounded like this but the fool boyhe would always be a fool boy no matter how old he waslooked perfectly at peace thirteen aes sedai waited outside the tent which wasnt large enough for them all thirteen that hadnt made althor blink what man who could channel would sit amid thirteen aes sedai and not sweat hes changed cadsuane told herself youre just going to have to accept that not that he didnt need her anymore men like him grew overly confident a few little successes and hed trip over his own feet and land in some predicament but well she was proud of him grudgingly proud a little it was given by an aes sedai of my own family line paitar continued the squarefaced man sipped a small cup of tea my ancestor reo myershi was the only one who heard it he ordered the words preserved passed from monarch to monarch for this day speak them to me rand said please i see him before you paitar quoted him the one who lives many lives the one who gives deaths the one who raises mountains he will break what he must break but first he stands here before our king you will bloody him measure his restraint he speaks how was the fallen slain tellindal tirraso murdered by his hand the darkness that came the day after the light you must ask and you must know your fate if he cannot answer he trailed off falling silent what min asked if he cannot answer paitar said then you will be lost you will bring his end swiftly so that the final days may have their storm so that light may not be consumed by he who was to have preserved it i see him and i weep you came to murder him then cadsuane said to test him tenobia said or so we decided once paitar told us of the prophecy you dont know how close you came to doom rand said softly if i had come to you but a short time earlier id have returned those slaps with balefire inside the guardian tenobia sniffed disdainfully the guardian blocks the one power rand whispered the one power only what does he mean by that cadsuane thought frowning we knew well the risk ethenielle said proudly i demanded the right to slap you first our armies had orders to attack if we fell my family has analyzed the words of the prophecy a hundred times over paitar said the meaning seemed clear it was our task to test the dragon reborn to see if he could be trusted to go to the last battle only a month earlier rand said i wouldnt have had the memories to answer you this was a foolish gambit if you had killed me then all would have been lost a gamble paitar said evenly perhaps another would have risen in your stead no rand said this prophecy was like the others a declaration of what might happen not advice i see it differently rand althor paitar said and the others agreed with me it should be noted ethenielle said that i didnt come south because of this prophecy my goal was to see if i could bring some sense to the world and then she grimaced what cadsuane asked finally sipping her tea it tasted good as it usually did near althor these days the storms tenobia said the snow stopped us and then finding you proved more difficult than wed assumed these gateways can you teach them to our aes sedai i will have your aes sedai taught in return for a promise rand said you will swear to me i have need of you we are sovereigns tenobia snapped im not going to bow to you as quickly as my uncle did we have to speak about that by the way our oaths are to the lands we protect easar said as you wish rand said rising i once gave you an ultimatum i phrased it poorly and i regret that but i remain your only path to the last battle without me you will remain here hundreds of leagues from those lands you swore to protect he nodded to each of them then helped min to her feet tomorrow i meet with the monarchs of the world after that i am going to go to shayol ghul and break the remaining seals on the dark ones prison good day cadsuane didnt rise she sat sipping her tea the four seemed astounded well the boy certainly had picked up an understanding of the dramatic wait paitar finally sputtered rising youre going to do what rand turned im going to shatter the seals lord paitar im going to break what he must break as your own prophecy says i must you cannot stop me not when those words prove what i will do earlier i stepped in to prevent maradon from falling it was near to it tenobia the walls are shattered your troops bloodied with help i was able to save it barely your countries need you and so you have two choices swear to me or sit here and let everyone else fight in your place cadsuane sipped her tea that was going a little too far ill leave you to discuss my offer rand said i can spare one hourthough before you start your deliberation could you send for someone on my behalf there is a man in your army named hurin i would like to apologize to him they still looked stunned cadsuane rose to go speak with the sisters waiting outside she knew a few of them and needed to feel out the others she didnt worry about what the borderlanders would decide althor had them another army beneath his banner i didnt think hed manage this one one more day and it all began light but she hoped that they were ready chapter boots elayne settled herself in glimmers saddle the mare was one of the prizes of the royal stable she was of fine saldaean stock with a brilliant white mane and coat the saddle itself was rich the leather trimmed with winered and gold it was the sort of saddle you used when parading birgitte rode rising a tall dun gelding also one of the fastest in the royal stables the warder had chosen both horses she expected to have to run birgitte wore one of elaynes foxhead copies though it had a different shape a thin silver disc with a rose on the front elayne carried another wrapped in cloth inside her pocket shed tried making another this morning but it had melted nearly setting her dresser on fire she was having a great deal of difficulty without the original to study her dreams of arming all of her personal guards with medallions was looking less and less possible unless she somehow managed to persuade mat to give her the original again her honor guard fell into mounted ranks around her and birgitte in the queens plaza she was bringing only a hundred soldiersseventyfive guardsmen and an inner ring of twentyfive guardswomen it was a tiny force but shed have gone without those hundred if shed been able to get away with it she couldnt afford to be seen as a conqueror i dont like this birgitte said you dont like anything lately elayne said i swear youre becoming more irritable by the day its because youre becoming more foolhardy by the day oh come now this is hardly the most foolhardy thing ive done only because youve set a very high benchmark for yourself elayne it will be fine elayne said glancing southward why do you keep looking in that direction rand elayne said feeling that warmth again pulsing from the knot of emotions in her mind hes getting ready for something he feels troubled and peaceful at the same time light but that man could be confusing the meeting would happen in one day if his original deadline still held egwene was right breaking the seals would be foolish but rand would see reason alise rode up to her accompanied by three kinswomen sarasia was a plump woman with a grandmotherly air darkskinned kema kept her black hair in three long braids and prim nashia with a youthful face wore a baggy dress the four took up positions beside elayne only two of them were strong enough for a gatewaymany of the kin were weaker than most aes sedai but that would be enough assuming elayne had trouble embracing the source can you do something to prevent archers from hitting her birgitte asked alise some kind of weave alise cocked her head thoughtfully i know of one that might help she said but ive never tried it another kinswoman wove a gateway up ahead it opened to a span of rough browngrassed land outside of cairhien a much larger army waited there wearing the cuirasses and bellshaped helmets of cairhienin troops the officers were easy to spot with their dark clothing in the colors of the houses they served they wore con rising over their backs tall narrowfaced lorstrum sat his mount at the front of his army which wore dark green with crimson slashes bertome was on the other side their forces looked to be about the same size five thousand each the other four houses had fielded smaller armies if they wanted to take you captive birgitte said grimly youre handing them the chance theres no way to do this and remain safe not unless i want to hide in my palace and send my troops in that would only lead to rebellion in cairhien and potential collapse in andor she glanced at the warder im queen now birgitte youre not going to be able to keep me from danger no more than you could keep a lone soldier safe on the battlefield birgitte nodded stay close to me and guybon guybon approached on a large dappled gelding with birgitte on one side of her and guybon on the otherand with both of their horses taller than elaynesa wouldbe assassin would have great difficulty picking her off without first hitting her friends so it would be for the rest of her life she nudged glimmer into motion and her troop made its way through the gateway and onto cairhienin soil the noblemen and noblewomen ahead bowed or curtsied from horseback and those oblations were deeper this time than they had been when meeting elayne in her throne room the show had begun the city was just ahead walls still blackened from fires during the fight with the shaido elayne could sense birgittes tension as the gateway vanished behind the kin around elayne embraced the source and alise wove an unfamiliar weave placing it in the air around the inner ring of troops it made a smallbut swiftwind spinning in the air birgittes anxiety was contagious and elayne found herself holding her reins in a tight grip as glimmer moved forward the air was drier here in cairhien with a faint dusty scent to it the sky was overcast the cairhienin troops formed around her small group of andorans in white and red most of the cairhienin forces were foot though there was some heavy cavalry horses in shiny barding and men carrying lances pointed high into the air all marched in perfect lines protecting elayne or keeping her captive lorstrum moved his bay stallion closer to elaynes outer ranks guybon glanced at her and she nodded so the captain allowed him to approach the city is nervous your majesty lorstrum said birgitte was still careful to keep her mount between his and elaynes there are unfortunate rumors surrounding your ascension rumors you probably initiated elayne thought before you decided to support me instead surely they wont rise against your troops i hope they will not he eyed her from under his flat cap of forest green he wore a black coat that went down to his knees and slashes of color across it all the way down to denote his house it was the type of clothing hed wear if going to a ball that projected a sense of confidence his force wasnt seizing the city it was escorting the new queen with an honorary parade it is unlikely that there will be armed resistance but i wanted to warn you lorstrum nodded to her with respect he knew she was manipulating him but he also accepted that manipulation she would have to keep a careful watch on him in the years to come cairhien was such a boxish city all straight lines and fortified towers though some of its architecture was beautiful there was no comparing the place to caemlyn or tar valon they rode directly in through the northern gates the river alguenya to their right crowds waited inside lorstrum and the others had done their work well there were cheers probably started by carefully placed courtiers as elayne entered the city the cheers grew louder that surprised her she had expected hostility and yes there was some of thatthe occasional thrown piece of refuse hurled from the back of the crowd she caught a jeer here and there but most seemed pleased as she rode down that broad passageway lined with the rectangular buildings cairhienin favored she realized that perhaps these people had been waiting for an event like this talking of it spreading tales some of those tales had been hostile and those were what norry had reported but they now seemed to her more a sign of worry than hostility cairhien had been too long without a monarch their king dead by unknown hands the lord dragon seemingly abandoning them her confidence grew cairhien was a wounded city the burned and broken remnants of the foregate outside cobbles had been torn up to be thrown from the walls the city had never fully recovered from the aiel war and the unfinished topless towerssymmetrical in design but woefully forlorn in appearancewere a lofty declaration of that fact that bloody game of houses was nearly as bad a scourge could she change that the people around her sounded hopeful as if they knew what a twisted mess their nation had become one could sooner take away an aiels spears than cut the craftiness out of the cairhienin but perhaps she could teach them a greater loyalty to country and throne so long as they had a throne worth that loyalty the sun palace stood at the exact center of the city like the rest of the city it was square and angular but here the architecture gave a sense or imposing strength it was a grand building despite the broken wing where the attempt on rands life had taken place more nobles waited here standing on covered steps or in front of ornate carriages women in formal gowns with wide hoops the men in neat coats of dark colors caps on the heads many looked skeptical and some amazed elayne shot birgitte a satisfied smile its working nobody expected me to ride to the palace escorted by a cairhienin army birgitte said nothing she was still tenseand probably would be until elayne returned to caemlyn two women stood at the foot of the steps one a pretty woman with bells in her hair the other with curly hair and a face that did not seem aes sedai for all the fact that she had been one for years that was sashalle anderly and the other womanwho did have an ageless facewas samitsu tamagowa from what elaynes sources had been able to determine these two were as close to rulers as the city had in rands absence shed corresponded with both and found sashalle remarkably keen at understanding the cairhienin way of thinking shed offered elayne the city but had implied that she understood that being offered it and taking it were two different things sashalle stepped forward your majesty she said formally let it be known that the lord dragon gives you all rights and claim to this land all formal control he had over the land is ceded to you and the position of steward over the nation is dissolved may you rule in wisdom and peace elayne nodded to her regally from horseback but inside she seethed shed said she didnt mind rands help taking this throne but it wasnt like she wanted her nose rubbed in it still sashalle seemed to take her position seriously though from what elayne had discovered that position was in large measure selfcreated elayne and her procession dismounted had rand thought that it would be as easy as that to give her the throne hed stayed in cairhien long enough to know how they schemed one aes sedai making a proclamation would never have been enough but having powerful nobles support her directly should be enough to do it their procession made its way up the steps they entered and each of those supporting her brought a smaller honor guard of fifty elayne brought her entire force it was crowded but she didnt intend to leave any behind the inner hallways were straight with peaked ceilings and golden trim the symbol of the rising sun emblazoned each door there were alcoves for riches to be displayed but many were empty the aiel had taken their fifth from this palace upon reaching the entrance to the grand hall of the sun elaynes andoran guardsmen and guardswomen arranged themselves lining the outer hallway elayne took a deep breath then strode into the throne room with a group of ten bluestreaked marble columns rose to the ceiling at the sides of the room and the sun throne sat on its blue marble dais at the back of the large hall the seat was of gilded wood but was surprisingly unassuming perhaps that was why laman had decided to build himself a new throne using avendoraldera itself as a material elayne walked up to the dais then turned as the cairhienin nobility entered her supporters first then the others ranked according to the complicated dictates of does daemar those rankings could change by the day if not the hour birgitte eyed each one who entered but the cairhienin were models of propriety none would show anything like elloriens audacity in andor she was a patriot if one who frustratingly continued to disagree with elayne in cairhien one did not do such things once the crowd had stilled elayne took a deep breath shed considered a speech but her mother had taught her that sometimes decisive action made for the best speech elayne moved to sit down in the throne birgitte caught her arm elayne glanced at her questioningly but the warder was eyeing the throne wait a moment she said bending down the nobles began murmuring one to another and lorstrum stepped up to elayne your majesty birgitte elayne said blushing is this really necessary birgitte ignored her prodding at the seats cushion light was the warder determined to embarrass her in every possible situation surely theaha birgitte said yanking something from the pillowed cushion elayne started the stepped closer lorstrum and bertome at her side birgitte was holding up a small needle tipped black hidden in the cushion elayne paled it was the only place they knew youd be elayne birgitte said softly she knelt down and began prodding for more traps lorstrum had grown flushed i will find who did this your majesty he said in a low voice a dangerous voice they will know my wrath not if they know mine first stocky bertome said looking over the needle obviously an assassination attempt intended for the lord dragon your majesty lorstrum said in a louder voice for the benefit of the audience none would dare try to kill you our beloved sister from andor that is good to hear elayne said eyeing him that expression of hers said to everyone in the room that she would put up with this ruse intended to save his face as her strongest supporter the shame of an assassination attempt fell on him agreeing to let him save face would cost him he lowered his eyes briefly in understanding light she hated this game but she would play it and she would play it well is it safe she asked birgitte the warder rubbed her chin one way to find out she said then plopped herself down in the throne with an unceremonious amount of force not a few of the nobles in the hall gasped and lorstrum grew more pale not very comfortable birgitte said leaning to the side then pushing her back up against the wood i would have expected a monarchs throne to be more cushioned what with your delicate backside and all birgitte elayne hissed feeling her face grow red again you cant sit in the sun throne im your bodyguard birgitte said i can taste your food if i want i can walk through doorways before you and i can bloody sit in your chair if i think it will protect you she grinned besides she added in a lower voice i always wondered what one of these felt like the warder stood up still wary but also satisfied elayne turned and faced the nobility of cairhien you have waited long for this she said some of you are dissatisfied but remember that half of my blood is cairhienin this alliance will make both of our nations great i do not demand your trust but i do demand your obedience she hesitated then added remember again this is as the dragon reborn wishes it to be she saw that they understood rand had conquered this city once though it had been to liberate it from the shaido they would be wise not to tempt him to come back and conquer it again a queen used the tools that she had at hand she had taken andor on her own she would let rand help her with cairhien she sat down such a simple thing but the implications would be farreaching indeed gather your individual forces and house guards she commanded to the collected nobles you will be marching with the forces of andor through gateways to a place known as the field of merrilor we will be meeting the dragon reborn the nobles seemed surprised she would come in take the throne then command their armies from the city the same day she smiled best to act quickly and decisively it would build precedent for obeying her and would begin to ready them for the last battle also she announced as they began to whisper i want you to gather every man in this realm who can hold a sword and conscript them into the queens army there wont be much time for training but every man will be needed in the last battleand those women who wish to fight may report as well also send word to the bellfounders in your city i will need to meet with them within the hour but bertome said the coronation feast your majesty we will feast when the last battle has been wori and cairhiens children are safe elayne said she needed to distract them from their plots give them work to keep them busy if possible move pretend the last battle is on your doorstep and will arrive on the morrow for indeed it might mat leaned against a dead tree looking over his camp he breathed in and out smiling feeling the beautiful comfort of knowing that he was no longer being chased he had forgotten how good that felt better than a pretty serving girl on each knee that feeling was well better than one serving girl anyway a military camp at evening was one of the most comfortable places in all the world even if half the camp was empty the men there having gone to cairhien the sun had set and some of those who remained had turned in but for those who had pulled afternoon duty the next day there was no reason to sleep just yet a dozen firepits smoldered through the camp men sitting to share tales of exploits of women left behind or of rumors from far off tongues of flames flickered as men laughed sitting on logs or rocks someone occasionally digging into the coals with a twisted branch and stirring tiny sparks into the air as his friends sang come ye maids or fallen willows at noon the men of the band were from a dozen different nations but this camp was their true home mat strode through them hat on his head ashandarei over his shoulder he had gotten a new scarf for his neck people knew about his scar but there was no reason to show it off like one or lucas bloody wagons the scarf he had chosen this time was red in memory of tylin and the others who had fallen to the gholam for a short time he had been tempted to choose pink a very short time mat smiled though songs rang from several of the campfires none were loud and there was a healthy stillness about the camp not a silence silence was never good he hated silence made him wonder who was trying so hard to sneak up on him no this was a stillness men snoring softly fires crackling other men singing weeds crunching as those on watch passed by the peaceful noises of men enjoying their lives mat found his way back to his table outside his darkened tent he sat down looking over the papers he had stacked here the inside of the tent had been too stuffy besides he had not wanted to wake olver mats tent rippled in the wind his seat did look odd the fine oak table sitting in a patch of hensfoot mats chair beside it a pitcher of mulled cider on the ground beside him the papers on his table were weighed down with various rocks he had picked up lit by a single flickering lamp he should not have to have stacks of paper he should be able to sit at one of those fires and sing dance with jak o the shadows he could faintly make out the words of the song from a nearby campfire papers well he had agreed to elaynes employment and there were papers for that sort of thing and papers about setting up the dragon crews papers about supplies discipline reports and all kinds of nonsense and a few papers he had been able to wiggle out of her royal majesty spy reports he had wanted to look over reports on the seanchan much of the news was not new to him by courtesy of verins gateway mat had traveled to caemlyn more quickly than most rumors but elayne had gateways of her own and some of the news from tear and illian was fresh there was talk of the new seanchan empress so tuon really had crowned herself or whatever it was the seanchan did to name a new leader that made him smile light but they did not know what they were in for they probably thought they did but she would surprise them sure as the sky was blue or well it had been gray lately there was also talk of sea folk in alliance with the seanchan mat dismissed that the seanchan had captured enough sea folk vessels to give that impression but it was not the truth he found some pages with news about rand too most of it unspecific or untrustworthy blasted colors rand was sitting around and talking with some people in a tent perhaps he was in arad doman but he could not be both there and fighting in the borderlands now could he one rumor said that rand had killed queen tylin which bloody idiots thought that he turned over the reports on rand quickly he hated having to banish those flaming colors over and over again at least rand was wearing clothes this time the last page was curious wolves running in enormous packs congregating in clearings and howling in chorus the skies shining red at night livestock lining up in the fields all facing toward the north watching silently the footprints of shadowspawn armies in the middle of fields these things smelled of simple hearsay passed on from farmwife to farmwife until they reached the ears of elaynes spies mat looked over the sheet thenwithout even thinking of itrealized he had pulled verins envelope out of his pocket the stillsealed letter was looking worn and dirty but he had not opened it it seemed lke the most difficult thing he had ever done resisting thaturge now that is a sight of some irregularity a womans voice said mat looked up to see setalle strolling toward him she wore a brown dress that laced over her ample bosom not that mat spent any time looking at it you like my den mat asked he set the envelope aside then put the last of the spy reports on a stack just beside a series of sketches hed been doing on some new crossbows based on the ones talmanes had bought the papers threatened to blow away as he had no rock for this stack he pulled off one of his boots and set it on the top your den setalle asked sounding amused sure mat said scratching the bottom of his stockinged foot youll have to make an appointment with my steward if you want to come in your steward the stump right over there mat said nodding not the little one the big one with moss growing on the top she raised an eyebrow hes quite good mat said hardly ever lets anyone in i dont want to see you are an interesting creature matrim cauthon setalle said seating herself on the larger stump her dress was after the ebou dar style with the side pinned up to reveal petticoats colorful enough to scare away a tinker did you want anything specific mat asked or did you just drop by so that you could sit on my stewards head i heard that you visited the palace again today is it true that you know the queen mat shrugged elaynes a nice enough girl pretty thing thats for certain you dont shock me anymore matrim cauthon setalle noted ive realized that the things you say are often intended to do that they were i say what im thinking mistress anan why does it matter to you if i know the queen merely another piece of the puzzle that you represent setalle said i received a letter from joline today what did she want from you she didnt ask for anything she merely wanted to send word that they had arrived safely in tar valon you must have read it wrong setalle gave him a chiding stare joline sedai respects you master cauthon she often spoke highly of you and the way that you rescued not only her but the other two she asked after you in the letter mat blinked really she said things like that setalle nodded burn me he said almost makes me feel bad for painting her mouth blue but you wouldnt have known she thought that way considering how she treated me speaking such things to a man inflates his opinion of himself one would think that the way she treated you would have been enough shes aes sedai mat muttered she treats everyone like theyre mud to be scraped off her boots setalle glared at him she had a stately way about her part grandmother part court lady part nononsense innkeeper sorry he said some aes sedai arent as bad as others i didnt mean to insult you ill take that for a compliment setalle said though im not aes sedai mat shrugged finding a nice small rock at his feet he used it to replace his boot atop the stack of paper the rains of the last few days had passed leaving a crisp freshness to the air i know you said it didnt hurt mat said but what does it feel like the thing you lost she pursed her lips what is the most delightful food you enjoy master cauthon the one thing that you would eat above all others mas sweet pies mat said immediately well it is like that setalle said knowing that you used to be able to enjoy those pies every day but now they have been denied you your friends they can have as many of those pies as they want you envy them and you hurt but at the same time youre happy at least someone can enjoy what you cannot mat nodded slowly why is it that you hate aes sedai so master cauthon setalle asked i dont hate them mat said burn me but i dont but sometimes a man cant seem to do two things without women wanting him to do one of those things a different way and ignore the other one completely you arent forced to take their advice and i warrant that much of the time you eventually admit it is good advice mat shrugged sometimes a man just likes to do what he wants without someone telling him whats wrong with it and whats wrong with him thats all and it has nothing to do with your peculiar views of nobles most aes sedai act as if they were noblewomen after all i have nothing against nobles mat said straightening his coat i just dont fancy being one myself why is that then mat sat for a moment why was it finally he looked down at his foot then replaced his boot its boots boots setalle looked confused boots mat said with a nod tying his laces its all about the boots but you see mat said pulling the laces tight a lot of men dont have to worry much about what boots to wear theyre the poorest of folks if you ask one of them what boots are you going to wear today mop their answer is easy well mat i only have one pair so i guess im gonna wear that pair mat hesitated or i guess they wouldnt say that to you setalle since youre not me and all they wouldnt call you mat you understand i understand she said sounding amused anyway for people that have a little coin the question of which boots to wear is harder you see average men men like me he eyed her and im an average man mind you of course you are bloody right i am mat said finishing with his laces and sitting up an average man might have three pairs of boots your third best pair of boots those are the boots you wear when youre working at something unpleasant they might rub after a few paces and they might have a few holes but theyre good enough to keep your footing you dont mind mucking them up in the fields or the barn all right setalle said then you have your second best pair of boots mat said those are your daytoday boots you wear those if you are going over to dinner at the neighbors or in my case you wear those if youre going to battle theyre nice boots give you good footing and you dont mind being seen in them or anything and your best pair of boots setalle asked you wear those to social events like a ball or dining with a local dignitary balls dignitaries bloody ashes woman i thought you were an innkeeper setalle blushed faintly were not going to any balls mat said but if we had to i suspect wed wear our second best pair of boots if theyre good enough for visiting old lady hembrew next door then theyre bloody well good enough for stepping on the toes of any woman fool enough to dance with us then what are the best boots for walking mat said any farmer knows the value of good boots when you go walking a distance setalle looked thoughtful all right but what does this have to do with being a nobleman everything mat said dont you see if youre an average fellow you know exactly when to use your boots a man can keep track of three pairs of boots life is simple when you have three pairs of boots but noblemen talmanes claims he has forty different pairs of boots at home forty pairs can you imagine that she smiled in amusement forty pairs mat repeated shaking his head forty bloody pairs and they arent all the same kind of boots either there is a pair for each outfit and a dozen pairs in different styles that will match any number of half your outfits you have boots for kings boots for high lords and boots for normal people you have boots for winter and boots for summer boots for rainy days and boots for dry days you have bloody shoes that you wear only when youre walking to the bathing chamber lopin used to complain that i didnt have a pair to wear to the privy at night i see so youre using boots as a metaphor for the onus of responsibility and decision placed upon the aristocracy as they assume leadership of complex political and social positions metaphor for mat scowled bloody ashes woman this isnt a metaphor for anything its just boots setalle shook her head youre an unconventionally wise man matrim cauthon i try my best he noted reaching for the pitcher of mulled cider to be unconventional i mean he poured a cup and lifted it in her direction she accepted graciously and drank then stood i will leave you to your own amusements then master cauthon but if you have made any progress on that gateway for me elayne said she would have one for you soon in a day or two once im back from the errand i have to run with thorn and noal ill see it done she nodded in understanding if he did not return from that errand she would see to olver she turned to leave mat waited until she was gone before taking a slurp of the cider straight from the pitcher he had been doing that all evening but he figured she would probably rather not know it was the sort of thing women were better off not thinking about he turned back to his reports but soon found his mind wandering to the tower of ghenjei and those bloody snakes and foxes birgittes comments had been enlightening but not particularly encouraging two months two bloody months spent wandering those hallways that was a mighty steaming bowl of worry served up like afternoon slop beyond that she had taken fire music and iron breaking the rules was not so original an idea he was not surprised likely the day the light made the very first man and that man had made the first rule someone else had thought to break it people like elayne made up rules to suit them people like mat found ways to get around the stupid rules unfortunately birgitteone of the legendary heroes of the horn had not been able to defeat the aelfinn and eelfinn that was disconcerting well mat had something she had not had his luck he sat thoughtfully leaning back in his chair one of his soldiers passed by clintock saluted the redarm checked on mat every halfhour they still had not gotten over the shame of letting the gbolam sneak into camp he picked up verins letter again feeling it over in his fingers the worn corners the smudges of dirt on the oncewhite paper he tapped it against the wood then he tossed it onto the desk no no he was not going to open it even when he got back that was that he would never know what was in it and he bloody did not care he stood up and went looking for thorn and noal tomorrow they would leave for the tower of ghenjei chapter pevara kept her tongue as she walked through the village of the black tower with javindhra and mazrim taim there was activity all through the place there was always activity in the black tower soldiers felling trees nearby dedicated stripping the bark away then slicing the logs into lumber with focused jets of air sawdust coated the path with a chill pevara realized that the stack of boards nearby had probably been cut by ashaman light shed known what shed find here it was much harder to face than shed assumed it would be and you see taim said walking with one hand foldedfingers making a fistbehind his back with his other hand he pointed toward a distant partfinished wall of black stone guard posts spaced at fiftyfoot intervals each with two ashaman atop them he smiled in satisfaction this place will be impregnable yes indeed javindhra said impressive her tone was flat and uninterested but the item i wished to speak with you about if we could choose men with the dragon pin to this again taim said he had fire in his eyes this mazrim taim a tall blackhaired man with high saldaean cheekbones he smiled or the closest he came to such an expressiona halfsmile that did not reach his eyes it looked predatory i have made my will known and yet you continue to push no soldiers and dedicated only as you demand javindhra said we will continue our consideration weeks pass taim replied and still you consider well far be it from me to question aes sedai i care not what you do but the women outside my gates claim to be from the white tower as well do you not wish me to invite them in to meet with you pevara felt a chill he always seemed to know too much and hint that he knew too much about internal white tower politics that wont be needed javindhra said coldly as you wish he said you should make your choices soon they grow impatient and althor has given them permission to bond my men they will not suffer my stalling forever they are rebels you need pay them no heed at all rebels taim said with a much larger force than you what do you have six women from the way you talk you seem to intend to bond the entirety of the black tower perhaps we might pevara spoke calmly no limit was placed upon us taim glanced at her and she had the distinct feeling she was being inspected by a wolf considering whether shed make a good meal she shoved that feeling aside she was aes sedai no easy meat still she couldnt help remembering that they were only six inside a camp filled with hundreds of men who could channel i once saw a skyfisher dying on the city docks of illian taim said the bird was choking having tried to swallow two fish at once did you help the sorry thing javindhra asked fools will always choke themselves when they grasp for too much aes sedai taim said what matters that to me i had a fine meal of it that night the flesh of the bird and of the fish i must go but be warned now that i have a defensible perimeter you must give me warning if you wish to pass outside you mean to keep comings and goings that tight pevara asked the world becomes a dangerous place taim said smoothly i must think of the needs of my men pevara had noticed how he saw to the needs of his men a group of young soldiers passed by saluting taim two bore bruised features one with an eye swollen shut ashaman were beaten brutally for making mistakes in their training then forbidden healing the aes sedai were never touched in fact the deference they were shown bordered on mockery taim nodded then stalked off meeting up with two of his ashaman who waited nearby beside the smithy they immediately began speaking in hushed tones i dont like this pevara said as soon as the men were away perhaps she said it too quickly betraying her worries but this place had her on edge this could easily turn to disaster im beginning to think that we should do as i originally statedbond a few dedicated each and return to the white tower our task was never to lock down the entire black tower but to gain access to ashaman and learn about them thats what were doing javindhra said ive been learning much these last few weeks what have you been doing pevara did not rise to the other womans tone must she be so contrary pevara had leadership of this team and the others would defer to her but it didnt mean that they would always be pleasant about it this has been an interesting opportunity javindhra continued scanning the tower grounds and i do think he will yield eventually on the subject of full ashaman pevara frowned javindhra couldnt honestly think that could she after how stubborn taim had been yes pevara had yielded to suggestions that they remain in the black tower a little longer to learn of its workings and ask taim to allow them access to the more powerful ashaman but it was obvious now he would not give in surely javindhra saw that unfortunately pevara was having great difficulty reading javindhra lately originally the woman had seemed against coming to the black tower only agreeing to the mission because the highest had ordered it yet now she offered reasons to remain here javindhra pevara said stepping closer you heard what he said we now need permission to leave this place is turning into a cage i think were safe javindhra said waving a hand he doesnt know we have gateways so far as we know pevara said if you order it im sure the others will go javindhra said but i intended to continue to use the opportunity to learn pevara took a deep breath insufferable woman surely she wasnt going so far as to ignore pevaras leadership of the group after the highest herself had placed pevara in charge light but javindhra was growing erratic they parted without another word pevara spinning and walking back down the path she kept her temper with difficulty that last statement had been close to outright defiance well if she wanted to disobey and remain so be it it was time to be returning to the white tower men in black coats walked all around her many nodded with those tooobsequious grins of feigned respect her weeks here had not done anything to make her more comfortable around these men she would make a few of them warders three she could handle three couldnt she those dark expressions like the eyes of executioners while waiting for the next neck to line up before them the way some of them muttered to themselves or jumped at shadows or held their heads and looked dazed she stood in the very pit of madness itself and it made her skin creep as if covered in caterpillars she couldnt help quickening her pace no she thought cant leave javindhra here not without trying one more time pevara would explain to the others give them the order to leave then shed ask them tarna first to approach javindhra surely their united arguments would convince her pevara reached the huts they had been given she purposely did not look to the side toward the line of small buildings where the bonded aes sedai made their homes shed heard what some of them were doing trying to control their ashaman using various methods that made her skin crawl too while she thought most reds had too harsh an opinion of men what those women did crossed the line with a heedless leap she stepped inside her hut and there found tarna at the desk writing a letter the aes sedai had to share their huts and pevara had picked tarna specifically pevara might have been made leader of this group but tarna was keeper of the chronicles the politics of this particular expedition were very delicate with so many influential members and so many opinions last night tarna had agreed that it was time to leave shed work with pevara on going to javindhra taim has locked down the black tower pevara said calmly sitting on her bed in the small circular chamber we now need his permission to leave he said it offhandedly as if it werent really meant to stop us just a rule hed forgotten to give us a blanket exception to likely thats just what it was tarna said im sure its nothing pevara fell still what she tried again javindhra still irrationally thinks he will change his mind on letting us bond full ashaman its time to bond dedicated and leave but shes hinted that shell remain regardless of my intentions i want you to speak to her actually tarna said continuing to write ive been thinking on what we discussed last night perhaps i was hasty there is much to learn here and there is the matter of the rebels outside if we leave they will bond ashaman which should not be allowed the woman looked up and pevara froze there was something different in tarnas eyes something cold shed always been a distant one but this was worse tarna smiled a grimace that looked completely unnatural on her face like the smile on the lips of a corpse she turned back to her writing something is very very wrong here pevara thought well you may be right she found herself saying her mouth worked though her mind reeled this expedition was your suggestion after all i will think on it further if youll excuse me tarna waved ambivalently pevara stood years as an aes sedai keeping her profound worry from showing in her posture she stepped outside then walked eastward along the unfinished wall yes guard stations had been set up regularly earlier this morning those hadnt been manned now they were with men who could channel one of those men could strike her dead before she could respond she couldnt see their weaves and she couldnt strike first because of her oaths she turned and walked to a small stand of trees a place that was to become a garden inside she sat down on a stump breathing deeply the coldnessalmost lifelessnessshed seen in tarnas eyes still chilled her pevara had been ordered by the highest not to risk gateways unless the situation were dire this seemed like a dire situation to her she embraced the source and wove the proper weave the weave fell apart the moment she completed it no gateway formed eyes wide she tried again but got the same result she tried other weaves and they worked but gateways failed every time her chill became frost within her she was trapped they all were perrin clasped hands with mat good luck my friend mat grinned tugging down the broad brim of his dark hat luck i hope this all comes down to luck im good with luck mat carried a bulging pack over one shoulder as did the bony gnarled man that mat had introduced as noal thorn had his harp on his back and a similar pack perrin still wasnt clear on what they were bringing mat only planned to be at the tower for a few days so there was no need for a lot of supplies the small group stood on the traveling ground outside perrins camp behind them perrins people shouted back and forth breaking down the camp none had any inkling of how important this day could prove moiraine moiraine was alive light let it be so are you certain i cant convince you to take more help perrin asked mat nodded sorry these things well they tend to be particular the note was clear only three of us can enter otherwise well fail if we fail anyway well i guess it will be her own bloody fault then wont it perrin frowned just be careful im expecting another helping from your pouch of tabac at master denezels place when you return youll have it thorn said taking perrins offered hand he hesitated smiling a faint twinkle in his eyes what perrin asked thorn repositioned his pack is every last farmboy i know going to transform into a nobleman by the time this is through im no nobleman mat said oh thom asked prince of the ravens mat pulled his hat down people can call me what they want that doesnt mean im one of them actually thom said it open the gateway so we can get going mat said no more nonsense perrin nodded to grady the air rent a twisting beam of light opening a portal that overlooked a broad slowmoving river this is as close as he can get perrin said at least not without a better description of the place itll do mat said poking his head through the gateway youll open one for us to get back each day at noon grady said repeating perrins orders to him into that exact spot he smiled take care you dont get your toes cut off when it appears master cauthon ill do my best mat said im attached to those toes he took a breath and stepped through the gateway quiet noal followed smelling of determination that one was a lot tougher than he looked thom nodded to perrin mustaches wagging then hopped through he was spry though he still bore the stiff leg from fighting that fade two years ago light guide you perrin prayed raising a hand to the three as they trudged along the rivers bank moiraine perrin should send word to rand the colors appeared showing rand speaking with a group of borderlanders but no perrin couldnt tell rand until he was certain she lived to do otherwise would be too cruel and would be an invitation for rand to meddle in mats mission perrin turned as the portal closed as he stepped he felt a faint throbbing from his leg where slayers arrow had hit him he had been healed or that wound and from what hed been able to tell the healing had been complete there was no injury but his leg it felt like it could remember the wound anyway it was like a shadow very faint almost unnoticeable faile walked up to him her face curious gaul was with her and perrin smiled at the way he kept glancing over his shoulder at bain and chiad one carried his spears the other his bow so that he didnt have to apparently i missed the sendoff faile asked as you intended perrin replied she sniffed matrim cauthon is a bad influence im surprised he didnt drag you off to another tavern before leaving amusingly the colors appeared showing him matwho had just leftwalking along the river hes not as bad as all that perrin said are we ready aravine has everyone organized and moving faile said we should be ready to march within the hour that proved a good estimate in about a halfhour perrin stood to the side as an enormous gateway split the air created by grady and neald linked together with the aes sedai and edarra nobody had questioned perrins decision to move if rand was traveling to this place known as the field of merrilor then that was where perrin wanted to be it was where he needed to be the land beyond this gateway more rugged than southern andor fewer trees more prairie grass some ruins lay in the distance the open area before them was filled with tents banners and camps it looked as if egwenes coalition was gathered grady peered through then whistled softly how many people is that those are the crescent moons of tear perrin noted pointing toward a banner and thats illian camped on opposite sides of the field a green banner set with nine golden bees marked that army a large number of cairhienin houses faile said looking out off the rise not a few aiel no borderlander flags ive never seen so many troops in one place grady said its really happening perrin thought heart thumping the last battle do you think theyll be enough to stop rand faile asked to help us keep him from breaking the seals help us perrin asked you told elayne that youd go to the field of merrilor faile said because of what egwene had asked oh i told her i needed to be there perrin said but i never said i was going to take egwenes side i trust rand faile and it seems right to me that hed need to break the seals its like making a sword you usually dont want to forge one out of the pieces of a broken and ruined weapon you get new good steel to make it rather than patch the old seals hell need to make new ones perhaps faile said but this is going to be a fine line to walk so many armies in one place if some side with rand and others with the white tower nobody would win if they turned against one another well perrin would have to make sure that didnt happen the soldiers were already gathered in lines preparing to march perrin turned to them rand sent us away to search for an enemy he bellowed we return to him having found allies onward to the last battle only the ones at the front could hear him but they cheered and passed the word back rand or elayne would have given a far more inspiring speech but perrin wasnt them hed have to do things his way aravine perrin called to the plump amadician go through and make sure that nobody fights over where to set up their camps yes lord goldeneyes keep us away from the other armies for now perrin said pointing have sulin and gaul pick a good site pass the word to each of the armies as we set up were not to interact with or look the wrong way at any of those other forces and dont let people go wandering off southward either were not in the wilderness anymore and i dont want the local farmers complaining of mischief yes my lord she said hed never asked aravine why she didnt join one of the groups that had been sent back to amadicia it was probably because of the seanchan though she was obviously noble but didnt say much of her past he was glad to have her as his camp steward she was his liaison between the various factions that made up his army the wolf guard had drawn first lot so they led the way through the gateway the large column began to move perrin went down the line giving orders mostly reinforcing that he didnt want trouble with the locals or the other armies he stopped as he met whitecloaks waiting their turn berelain was riding next to galad again they seemed very amenably lost in conversation light but the woman had spent pretty much every waking hour with galad these last few days perrin hadnt put the whitecloaks and mayeners together yet they seemed to have somehow ended up that way as they started moving galads whitecloaks rode in a perfect line four across their white tabards set with sunbursts perrin still had a gut reaction akin to panic whenever he saw them but theyd made surprisingly little trouble since the trial mayenes winged guard rode along the other side gallenne just behind berelain their lances held high red streamers came from the lances and breastplates and helms were shined to perfection it seemed they were ready to parade and maybe they were if you were going to ride to the last battle you did it with lance held high and armor polished perrin continued on alliandres army came next riding in a tight formation of heavy cavalry eight men across arganda at their head he called orders when he saw perrin and the serpentine column of soldiers turned and saluted perrin returned their salute hed asked alliandre and shed indicated that was the appropriate response she rode with arganda sidesaddle in a slim maroon gown with gold trim an impractical outfit for riding but they wouldnt be in the saddle very long three hundred paces and as many leagues he could see her satisfaction as he saluted her soldiers she was pleased to see him stepping into his role as leader of the coalition in fact many in camp reacted the same way perhaps before theyd been able to sense how much he resented leadership how did people do that without being able to smell emotions lord perrin alliandre said riding past him she gave a bowing sort of sway that was the equivalent of a horseback curtsy should you not be riding i like my feet perrin said it looks more authoritative when a commander rides ive decided to lead this bunch alliandre perrin said gruffly but ill do it my way that means walking when i want to they were only going a few feet through the gateway his feet would serve him well enough of course my lord once were settled i want you to send some men back to jehannah see if you can recruit anyone else pick up whatever city guard you have bring them here were going to need everyone we can get and i want to train them as much as possible before this war hits very well my lord ive sent to mayene already perrin said and tarns been gathering what extras he can from the two rivers light but he wished he could let them stay behind on their farms to live in peace while the storm raged elsewhere but this really was the end he could feel it lose this fight and they lost everything the world the pattern itself facing that hed field boys who could barely swing a sword and grandfathers who had trouble walking it twisted his stomach to admit it but it was the truth he continued down the line and gave some orders to several other groups as he was finishing up with the last he noticed a handful of two rivers men passing by one azi held the wolfhead banner jori congar hung back he stopped then waved the other three on before trotting up to perrin was something wrong lord perrin jori drew himself up long and lanky like a bird standing on one leg i well perrin said out with it i wanted to apologize jori said words coming in a rush for what for some things i said jori said looking away i mean some foolish words it was after you were ill you see and you were taken to the firsts tent and well i jts all right jori perrin said i understand jori looked up smiling its a pleasure to be here with you lord perrin a real pleasure well follow you anywhere the others and i with that jori saluted then ran off perrin scratched at his beard watching the man go jori was one of a good dozen two rivers men who had approached perrin over the last few days to apologize it seemed all of them felt guilty for spreading rumors about perrin and berelain though none would say it straight out bless faile for what she had done there everyone seen to perrin took a deep breath then walked up the column and stepped through the gateway come quickly rand he thought colors blossoming in his vision i can feel it starting mat stood with thorn at his left and noal at his right looking up through the trees at the spire ahead a trickling musical stream gurgled behind them a tributary of the nearby arinelle a grassy plain spread behind them and beyond that the grand river itself had he passed this way before so much of his memory from that time was fragmented and yet this tower remained clear in his mind viewed from a distance even the darkness of shadar logoth had not been able to excise it from his mind the tower looked to be of pure metal its solid steel gleaming in the overcast sunlight mat felt an iciness between his shoulder blades many travelers along the river thought it some relic from the age of legends what else did you make of a column of steel rising out of the forest seemingly uninhabited it was as unnatural and out of place as the twisted red doorways were those warped the eyes to look at them the forest felt too still here quiet save for the footsteps of the three noal walked with a long staff taller than he was where had he gotten it it had that smooth oiled look of wood that had spent more years as a walking staff than it originally had as a tree noal had also put on a dark bluenearly blackpair of trousers and a shirt that was of an odd unknown style the shoulders were stiffer than the cuts mat was familiar with and the coat longer going almost all the way down to noals knees it buttoned to the waist then split at the legs strange indeed the old man never would answer questions about his past thom had opted for his gleemans clothing it was good to see him in that again rather than the frilly court bard apparel the patchwork cloak the simple shirt that tied up the front the tight breeches tucked into boots when mat had asked about the choice thom had shrugged saying it feels like what i should wear if im going to see her her meant moiraine but what had the snakes and foxes done to her it had been so long but burn him if he was going to let another hour pass he had chosen clothing of forest greens and earthy browns along with a deep brown cloak he carried his pack slung over one arm and his ashandarei in his hand he had practiced with the new iron counterweight on the butt and was pleased the eelfinn had given him the weapon well if they dared stand between him and moiraine then they would see what he could do with their gift burn him but they would the three men stepped up to the tower it did not appear to have a single opening anywhere on its twohundredfoottall height not a window not a seam not a scratch mat looked up feeling disoriented as he stared along its gleaming length toward the distant gray sky did the tower reflect too much light he shuddered and turned to thom mat gave a single nod hesitating only briefly thom slid a bronze knife from its sheath on his belt and stepped over to set the tip against the tower he grimly slid the knife in the shape of a triangle about a palm wide point down metal scraped against metal but left no trail thom finished by making a wavy line through the center as one did at the start of any game of snakes and foxes all stood silently mat glanced at thorn did you do it right i think so thorn said but how do we know what right is that game has been passed down for he cut off as a line of light appeared on the tower front mat jumped back leveling his spear the glowing lines formed a triangle matching the one that thorn had drawn and thenquick as a single beat of a moths wingsthe steel in the center of the triangle vanished noal eyed the palmsized hole thats a tad small to get through he stepped up to it and looked through nothing but darkness on the other side thorn looked down at the knife guess that triangle is actually a doorway thats what youre drawing when you start the game should i try a bigger one guess so mat said unless the gholam taught you how to squeeze through holes the size of a fist no need to be unpleasant thorn said using the knife to draw another triangle around the first this one large enough to walk through he finished with the wavy line mat counted it took seven heartbeats for the lines of white to appear the steel between them faded away opening a triangular corridor leading into the tower the inside looked to be solid steel light burn me noal whispered the corridor disappeared into darkness the sunlight seemed hesitant to enter the opening though it was probably just a trick of the light and so we begin the game that cannot be won thorn said sliding the knife back into its sheath courage to strengthen noal whispered stepping forward holding up a lantern with a flickering flame fire to blind music to dazzle iron to bind and matrim cauthon mat added to bloody even the odds he stepped through the doorway light flashed brilliant white blinding he cursed squeezing his eyes shut and lowering his asbandarei in what he hoped was a threatening posture he blinked and the whiteness faded he was in the center of a wide room with a triangular opening behind him freestanding with the point down at the floor it was pure black made of twisting cords that in some places seemed metal and in other places seemed wood the room was black as well shaped like an offkilter square rippling white steam poured up from holes at all four corners that mist glowed with a white light there were four hallways extending from the room one in each direction the chamber was not exactly square each side was a slightly different length than the others making for an odd meeting of angles at the corners and that steam it gave off a sulphurous stench that made him want to breathe through his mouth the onyxcolored walls were not stone but were of some reflective material like the scales of enormous fish the steam collected at the ceiling glowing faintly with a soft light burn him this was not like the first place he had visited with its twisting coils and circular doorways but nor was it like the second one with the starshaped rooms and lines of yellow light where was he what had he gotten himself into he turned about nervous thorn stumbled through the doorway blinking dazed mat dropped his pack and caught the gleeman by one arm noal came next the bony man kept his footing but was obviously blinded his lantern held forward defensively the two others blinked tears streaming from noals eyes but they eventually got their bearings and glanced about the room like the hallways extending in all four directions was empty this doesnt look like what you described mat thorn said his voice echoed faintly though the sounds seemed eerily warped almost like whispers thrown back at them it made the hair on mats neck rise i know mat said pulling a torch from his pack this place doesnt makes sense the stories agree about that at least here light this noal thorn got out a torch of his own and both lit from noals lantern they had strikers from aludra but mat wanted to save those he had been halfafraid that in the tower flames would go out once lit but the lights burned steady and true that heartened him somewhat so where are they thorn asked walking around the perimeter of the black room theyre never here when you come through mat said holding up his own torch and inspecting a wall was that writing carved into the notstone the unfamiliar script was so fine and delicate he could barely see it but watch yourself they can appear behind you faster than an innkeeper who heard coins clink in your pouch noal inspected the triangular opening they had come through do you suppose we can use this to get back it resembled the stone terangreal mat had stepped through before just a different shape i hope so mat said maybe we should try noal said mat nodded to him he did not like being separated but they did need to know if this was a way back or not noal looked determined and stepped through he vanished mat held his breath for a long moment but the aged man did not return was it a trick had this doorway been placed here tonoal stumbled back into the room through the opening thorn set his torch on the floor and dashed over to help noal recovered more quickly this time blinking away the blindness it sealed me out he explained i had to draw another triangle to get back in at least we know weve got a means of escape thorn said assuming those bloody aelfinn or eelfinn dont move it mat thought remembering his previous visit the one that had ended with him being hanged that time the rooms and corridors had shifted mysteriously in total defiance of what was right will you look at that thorn said mat lowered his spear and noal had an iron shortsword in his hand in a moment thorn was pointing at his torch which burned fitfully where he had set it on the floor beside one of the glowing steam vents the white steam pushed away from the flames like it was being blown by a breeze only no breeze ever made steam move so unnaturally it curved around the fire in a loop thorn stepped over and picked up the torch he moved it toward the column of steam and it bowed out of the way thorn rammed the torch directly into the steams path and the steam split going around the flame and melding together into a single stream again above thorn glanced at the others dont ask me mat said scowling i said this place doesnt make sense if thats the oddest thing we see here ill be a murandians mustache come on mat picked one of the hallways and began to walk down it the other two hurried to catch up the steam glowed on the ceiling bathing the black hallway with its milky light the floor was made of interlocking triangular tiles that once again looked discomfortingly like scales the corridor was wide and long the other end distant and dark to think noal said holding up his lantern all of this hidden in that single tower i doubt were in the tower anymore mat said up ahead he could see a slice out of the side of the wall a kind of window it was set up a little too high up to feel natural then where noal trailed off as they reached the window which was an offcenter square through it they could look out at an unnatural landscape they were up several floors in some kind of spire but that certainly was not andor outside the window looked out over a canopy of dense vegetation that was too yellow mat recognized the wispy trees with a drooping umbrella of branches at the top though before he had seen them from below the fernlike trees with their spreading fans of leaves were familiar as well though those had deep black fruits hanging from them now the large fruits caused the leaves to droop mercy of the winnower noal whispered a phrase mat had never heard before noal had reason to be astonished mat remembered looking out at that forest for the first time realizing that the twisted doorway had not brought him to another place but another world entirely mat looked to the side could he see the three spires he had noted on his first visit they did not seem to be about though in this place the very next window they passed could show a different scene they could he paused then glanced sharply through the window he could make out a spire to the left and then he knew he was in one of the spires he had seen in the distance during his first visit he stifled a shiver and turned away at least he knew for certain he was in the same place did that mean that the worlds of the aelfinn and the eelfinn were the same he hoped so moiraine had fallen through the second of the twisted red doorways which meant she had most likely been taken by the eelfinn the foxes they were the ones who had hanged mat the snakes at least had only tossed him out of their realm without any useful answers he bore them a grudge but the foxes they had refused to answer his questions and had given him these bloody memories instead mat and the others continued down the hallway their footsteps echoing against the flooring soon mat began to get the sense that he was being watched he had felt it before on his other visits he turned to the side and caught a glimpse of faint motion far behind he spun preparing to toss his torch aside and fight with his ashandarei but saw nothing the other two froze looking about anxious mat continued on sheepishly though he felt less so after thorn did the same thing a short time later thorn went so far as to throw a knife at a darkened patch of the wall the iron weapon clanked against the surface the dull ring echoed for far too long in the hallway sorry thorn said its all right mat said theyre watching us arent they noal asked his voice was soft faintly nervous light mat felt as if he was going to jump out of his skin and run away leaving it behind compared to that noal seemed steady i suspect they are at that mat said within a few moments they reached the end of the toolong hallway here they entered a chamber that was identical to the first save it had no doorway in the center it split off in four directions each corridor disappearing into the distant darkness they picked another direction memorizing the path they were taking unseen eyes scratching at their backs his footsteps grew more hurried as they traversed the length of the hallway and entered another chamber it was exactly like the previous one easy to be disoriented in a place like this noal said he opened his pack and got out a sheet of paper and a charcoal pencil he made three dots on his paper then connected them by lines representing the corridors and rooms theyd gone through its all a matter of keeping a good map a good map can mean life or death you can trust me on that mat turned around looking back the way they had come part of him wanted to keep going not look backward but he had to know come on he said going back the way they had come thorn and noal shared looks but once again hurried to catch up it took them a good halfhour to retrace their steps back to the first chamber the one that should contain the doorway they found it empty those columns of steam rose from the corners they had in the other two rooms too impossible noal said we retraced our steps perfectly the way out should be here in the distancefaint and almost inaudiblemat heard laughter a hissing dangerous laughter malicious mats skin grew icy thorn he said you ever hear a story about birgitte silverbow and her visit to the tower of ghenjei birgitte thom asked looking up from his inspectionwith noalof the floor they seemed convinced that the doorway must have been pulled down into some hidden trapdoor no cant say that i have what about a story of a woman trapped for two months in a maze of corridors inside a fortress two months thom said well no but theres the tale of elmiara and the shadoweyes she spent a hundred days wandering in a maze looking for the infamous healing spring of sund to save her lovers life that was probably it the story had survived it had changed forms the way so many of them did she didnt get out did she no she died at the end only two steps away from the fountain but separated from it by a wall she could hear it bubbling it was the last sound she heard before dying from thirst he glanced about uncomfortably as if uncertain he wanted to be sharing such a story in this place mat shook his head worried burn him but he hated these foxes there had to be a way toyou have broken the bargain a soft voice said mat spun and the other two cursed standing up hands on weapons a figure stood in the hallway behind them it was one of the creatures mat remembered perhaps the exact same one who had met him last time short bright red hair sprouted from the creatures pale scalp a pair of ears clung to the head slightly pointed at the tips the figure was willowy and tall the shoulders disproportionately wide for the waist and it wore pale leather straps crossed the chestmat still did not want to think about what those might have been made ofand a long black kilt below it was the face that was most distinctive large unnatural eyes pale with a shade of iris in the center a narrow jaw and angular features like a fox one of the eelfinn masters of this realm it had come to play with the mice there is no bargain this way mat said trying to keep the nervousness from his voice we can bloody bring what we want having no bargain is dangerous the eelfinn said in a smooth voice for you fortunately i can take you where you desire well then mat said do it leave your iron the eelfinn said your implements of music your fire never mat said the eelfinn blinked large eyes slowly deliberately it stepped forward footsteps soft mat raised his ashandarei but the eelfinn made no directly threatening moves it glided around the three of them speaking softly come now it said can we not speak with civility you have come to our realm seeking we have power to grant what you wish what you need why not show good faith leave behind your implements of fire those only and i promise to lead you for a time its voice was hypnotic soothing it did make sense what need had they of fire it was light enough with that mist it thorn mat said music what thorn said shaking a little bit play anything it doesnt matter what thorn took out his flute and the eelfinn narrowed its eyes thorn began playing it was a familiar song the wind that shakes the willows mat had intended to soothe the eelfinn maybe put it off guard but the familiar tune seemed to help dispel the cloud on mats mind this isnt needed the eelfinn said glaring at thorn yes it is mat said and were not bloody leaving our fire not unless you promise to take us all the way to the central chamber and give us back moiraine i cannot make that bargain the creature said continuing to walk around them mat turned to follow it never letting his back to the thing i have not the authority bring someone who can impossible the eelfinn said listen to me fire isnt needed i will lead you half of the way to the central chamber the chamber of bonds should you leave behind that terrible fire it offends us we wish only to meet your desires the creature was obviously trying to lull them again but its cadence was off at odds with thorns playing mat watched it then began to sing along with the flute playing he did not have the best voice among those he knew but he was not terrible either the eelfinn yawned then settled down beside the wall and closed its eyes in moments it was sleeping thorn lowered the flute form his lips looking impressed nicely done noal whispered i had no idea you were so fluent in the old tongue mat hesitated he had not even realized they had been speaking in it my old tongue is rusty noal said rubbing his chin but i caught a lot of that problem is we still dont know the way through this place how will we make our way without one of them to guide us he was right birgitte had wandered for months never knowing if her goal was merely a few steps away the chamber where mat had met the eelfinn leaders she had said that once you were there they had to bargain with you that must be the chamber of bonds the eelfinn had mentioned poor moiraine she had come through one of the red doorways she should have been protected by whatever treaty the eelfinn had with the ancient aes sedai but that doorway had been destroyed no way back when mat had come originally they had praised him as wise for thinking to ask for a leavetaking though he grumbled still about the eelfinn not answering his questions he could see that was not what they did the aelfinn were for questions the eelfinn granted requests but they twisted those requests and took whatever price they wanted mat had unwittingly asked for his memory filled for a way to be free of the aes sedai and a way out of the tower if moiraine had not known this and had not asked for passage out as he had done or if she had asked for passage back to the doorway not knowing it had been destroyed mat had asked for a way out they had given it to him but he could not remember what it was everything had gone black and he had awakened hanging from the ashandarei mat pulled something from his pocket holding it tightly in his fist the aelfinn and the eelfinn get around in here somehow his whispered there has to be a correct pathway one way noal said four choices followed by four choices followed by four choices the odds against us are incredible odds mat said holding out his hand he opened it revealing a pair of dice what do care for odds the two looked at his ivory dice then looked back up at his face mat could feel his luck surge twelve pips three for each doorway if i roll a one a two or a three we go straight four five or six we take the right path and so on but mat noal whispered glancing at the sleeping eelfinn the rolls wont be equal you cant roll a one for example and a seven is far more likely to you dont understand noal mat said tossing the dice to the floor they rattled against the scalelike tiles clacking like teeth it doesnt matter what is likely not when im around the dice came to a rest one of them caught in a rut between two tiles and froze precariously one of the corners to the air the other came to rest with a single pip showing how about that noal thorn said looks like he can roll a one after all now thats something noal said rubbing his chin mat fetched his ashandarei then picked up the dice and walked straight ahead the others followed leaving the sleeping eelfinn behind at the next intersection mat rolled again and got a nine back the way we came thorn asked frowning thats just what were going to do mat said turning and going back in the other room the sleeping eelfinn was gone they could have wakened him noal pointed out or it could be a different room mat said tossing the dice again another nine he was facing the way he had come so a nine meant going back again the aelfinn and the eelfinn have rules mat said turning and running down the corridor the other two chasing after him and this place has rules rules have to make sense mat noal said they have to be consistent mat said but they dont have to follow our logic why should they it made sense to him they ran for a timethis hallway seemed much longer than the others he was starting to feel winded when he reached the next room he tossed the dice again but suspected what he would see nine back to the first room again look this is foolish noal said as they turned and ran back the other way were never going to get anywhere this way mat ignored him continuing to run soon they approached the first room again mat noal said pleadingly can we at least noal trailed off as they burst into the first chamber only it was not the first chamber this room had a white floor and was enormous with thick black columns rising toward an unseen ceiling far above the glowing white steam that pooled atop their corridor poured into the room and fell upward into that blackness like a waterfall going in the wrong direction though the floor and the columns looked like glass mat knew they would feel porous like stone the room was lit by a series of glowing yellow stripes that ran up each column marking places where the carved glassstone was fluted to a point thorn clapped him on the shoulder mat lad that was insane and effective somehow about what you should expect from me mat said pulling down the brim of his hat ive been in this room before were on track if moiraine still lives then shell be somewhere past here chapter the light of the world thom held up his torch inspecting the enormous starshaped black columns and their glowing yellow lines those lines gave the entire room a sickly light making thorn look wan and jaundiced mat remembered the stink of this place that musty staleness now that he knew what to look for he could smell something else too the musky stink of an animals den a predators lair there were five corridors leading out of the room one at each inner point of the star shape he remembered passing through one of those passageways but had there not been only one way out before wonder how high up the pillars go thorn said raising his torch higher and squinting mat held his ashandarei in a firmer grip palms sweaty they had entered the foxes den he felt at his medallion the eelnnn had not used the power on him before but they had to have some understanding of it did they not of course ogier could not channel perhaps that meant eelfinn could not either rustling sounds came from the edges of the room shadows shifted and moved the eelnnn were in there in that darkness thorn mat said we should play some more music thorn watched that darkness he did not object he raised his flute and began playing the sound seemed lonely in the vast room mat noal said kneeling near the center of the room look at this i know mat said it looks like glass but feels like stone no not that noal said theres something here mat edged over to noal thorn joined them watching and playing as noal used his lantern to illuminate a melted lump of slag on the floor perhaps the size of a small chest it was black but a deeper less reflective black than the floor and the columns what do you make of it noal asked maybe one of the trapdoors no mat said its not that the other two looked at him its the doorframe mat said feeling sick the red stone doorframe when i came through it before it was in the center of a room like this when it melted on the other side it melted here too noal said the three stared at it thorns music sounded haunting well mat said we knew it wasnt a way out in the first place well have to bargain our way free and ill make bloody sure not to get hanged this time will the dice lead us noal asked rising mat felt them in his coat pocket i dont see why not but he did not take them out he turned to regard the depths of the room thorns music seemed to have stilled some of the shadows but others still moved there was a restless energy to the air mat thorn asked you knew id come back mat said loudly his voice did not echo light how large was the thing you knew id come marching back to your bloody realm didnt you you knew youd have me eventually hesitant thorn lowered his flute show yourselves mat said i can hear you scrambling hear you breathing mat thom said laying a hand on his shoulder they couldnt have known that youd come back moiraine didnt know that youd come for certain mat watched the darkness you ever see men lead cattle to slaughter thom the gleeman hesitated then shook his head well every man has his own ways mat said but cattle see theyll know something is wrong theyll smell the blood theyll get frenzied refuse to enter the slaughterhouse and you know how you fix that do we have to talk about this now mat you fix it mat said by taking them through the slaughterhouse a few times when it is clean when the scents arent so strong you let them go through and escape see and theyll think the place is safe he looked at thom they knew id be back they knew id survive that hanging they know things thom burn me but they do well get out mat thom promised we can moiraine saw it mat nodded firmly bloody right we will theyre playing a game thom i win games he pulled a handful of dice from his pocket win them most of the time anyway a voice whispered suddenly from behind them welcome son of battles mat spun cursing glancing about the chamber there noal said pointing with his staff there was a figure beside one of the pillars half lit by the yellow light another eelfinn taller his face more angular his eyes reflected torchlight orange i can take you where you wish to go the eelfinn said voice rough and gravelly he raised an arm against the glow of the torches for a price thom music thom began playing again one of you already tried to get us to leave our tools behind mat said he pulled a torch from the pack over his arm then thrust it to the side lighting it on noals lantern it wont work the eelfinn shied away from the new light snarling softly you come looking to bargain yet you purposely antagonize we have done nothing to earn this mat pulled the scarf free from his neck nothing the creature made no response though it did back away stepping into the darker area between pillars its tooangular face was now only barely lit by the yellow lights why do you wish to speak with us son of battles the whisperer said from the shadows if you are not willing to bargain no mat said no bargaining until we reach the great hall the chamber of bonds that was the only place where they would be bound to the agreement is that not what birgitte had said of course she had seemed to be relying on stories and hearsay herself thom continued playing eyes darting from side to side trying to watch the shadows noal began to play the little cymbals he had tied to the legs of his trousers tapping them in time with thoms music the shadows continued to move out there however your comforts will not slow us son of battles a voice said from behind mat spun lowering his weapon another eelfinn stood there just inside the shadows a female with a crest of red running down her back the leather straps crossing her breasts in an x pattern her red lips smiled we are the near ancient the warriors of final regret the knowers of secrets be proud son of battles another voice hissed mat spun again sweat dampening his brow the female vanished back into the shadows but another eelfinn strolled through the light he carried a long wicked bronze knife with a crosswork pattern of roses along its length and thorns sticking out near the top of the crossguard you draw out our most skilled you are to be savored what mat began but the lean dangerouslooking eelfinn stepped back into the shadows and vanished too quickly as if the darkness had absorbed him other whispers began in the shadows speaking in low voices overlapping each other faces appeared from the darkness inhuman eyes wide lips curled in smiles the creatures had pointed teeth light there were dozens of eelfinn in the room shifting moving about dancing into the light then jumping back into the dark some were casual others energetic all looked dangerous will you bargain one asked you come without treaty dangerous said another son of battles the savor feel his fear come with us leave your terrible light a bargain must be made we will wait patient we are ever patient the savor stop it mat bellowed no bargains not until we reach the center at his side thorn lowered the flute mat i dont think the music is working anymore mat nodded curtly he needed thom ready with weapons the gleeman tucked away his flute getting out knives mat ignored the whispering voices and tossed the dice onto the ground as they rolled a figure scuttled from the darkness beside the nearest pillar mat cursed lowering his spear and striking at the eelfinn which moved across the ground on all fours but his blade passed right through it as if it were smoke was it an illusion a trick of the eyes mat hesitated long enough for another creature to snatch the dice and leap back toward the shadows something sparkled in the air thorns dagger found its mark striking the creature in the shoulder this time the blade pierced and stayed releasing a spray of dark blood iron mat thought cursing his stupidity he spun the ashandarei around using the side banded with iron he shivered as he saw the eelfinns blood on the ground begin to steam white steam as in the other chambers but this had shapes in it they looked like twisted faces appearing briefly and yelling before vanishing burn them he couldnt get distracted he had other dice he reached for his pocket but an eelfinn ducked from the shadows as if to grab at his coat mat spun his weapon striking the side of the fox males face with the banded iron he crushed bone tossing the creature to the side like a bundle of sticks hisses and growls surrounded them eyes shifted in the darkness reflecting torchlight the eelfinn moved cloaked in blackness surrounding mat and the others mat cursed taking a step in the direction of the eelfinn he had struck mat thorn said grabbing the cuff of his coat we cant wade into that mat hesitated it seemed that the stink from before was stronger the scent of beasts shadows moved all about more frantic now their whispers angry and mixed with yipping calls they control the darkness noal said he stood with his back to mat and thorn wary those yellow lights are to distract us there are breaks in them and sheltered alcoves its all a trick mat felt his heart beating rapidly a trick no not just a trick there was something unnatural about the way those creatures moved in the shadow burn them mat said shaking thorns hand free but not chasing into the darkness gentlemen noal said gather arms mat glanced over his shoulder there were eelfinn stalking from the shadows behind them a double wave one group sliding on all fours before a second group the second group carried those wickedlooking bronze knives the shadows from the depths of the room seemed to be extending with the eelfinn closing on mat and his group his heart beat even faster the eelfinn eyes shone and those on all fours began to lope forward mat swung as the eelfinn reached his group but they split ducking to the sides distracting him behind mat thought with alarm another group of eelfinn jumped out of the darkness there mat turned on them swinging they ducked back before he hit light they were all around seething out of the darkness coming close enough to be dangerous then backing away thorn whipped out a pair of daggers throwing and noal kept his shortsword at the ready waving his torch with his other hand his banded staff on the floor at his feet one of thorns knives flashed seeking flesh but missed and passed into the darkness dont waste knives mat said bloody sons of goats theyre trying to make you waste them thorn theyre harrying us noal growled theyll overwhelm us eventually we have to move which way thorn asked urgent he cursed as a pair of eelfinn appeared from the shadows carrying bronzeended lances they thrust forward forcing mat thorn and noal to back away no time for dice they would just snatch those anyway mat yanked open his pack and pulled out a nightflower once this goes off im going to close my eyes and spin about what thorn said its worked before mat said lighting the nightflower and throwing it as hard as he could into the darkness there was a count of five and the boom that followed rattled the room all three of them averted their eyes but the colorful flash was bright enough to see through eyelids eelfinn screamed in pain and mat distinctly heard pings as weapons were dropped no doubt hands were raised to eyes here we go mat said spinning this is flaming insane thorn said mat kept going trying to feel for it where was that luck that way he said pointing in a random direction he opened his eyes in time to leap over the dark form of an eelfinn huddling on the ground mat and thorn followed and mat led them straight into the darkness he charged ahead until his friends were barely visible all he could see were those lines of yellow oh bloody ashes he thought if my luck fails me now they burst into a fivesided corridor the darkness vanishing around them they had not been able to see this corridor from the other room but here it was thorn let out a whoop mat you woodheaded shepherd for this ill let you play my harp i dont want to play your bloody harp mat said glancing over his shoulder but you can buy me a mug or two when were out he heard screams and screeches from the dark room that was one trick used up they would be expecting nightflowers now birgitte you were right he thought you probably walked past the corridor you needed several times never knowing it was only a few feet away never choose the card a man wants you to mat should have realized that it was one of the oldest cons in creation they hastened forward passing fivesided doorways leading into large starshaped caverns thorn and noal glanced into them but mat kept on straight forward this was the way his luck had sent them something was different from when he had visited before there was no dust on the floor to make footprints had they known he was coming and used the dust to confuse him or had they cleaned the place this time knowing that visitors might arrive who knew in a realm such as this it had been a long walk before or had it been a short one time blended here it seemed that they ran for many hours yet it also felt like moments and then the doorway was in front of them appearing like a striking adder it had not been there a moment before the rim of the opening was intricately carved wood with an impossible pattern of weaving vines that seemed to double back on one another and make no sense all three pulled to a halt mirrors noal said ive seen it before thats how they do it obscuring things with mirrors he sounded unnerved where did one hide mirrors in a bloody straight tunnel they were in the right place mat could smell it the stink of the eelfinn was strongest here he set his jaw and stepped through the doorway the room beyond was as he remembered it no columns here though the room was distinctly starshaped eight tips and only the one doorway those glowing yellow strips ran up the sharp ends of the room and eight empty pedestals stood black and ominous one at each point it was exactly the same except for the woman floating at its center she was clothed only in a fine white mist that shifted and shone around her the details of her figure obfuscated but not hidden her eyes were closed and her dark haircurly but no longer in perfect ringlets fluttered as if in a wind blowing up from beneath her hands rested atop her stomach and there was a strange bracelet of something that looked like aged ivory on her left wrist moiraine mat felt a surge of emotions worry frustration concern awe she was the one who had started this all he had hated her at times he also owed her his life she was the first one who had meddled yanking him this way and that yetlooking backhe figured that she had been the most honest about it of anyone who had used him unapologetic unyielding and selfless she had dedicated everything to protecting three foolish boys all ignorant of what the world would demand of them she had determined to take them to safety maybe train them a little whether they wanted it or not because they needed it light her motives seemed clear to him now that did not make him any less angry with her but it did make him grateful burn her but this was a confusing set of emotions those bloody foxeshow dare they keep her like this was she alive thorn and noal were staringnoal solemn thorn disbelieving so mat stepped forward to pull moiraine free as soon as his hands touched the mist however he felt a blazing pain he screamed pulling back shaking his hand its bloody hot mat said it he cut off as thorn stepped forward thom mat said warningly i dont care the gleeman said he stepped up to the mist reaching in his clothing beginning to steam his eyes watering from the pain he did not flinch he dug into that mist and took hold of her then pulled her free her weight sank into his arms but his aging limbs were strong and she looked frail enough that she must not have weighed much light mat had forgotten how small she was a good head shorter than he was thom knelt pulling off his gleemans cloak and wrapping her in it her eyes were still closed is she noal asked she lives thom said quietly i felt her heartbeat he took the bracelet off her arm it was in the shape of a man bent backward with his wrists bound to his ankles clothed in a strange suit of clothing it looks like a terangreal of some sort thom said tucking it into his cloak pocket i it is an angreal a voice proclaimed strong enough to be nearly saangreal it can be part of her price should you wish to pay it mat spun the pedestals were now occupied by eelfinn four males four females all eight wore white instead of blackwhite skirts with straps across the chests for the males and blouses for the females made from that disturbing pale substance that looked like skin mark your tongues mat said to thorn and noal trying to contain his worry speak amiss and theyll have you strung up claiming it was your own desire ask nothing of them the other two fell silent thorn holding moiraine close noal carrying his torch and staff warily pack over his shoulder this is the great hall mat said to the eelfinn the place called the chamber of bonds you must abide by the pacts you make here the bargain has been arranged one of the eelfinn males said smiling showing pointed teeth the other eelfinn leaned in breathing deeply as if smelling something or as if drawing something from mat and the others birgitte had said that they fed off emotion what bargain mat snapped glancing around at the pedestals burn you what bargain a price must be paid one said the demands must be met said another a sacrifice must be given this from one of the females she smiled more broadly than the others her teeth were pointed too i want the way out restored as part of the bargain mat said i want it back where it was and open again and im not bloody done negotiating so dont assume that this is my only request burn you it will be restored an eelfinn said the others leaned forward they could sense his desperation several of them seemed dissatisfied they didnt expect us to make it here mat thought they dont like to risk losing us i want you to leave that way out open until we get through mat continued no blocking it up or making it bloody vanish when we arrive and i want the way to be direct no changing rooms about a straight pathway and you bloody foxes cant knock us unconscious or try to kill us or anything like that they did not like that mat caught several of them frowning good they would see they were not negotiating with a child we take her mat said we get out these demands are expensive one of the eelfinn said what will you pay for these boons the price has been set another whispered from behind and it had been somehow mat knew a part of him had known from the first time he had read that note if he had never spoken to the aelfinn that first time would any of this have happened likely he would have died they had to tell the truth they had warned him of a payment to come for life for moiraine and he would have to pay it in that moment he knew that he would for he knew that if he did not the cost would be too great not just to thom not just to moiraine and not just to mat himself by what hed been told the fate of the world itself depended on this moment well burn me for a fool mat thought maybe i am a hero after all didnt that beat all ill pay it mat announced half the light of the world to save the world done one of the male eelfinn announced the eight creatures leapedas if onefrom their pedestals they enclosed him in a tightening circle like a noose quick supple and predatory mat thom cried struggling to hold the unconscious moiraine while reaching for one of his knives mat held up a hand toward thom and noal this must be done he said taking a few steps away from his friends the eelfinn passed them without sparing a glance the gold studs on the straps crossing the male eelfinns chests glittered in the yellow light all eight creatures were smiling wide noal raised his sword no mat yelled dont break this agreement if you do we all will die here the eelfinn stepped up in a tight circle around mat he tried to look at them all at once heart thudding louder and louder in his chest they were sniffing at him again drawing in deep breaths enjoying whatever it was they drew from him do it burn you mat growled but know this is the last youll get of me ill escape your tower and ill find a way to free my mind from you forever you wont have me matrim cauthon is not your bloody puppet we shall see an eelfinn male growled eyes lustful the creatures hand snapped forward toosharp nails glittering in the dim light he drove them directly into the socket around mats left eye then ripped the eye out with a snap mat screamed light but it hurt more than any wound taken in battle more than any insult or barb it was as if the creature had pressed its deceitful claws into his mind and soul mat fell to his knees spear clattering to the ground as he raised hands to his face he felt slickness on his cheek and he screamed again as his fingers felt the empty hole where his eye had been he threw his head back and yelled into the room bellowing in agony eelfinn watched with their horrid almosthuman faces eyes narrowed in ecstasy as they fed on something rising from mat an almost invisible vapor of red and white the savor one eelfinn exclaimed so long cried another how it twists around him said the one who had taken his eye how it spins scents of blood in the air and the gambler becomes the center of all i can taste fate itself mat howled his hat falling back as he looked through a single tearmuddled eye toward the darkness above his eye socket seemed to be on fire blazing he felt the blood and sera dry on his face then flake away as he screamed the eelfinn drew in deeper breaths looking drunk mat let out one final scream then he clenched his fists and shut his jaw though he could not stop a low groana growl of anger and pain from sounding deep within his throat one of the eelfinn males collapsed as if overwhelmed he was the one who had taken mats eye he clutched it in his hands curling around it the others stumbled away finding their way to pillars or the sides of the room resting against them for support noal dashed to mats side thorn following more carefully still cradling moiraine mat noal asked teeth still clenched against the pain mat forced himself to reach back and snatch his hat off the white floor he was not leaving his hat burn him it was a bloody good hat he stumbled to his feet your eye mat thorn said doesnt matter mat said burn me for a fool a bloody goatheaded fool he could barely think through the agony his other eye blinked tears of pain it really did seem he had lost half of the light of the world it was like looking through a window with one half blackened despite the blazing pain in his left socket he felt as he should be able to open his eye but he could not it was gone and no aes sedai channeling could replace that he pulled on his hat defiantly ignoring the pain he pulled the brim down on the left shading the empty socket then bent down and picked up his ashandarei stumbling but managing it i should have been the one to pay thorn said voice bitter not you mat you didnt even want to come it was my choice mat said and i had to do it anyway its one of the answers i was told by the aelfinn when i first came id have to give up half the light of the world to save the world bloody snakes to save the world thorn asked looking down at moiraines peaceful face her body wrapped in the patchwork cloak he had left his pack on the floor she has something yet to do mat said the pain was retreating somewhat we need her thorn burn me but its probably something to do with rand anyway this had to happen and if it hadnt thorn asked she said she saw it doesnt matter mat said turning toward the doorway the eelfinn were still overwhelmed one would think they had been the ones to lose an eye looking at those expressions mat set his pack on his shoulder leaving thorns where it sat he could not carry two not and be able to fight now ive seen something noal said looking over the room and its occupants something no man has ever seen i warrant should we kill them mat shook his head might break our bargain will they keep it thom asked not if they can wiggle out of it mat said then winced again light but his head hurt well he could not sit around and cry like he had lost his favorite foal lets go they made their way out of the grand hall noal carried a torch though he had reluctantly left his staff behind favoring his shortsword there were no openings in the hallway this time and mat heard noal muttering at that it felt right he had demanded a straight pathway back the eelfinn were liars and cheats but they seemed to be liars and cheats like the aes sedai mat had made his demands carefully this time rather than spouting out whatever occurred to him the hallway went on for a long while noal was growing more and more nervous mat kept on forward footsteps in time with his throbbing skull how would missing an eye change how he fought he would have to be more careful of that left side and he would have trouble judging distance now in fact he had that trouble nowwalls and floor were disturbingly hard to judge thom clutched moiraine close to his chest like a miser holding his gold what was she to him anyway mat had assumed that thom was along for the same reason that mat wasbecause it felt as if it needed to be done that tenderness in thorns face was not what mat had expected to see the hallway ended abruptly in a fivesided arch the room beyond appeared to be the one with the melted slag on the floor no signs of the fight before were visible no blood on the floor mat took a deep breath and led the way through he tensed as he saw eelfinn here crouching or standing in the shadows hissing and growling they did not move did not strike though some yipped quietly shadows made them seem even more like foxes if mat looked right at one he could almost mistake them for ordinary men and women but the way they moved in darkness sometimes on all fours no man walked like that with the anxious tension of a chained predator like an angry hound separated from you by a fence and fiercely eager to get to your throat but they held to their bargain none attacked and mat began to feel right good about himself once they reached the other side of the room he had beaten them last time they had gotten the better end but that was only because they had fought like cowards punching a man who did not know the fight had started this time he had been ready he had shown them that matrim cauthon was no fool they entered a corridor with the faintly glowing white steam at the top the floor was of those black interlocking triangles curved on the sides like scales mat began to breathe easier as they entered one of the rooms with the twisting steam rising from the corners though his eye socket still hurt like the nethers of a freshly gelded stallion he stopped in the center of the room but then continued forward he had demanded a straight pathway that was what he would get no doubling back and forth this time blood and bloody ashes mat said realizing something as he walked what thorn asked looking up from moiraine with alarm my dice mat said i should have included getting my dice back in the bargain but we discovered you dont need them to guide us its not about that mat grumbled i like those dice he pulled his hat down again looking down the hallway ahead was that motion he saw all the way in the distance a good dozen rooms away no it must be a trick of the shadows and the shifting steam mat noal said ive mentioned that my old tongue isnt what it once was but i think i understood what you said the bargain you made yes mat said only halflistening had he been speaking in the old tongue again burn him and what was that down the hallway well noal said you saidas part of the bargainsomething like you foxes cant knock us down or try to kill us or anything sure did mat said you said foxes mat noal said the foxes cant hurt us and they let us pass but what about the others noal asked the aelfinn if the eelfinn cant hurt us are the aelfinn required to leave us be as well the shadows in the fardistant corridor resolved into figures carrying long sinuous bronze swords with curving blades tall figures wearing layers of yellow cloth the hair on their heads straight and black dozens of them who moved with an unnatural grace eyes staring forward eyes with pupils that were vertical slits bloody and bloody ashes run mat yelled which direction noal asked alarmed any direction mat yelled so long as its away from them chapter the one left behind aloud boom shook the hallways making the entire structure rumble mat stumbled leaning against the wall for support as smoke and chips of rock sprayed out of the opening behind them he ducked his head around and looked down the hallway as thorn and noal ran onward thorn clutching moiraine noal had tossed his torch aside and gotten out a drum to try to soothe the aelfinn that had not worked and so mat had turned to the exploding cylinders and nightflowers light but the cylinders were deadly he saw corpses of aelfinn lying scattered through the hallway their glistening skin ripped and torn evillooking smoke steaming from their blood others slid out of doorways and alcoves pushing through the smoke they walked on two legs but they seemed to slither as they walked waving back and forth through the hallway their hissing growing angrier and angrier heart pounding mat charged after mat and noal they still following noal called what do you think mat said catching up to the other two light but those snakes are fasti mat and the other two burst into another room identical to all of the others vaguely offscale square walls steam rising from the corners black trianglepattern floor tiles there was no triangular opening at the center to get them out blood and bloody ashes mat glanced at the three ways out holding his ashandarei in sweaty hands they could not do the same trick as before bouncing back and forth between the same two rooms not with the aelfinn behind them he needed to invoke his luck he prepared to spin andwe have to keep moving noal yelled he had stopped by the doorway dancing from one toe to the next in anxiety mat if those snakes catch us mat could hear them behind hissing like the rush of a river he picked a direction and ran throw another cylinder thorn said that was the last one mat said and weve only got three nightflowers his pack was feeling light music doesnt work on them noal said throwing aside his drum theyre too angry mat cursed and lit a nightflower with a striker then tossed it over his shoulder the three of them barreled into another room then continued on directly through the doorway on the other side i dont know what way to go lad thorn said he sounded so winded were lost ive been picking directions at random mat said only you cant go backward thorn said thats probably the direction the luck wants us to go the nightflower boomed the explosion echoing through the corridors it was not nearly as great as that of the cylinders mat risked a glance over his shoulder seeing smoke and sparks fly through the tunnel the fire slowed the aelfinn but soon the more daring members of the band slithered through the smoke maybe we can negotiate thorn panted they look too angry noal said mat thorn said you mentioned that they knew about your eye they answered a question about it they told me id bloody give up half the light of the world mat said skull still throbbing i didnt want to know but they told me anyway what else did they say thorn asked anything that can be a clue how did you get out last time they threw me out mat said he and the others burst into another roomno doorwaythen dashed out the lefthand exit what thorn had said before was correct they probably needed to double back but they could not not with that nest of vipers following so closely they threw me out of the doorframe in the aelfinn realm mat said feeling winded it leads to the basement of the stone of tear then maybe we can find that thom said your luck mat have it take us to the aelfinn realm it might work all right he said closing his eye and spinning about mat pointed in a direction and opened his eye he was pointing directly toward the gang of aelfinn weaving up the corridor toward them bloody ashes mat cursed turning and running away from them picking another corridor at random thom joined him but was looking very wearied mat could take moiraine from him for a while but thom would be so tired he would not be able to fight the aelfinn were going to run them ragged as they had birgitte centuries ago in the next room thom stumbled to a halt drooping though he still held moiraine like all of the chambers this one had four ways out but the only way that mattered was one directly toward the aelfinn the one they couldnt take theres no winning this game thom said panting even if we cheat theres no winning thom mat said urgently he handed thom his asbandarei then picked up moiraine she was so light a good thing too otherwise thom would never have lasted as long as he had noal glanced at them then down the corridor the aelfinn would be on them in moments noal met mats eye give me your pack i need those nightflowers but no arguing noal said he dashed over and snagged one of the nightflowers it had a very short fuse he lit it and tossed it into the corridor the aelfinn were close enough that mat could hear them scream and hiss as they saw the firework the boom came sparks spurting out of the corridor and lighting the dark room where sparks came close to one of the rising columns of steam that steam shied back dancing away from the flames the air smelled strongly of smoke and sulphur light his socket was throbbing again now mat noal said mats ears still ringing from the blast give me the pack what are you doing mat said warily as noal took the pack then fished out the last nightflower you can see it mat noal said we need more time you have to get far enough ahead of those vipers that you can double back a few times let your luck work you out of this noal nodded to one of the corridors these corridors are narrow good choke points a man could stand there and only have to fight one or two at a time hed last maybe a few minutes noal thom said wheezing standing with his hands on his knees near mats asbandarei leaning against the wall you cant do this yes i can noal said he stepped up to the corridor beyond which the aelfinn gathered thom youre in no shape to fight mat youre the one whose luck can find the way out neither of you can stay but i can there will be no coming back for you mat said grimly as soon as we double back this flaming place will take us somewhere else noal met his eye that weathered face determined i know a price mat we knew this place would demand a price well ive seen a lot of things done a lot of things ive been used mat one too many times this is as good a place as any to meet the end mat stood up lifting moiraine then nodded in respect to noal come on thom but come on mat barked dashing to one of the other doorways thom hesitated then cursed and joined him carrying mats torch in one hand and his asbandarei in the other noal stepped into the corridor behind hefting his shorts word shapes moved in the smoke beyond him mat noal called glancing over his shoulder mat waved thom on but hesitated looking back if you ever meet a malkieri noal said you tell him jain farstrider died clean i will jain mat said may the light hold you noal turned back to face the aelfinn and mat left him there was another boom as a nightflower went off then mat heard noals voice echo down the corridor as he screamed a battlecry it was not in any tongue mat had ever heard he and thom entered another chamber thom was weeping but mat held his tears noal would die with honor once mat would have thought that kind of thinking foolishwhat good was honor if you were dead but he had too many memories of soldiers had spent too much time with men who fought and bled for that honor to discredit such notions now he closed his eye and spun moiraines weight almost unbalancing him he picked a direction and found himself pointing back the way they had come he charged down the corridor thom following when they reached the end of the corridor it did not open into the room where they had left noal this room was round and was filled with yellow columns made in the shape of enormous vines twisting around one another with an open cylinder of space at the center coiled lamp stands held globes of white that gave the room a soft light and the floor was tiled in the pattern of white and yellow strips spiraling out from the center it smelled pungently of dry snakeskin matrim cauthon youre no hero he thought glancing over his shoulder that man you left behind hes the hero light illumine you noal now what thorn asked he seemed to have recovered some of his strength so mat handed back moiraine and took his spear there were only two doorways in this room the one behind and one directly across the chamber but mat spun with his eye closed anyway the luck pointed them to the doorway opposite the one they had entered they took it the windows in this hallway looked out at the jungle and they were now down in the thick of it mat occasionally spotted those three spires the place where they had been moments ago the place where noal bled this is where you got your answers isnt it thorn asked mat nodded you think i could get some of those myself thom asked three questions any answers you like you dont want them mat said tugging down the brim of his hat trust me you dont they arent answers theyre threats promises we thom stopped beside him in thorns arms moiraine was beginning to stir she let out a soft groan eyes still closed but that was not what made mat freeze he could see another circular yellow room up ahead sitting in the middle of that room was a redstone doorway or what was left of it mat cursed running forward the floor was strewn with chunks of red rock rubble mat groaned dropping his spear and taking a few of the chunks holding them up the doorway had been shattered by something a blow of awesome force near the entrance to the room thom sank down holding the stirring moiraine he looked exhausted neither of them had a pack anymore mat had given his to noal and thom had left his behind and this room was a dead end with no other doorways burn this place mat shouted ripping off his hat staring up into the expansive endless darkness above burn you all snakes and foxes dark one take the lot of you you have my eye you have noal thats enough of a price for you thats too much of a price isnt the life of jain bloody farstrider enough to appease you you monsters his words rang and vanished with no reply the old gleeman squeezed his eyes shut holding moiraine he looked beaten ground down to nothing his hands were red and blistered from pulling her free his coat sleeves burned mat looked about desperate he tried spinning about with eye closed pointing when he opened his eye he was pointing at the center of the room the broken doorway it was then that he felt hope start to die inside of him it was a good try lad thorn said we did well better than we should have expected i wont give up mat said trying to defy the crushing sense inside of him well well retrace our steps find a way back to the place between the aelfinn and eelfinn the bargain said they had to leave that portal open well take it and get out of here thorn ill be burned if im going to die in here you still owe me a couple of mugs thorn opened his eyes and smiled but did not stand up he shook his head those drooping mustaches wagging and looked down at moiraine her eyes fluttered open thorn she whispered smiling i thought i heard your voice light but her voice took mat back to other times ages ago she glanced at him and mat dear matrim i knew you would come for me both of you i wish you hadnt but i knew you would rest moiraine thorn said softly well be out of here in two strums of a harp mat looked at her lying there helpless burn me im not going to let it end like this theyre coming lad thorn said i can hear them mat turned to look through the opening he could see what thorn had heard the aelfinn crept through the corridor sinuous and deadly they smiled and he could see fanglike incisors at the forefront of those smiles they could have been human save for those fangs and those eyes those unnatural slitted eyes they moved sleekly terrible eager no mat whispered there has to be a way think he told himself mat you fool there has to be a way out how did you escape the last time noal had asked that was no help thorn looking desperate unhooked his harp from his back he began to play it mat recognized the tune sweet whispers of tomorrow a mournful sound played for the fallen dead it was beautiful remarkably the music did seem to soothe the aelfinn they slowed the ones at the front beginning to sway to the beat of the melody as they walked they knew thorn played for his own funeral i dont know how i got out last time mat whispered i was unconscious i woke up being hanged rand cut me down he raised a hand to his scar his original aelfinn answers revealed nothing he knew about the daughter of the nine moons he knew about giving up half the light of the world he knew about rhuidean it all made sense no holes no questions except what did the eelfinn give you if i had my way mat whispered staring at the oncoming aelfinn i would want those holes filled the aelfinn slithered forward wearing those cloths of yellow wrapping their bodies thorns music spun in the air echoing the creatures approached with steady slow steps they knew they had their prey now the two aelfinn at the front carried swords of gleaming bronze dripping red poor noal thom began to sing oh how long were the days of a man when he strode upon a broken land mat listened memories blossoming in his mind thorns voice carried him to days long ago days in his own memories days of the memories of others days when he had died days when he had lived days when he had fought and when he had won i want those holes filled mat whispered to himself thats what i said the eelfinn obliged giving me memories that were not my own moiraines eyes had closed again but she smiled as she listened to thorns music mat had thought thom was playing for the aelfinn but now he wondered if he was playing for moiraine a last melancholy song for a failed rescue he sailed as far as a man could steer thom sang voice sonorous beautiful and he never wished to lose his fear i want those holes filled mat repeated so they gave me memories that was my first boon for the fear of man is a thing untold it keeps him safe and it proves him bold i asked something else not knowing it mat said i said i wanted to be free of aes sedai and the power they gave me the medallion for that another gift dont let fear make you cease to strive for that fear it proves you remain alive and and i asked for one more thing i said i wanted to be away from them and back to rhuidean the eelfinn gave me everything i asked for the memories to fill my holes the medallion to keep me free from the power and what they sent him back to rhuidean to hang but hanging was a price not an answer to his demands i will walk this broken road thorn sang voice growing louder and i will carry a heavy load they did give me something else mat whispered looking down at the ashandarei in his hands as the aelfinn began to hiss more loudly thus is our treaty written thus is agreement made it was carved on the weapon the blade had two ravens the shaft inscribed with words in the old tongue thought is the arrow of time memory never fades why had they given to him he had never questioned it but he had not asked for a weapon what was asked is given the price is paid no i didnt ask for a weapon i asked for a way out and they gave me this so come at me with your awful lies thorn bellowed the final line of the song im a man of truth and ill meet your eyes mat spun the ashandarei and thrust it into the wall the point sank into the notstone light sprayed out around it spilling free like blood gushing from a split vein mat screamed ramming it in farther powerful waves of light erupted from the wall he drew the ashandarei down at an angle making a slit he pulled the weapon up the other side cutting out a large inverse triangle of light the light seemed to thrum as it washed across him the aelfinn had reached the doorway by thorn but they hissed shying back from the powerful radiance mat finished by drawing a wavy line down the middle of the triangle he could barely see the light was so bright the section of the wall in front of him fell away revealing a glowing white passage that seemed to be cut out of steel well ill thorn whispered standing up the aelfinn screamed with highpitched anger they entered the room arms raised to shield their eyes wicked swords gripped in opposing hands get her out mat bellowed spinning to face the creatures he lifted the ashandarei using the butt end to smash the face of the first aelfinn go thorn grabbed moiraine then spared a glance at mat go mat repeated smashing the arm of another aelfinn thom leaped into the doorway and vanished mat smiled spinning among the aelfinn with his ashandarei laying into legs arms heads there were a lot of them but they seemed dazed by the light frenzied to get to him as he tripped the first few the others stumbled the creatures became a squirming mass of sinuous arms and legs hissing and spitting in anger several of those in back trying to crawl over the pile to reach him mat stepped back and tipped his hat to the creatures looks like the game can be won after all he said tell the foxes im mighty pleased with this key they gave me also you can all go rot in a flaming pit of fire and ashes you unwashed lumps on a pigs backside have a grand bloody day he held his hat and leaped through the opening all flashed white chapter something wrong a soft knock came at the post outside egwenes tent come she said shuffling through the papers on her desk gawyn slipped in hed given up his fine clothing choosing trousers of brown and a slightly lighter shirt a warders colorshifting cloak hung around his shoulders making him blend into his surroundings egwene herself was wearing a regal dress of green and blue his cloak rustled as he took a seat beside her desk elaynes army is crossing she sent word that shes on her way to come visit our camp excellent egwene said gawyn nodded but he was troubled such a useful thing that ball of emotions caused by the bond if shed known earlier the depth of his devotion to her shed have bonded him weeks ago what egwene asked setting aside her papers aybara he said he hasnt agreed to meet with you elayne said he might be difficult i think hes going to take althors side gawyn said you can see it in the way he set up camp apart from everyone else he sent messengers immediately to the aiel and to the tairens hes got a good army egwene a huge one with whitecloaks in it that doesnt sound likely to make him side with rand egwene said doesnt seem like it makes him likely to side with us either gawyn said egwene galad leads the whitecloaks your brother yes gawyn shook his head this many armies this many loyalties all rubbing against one another aybara and his force could be a spark that sends us all up like a firework it will be better when elayne settles in egwene said egwene what if althor isnt coming what if he did this to distract everyone from whatever else hes doing why would he do that egwene said hes already proven that he can avoid being found if he wants to she shook her head gawyn he knows he shouldnt break those seals a part of him does at least perhaps thats why he told meso i could gather resistance so i could talk him out of it gawyn nodded no further complaint or argument it was a wonder how hed changed he was as intense as ever yet less abrasive ever since that night with the assassins he had started doing as she asked not as a servant as a partner dedicated to seeing her will done it was a wonderful thing it was also important since the hall of the tower seemed determined to overturn their agreement to let her take charge of dealings with rand she looked down at her stack of papers not a few of which were letters of advice from sitters but they came to her rather than circumventing her that was good and she couldnt ignore them she had to make them continue to believe that working with her was for the best at the same time she couldnt let them assume that shed be blown over by a few good shouts such a delicate balance well lets go meet your sister then gawyn rose moving smoothly the three rings he wore on a chain around his neck rattled as he moved shed have to ask him again where hed gotten those he had been oddly closemouthed about them he held open the tent flaps for her and she stepped out outside the lateafternoon sun was hidden by gray clouds brynes soldiers worked busily on a palisade his army had swelled during the last few weeks and they dominated the eastern side of the wide forestrimmed grassland that had once been known as merrilor the ruins of the tower fortress that had stood here were strewn across the northern side of the field mosscovered nearly hidden by chokevine egwenes tent was on a rise and she could overlook the many armies encamped here is that one new she asked gesturing toward a smaller force that had taken up a position just below the ruins they came on their own gawyn said farmers mostly not really a true army most dont have swords pitchforks wood axes quarterstaffs i assume althor sent them they started wandering in yesterday curious egwene said they seemed a varied bunch with mismatched tents and little understanding of how to set up an army camp but there did seem to be some five or ten thousand of them have some scouts keep an eye on them gawyn nodded egwene turned and noted a procession moving through several gateways nearby setting up camp the lion of andor flew high above them and the soldiers marched in orderly rows a procession in red and white had left them and was marching toward egwenes camp the banner of the queen flying above them gawyn accompanied egwene across the yellowed grass to meet elayne the andoran queen had certainly taken her time only one day until the time specified by rand still she had come as had others aiel had accompanied darlin from tear and her persuasion had been enough to bring a large contingent of illianers who camped on the western side of the grass the cairhienin were elaynes now by reports and were coming through with the andorans and a large number of men from the band of the red hand egwene had sent an offer and a woman to offer traveling to king roedran of murandy but she was uncertain if he would come even without him however a considerable number of the worlds nations were represented here particularly since the flags of ghealdan and mayene could be seen among perrins armies she would have to contact their two rulers and see if she could sway them to her way of thinking but even if not surely what she had gathered would be enough to convince rand to change his plans light send it was enough she didnt want to think of what would happen if he forced her hand she walked down the pathway nodding back to sisters who nodded and accepted who curtsied soldiers who saluted and servants who bowed rand wouldit cant be gawyn said suddenly freezing in place gawyn she said frowning are you he took off at a run across the weedstrewn hill egwene looked after him with dissatisfaction he still had an impulsive streak why was he so upset suddenly it wasnt worry she could feel that it was confusion she hastened after him with as much speed as decorum would allow elaynes envoy had stopped in the dead grass gawyn was on his knees there before someone an older woman with redgold hair standing beside a smiling elayne who still sat her horse ah egwene thought her spies had delivered word of this rumor just last night but shed wanted to confirm it before speaking to gawyn morgase trakand lived egwene stood back for now once she stepped forward elayne would have to kiss her ring and the entire procession would bow that would spoil gawyns moment as she waited the clouds above grew thinner suddenly they split the dark thunderheads pulling back the sky became an open field of blue a deep pure expanse elaynes eyes opened wide and she turned on her horse looking at perrins section of camp hes come then egwene thought and the calm is here the brief moment of peace before the storm that destroys you give it a try emarin androl said standing with a small group inside a stand of trees near the border of the black tower grounds the stately nobleman concentrated holding the one power weaves sprang up around him he was remarkably skillful considering his short time practicing and expertly crafted the weave for a gateway instead of opening a hole in the air the weave unraveled and vanished emarin turned to the rest of them sweat streaming down his face forming those weaves seemed harder than before he said why wont they work evin said the young mans youthful face flushed with angeras if the problem with gateways was an insult androl shook his head arms folded the trees rustled leaves shivering many falling to the ground brown as if it were autumn that unnerved him hed spent some time working the ground during his journeys in life and had acquired a farmers sense for right and wrong regarding the land you try it again androl evin said youre always so good with gateways he glanced at the other three canler was the other one there the aging andoran farmer wore a deep frown of course canler often scowled at one thing or another androl closed his eyes emptying himself of all passions embracing the void saidin shone in there life and power he seized it drinking it in he opened his eyes to a world that was more vibrant could dead plants look both sickly and vibrant at the same time a strange juxtaposition made possible by saidin he focused making gateways came so much easier to him than other weaves did hed never understood why though he couldnt break even a small rock apart by channeling he could make a gateway large enough for a wagon to drive through logain had called it impressive taim had called it impossible this time androl pushed all of the power he had into his weave he understood gateways they made sense maybe it was the innate fondness he had for traveling for discovering new places and new arts the weaves came together he didnt notice any of the difficulty that emarin had mentioned however when the familiar slash of light should have come the weave began to unravel instead androl tried to hold to it pulling it together for a moment it looked like that would work then the threads slid from his grip evaporating the gateway never formed the other weaves ive tried all work evin said making a globe of light every one of them only gateways canler said with a grunt its like emarin said its as if something wants to keep us here in the black tower try them in other places inside the perimeter androl said but try not to let any of taims loyalists see what youre doing pretend to be surveying as taim ordered the men nodded the three of them hiking toward the east androl left the glade norley was standing beside the road looking about for him the short thickwaisted cairhienin man waved and approached androl met him halfway norley had an open inviting smile nobody ever suspected him of spying on them something androl had put to good use you spoke with mezar androl asked sure did norley replied shared a lunch with him norley waved at mishraile as they passed him supervising a group of soldiers practicing their weaves the goldenhaired man turned away dismissively and androl asked tense its not really mezar norley said oh it has mezars face right enough but its not him i can see it in his eyes trouble is whatever the thing is it has mezars memories talks right like him but the smile is wrong all wrong androl shivered it has to be him norley it aint i promise you that but it just aint the stout man said androl took a deep breath when mezar had returned a few days backexplaining that logain was well and that all would soon be resolved with taimandrol had begun to hope that there was a way out of this mess but something had seemed off about the man beyond that the mhael had made a great show of accepting mezar as a full ashaman the dragon had raised him and now mezaronce fiercely loyal to logain was spending his time with coteren and taims other lackeys this is getting bad androl norley said softly smiling and waving toward another group of practicing men id say its time for us to leave here whether or not its against orders wed never get past those guard posts androl said taim wont even let those aes sedai leave you heard the fit that plump one threw at the gates the other day taim doubles the guard at night and gateways dont work well we have to do something dont we i mean what if theyve got logain what then i z dont know go talk to the others who are loyal to logain im going to move us to a shared barrack them and their families well tell the mhael that we want to give more space for his new recruits then well post a guard at nights thats going to be a little obvious the division is already obvious androl said go do it sure thing but what are you going to do androl took a deep breath im going to find us some allies norley moved off to the left but androl continued down the path through the village it seemed that fewer and fewer people were showing him respect these days either they were afraid to do so or theyd thrown their lot in with taim packs of blackcoated man stood with arms folded watching him androl tried not to feel a chill as he walked he noted mezarhair graying at the sides skin a domani copperstanding with a group of lackeys the man smiled at him mezar hadnt ever been one who smiled easily androl nodded to him meeting his eyes and he saw what norley had seen something was deeply wrong something notquitealive inside those eyes this didnt seem to be a man but a parody of one a shadow stuffed inside human skin light help us all androl thought hurrying by he made his way to the southern side of the village to a group of small huts with bleached white wood walls and thatched roofs that needed to be replaced androl hesitated outside what was he doing this was where the women of the red ajah were staying they said theyd come to bond the ashaman but they hadnt done it so far that was obviously some kind of ruse perhaps theyd come here to try to find a way to gentle the entire lot but if that were the case then at least he could count on them not siding with taim when you stared down the gullet of a lionfish a pirates brig didnt seem so bad androl had heard the saying once while working a fishers boat in the south taking a deep breath he knocked the plump red answered the door she had the ageless face of an aes sedainot young really but also not old she eyed him i hear you want to leave the black tower androl said hoping he was doing the right thing has your mhael changed his mind she asked sounding hopeful she actually smiled a rare action for an aes sedai no androl said so far as i know he still forbids you to leave she frowned then androl lowered his voice youre not the only one who would like to leave this place aes sedai she looked at him her face becoming perfectly calm she doesnt trust me he thought odd how the mere lack of emotion could itself convey meaning desperate he took a step forward laying a hand on the frame of the door somethings wrong in this place something worse than you understand once long ago men and women who worked the power strove together they were stronger for it please hear me out she stood for a moment longer then pulled the door open come in quickly tarnathe woman i share this hut withis away we must be done before she returns androl stepped up into the building he didnt know whether he was stepping into the pirates brig or the lionfishs mouth but it would have to do chapter a rabbit for supper a rabbit for supper mat hit uneven ground blinded by the flash of light cursing he used the ashandarei to steady himself on the springy earth he smelled foliage dirt and rotting wood insects buzzed in the shade the whiteness faded and he found himself standing outside the tower of ghenjei he had halfexpected to reappear in rhuidean it seemed that the spear returned him to his world in the place where he had entered thom sat on the ground propping up moiraine who was blinking and looking about her mat spun on the tower and pointed upward i know youre watching he said thrilled he had made it he had bloody made it out alive i beat you you crusty bootleavings i matrim cauthon survived your traps ha he raised the ashandarei over his head and you gave me the way out chew on that bitterness for lunch you flaming burning misbegotten liars mat beamed slamming the spear down butt first onto the ground beside him he nodded nobody got the better of matrim cauthon they had lied to him told him vague prophecies and threatened him and then they had hanged him but mat came out ahead in the end who was the other moiraines soft voice asked from behind the one i saw but did not know he didnt make it out thom said somberly that dampened mats spirits their victory had come at a price a terrible one mat been traveling with a legend all this time he was a friend thorn said softly he was a great man mat said turning and pulling his ashandarei from where he had planted it in the dirt when you write the ballad of all this thom make sure you point out that he was the hero thorn glanced at mat then nodded knowingly the world will want to know what happened to that man light as mat thought about it thom had not been at all surprised to hear noal was jain farstrider he had known when had he figured it out why had he said nothing to mat some friend thom was mat just shook his head well were out one way or another but thom next time i want to do the bloody negotiating sneak up behind and hit me on the head with something large heavy and blunt then take over your request is noted lets move on a little way i dont like that bloody tower looming over me yes moiraine said you could say that they feed off emotion though i wouldnt call it feeding off so much as delighting in emotion they dont need it to survive but it pleases them greatly they sat in a wooded hollow a short walk from the tower next to the meadow beside the arinelle the thick tree canopy cooled the air and obscured their view of the tower mat sat on a small mossy boulder as thom made a fire he had a few of aludras strikers in his pocket as well as some packets of tea though there was nothing to warm the water in moiraine sat on the ground still wrapped in thorns cloak leaning back against a fallen log she held the cloak closed from the inside letting it envelop her completely save for her face and those dark curls she looked more a woman than mat rememberedin his memories she was like a statue always expressionless face like polished stone eyes like dark brown topaz now she sat with pale skin flushed cheeks hair curled and falling naturally around her face she was fetching save for that ageless aes sedai face yet that face showed far more emotion than mat remembered a look of fondness when she glanced at thom a faint shiver when she spoke of her time in the tower she glanced at mat and her eyes were still appraising yes this was the same moiraine humbled cast down that made her seem stronger to him for some reason thorn blew at a hesitant flame that curled a lock of smoke into the air before flickering out the wood was probably too wet thorn cursed its all right thom moiraine said softly i will be well i wont have you catching cold the moment we free you from that place thom said he got out a striker but suddenly the wood sparked and then fire sputtered to life as it consumed the toowet tinder mat glanced at moiraine who had a look of concentration on her face oh thom said then chuckled id forgotten about that nearly its all i can manage now on my own moiraine said grimacing light had moiraine grimaced before she been too highandmighty for that had she not or was mat remembering her wrong moiraine he was talking to flaming aloirainel though he had gone into the tower with the distinct purpose of rescuing her it seemed incredible that he was speaking with her it was like talking to well like talking to birgitte silverbow or jain farstrider mat smiled shaking his head what a world this was and what a strange place he had in it what did you mean by that moiraine thom asked nurturing the fire with some sticks its all you can manage the aelfinn and eelfinn she explained voice calm they savor and relish powerful emotions for some reason the effects of a taveren are even more intoxicating to them there are other things that they enjoy thom glanced at her frowning my power thom she explained i could hear them barking and hissing to one another as they fed on me both aelfinn and eelfinn in turn they have not often had an aes sedai to themselves it seems while draining my ability to channel they were fed twofoldmy sorrow at what i was losing and the power itself my capacity has been greatly reduced they claimed to have killed lanfear by draining her too quickly though i think they may have been trying to make me afraid a man was there once when they woke me he said i was not the one he wanted she hesitated then shivered sometimes i wished that they would drain me quickly and end my life the small camp grew silent save for the popping of the fire thom looked toward moiraine seeming helpless do not show me such sorrow thom merrilin moiraine said smiling i have felt terrible things but all people know such moments of despair i believed that you would come she removed her hand from the cloakrevealing a slender pale shoulder and collarboneand reached toward him he hesitated then took the hand and squeezed it moiraine looked to mat and you matrim cauthon not a simple farm lad any longer does your eye pain you much mat shrugged i would heal the wound if i could moiraine said but even were i still as strong as i once was i couldnt restore your eye she looked down releasing thorns hand and holding up her arm do you have the angreal oh yes thorn said fishing the strange bracelet out of his pocket he put it on her arm with this moiraine said i will be strong enough to at least take the pain away they placed it on me to let me draw more of the power to make their feeding more succulent i asked for it actually as one of my three demands i did not realize they would end up using it against me they gave you your three demands mat asked frowning i passed through the terangreal she said the ancient treaty held for both of us though with the doorway destroyed there was no simple return i knew from previous events that i would not escape unless you came for me no matter what my demands were or how carefully i worded them so i used them for the best what did you ask for mat asked beyond the angreal she smiled i shall keep that to myself for now you do have my thanks young matrim for my life then i guess were equal he said you saved me from life in the two rivers burn me if i havent had a nice gallop of it since then and your wound doesnt hurt so much actually it throbbed really really badly no need for you to waste strength on it still afraid of the one power i see he bristled afraid i should think you have good reason for that wariness she looked away from him but take care the most displeasing of events in our lives are sometimes for our good yes she was still moiraine quick with a moral and advice but perhaps she had a rightafter what she had been throughto lecture on suffering light she had known what she would have to go through and yet she had still pulled lanfear into that terangreal maybe mat was not the hero here and maybe noal was not either so what now thorn said settling back on a stump the warmth of the fire did feel good i must find rand moiraine said he will need my help i trust he has done well in my absence i dont know about that mat said hes half mad and the whole bloody world is at one anothers throats colors swirled rand eating a meal with min mat dispelled the image she raised an eyebrow but mat acknowledged hes got most everybody pointed toward the last battle and verin says he managed to clean the taint from saidin blessed light moiraine whispered how i dont know this changes everything she said smile deepening he has fixed what he once set wrong by the dragon came our pain and by the dragon was the wound repaired mat keeps saying we should be having a festival or something to celebrate thorn noted though maybe he only wants a good excuse to get drunk id say thats a certainty mat added anyway rands been busy elayne says hes got some kind of meeting arranged with the monarchs under him coming up soon elayne is queen then sure is her mother was killed by rahvin mat said so you told me i did when a lifetime ago matrim she replied smiling oh well rand finished him off so thats good and the other forsaken moiraine asked dont know mat said mats been too busy to keep track thom added hes been spending his time marrying the empress of the seanchan moiraine blinked in surprise you did what it was an accident mat said lamely hunching down you accidentally married the seanchan empress theyve got some odd customs mat said pulling his hat down strange folk he forced out a chuckle taveren moiraine said somehow he had known she would say that light well it was good to have her back mat was surprised at how strongly he felt that who would have thought it affection for an aes sedai from him well she said i can see there are many tales i need to be told but for now we will need to seek out rand he had also known that she would try to take charge you find him moiraine but ive got things to do in caemlyn dont mean to argue and all but thats the fact of it you should come there too elaynes more likely than anyone else to be able to help you with rand bloody colors as if having one eye were not bad enough he had those flaming visions bunching up his sight every time he so much as thought of ranburn those visions moiraine raised an eyebrow as he shook his head then blushed he probably looked like he was having a fit we shall see matrim she said then glanced at thorn who stood holding the packets of tea mat half thought he would try to boil water in his own hands if only to get some warm tea for moiraine thorn looked at her and she held out her hand again dearest thorn she said i would have you for a husband if youll have me for a wife what mat said standing up he raised a hand to his forehead nearly knocking his hat free what did you say hush mat thorn said he did not take moiraines offered hand you know ive never much liked women who can channel the one power moiraine you know it held me back in the past i dont have much of the power now dearest thorn without this angreal i wouldnt be strong enough to be raised accepted in the white tower i will throw it away if you wish it of me she lifted out her other hand barely staying modest she pulled off the angreal i dont think so moiraine thorn said kneeling down taking her hands no i wont rob you of anything but with it ill be very strong stronger in the power than before i was taken so be it then he said he put the bracelet back on her wrist ill marry you now if you wish it she smiled deeply mat stood stunned and whos going to bloody marry you he blurted out it sure as thunder isnt going to be me ill tell you that the two glanced at him thorn with a flat stare moiraine with a hint of a smile i can see why the seanchan woman had to have you mat she noted you certainly have a mind for romance i just he pulled off his hat holding it awkwardly looking back and forth between them i justburn me how did i miss this i was with the two of you most the time you were together when did you become affectionate you werent watching very closely thorn said he turned back to moiraine i assume youll want me as a warder too she smiled my previous gaidin has been appropriated by another by now i hope ill take the job thorn said though youll have to explain to elayne why her courtbard is someones warder he hesitated you think they can make one of those colorchanging cloaks with some patches on it well you two have gone bloody insane i see mat said thorn didnt you once tell me once that the two most painful places for you to be were tar valon and caemlyn now youre running headlong down the hillside that will end with you living in one or the other thorn shrugged times change i never have spent much of my time in tar valon moiraine said i think we shall enjoy traveling together thom merrilin should we survive the months to come she looked at mat you should not spurn the warder bond so easily mat the blessings it provides will be of great use to men in these days mat pulled his hat back on that may be true but youll never see me bloody trapped by one no offense moiraine i like you well enough but to be bonded to a woman isnt going to happen to matrim cauthon is that so thom asked amused didnt we determine that your tuon would be capable of channeling should she decide to learn mat froze bloody ashes thom was right but channeling would make her marathdamane she would not do such a thing he did not have to worry did he he must have made a face at the thought for thom chuckled and moiraine smiled again the two of them soon lost interest in sporting with mat however and turned to a soft discussion that affection in their eyes was true they did love each other light how had mat missed it he felt like a man who had brought a hog to a horse race he decided to make himself scarce leaving the two of them alone he went to scout the area where their gateway was supposed to appear it had better they had no supplies and mat did not fancy flagging down a ship and riding the long way back to caemlyn it was a short hike across the meadow to the banks of the arinelle once there he made a small cairn for noal then tipped his hat to it and sat down to wait and think moiraine was safe mat had survived though that bloody socket throbbed like nothing else he still was not certain if the aeifinn and eelfinn had strings around him or not but he had gone into their den and come out unscathed mostly anyway one eye lost what would that do to his ability to fight that worried him more than anything he had put on a brave front but inside he trembled what would tuon think of a husband missing an eye a husband who might not be able to defend himself he pulled out a knife flipping it then on a whim he tossed it behind him without looking he heard a soft screech then turned to see a rabbit slump to the ground speared by the idly thrown knife he smiled then turned back to the river there he noticed something caught between two large river stones along the shore it was an overturned cooking pot with a copper bottom barely used only dinged on the sides a couple of times it must have been dropped by a traveler walking up the river yes he might not be able to judge distance and he might not be able to see as well but luck worked better when you were not looking anyway he smiled wider then fetched the rabbithe would skin that for supperand plucked the pot out of the river moiraine would get her tea after all epilogue and after graendal hurriedly gathered what she needed from her new palace from her desk she took a small angreal mesaana had traded her in exchange for information it was in the shape of a small carved ivory knife shed lost her gold ring in althors attack graendal tossed it in her pack then snatched a sheaf of papers from her bed names of contacts eyesandearseverything shed managed to remember from what had been destroyed at natrins barrow waves surged against the rocks outside it was still dark only moments had passed since her last tool had failed her aybara surviving the battlefield that was supposed to have worked she was in her elegant manor house a few leagues from ebou dar now that semirhage was gone graendal had begun placing some strings around their new childlike empress shed have to abandon those schemes now perrin aybara had escaped she felt stunned plan after perfect plan had fallen in place and then hed escaped how the prophecy it had said that fool ham graendal thought stuffing the papers in her pack and that idiot whitecloak she was sweating she shouldnt be sweating she tossed a few terangreal from her desk into the pack then rifled her closet for changes of clothing he could find her anywhere in the world but perhaps one of the mirror realms of the portal stones yes there his connections were notshe turned arms full of silk and froze a figure stood in the room tall like a pillar dressed in black robes eyeless smiling lips the color of death graendal dropped to her knees throwing aside the clothing sweat ran down her temple onto her cheek graendal said the tall myrddraal his voice was terrible like the last whispers of a dying man you have failed graendal shaidar haran very bad i she said licking her dry lips how to twist this to a victory it is according to plan it is merely a i know your heart graendal i can taste your terror she squeezed her eyes shut mesaana has fallen shaidar haran whispered three chosen destroyed by your actions the design builds a lattice of failure a framework of incompetence i had nothing to do with mesaanas fall nothing graendal the dreamspike was there those who fought with mesaana said that they tried to move to draw the aes sedai to a location where their trap could be sprung they were not meant to fight in the white tower they could not leave because of you isam a tool given you the failure is yours graendal she licked her lips again her entire mouth had gone dry there had to be a way out i have a better plan more bold you will be impressed althor thinks i am dead and so i can no such a quiet voice but so horrible graendal found she could not speak something had taken her voice no shaidar haran continued this opportunity has been given to another but graendal you shall not be forgotten she looked up feeling a surge of hope those dead lips were smiling widely that eyeless gaze fixed on her she felt a horrible sinking feeling no shaidar haran said i shall not forget you and you shall not forget that which comes next she opened her eyes wide then howled as he reached for her the sky rumbled the grass around perrin shivered that grass was spotted black just as in the real world even the wolf dream was dying the air was full of scents that did not belong a fire burning blood drying the dead flesh of a beast he didnt recognize eggs rotting no he thought no it will not be he gathered his will those scents would vanish they did replaced with the scents of summer grass hedgehogs beetles moss mice bluewinged doves purple finches they appeared bursting to life in a circle around him he gritted his teeth the reality spread from him like a wave blackness fading from the plants above him the clouds undulated then parted sunlight streamed down the thunder calmed and hopper lives perrin thought he does i can smell his coat hear him loping in the grass a wolf appeared before him forming as if from mist silvery gray grizzled from years of life perrin thrilled in his power it was real and then he saw the wolfs eyes lifeless the scent turned stale and wrong perrin was sweating from the strain of concentrating so hard something within him became disjointed he was coming into the wolf dream too strongly to try to control this place absolutely was like trying to contain a wolf in a box he cried out falling to his knees the misty nothopper vanished in a puff and the clouds crashed back into place lightning exploded above him and the black spots flooded the grass the wrong scents returned perrin knelt sweat dripping from his brow one hand on the prickly brown and black grass too stiff perrin thought of faile in their tent back in the field of merrilor she was his home there was much to do rand had come as promised tomorrow he would face egwene thought of the real world grounded perrin keeping him from entering the wolf dream too strongly perrin stood he could do many things in this place but there were limits there were always limits seek boundless he will explain hoppers last sending to him what did it mean hopper had said that perrin had found the answer and yet boundless would explain that answer the sending had been awash with pain loss satisfaction at seeing perrin accept the wolf within him one final image of a wolf leaping proudly into the darkness coat shining scent determined perrin sent himself to the jehannah road boundless was often there with the remnants of the pack perrin reached out and found him a youthful male with brown fur and a lean build boundless teased him sending the image of perrin as a bull trampling a stag the others had left that image alone but boundless continued to remember boundless perrin sent hopper told me i needed you the wolf vanished perrin started then jumped to the place the wolf had beena cliff top several leagues from the road he caught the faintest scent of the wolfs destination and then went there an open field with a distant barn looking rotted boundless perrin sent the wolf crouched in a pile of brush nearby no no boundless sent fright and anger what did i do the wolf streaked away leaving a blur perrin growled and went down on all fours becoming a wolf young bull followed wind roaring in his ears he forced it to part before him increasing his speed further boundless tried to vanish but young bull followed appearing in the middle of the ocean he hit the waves water firm beneath his paws and continued after boundless without breaking stride boundlesss sendings flashed with images forests cities fields an image of perrin looking down at him standing outside a cage perrin froze becoming human again he stood upon the surging waves rising slowly into the air what that sending had been of a younger perrin and moiraine had been with him how could boundless have and suddenly perrin knew boundless was always found in ghealdan in the wolf dream noam he sent to the wolf now distant there was a start of surprise and then the mind vanished perrin moved to where boundless had been and there smelled a small village a barn a cage perrin appeared there boundless lay on the ground between two houses looking up at perrin boundless was indistinguishable from the other wolves for all that perrin now suspected the truth this was not a wolf he was a man boundless perrin said kneeling down on one knee to look the wolf in the eyes noam do you remember me of course you are young bull i mean do you remember me from before when we met in the waking world you sent an image of it noam opened his jaws and a bone appeared in them a large femur with some meat still on it he lay on his side chewing the bone you are young hull he sent stubborn do you remember the cage noam perrin asked softly sending the image the image of a man his filthy clothing half ripped off locked in a makeshift wooden cell by his family noam froze and his image wavered momentarily becoming that of a man the wolf image retuned immediately and he growled a low dangerous growl i do not bring up bad times to make you angry noam perrin said i well im like you i am a wolf yes perrin said but not always always no perrin said firmly once you were like me thinking it differently doesnt make it so here it does young bull noam sent here it does that was true why was perrin pressing this issue hopper had sent him here though why should boundless have the answer seeing him knowing who he was brought back all of perrins fears hed made peace with himself yet here was a man who had lost himself completely to the wolf this was what perrin had been terrified of this was what had driven the wedge between him and the wolves now that hed overcome that why would hopper send him here boundless scented his confusion the bone vanished and boundless set his head on his paws looking up at perrin noamhis mind almost gonehad thought only of breaking free and of killing hed been a danger to everyone around him there was none of that now boundless seemed at peace when theyd freed noam perrin had worried that the man would die quickly but he seemed alive and well alive at leastperrin couldnt judge much about his wellness from how the man looked in the wolf dream still boundlesss mind was far better now perrin frowned to himself moiraine had said there was nothing left of the man noam in the mind of the creature boundless perrin said what do you think of the world of men perrin was immediately hit with a rapid succession of images pain sadness dying crops pain a large stout man halfdrunk beating a pretty woman pain a fire fear sorrow vain perrin stumbled back boundless kept sending the images one after another a grave a smaller grave beside it as if for a child the fire getting larger a mannoams brother perrin recognized him though the man had not seemed dangerous at the timeenraged it was a flood too much perrin howled a lament for the life that noam had led a dirge of sorrow and pain no wonder this man preferred the life of a wolf the images stopped and boundless turned his head away perrin found himself gasping for breath a gift boundless sent by the light perrin whispered this was a choice wasnt it you picked the wolf intentionally boundless closed his eyes i always thought it would take me if i werent careful perrin said the wolf is peace boundless sent yes perrin said laying a hand on the wolfs head i understand this was the balance for boundless different from the balance for elyas and different from what perrin had found he understood this did not mean that the way he let himself lose control was not a danger but it was the final piece he needed to understand the final piece of himself thank you perrin sent the image of young bull the wolf and perrin the man standing beside one another atop a hill their scents the same he sent that image outward as powerfully as he could to boundless to the wolves nearby to any who would listen thank you dovieandi se tovya sagain olver said throwing the dice they rolled across the canvas floor of the tent olver smiled as they came up all black dots no wavy lines or triangles a lucky roll indeed olver moved his piece along the cloth board of the snakes and foxes game his father had made for him seeing that board made olver hurt every time it reminded him of his father but he kept his lip stiff and did not let anyone know warriors did not cry and besides someday he would find that shaido who had killed his father then olver would get his vengeance that was the sort of thing a man did when he was a warrior he figured mat would help once he was done with all of this business at the last battle he would owe olver by then and not just for all the time olver had spent being mats personal messenger for the information he had given him about the snakes and the foxes talmanes sat in a chair beside olver the stoic man was reading a book only paying mild attention to the game he was not nearly as good to play with as noal or thorn but then talmanes had not been sent to play with olver so much as watch over him mat did not want olver to know that he had gone to the tower of ghenjei leaving olver behind well olver was not a fool and he knew what was going on he was not mad not really noal was a good one to take and if mat could only take three well noal could fight better than olver so it made sense for him to go but next time olver would do the choosing and then mat had better be nice or he would be left behind your roll talmanes olver said talmanes mumbled something reaching over and tossing the handful of dice without losing his place in the book he was an allright fellow though a little stiff olver would not choose to have a man like him on a good night of drinking and hunting serving girls as soon as olver was old enough to go drinking and hunting serving girls he figured he would be ready in another year or so olver moved the snakes and foxes then picked up the dice for his next throw he had figured it all out there were a lot of shaido out there and he had no idea how to find the one who had killed his parents but the aelfinn they could answer questions he had heard mat talking about it so olver would go get his answers then track the man down easy as riding a horse he just had to train with the band beforehand so he could fight well enough to see done what needed to be done he threw his dice another full run olver smiled moving his piece back toward the center of the board half lost in thought and dreaming of the day when he would finally get his revenge like was proper he moved his piece across one more line then froze his piece was on the center spot i won he exclaimed talmanes looked up pipe lowering in his lips he cocked his head staring at the board burn me he muttered we must have counted wrong or counted wrong i mean talmanes looked stunned you cant win the game cant be won it just cant that was nonsense why would olver piay if it could not be won he smiled looking over the board the snakes and the foxes were within one toss of getting to his piece and making him lose but this time hed gotten all the way to the outside ring and back he had won good thing too he had started to think he would never manage it olver stood up stretching his legs talmanes climbed off his chair squatting down beside the game board and scratching his head smoke idly curling from the end of his pipe i hope mat will be back soon olver said im sure he will be talmanes said his task for her majesty shouldnt take much longer that was the lie they had told olverthat mat thorn and noal had gone off on some secret errand for the queen well that was just another reason that mat would owe him honestly mat could be so prim sometimes acting as if olver could not take care of himself olver shook his head strolling over to the side of the tent where a stack of mats papers sat waiting his return there peeking from between two of them olver noticed something interesting a bit of red like blood he reached up sliding a worn letter from between two of the sheets it was sealed closed with a dollop of wax olver frowned turning the small letter over he had seen mat carrying it about why had he not opened it that was downright rude setalle had worked hard to explain propriety to olver and while most of what she said made no sensehe just nodded his head so she would let him snuggle up to herhe was sure you were supposed to open letters people sent you then respond kindly he turned the letter over again then shrugged and broke the seal olver was mats personal messenger all official and everything it was no wonder mat sometimes forgot things but it was olvers job to take care of him now that lopin was gone mat would need extra taking care of it was one of the reasons olver stayed with the band he was not sure what mat would do without him he unfolded the letter and removed a small stiff piece of paper inside he frowned trying to make out the words he was getting pretty good with reading mostly because of setalle but some words gave him trouble he scratched his head talmanes he said you should probably read this whats that the man looked up from the game here now olver what are you doing that wasnt to be opened the man rose striding over to snatch the paper from olvers fingers but olver began lord mat didnt open it talmanes said he knew that it would get us tied up in white tower politics he waited all those weeks now look what youve done i wonder if we can stuff it back inside talmanes olver said insistently i think its important talmanes hesitated he seemed torn for a moment then held the letter so that the light shone better on it he read it quickly with the air of a boy stealing food from a street vendors cart and stuffing into his mouth before he could be discovered talmanes whispered a curse under his breath he read the letter again then cursed more loudly he grabbed his sword from the side of the room and dashed out of the tent he left the letter on the floor olver looked it over again sounding out the words he had not understood the first time matrim if you are opening this then i am dead i had planned to return and release you of your oath in a single day there are many potential complications to my next task however and a large chance that i will not survive i needed to know that id left someone behind who could see this work done fortunately if theres one thing i believe i can rely upon it is your curiosity i suspect you lasted a few days before opening this letter which is long enough for me to have returned if i were going to therefore this task falls upon you there is a waygate in caemlyn it is guarded barricaded and thought secure it is not an enormous force of shadowspawn moves through the ways toward caemlyn i do not know when they left exactly but there should be time to stop them you must reach the queen and persuade her to destroy the waygate it can be done walling it up will not suffice if you cannot destroy it the queen must bring all of her forces to bear upon guarding the location if you fail in this i fear caemlyn will be lost before the month is out sincerely verin mathwin olver rubbed his chin what was a waygate he thought he had heard mat and thorn talking about them he took the letter and walked out of the tent talmanes stood just outside the tent looking eastward toward caemlyn a reddish haze hung on the horizon a glow over the city one larger than had been there on other nights light preserve us talmanes whispered its burning the city is burning he shook his head as if clearing it then raised a call to arms trollocs in caemlyn the city is at war to arms men burn me we have to get into the city and salvage those dragons if those fall irito the shadows hands were all dead men olver lowered the letter in his fingers eyes wide trollocs in caemlyn it would be like the shaido in cairhien only worse he hurried into mats tent stumbling over the rug and threw himself to his knees beside his sleeping pallet he hurriedly pulled at the stitchings on the side the wool stuffed inside bulged out through the opening he reached in fishing about and pulled free the large knife he had hidden there it was wrapped in a leather sheath he had taken it from one of the bands quartermasters bergevin when he had not been looking after cairhien olver had sworn to himself that he would never prove himself a coward again he gripped the large knife in two hands knuckles white then dashed out of the tent it was time to fight barriga stumbled as he crawled past the stump of a fallen tree blood from his brow dripped onto the ground and the darkspeckled nettles seemed to soak it in feeding upon his life he raised a trembling hand to his brow the bandage was soaked through no time to stop no time he forced himself to his feet and hastily scrambled through the brown sawleaf he tried not to look at the black spots on the plants the blight hed entered the blight but what else was he to do the trollocs rampaged to the south the towers had all fallen kandor itself had fallen barriga tripped and fell to the earth he groaned rolling over gasping he was in a trough between two hills north of heeth tower his once fine clothingcoat and vest of rich velvetwas ragged and stained with blood he stank of smoke and when he closed his eyes he saw the trollocs washing over his caravan slaughtering his servants and soldiers theyd all fallen thum yang both dead light they were all dead barriga shuddered how had he come to this he was just a merchant i should have listened to rebek he thought smoke rose from heeth tower behind that was where his caravan had been going how could this be happening he needed to keep moving east hed make for arafel the other borderlands would couldnt have fallen could they he climbed up a hillside hands pulling against short coiling chokevine like worms between his fingers he was growing woozy he reached the hilltop the world was spinning he fell there blood seeping from his bandage something moved in front of him he blinked those clouds above were a tempest in front of him three figures wearing black and brown approached with a sleek grace myrddraal no he blinked the tears and blood from his eyes no those werent myrddraal they were men wearing red veils over their faces they walked at a crouch scanning the terrain short spears worn on their backs light be praised he whispered aiel hed been in andor when rand althor had come everyone knew the aiel followed the dragon reborn he had tamed them im safe one of the aiel stepped up to barriga why was the mans veil red that was unusual the aiels dark eyes were glassy and hard the aiel man undid his veil and revealed a smiling face the mans teeth had been filed to points his smile broadened and he slipped a knife from his belt barriga stuttered looking at that horrific maw and the glee in this mans eyes as he reached in for the kill these werent aiel they were something else something terrible rand althor the dragon reborn sat quietly in his dream he breathed in the cool chill air white clouds floated gently around him kissing his skin with their condensation his throne for the night was a flat boulder on a mountain slope he looked down through the clouds at a narrow valley this wasnt the real location it wasnt even the world of dreams that place where hed fought forsaken the place hed been told was so dangerous no this was one of his own ordinary dreams he controlled them now they were a place he could find peace to think protected by wards while his body slept beside min in their new camp surrounded by borderlanders set up on the field of merrilor egwene was there with armies marshaled he was ready for that hed counted on it on the morrow theyd hear his demands not what he would demand to keep him from breaking the sealshe was going to do that regardless of what egwene said no these would be the demands he made on the monarchs of the world in exchange for going to shayol ghul to face the dark one he wasnt certain what hed do if they refused him theyd find it very difficult to do so sometimes it could be useful to have a reputation for being irrational he breathed in deeply peaceful here in his dreams the hills grew green as he remembered them in that nameless valley below sheltered in the mountains of mist hed begun a journey not his first and not his last but perhaps the most important one of the most painful for certain and now i come back he whispered ive changed again a man is always changing he felt a unity in returning here to the place where hed first confronted the killer inside him the place where hed first tried to flee from those whom he should have kept near he closed his eyes enjoying tranquility calmness harmony in the distance he heard screams of pain rand opened his eyes what had that been he stood up spinning this place was created of his own mind protected and safe it couldntthe scream came again distant he frowned and raised a hand the scene around him vanished puffing away into mist he stood in blackness there he thought he was in a long corridor of dark wood paneling he walked down it boots thumping that screaming it shook his peace someone was in pain they needed him rand began to run he reached a doorway at the end of the hall the doors russet wood was knobbed and ridged like the thick roots of an ancient tree rand seized the handlejust another rootand wrenched the door open the vast room beyond was pure black lightless like a cavern deep beneath the ground the room seemed to suck in the light and extinguish it the screaming voice was inside it was weak as if it were being smothered by the darkness rand entered the darkness swallowed him it seemed to pull the life out of him like a hundred leeches sucking blood from his veins he pressed onward he couldnt distinguish the direction of the cries so he moved along the walls they felt like bone smooth but occasionally cracked the room was round as if he stood inside the bowl of an enormous skull there a faint light ahead a single candle on the ground illuminating a floor of black marble rand hurried toward it yes there was a figure there huddled against the bonewhite wall it was a woman with silvery hair wearing a thin white shift she was weeping now her figure shaking and trembling rand knelt beside her the candle flickering from his motion how had this woman gotten into his dream was she someone real or was this a creation of his mind he laid a hand on her shoulder she glanced toward him eyes red face a mask of pain tears dripping from her chin please she pled please he has me who are you you know me she whispered taking his hand clinging to it im sorry im so sorry he has me he flays my soul anew each eve oh please let it stop the tears flowed more freely i dont know you rand said i those eyes those beautiful terrible eyes rand gasped releasing her hand the face was different but he did know that soul mierin youre dead i saw you die she shook her head i wish i were dead i wish it please he grinds my bones and snaps them like twigs then leaves me to die before healing me just enough to keep me alive he she cut off jerking what her eyes opened wide and she spun toward the wall no she screamed he comes the shadow in every mans mind the murderer of truth no she spun reaching for rand but something towed her backward the wall broke away and she tumbled into the darkness rand jumped forward reaching for her but he was too late he caught a glimpse of her before she vanished into the blackness below rand froze staring into that pit he sought calmness but he could not find it instead he felt hatred concern andlike a seething viper within himdesire that had been mierin eronaile a woman he had once called the lady selene a woman most people knew by the name shed taken upon herself lanfear a cruel dry wind blew across lans face as he looked down at a corrupt landscape tarwins gap was a wide pass rocky speckled with blighted knifegrass this had once been part of malkier he was home again for the last time masses of trollocs clustered on the other side of the gap thousands tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands easily ten times the number of men lan had gathered during his march across the borderlands normally men held at their side of the gap but lan could not do that he had come to attack to ride for malkier andere rode up beside him on his left young kaisel of kandor on his right he could feel something distant that had given him strength recently the bond had changed the emotions had changed he could still feel nynaeve so wonderful caring and passionate in the back of his mind he should have been pained to know that now she would suffer when he died instead of another however that closeness to hera final closenessbrought him strength the hot wind seemed too dry it smelled of dust and dirt and drew the moisture from his eyes forcing him to blink it is fitting kaisel said what lan asked that we should strike here yes lan said perhaps kaisel said but it is bold it shows the shadow that we will not be beaten down that we will not cower this is your land lord mandragoran my land he thought yes it was he nudged mandarb forward i am allan mandragoran lan bellowed lord of the seven towers defender of the wall of first fires bearer of the sword of the thousand lakes i was once named aanallein but i reject that title for i am alone no more fear me shadow fear me and know i have returned for what is mine i may be a king without a land but i am still a kingl he roared raising his sword a cheer rose from behind him he sent a final powerful sensation of love to nynaeve as he kicked mandarb into a gallop his army charged behind him each man mounteda charge of kandori arafellin shienarans and saldaeans but most of all malkieri lan wouldnt be surprised if hed drawn every living man from his former kingdom who could still hold a weapon they rode cheering brandishing swords and leveling lances their hooves were thunder their voices a crash of waves their pride stronger than the blazing sun they were twelve thousand strong and they charged a force of at least one hundred and fifty thousand this day will be remembered in honor lan thought galloping forward the last charge of the golden crane the fall of the malkieri the end had come they would meet it with swords raised lo it shall come upon the world that the prison of the greatest one shall grow weak like the limbs of those who crafted it once again his glorious cloak shall smother the pattern of all things and the great lord shall stretch forth his hand to claim what is his the rebellious nations shall be laid barren their children caused to weep there shall be none but him and those who have turned their eyes to his majesty in that day when the oneeyed fool travels the halls of mourning and the first among vermin lifts his hand to bring freedom to him who will destroy the last days of the fallen blacksmiths pride shall come yea and the broken wolf the one whom death has known shall fall and be consumed by the midnight towers and his destruction shall bring fear and sorrow to the hearts of men and shall shake their very will itself and then shall the lord of the evening come and he shall take our eyes for our souls shall bow before him and he shall take our skin for our flesh shall serve him and he shall take our lips for only him will we praise and the lord of the evening shall face the broken champion and shall spill his blood and bring us the darkness so beautiful let the screams begin o followers of the shadow beg for your destruction from the prophecies of the shadow the end of the thirteenth book of the wheel of time
