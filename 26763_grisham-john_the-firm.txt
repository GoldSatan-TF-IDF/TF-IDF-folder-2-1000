the senior partner studied the resume for the hundredth time and again found nothing he disliked about mitchell y mcdeere at least not on paper he had the brains the ambition the good looks and he was hungry with his background he had to be he was married and that was mandatory had never hired an unmarried lawyer and it frowned heavily on divorce as well as womanizing and drinking drug testing was in the contract he had a degree in accounting passed the cpa exam the first time he took it and wanted to be a tax lawyer which of course was a requirement with a tax firm he was white and had never hired a black they managed this by being secretive and clubbish and never soliciting job applications other firms solicited and hired blacks this firm recruited and remained lily white plus was in memphis of all places and the top blacks wanted new york or washington or chicago mcdeere was a male and there were no women in that mistake had been made in the midseventies when they recruited the number one grad from harvard who happened to be a she and a wizard at taxation she lasted four turbulent years and was killed in a car wreck he looked good on paper he was their top choice in fact for this year there were no other prospects the list was very short it was mcdeere or no one the managing partner royce mcknight studied a dossier labeled mitchell y mcdeereharvard an inch thick with small print and a few photographs it had been prepared by some excia agents in a private intelligence outfit in bethesda they were clients of and each year did the investigating for no fee it was easy work they said checking out unsuspecting law students they learned for instance that he preferred to leave the northeast that he was holding three job offers two in new york and one in chicago and that the highest offer was and the lowest was he was in demand he had been given the opportunity to cheat on a securities exam during his second year he declined and made the highest grade in the class two months ago he had been offered cocaine at a law school party he said no and left when everyone began snorting he drank an occasional beer but drinking was expensive and he had no money he owed close to in student loans he was hungry royce mcknight flipped through the dossier and smiled mcdeere was their man lamar quin was thirtytwo and not yet a partner he had been brought along to look young and act young and project a youthful image for bendini lambert locke which in fact was a young firm since most of the partners retired in their late forties or early fifties with money to burn he would make partner in this firm with a sixfigure income guaranteed for the rest of his life lamar could enjoy the twelvehundreddollar tailored suits that hung so comfortably from his tall athletic frame he strolled nonchalantly across the thousanddollaraday suite and poured another cup of decaf he checked his watch he glanced at the two partners sitting at the small conference table near the windows precisely at twothirty someone knocked on the door lamar looked at the partners who slid the resume and dossier into an open briefcase all three reached for their jackets lamar buttoned his top button and opened the door mitchell mcdeere he asked with a huge smile and a hand thrust forward yes they shook hands violently nice to meet you mitchell im lamar quin my pleasure please call me mitch he stepped inside and quickly surveyed the spacious room sure mitch lamar grabbed his shoulder and led him across the suite where the partners introduced themselves they were exceedingly warm and cordial they offered him coffee then water they sat around a shiny mahogany conference table and exchanged pleasantries mcdeere unbuttoned his coat and crossed his legs he was now a seasoned veteran in the search of employment and he knew they wanted him he relaxed with three job offers from three of the most prestigious firms in the country he did not need this interview this firm he could afford to be a little overconfident now he was there out of curiosity and he longed for warmer weather oliver lambert the senior partner leaned forward on his elbows and took control of the preliminary chitchat he was glib and engaging with a mellow almost professional baritone at sixtyone he was the grandfather of the firm and spent most of his time administering and balancing the enormous egos of some of the richest lawyers in the country he was the counselor the one the younger associates went to with their troubles mr lambert also handled the recruiting and it was his mission to sign mitchell y mcdeere are you tired of interviewing asked oliver lambert not really its part of it yes yes they all agreed seemed like yesterday they were interviewing and submitting resumes and scared to death they wouldnt find a job and three years of sweat and torture would be down the drain they knew what he was going through all right may i ask a question mitch asked certainly sure anything why are we interviewing in this hotel room the other firms interview on campus through the placement office good question they all nodded and looked at each other and agreed it was a good question perhaps i can answer that mitch said royce mcknight the managing partner you must understand our firm we are different and we take pride in that we have fortyone lawyers so we are small compared with other firms we dont hire too many people about one every other year we offer the highest salary and fringes in the country and im not exaggerating so we are very selective we selected you the letter you received last month was sent after we screened over two thousand thirdyear law students at the best schools only one letter was sent we dont advertise openings and we dont solicit applications we keep a low profile and we do things differently thats our explanation fair enough what kind of firm is it tax some securities real estate and banking but eighty percent is tax work thats why we wanted to meet you mitch you have an incredibly strong tax background whyd you go to western kentucky asked oliver lambert simple they offered me a full scholarship to play football had it not been for that college wouldve been impossible tell us about your family why is that important its very important to us mitch royce mcknight said warmly they all say that thought mcdeere okay my father was killed in the coal mines when i was seven years old my mother remarried and lives in florida i had two brothers rusty was killed in vietnam i have a brother named ray mcdeere where is he im afraid thats none of your business he stared at royce mcknight and exposed a mammoth chip on his shoulder the dossier said little about ray im sorry the managing partner said softly mitch our firm is in memphis lamar said does that bother you not at all im not fond of cold weather have you ever been to memphis no well have you down soon youll love it mitch smiled and nodded and played along were these guys serious how could he consider such a small firm in such a small town when wall street was waiting how are you ranked in your class mr lambert asked top five not top five percent but top five that was enough of an answer for all of them top five out of three hundred he could have said number three a fraction away from number two and within striking distance of number one but he didnt they came from inferior schoolschicago columbia and vanderbilt as he recalled from a cursory examination of martindalehubbelps legal directory he knew they would not dwell on academics why did you select harvard actually harvard selected me i applied at several schools and was accepted everywhere harvard offered more financial assistance i thought it was the best school still do youve done quite well here mitch mr lambert said admiring the resume the dossier was in the briefcase under the table thank you ive worked hard you made extremely high grades in your tax and securities courses thats where my interest lies weve reviewed your writing sample and its quite impressive thank you i enjoy research they nodded and acknowledged this obvious lie it was part of the ritual no law student or lawyer in his right mind enjoyed research yet without fail every prospective associate professed a deep love for the library tell us about your wife royce mcknight said almost meekly they braced for another reprimand but it was a standard nonsacred area explored by every firm her name is abby she has a degree in elementary education from western kentucky we graduated one week and got married the next for the past three years shes taught at a private kindergarten near boston college and is the marriage were very happy weve known each other since high school what position did you play asked lamar in the direction of less sensitive matters quarterback i was heavily recruited until i messed up a knee in my last high school game everyone disappeared except western kentucky i played off and on for four years even started some as a junior but the knee would never hold up howd you make straight as and play football i put the books first i dont imagine western kentucky is much of an academic school lamar blurted with a stupid grin and immediately wished he could take it back lambert and mcknight frowned and acknowledged the mistake sort of like kansas state mitch replied they froze all of them froze and for a few seconds stared incredulously at each other this guy mcdeere knew lamar quin went to kansas state he had never met lamar quin and had no idea who would appear on behalf of and conduct the interview yet he knew he had gone to martindalehubbelps and checked them out he had read the biographical sketches of all of the fortyone lawyers in and in a split second he had recalled that lamar quin just one of the fortyone had gone to kansas state damn they were impressed i guess that came out wrong lamar apologized no problem mitch smiled warmly it was forgotten oliver lambert cleared his throat and decided to get personal again mitch our firm frowns on drinking and chasing women were not a bunch of holy rollers but we put business ahead of everything we keep low profiles and we work very hard and we make plenty of money i can live with all that we reserve the right to test any member of for drug use i dont use drugs good whats your religious affiliation methodist good youll find a wide variety in our firm catholics baptists episcopalians its really none of our business but we like to know we want stable families happy lawyers are productive lawyers thats why we ask these questions mitch smiled and nodded hed heard this before the three looked at each other then at mitch this meant they had reached the point in the interview where the interviewee was supposed to ask one or two intelligent questions mitch recrossed his legs money that was the big question particularly how it compared to his other offers if it isnt enough thought mitch then it was nice to meet you fellas if the pay is attractive then we can discuss families and marriages and football and churches but he knew like all the other firms they had to shadowbox around the issue until things got awkward and it was apparent they had discussed everything in the world but money so hit them with a soft question first what type of work will i do initially they nodded and approved of the question lambert and mcknight looked at lamar this answer was his we have something similar to a twoyear apprenticeship although we dont call it that well send you all over the country to tax seminars your education is far from over youll spend two weeks next winter in washington at the american tax institute we take great pride in our technical expertise and the training is continual for all of us if you want to pursue a masters in taxation well pay for it as far as practicing law it wont be very exciting for the first two years youll do a lot of research and generally boring stuff but youll be paid handsomely how much lamar looked at royce mcknight who eyed mitch and said well discuss the compensation and other benefits when you come to memphis i want a ballpark figure or i may not come to memphis he smiled arrogant but cordial he spoke like a man with three job offers the partners smiled at each other and mr lambert spoke first okay a base salary of eighty thousand the first year plus bonuses eightyfive the second year plus bonuses a lowinterest mortgage so you can buy a home two country club memberships and a new bmw you pick the color of course they focused on his lips and waited for the wrinkles to form on his cheeks and the teeth to break through he tried to conceal a smile but it was impossible he chuckled thats incredible he mumbled eighty thousand in memphis equaled a hundred and twenty thousand in new york did the man say bmw his mazda hatchback had a million miles on it and for the moment had to be jumpstarted while he saved for a rebuilt starter plus a few more fringes well be glad to discuss in memphis suddenly he had a strong desire to visit memphis wasnt it by the river the smile vanished and he regained his composure he looked sternly importantly at oliver lambert and said as if hed forgotten about the money and the home and the bmw tell me about your firm fortyone lawyers last year we earned more per lawyer than any firm our size or larger that includes every big firm in the country we take only rich clientscorporations banks and wealthy people who pay our healthy fees and never complain weve developed a specialty in international taxation and its both exciting and very profitable we deal only with people who can pay how long does it take to make partner on the average ten years and its a hard ten years its not unusual for our partners to earn half a million a year and most retire before theyre fifty youve got to pay your dues put in eightyhour weeks but its worth it when you make partner lamar leaned forward you dont have to be a partner to earn six figures ive been with seven years and went over a hundred thousand four years ago mitch thought about this for a second and figured by the time he was thirty he could be well over a hundred thousand maybe close to two hundred thousand at the age of thirty they watched him carefully and knew exactly what he was calculating whats an international tax firm doing in memphis he asked that brought smiles mr lambert removed his reading glasses and twirled them now thats a good question mr bendini founded in he had been a tax lawyer in philadelphia and had picked up some wealthy clients in the south he got a wild hair and landed in memphis for twentyfive years he hired nothing but tax lawyers and prospered nicely down there none of us are from memphis but we have grown to love it its a very pleasant old southern town by the way mr bendini died in how many partners in twenty active we try to keep a ratio of one partner for each associate thats high for the industry but we like it again we do things differently all of our partners are multimillionaires by the age of fortyfive royce mcknight said all of them yes sir we dont guarantee it but if you join our firm put in ten hard years make partner and put in ten more years and youre not a millionaire at the age of fortyfive youll be the first in twenty years thats an impressive statistic its an impressive firm mitch oliver lambert said and were very proud of it were a closeknit fraternity were small and we take care of each other we dont have the cutthroat competition the big firms are famous for were very careful whom we hire and our goal is for each new associate to become a partner as soon as possible toward that end we invest an enormous amount of time and money in ourselves especially our new people it is a rare extremely rare occasion when a lawyer leaves our firm it is simply unheard of we go the extra mile to keep careers on track we want our people happy we think it is the most profitable way to operate i have another impressive statistic mr mcknight added last year for firms our size or larger the average turnover rate among associates was twentyeight percent at bendini lambert locke it was zero year before zero its been a long time since a lawyer left our firm they watched him carefully to make sure all of this sank in each term and each condition of the employment was important but the permanence the finality of his acceptance overshadowed all other items on the checklist they explained as best they could for now further explanation would come later of course they knew much more than they could talk about for instance his mother lived in a cheap trailer park in panama city beach remarried to a retired truck driver with a violent drinking problem they knew she had received from the mine explosion squandered most of it then went crazy after her oldest son was killed in vietnam they knew he had been neglected raised in poverty by his brother ray whom they could not find and some sympathetic relatives the poverty hurt and they assumed correctly it had bred the intense desire to succeed he had worked thirty hours a week at an allnight convenience store while playing football and making perfect grades they knew he seldom slept they knew he was hungry he was their man would you like to come visit us asked oliver lambert when asked mitch dreaming of a black i with a sunroof the ancient mazda hatchback with three hubcaps and a badly cracked windshield hung in the gutter with its front wheels sideways aiming at the curb preventing a roll down the hill abby grabbed the door handle on the inside yanked twice and opened the door she inserted the key pressed the clutch and turned the wheel the mazda began a slow roll as it gained speed she held her breath released the clutch and bit her lip until the unmuffled rotary engine began whining with three job offers on the table a new car was four months away she could last for three years they had endured poverty in a tworoom student apartment on a campus covered with porsches and little mercedes convertibles for the most part they had ignored the snubs from the classmates and coworkers in this bastion of east coast snobbery they were hillbillies from kentucky with few friends but they had endured and succeeded quite nicely all to themselves she preferred chicago to new york even for a lower salary largely because it was farther from boston and closer to kentucky but mitch remained noncommittal characteristically weighing it all carefully and keeping most of it to himself she had not been invited to visit new york and chicago with her husband and she was tired of guessing she wanted an answer she parked illegally on the hill nearest the apartment and walked two blocks their unit was one of thirty in a twostory redbrick rectangle abby stood outside her door and fumbled through the purse looking for keys suddenly the door jerked open he grabbed her yanked her inside the tiny apartment threw her on the sofa and attacked her neck with his lips she yelled and giggled as arms and legs thrashed about they kissed one of those long wet tenminute embraces with groping and fondling and moaning the kind they had enjoyed as teenagers when kissing was fun and mysterious and the ultimate my goodness she said when they finished whats the occasion do you smell anything mitch asked she looked away and sniffed well yes what is it chicken chow mein and egg foo yung from wong boys okay whats the occasion plus an expensive bottle of chablis its even got a cork what have you done mitch follow me on the small painted kitchen table among the legal pads and casebooks sat a large bottle of wine and a sack of chinese food they shoved the law school paraphernalia aside and spread the food mitch opened the wine and filled two plastic wineglasses i had a great interview today he said who remember that firm in memphis i received a letter from last month yes you werent too impressed thats the one im very impressed its all tax work and the money looks good how good he ceremoniously dipped chow mein from the container onto both plates then ripped open the tiny packages of soy sauce she waited for an answer he opened another container and began dividing the egg foo yung he sipped his wine and smacked his lips how much she repeated more than chicago more than wall street she took a long deliberate drink of wine and eyed him suspiciously her brown eyes narrowed and glowed the eyebrows lowered and the forehead wrinkled she waited how much eighty thousand first year plus bonuses eightyfive second year plus bonuses he said this nonchalantly while studying the celery bits in the chow mein eighty thousand she repeated eighty thousand babe eighty thousand bucks in memphis tennessee is about the same as a hundred and twenty thousand bucks in new york who wants new york she asked plus a lowinterest mortgage loan that wordmortgagehad not been uttered in the apartment in a long time in fact she could not at the moment recall the last discussion about a home or anything related to one for months now it had been accepted that they would rent some place until some distant unimaginable point in the future when they achieved affluence and would then qualify for a large mortgage she sat her glass of wine on the table and said matteroffactly i didnt hear that a lowinterest mortgage loan loans enough money to buy a house its very important to these guys that their associates look prosperous so they give us the money at a much lower rate you mean as in a home with grass around it and shrubs yep not some overpriced apartment in manhattan but a threebedroom house in the suburbs with a driveway and a twocar garage where we can park the bmw the reaction was delayed by a second or two but she finally said bmw whose bmw ours babe our bmw leases a new one and gives us the keys its sort of like a signing bonus for a firstround draft pick its worth another five thousand a year we pick the color of course i think black would be nice what do you think no more clunkers no more leftovers no more handmedowns she said as she slowly shook her head he crunched on a mouthful of noodles and smiled at her she was dreaming he could tell probably of furniture and wallpaper and perhaps a pool before too long and babies little darkeyed children with light brown hair and there are some other benefits to be discussed later i dont understand mitch why are they so generous i asked that question theyre very selective and they take a lot of pride in paying top dollar they go for the best and dont mind shelling out the bucks their turnover rate is zero plus i think it costs more to entice the top people to memphis it would be closer to home she said without looking at him i dont have a home it would be closer to your parents and that worries me she deflected this as she did most of his comments about her family youd be closer to ray he nodded bit into an egg roll and imagined her parents first visit that sweet moment when they pulled into the driveway in their wellused cadillac and stared in shock at the new french colonial with two new cars in the garage they would burn with envy and wonder how the poor kid with no family and no status could afford all this at twentyfive and fresh out of law school they would force painful smiles and comment on how nice everything was and before long mr sutherland would break down and ask how much the house cost and mitch would tell him to mind his own business and it would drive the old man crazy theyd leave after a short visit and return to kentucky where all their friends would hear how great the daughter and the soninlaw were doing down in memphis abby would be sorry they couldnt get along but wouldnt say much from the start they had treated him like a leper he was so unworthy they had boycotted the small wedding have you ever been to memphis he asked once when i was a little girl some kind of convention for the church all i remember is the river they want us to visit us you mean im invited yes they insist on you coming when couple of weeks theyll fly us down thursday afternoon for the weekend i like this firm already the fivestory building had been built a hundred years earlier by a cotton merchant and his sons after the reconstruction during the revival of cotton trading in memphis it sat in the middle of cotton row on front street near the river through its halls and doors and across its desks millions of bales of cotton had been purchased from the mississippi and arkansas deltas and sold around the world deserted neglected then renovated time and again since the first war it had been purchased for good in by an aggressive tax lawyer named anthony bendini he renovated it yet again and began filling it with lawyers he renamed it the bendini building he pampered the building indulged it coddled it each year adding another layer of luxury to his landmark he fortified it sealing doors and windows and hiring armed guards to protect it and its occupants he added elevators electronic surveillance security codes closedcircuit television a weight room a steam room locker rooms and a partners dining room on the fifth floor with a captivating view of the river in twenty years he built the richest law firm in memphis and indisputably the quietest secrecy was his passion every associate hired by was indoctrinated in the evils of the loose tongue everything was confidential salaries perks advancement and most especially clients divulging firm business the young associates were warned could delay the awarding of the holy graila partnership nothing left the fortress on front street wives were told not to ask or were lied to the associates were expected to work hard keep quiet and spend their healthy paychecks they did without exception with fortyone lawyers was the fourth largest in memphis its members did not advertise or seek publicity they were clannish and did not fraternize with other lawyers their wives played tennis and bridge and shopped among themselves bendini lambert locke was a big family of sorts a rather rich family at am on a friday limo stopped on front street and mr mitchell y mcdeere emerged he politely thanked the driver and watched the vehicle as it drove away his first limo ride he stood on the sidewalk next to a streetlight and admired the quaint picturesque yet somehow imposing home of the quiet bendini firm it was a far cry from the gargantuan steelandglass erections inhabited by new yorks finest or the enormous cylinder he had visited in chicago but he instantly knew he would like it it was less pretentious it was more like himself lamar quin walked through the front door and down the steps he yelled at mitch and waved him over he had met them at the airport the night before and checked them into the peabodythe souths grand hotel good morning mitch how was your night they shook hands like lost friends very nice its a great hotel we knew youd like it everybody likes the peabody they stepped into the front foyer where a small billboard greeted mr mitchell y mcdeere the guest of the day a welldressed but unattractive receptionist smiled warmly and said her name was sylvia and if he needed anything while he was in memphis just let her know he thanked her lamar led him to a long hallway where he began the guided tour he explained the layout of the building and introduced mitch to various secretaries and paralegals as they walked in the main library on the second floor a crowd of lawyers circled the mammoth conference table and consumed pastries and coffee they became silent when the guest entered oliver lambert greeted mitch and introduced him to the gang there were about twenty in all most of the associates in and most barely older than the guest the partners were too busy lamar had explained and would meet him later at a private lunch he stood at the end of the table as mr lambert called for quiet gentlemen this is mitchell mcdeere youve all heard about him and here he is he is our number one choice this year our number one draft pick so to speak he is being romanced by the big boys in new york and chicago and who knows where else so we have to sell him on our little firm here in memphis they smiled and nodded their approval the guest was embarrassed he will finish at harvard in two months and will graduate with honors hes an associate editor of the harvard law review this made an impression mitch could tell he did his undergraduate work at western kentucky where he graduated summa cum laude this was not quite as impressive he also played football for four years starting as quarterback his junior year now they were really impressed a few appeared to be in awe as if staring at joe namath the senior partner continued his monologue while mitch stood awkwardly beside him he droned on about how selective they had always been and how well mitch would fit in mitch stuffed his hands in his pockets and quit listening he studied the group they were young successful and affluent the dress code appeared to be strict but no different than new york or chicago dark gray or navy wool suits white or blue cotton buttondowns medium starch and silk ties nothing bold or nonconforming maybe a couple of bow ties but nothing more daring neatness was mandatory no beards mustaches or hair over the ears there were a couple of wimps but good looks dominated mr lambert was winding down lamar will give mitch a tour of our offices so youll have a chance to chat with him later lets make him welcome tonight he and his lovely and i do mean lovely wife abby will eat ribs at the rendezvous and of course tomorrow night is dinner at my place ill ask you to be on your best behavior he smiled and looked at the guest mitch if you get tired of lamar let me know and well get someone more qualified he shook hands with each one of them again as they left and tried to remember as many names as possible lets start the tour lamar said when the room cleared this of course is a library and we have identical ones on each of the first four floors we also use them for large meetings the books vary from floor to floor so you never know where your research will lead you we have two fulltime librarians and we use microfilm and microfiche extensively as a rule we dont do any research outside the building there are over a hundred thousand volumes including every conceivable tax reporting service thats more than some law schools if you need a book we dont have just tell a librarian they walked past the lengthy conference table and between dozens of rows of books a hundred thousand volumes mitch mumbled yeah we spend almost half a million a year on upkeep supplements and new books the partners are always griping about it but they wouldnt think of cutting back its one of the largest private law libraries in the country and were proud of it its pretty impressive we try to make research as painless as possible you know what a bore it is and how much time can be wasted looking for the right materials youll spend a lot of time here the first two years so we try to make it pleasant behind a cluttered workbench in a rear corner one of the librarians introduced himself and gave a brief tour of the computer room where a dozen terminals stood ready to assist with the latest computerized research he offered to demonstrate the latest truly incredible software but lamar said they might stop by later hes a nice guy lamar said as they left the library we pay him forty thousand a year just to keep up with the books its amazing truly amazing thought mitch the second floor was virtually identical to the first third and fourth the center of each floor was filled with secretaries their desks file cabinets copiers and the other necessary machines on one side of the open area was the library and on the other was a configuration of smaller conference rooms and offices you wont see any pretty secretaries lamar said softly as they watched them work it seems to be an unwritten firm rule oliver lambert goes out of his way to hire the oldest and homeliest ones he can find of course some have been here for twenty years and have forgotten more law than we learned in law school they seem kind of plump mitch observed almost to himself yeah its part of the overall strategy to encourage us to keep our hands in our pockets philandering is strictly forbidden and to my knowledge has never happened and if it does who knows the secretary would be fired of course and i suppose the lawyer would be severely punished it might cost a partnership no one wants to find out especially with this bunch of cows they dress nice dont get me wrong we hire only the best legal secretaries and we pay more than any other firm in town youre looking at the best not necessarily the prettiest we require experience and maturity lambert wont hire anyone under thirty one per lawyer yes until youre a partner then youll get another and by then youll need one nathan locke has three all with twenty years experience and he keeps them jumping wheres his office fourth floor its offlimits mitch started to ask but didnt the corner offices were twentyfive by twentyfive lamar explained and occupied by the most senior partners power offices he called them with great expectation they were decorated to each individuals taste with no expense spared and vacated only at retirement or death then fought over by the younger partners lamar flipped a switch in one and they stepped inside closing the door behind them nice view huh he said as mitch walked to the windows and looked it the river moving ever so slowly beyond riverside drive how do you get this office mitch asked as he admired a barge inching under the bridge leading to arkansas takes time and when you get here youll be very wealthy and very busy and you wont have time to enjoy the view whose is it victor milligan hes head of tax and a very nice man originally from new england hes been here for twentyfive years and calls memphis home lamar stuck his hands in his pockets and walked around the room the hardwood floors and ceilings came with the building over a hundred years ago most of the building is carpeted but in a few spots the wood was not damaged youll have the option of rugs and carpet when you get here i like the wood what about that rug some kind of antique persian i dont know its history the desk was used by his greatgrandfather who was a judge of some sort in rhode island or so he says hes full of crap and you never know when hes blowing smoke where is he vacation i think did they tell you about vacations no you get two weeks a year for the first five years paid of course then three weeks until you become a partner then you take whatever you want has a chalet in vail a cabin on a lake in manitoba and two condos on seven mile beach on grand cayman island theyre free but you need to book early partners get priority after that its first come the caymans are extremely popular in its an international tax haven and a lot of our trips are written off i think milligans there now probably scuba diving and calling it business through one of his tax courses mitch had heard of the cayman islands and knew they were somewhere in the caribbean he started to ask exactly where but decided to check it himself only two weeks he asked uh yeah is that a problem no not really s in new york are offering at least three he spoke like a discriminating critic of expensive vacations he wasnt except for the threeday weekend they referred to as a honeymoon and an occasional drive through new england he had never participated in a vacation and had never left the country you can get an additional week unpaid mitch nodded as though this was acceptable they left milligans office and continued the tour the hallway ran in a long rectangle with the attorneys offices to the outside all with windows sunlight views those with views of the river were more prestigious lamar explained and usually occupied by partners there were waiting lists the conference rooms libraries and secretarial desks were on the inside of the hallway away from the windows and distractions the associates offices were smallerfifteen by fifteen but richly decorated and much more imposing than any associates offices he had seen in new york or chicago spent a small fortune on design consultants lamar said money it seemed grew on trees the younger lawyers were friendly and talkative and seemed to welcome the interruption most gave brief testimonials to the greatness of and of memphis the old town kind of grows op you they kept telling him but it takes time they too had been recruited by the big boys in washington and on wall street and they had no regrets the partners were busier but just as nice he had been carefully selected he was told again and again and he would fit in it was his kind of firm they promised to talk more during lunch an hour earlier kay quin had left the kids with the baby nurse and the maid and met abby for brunch at the peabody she was a smalltown girl much like abby she had married lamar after college and lived in nashville for three years while he studied law at vanderbilt lamar made so much money she quit work and had two babies in fourteen months now that she had retired and finished her childbearing she spent most of her time with the garden club and the heart fund and the country club and the pta and the church despite the money and the affluence she was modest and unpretentious and apparently determined to stay that way regardless of her husbands success abby found a friend after croissants and eggs benedict they sat in the lobby of the hotel drinking coffee and watching the ducks swim in circles around the fountain kay had suggested a quick tour of memphis with a late lunch near her home maybe some shopping have they mentioned the lowinterest loan she asked yes at the first interview theyll want you to buy a house when you move here most people cant afford a house when they leave law school so loans you the money at a lower rate and holds the mortgage how low i dont know its been seven years since we moved here and weve bought another house since then itll be a bargain believe me will see to it that you own a home its sort of an unwritten rule why is it so important several reasons first of all they want you down here this firm is very selective and they usually get who they want but memphis is not exactly in the spotlight so they have to offer more also is very demanding especially on the associates theres pressure overwork eightyhour weeks and time away from home it wont be easy on either of you and knows it the theory is that a strong marriage means a happy lawyer and a happy lawyer is a productive lawyer so the bottom line is profits always profits and theres another reason these guysall guys no womentake a lot of pride in their wealth and everyone is expected to look and act affluent it would be an insult to if an associate was forced to live in an apartment they want you in a house and after five years in a bigger house if we have some time this afternoon ill show you some of the partners homes when you see them you wont mind the eightyhour weeks im used to them now thats good but law school doesnt compare with this sometimes theyll work a hundred hours a week during tax season abby smiled and shook her head as if this impressed her a great deal do you work no most of us dont work the money is there so were not forced to and we get little help with the kids from our husbands of course working is not forbidden forbidden by whom i would hope not abby repeated the word forbidden to herself but let it pass kay sipped her coffee and watched the ducks a small boy wandered away from his mother and stood near the fountain do you plan to start a family kay asked maybe in a couple of years babies are encouraged by whom why should care if we have children again stable families a new baby is a big deal around the office they send flowers and gifts to the hospital youre treated like a queen your husband gets a week off but hell be too busy to take it they put a thousand dollars in a trust fund for college its a lot of fun sounds like a big fraternity its more like a big family our social life revolves around and thats important because none of us are from memphis were all transplants thats nice but i dont want anyone telling me when to work and when to quit and when to have children dont worry theyre very protective of each other but does not meddle im beginning to wonder relax abby is like a family theyre great people and memphis is a wonderful old town to live in and raise kids the cost of living is much lower and life moves at a slower pace youre probably considering the bigger towns so did we but ill take memphis any day over the big cities do i get the grand tour thats why im here i thought wed start downtown then head out east and look at the nicer neighborhoods maybe look at some houses and eat lunch at my favorite restaurant sounds like fun kay paid for the coflee as she had the brunch and they left the peabody in the quin familys new mercedes the dining room as it was simply called covered the west end of the fifth floor above riverside drive and high above the river in the distance a row of eightfoot windows lined the wall and provided a fascinating view of the tugboats paddlewheelers barges docks and bridges the room was protected turf a sanctuary for those lawyers talented and ambitious enough to be called partners in the quiet bendini firm they gathered each day for lunches prepared by jessie frances a huge temperamental old black woman and served by her husband roosevelt who wore white gloves and an oddfitting faded wrinkled handmedown tux given to him by mr bendini himself shortly before his death they also gathered for coffee and doughnuts some mornings to discuss firm business and occasionally for a glass of wine in the late afternoon to celebrate a good month or an exceptionally large fee it was for partners only and maybe an occasional guest such as a bluechip client or prospective recruit the associates could dine there twice a year only twiceand records were keptand then only at the invitation of a partner adjacent to the dining room was a small kitchen where jessie frances performed and where she had cooked the first meal for mr bendini and a few others twentysix years earlier for twentysix years she had cooked southern food and ignored requests to experiment and try dishes she had trouble pronouncing dont eat it if you dont like it was her standard reply judging from the scraps roosevelt collected from the tables the food was eaten and enjoyed immensely she posted the weeks menu on monday asked that reservations be made by ten each day and held grudges for years if someone canceled or didnt show she and roosevelt worked four hours each day and were paid a thousand each month mitch sat at a table with lamar quin oliver lambert and royce mcknight the entree was prime rib served with fried okra and boiled squash she laid off the grease today mr lambert observed its delicious mitch said is your system accustomed to grease yes they cook this way in kentucky i joined this firm in mr mcknight said and i come from new jersey right out of suspicion i avoided most southern dishes as much as possible everything is battered and fried in animal fat right then mr bendini decides to open up this little cafe he hires jessie frances and ive had heartburn for the past twenty years fried ripe tomatoes fried green tomatoes fried eggplant fried okra fried squash fried anything and everything one day victor milligan said too much hes from connecticut right and jessie frances had whipped up a batch of fried dill pickles can you imagine fried dill pickles milligan said something ugly to roosevelt and he reported it to jessie frances she walked out the back door and quit stayed gone for a week roosevelt wanted to work but she kept him at home finally mr bendini smoothed things over and she agreed to return if there were no complaints but she also cut back on the grease i think well all live ten years longer its delicious said lamar as he buttered another roll its always delicious added mr lambert as roosevelt walked by her food is rich and fattening but we seldom miss lunch mitch ate cautiously engaged in nervous chitchat and tried to appear completely at ease it was difficult surrounded by eminently successful lawyers all millionaires in their exclusive lavishly ornamented dining suite he felt as if he was on hallowed ground lamars presence was comforting as was roosevelts when it was apparent mitch had finished eating oliver lambert wiped his mouth rose slowly and tapped his tea glass with his spoon gentlemen could i have your attention the room became silent as the twenty or so partners turned to the head table they laid their napkins down and stared at the guest somewhere on each of their desks was a copy of the dossier two months earlier they had voted unanimously to make him their number one pick they knew he ran four miles a day did not smoke was allergic to sulfites had no tonsils had a blue mazda had a crazy mother and once threw three interceptions in one quarter they knew he took nothing stronger than aspirin even when he was sick and that he was hungry enough to work a hundred hours a week if they asked they liked him he was goodlooking athleticlooking a mans man with a brilliant mind and a lean body as you know we have a very special guest today mitch mcdeere he will soon graduate with honors from harvard hear hear said a couple of harvard alumni yes thank you he and his wife abby are staying at the peabody this weekend as our guests mitch will finish in the top five out of three hundred and has been heavily recruited we want him here and i know you will speak to him before he leaves tonight he will have dinner with lamar and kay quin and then tomorrow night is the dinner at my place you are all expected to attend mitch smiled awkwardly at the partners as mr lambert rambled on about the greatness of when he finished they continued eating as roosevelt served bread pudding and coffee kays favorite restaurant was a chic east memphis hangout for the young affluent a thousand ferns hung from everywhere and the jukebox played nothing but early sixties the daiquiris were served in tall souvenir glasses one is enough kay warned im not much of a drinker they ordered the quiche of the day and sipped daiquiris does mitch drink very little hes an athlete and very particular about his body an occasional beer or glass of wine nothing stronger how about lamar about the same he really discovered beer in law school but he has trouble with his weight frowns on drinking thats admirable but why is it their business because alcohol and lawyers go together like blood and vampires most lawyers drink like fish and the profession is plagued with alcoholism i think it starts in law school at vanderbilt someone was always tapping a keg of beer probably the same at harvard the job has a lot of pressure and that usually means a lot of booze these guys arent a bunch of teetotalers mind you but they keep it under control a healthy lawyer is a productive lawyer again profits i guess that makes sense mitch says theres no turnover its rather permanent i cant recall anyone leaving in the seven years weve been here the moneys great and theyre careful about whom they hire they dont want anyone with family money im not sure i follow they wont hire a lawyer with other sources of income they want them young and hungry its a question of loyalty if all your money comes from one source then you tend to be very loyal to that source demands extreme loyalty lamar says theres never talk of leaving theyre all happy and either rich or getting that way and if one wanted to leave he couldnt find as much money with another firm theyll offer mitch whatever it takes to get you down here they take great pride in paying more why no female lawyers they tried it once she was a real bitch and kept the place in an uproar most women lawyers walk around with chips on their shoulders looking for fights theyre hard to deal with lamar says theyre afraid to hire one because they couldnt fire her if she didnt work out with affirmative action and all the quiche arrived and they declined another round of daiquiris hundreds of young professionals crowded under the clouds of ferns and the restaurant grew festive smokey robinson sang softly from the jukebox ive got a great idea kay said i know a realtor lets call her and go look at some houses what kind of houses for you and mitch for the newest associate at bendini lambert locke she can show you several in your price range i dont know our price range id say a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand the last associate bought in oakgrove and im sure he paid something like that abby leaned forward and almost whispered how much would the monthly payments be i dont know but youll be able to afford it around a thousand a month maybe a little more abby stared at her and swallowed hard the small apartments in manhattan were renting for twice that lets give her a call as expected royce mcknights office was a power one with a great view it was in one of the prized corners on the fourth floor down the hall from nathan locke lamar excused himself and the managing partner asked mitch to have a seat at a small conference table next to the sofa a secretary was sent for coffee mcknight asked him about his visit so far and mitch said he was quite impressed mitch i want to nail down the specifics of our offer certainly the base salary is eighty thousand for the first year when you pass the bar exam you receive a fivethousanddollar raise not a bonus but a raise the exam is given sometime in august and youll spend most of your summer reviewing for it we have our own bar study courses and youll receive extensive tutoring from some of the partners this is done primarily on firm time as you know most firms put you to work and expect you to study on your own time not us no associate of this firm has ever flunked the bar exam and were not worried about you breaking with tradition eighty thousand initially up to eightyfive in six months once youve been here a year youll be raised to ninety thousand plus youll get a bonus each december based on the profits and performance during the prior twelve months last year the average bonus for associates was nine thousand as you know profit sharing with associates is extremely rare for law firms any questions about the salary what happens after the second year your base salary is raised about ten percent a year until you become a partner neither the raises nor the bonuses are guaranteed they are based on performance fair enough as you know it is very important to us that you buy a home it adds stability and prestige and were very concerned about these things especially with our associates provides a lowinterest mortgage loan thirty years fixed rate nonassumable should you decide to sell in a few years its a oneshot deal available only for your first home after that youre on your own what kind of rate as low as possible without running afoul with the irs current market rate is around ten ten and a half we should be able to get you a rate of seven to eight percent we represent some banks and they assist us with this salary youll have no trouble qualifying in fact will sign on as a guarantor if necessary thats very generous mr mcknight its important to us and we dont lose any money on the deal once you find a house our real estate section handles everything all you have to do is move in what about the bmw mr mcknight chuckled we started that about ten years ago and its proved to be quite an inducement its very simple you pick out a bmw one of the smaller ones we lease it for three years and give you the keys we pay for tags insurance maintenance at the end of three years you can buy it from the leasing company for the fair market value its also a oneshot deal thats very tempting we know mr mcknight looked at his legal pad we provide complete medical and dental coverage for the entire family pregnancies checkups braces everything paid entirely by mitch nodded but was not impressed this was standard we have a retirement plan second to none for every dollar you invest matches it with two provided however you invest at least ten percent of your base pay lets say you start at eighty and the first year you set aside eight thousand kicks in sixteen so youve got twentyfour after the first year a money pro in new york handles it and last year our retirement earned nineteen percent not bad invest for twenty years and youre a millionaire at fortyfive just off retirement one stipulation if you bail out before twenty years you lose everything but the money you put in with no income earned on that money sounds rather harsh no actually its rather generous find me another firm or company matching two to one there are none to my knowledge its our way of taking care of ourselves many of our partners retire at fifty some at fortyfive we have no mandatory retirement and some work into their sixties and seventies to each his own our goal is simply to ensure a generous pension and make early retirement an option how many retired partners do you have twenty or so youll see them around here from time to time they like to come in and have lunch and a few keep office space did lamar cover vacations yes good book early especially for vail and the caymans you buy the air fare but the condos are free we do a lot of business in the caymans and from time to time well send you down for two or three days and write the whole thing off those trips are not counted as vacation and youll get one every year or so we work hard mitch and we recognize the value of leisure mitch nodded his approval and dreamed of lying on a sundrenched beach in the caribbean sipping on a pina colada and watching string bikinis did lamar mention the signing bonus no but it sounds interesting if you join our firm we hand you a check for five thousand we prefer that you spend the bulk of it on a new wardrobe after seven years of jeans and flannel shirts your inventory of suits is probably low and we realize it appearance is very important to us we expect our attorneys to dress sharp and conservative theres no dress code but youll get the picture did he say five thousand dollars for clothes mitch currently owned two suits and he was wearing one of them he kept a straight face and did not smile any questions yes the large firms are infamous for being sweatshops where the associates are flooded with tedious research and locked away in some library for the first three years i want no part of that i dont mind doing my share of research and i realize i will be the low man on the pole but i dont want to research and write briefs for the entire firm id like to work with real clients and their real problems mr mcknight listened intently and waited with his rehearsed answer i understand mitch youre right it is a real problem in the big firms but not here for the first three months youll do little but study for the bar exam when thats over you begin practicing law youll be assigned to a partner and his clients will become your clients youll do most of his research and of course your own and occasionally youll be asked to assist someone else with the preparation of a briefer some research we want you happy we take pride in our zero turnover rate and we go the extra mile to keep careers on track if you cant get along with your partner well find another one if you discover you dont like tax well let you try securities or banking its your decision will soon invest a lot of money in mitch mcdeere and we want him to be productive mitch sipped his coffee and searched for another question mr mcknight glanced at his checklist we pay all moving expenses to memphis that wont be much just a small rental truck anything else mitch no sir i cant think of anything the checklist was folded and placed in the file the partner rested both elbows on the table and leaned forward mitch were not pushing but we need an answer as soon as possible if you go elsewhere we must then continue to interview its a lengthy process and wed like our new man to start by july ten days soon enough thats fine say by march sure but ill contact you before then mitch excused himself and found lamar waiting in the hall outside mcknights office they agreed on seven for dinner there were no law offices on the fifth floor of the bendini building the partners dining room and kitchen occupied the west end some unused and unpainted storage rooms sat locked and empty in the center then a thick concrete wall sealed off the remaining third of the floor a small metal door with a button beside it and a camera over it hung in the center of the wall and opened into a small room where an armed guard watched the door and monitored a wall of closedcircuit screens a hallway zigzagged through a maze of cramped offices and workrooms where an assortment of characters went secretly about their business of watching and gathering information the windows to the outside were sealed with paint and covered with blinds the sunlight stood no chance of penetrating the fortress devasher head of security occupied the largest of the small plain offices the lone certificate on his bare walls recognized him for thirty years of dedicated service as a detective with the new orleans police department he was stocky with a slight belly thick shoulders and chest and a huge perfectly round head that smiled with great reluctance his wrinkled shirt was mercifully unbuttoned at the collar allowing his bulging neck to sag unrestricted a thick polyester tie hung on the coatrack with a badly worn blazer monday morning after the mcdeere visit oliver lambert stood before the small metal door and stared at the camera over it he pushed the button twice waited and was finally cleared through security he walked quickly through the cramped hallway and entered the cluttered office devasher blew smoke from a dutch masters into a smokeless ashtray and shoved papers in all directions until wood was visible on his desk mornin ollie i guess you want to talk about mcdeere devasher was the only person in the bendini building who called him ollie to his face yes among other things well he had a good time was impressed with liked memphis okay and will probably sign on where were your people we had the rooms on both sides at the hotel his room was wired of course as was the limo and the phone and everything else the usual ollie lets get specific okay thursday night they checked in late and went to bed little discussion friday night he told her all about the offices the people said you were a real nice man i thought youd like that get on with it told her about the fancy dining room and his little lunch with the partners gave her the specifics on the offer and they were ecstatic much better than his other offers she wants a home with a driveway and a sidewalk and trees and a backyard he said she could have one any problems with not really he commented on the absence of blacks and women but it didnt seem to bother him what about his wife she had a ball she likes the town and she and quins wife hit it off they looked at houses friday afternoon and she saw a couple she liked you get any addresses of course ollie saturday morning they called the limo and rode all over town very impressed with the limo our driver stayed away from the bad sections and they looked at more houses i think they decided on one east meadowbrook its empty realtor by the name of betsy bell walked them through it asking oneforty but will take less need to move it thats a nice part of town how old is the house ten fifteen years three thousand square feet sort of a coloniallooking job its nice enough for one of your boys ollie are you sure thats the one they want for now anyway they discussed maybe coming back in a month or so to look at some more you might want to fly them back as soon as they accept thats normal procedure aint itt yes well handle that what about the salary most impressed highest one so far they talked and talked about the money salary retirement mortgage bmw bonus everything they couldnt believe it kids must really be broke they are you think we got him huh id bet on it he said once that may not be as prestigious as the ones on wall street but the lawyers were just as qualified and a lot nicer i think hell sign on yeah any suspicions not really quin evidently told him to stay away from lockes office he told his wife that no one ever went in there but some secretaries and a handful of partners but he said quin said locke was eccentric and not that friendly i dont think hes suspicious though she said seemed concerned about some things that were none of its business such as personal matters children working wives etc she seemed a bit irritated but i think it was more of an observation she told mitch saturday morning that she would be damned if any bunch of lawyers would tell her when to work and when to have babies but i dont think its a problem does he realize how permanent this place is i think so there was no mention of putting in a few years and moving on i think he got the message he wants to be a partner like all of them hes broke and wants the money what about the dinner at my place they were nervous but had a good time very impressed with your place really liked your wife sex every night sounded like a honeymoon in there whatd they do we couldnt see remember sounded normal nothing kinky i thought of you and how much you like pictures and i kept telling myself we shouldve rigged up some cameras for old ollie shut up devasher maybe next time they were silent as devasher looked at a notepad he stubbed his cigar in the ashtray and smiled to himself all in all he said its a strong marriage they seemed to be very intimate your driver said they held hands all weekend not a cross word for three days thats pretty good aint it but who am i ive been married three times myself thats understandable what about children couple of years she wants to work some then get pregnant whats your opinion of this guy very good very decent young man also very ambitious i think hes driven and he wont quit until hes at the top hell take some chances bend some rules if necessary ollie smiled thats what i wanted to hear two phone calls both to her mother in kentucky nothing remarkable what about his family never mentioned no word on ray were still looking ollie give us some time devasher closed the mcdeere file and opened another much thicker one lambert rubbed his temples and stared at the floor whats the latest he asked softly its not good ollie im convinced hodge and kozinski are working together now last week the fbi got a warrant and checked kozinskis house found our wiretaps they told him his house was bugged but of course they dont know who did it kozinski tells hodge last friday while theyre hiding in the thirdfloor library we got a bug nearby and we pick up bits and pieces not much but we know they talked about the wiretaps theyre convinced everything is bugged and they suspect us theyre very careful where they talk why would the fbi bother with a search warrant good question probably for our benefit to make things look real legal and proper they respect us which agent tarrance hes in charge evidently is he good hes okay young green overzealous but competent hes no match for our men how often has he talked to kozinski theres no way to know they figure were listening so everybodys real careful we know of four meetings in the last month but i suspect more how much has he spilled not much i hope theyre still shadowboxing the last conversation we got was a week ago and he didnt say much hes bad scared theyre coaxing a lot but not getting much he hasnt yet made the decision to cooperate they approached him remember at least we think they approached him they shook him up pretty bad and he was ready to cut a deal now hes having second thoughts but hes still in contact with them and thats what worries me does his wife know i dont think so she knows hes acting strange and he tells her its office pressure what about hodge still aint talked to the fibbies as far as we know he and kozinski talk a lot or whisper i should say hodge keeps saying hes scared to death of the fbi that they dont play fair and they cheat and play dirty he wont move without kozinski what if kozinski is eliminated hodge will be a new man but i dont think weve reached that point dammit ollie he aint some hotshot thug who gets in the way hes a very nice young man with kids and all that your compassion is overwhelming i guess you think i enjoy this hell i practically raised these boys well get them back in line then before this thing goes too far new yorks getting suspicious ollie theyre asking a lot of questions who lazarov what have you told them devasher everything thats my job they want you in new york day after tomorrow for a full briefing what do they want answers and plans plans for what preliminary plans to eliminate kozinski hodge and tarrance should it become necessary tarrance are you crazy devasher we cant eliminate a cop theyll send in the troops lazarov is stupid ollie you know that hes an idiot but i dont think we should tell him i think i will i think ill go to new york and tell lazarov hes a complete fool you do that ollie you do that oliver lambert jumped from his seat and headed for the door watch mcdeere for another month sure ollie you betcha hell sign dont worry the mazda was sold for two hundred dollars and most of the money was immediately invested in a twelvefoot uhaul rental truck he would be reimbursed in memphis half of the odd assortment of furniture was given or thrown away and when loaded the truck held a refrigerator a bed a dresser and chest of drawers a small color television boxes of dishes clothes and junk and an old sofa which was taken out of sentiment and would not last long in the new location abby held hearsay the mutt as mitch worked his way through boston and headed south far south toward the promise of better things for three days they drove the back roads enjoyed the countryside sang along with the radio slept in cheap motels and talked of the house the bmw new furniture children affluence they rolled down the windows and let the wind blow as the truck approached top speeds of almost fortyfive miles per hour at one point somewhere in pennsylvania abby mentioned that perhaps they could stop in kentucky for a brief visit mitch said nothing but chose a route through the carolinas and georgia never venturing within two hundred miles of any point on the kentucky border abby let it pass they arrived in memphis on a thursday morning and as promised the black i sat under the carport as though it belonged there he stared at the car she stared at the house the lawn was thick green and neatly trimmed the hedges had been manicured the marigolds were in bloom the keys were found under a bucket in the utility room as promised after the first test drive they quickly unloaded the truck before the neighbors could inspect the sparse belongings the uhaul was returned to the nearest dealer another test drive an interior designer the same one who would do his office arrived after noon and brought with her samples of carpet paint floor coverings curtains drapes wallpaper abby found the idea of a designer a bit hilarious after their apartment in cambridge but played along mitch was immediately bored and excused himself for another test drive he toured the treelined quiet shady streets of this handsome neighborhood of which he was now a member he smiled as boys on bicycles stopped and whistled at his new car he waved at the postman walking down the sidewalk sweating profusely here he was mitchell y mcdeere twentyfive years old and one week out of law school and he had arrived at three they followed the designer to an upscale furniture store where the manager politely informed them that mr oliver lambert had already made arrangements for their credit if they so chose and there was in fact no limit on what they could buy and finance they bought a houseful mitch frowned from time to time and twice vetoed items as too expensive but abby ruled the day the designer complimented her time and again on her marvelous taste and said she would see mitch on monday to do his office marvelous he said with a map of the city they set out for the quin residence abby had seen the house during the first visit but did not remember how to find it it was in a section of town called chickasaw gardens and she remembered the wooded lots huge houses and professionally landscaped front yards they parked in the driveway behind the new mercedes and the old mercedes the maid nodded politely but did not smile she led them to the living room and left them the house was dark and quietno children no voices no one they admired the furniture and waited they mumbled quietly then grew impatient yes they agreed they had in fact been invited to dinner on this night thursday june at pm mitch checked his watch again and said something about it being rude they waited from the hallway kay emerged and attempted to smile her eyes were puffy and glazed with mascara leaking from the corners tears flowed freely down her cheeks and she held a handkerchief over her mouth she hugged abby and sat next to her on the sofa she bit the handkerchief and cried louder mitch knelt before her kay whats happened she bit harder and shook her head abby squeezed her knee and mitch patted the other one they watched her fearfully expecting the worst was it lamar or one of the kids theres been a tragedy she said through the quiet sobbing who is it mitch asked she wiped her eyes and breathed deeply two members of marty kozinski and joe hodge were killed today we were very close to them mitch sat on the coffee table he remembered marty kozinski from the second visit in april he had joined lamar and mitch for lunch at a deli on front street he was next in line for a partnership but had seemed less than enthused mitch could not place joe hodge what happened he asked she had stopped crying but the tears continued she wiped her face again and looked at him were not sure they were on grand cayman scuba diving there was some kind of an explosion on a boat and we think they drowned lamar said details were sketchy there was a firm meeting a few hours ago and they were all told about it lamar barely made it home where is he by the pool hes waiting for you he sat in a white metal lawn chair next to a small table with a small umbrella a few feet from the edge of the pool near a flower bed a circular lawn sprinkler rattled and hissed and spewed forth water in a perfect arc which included the table umbrella chair and lamar quin he was soaked water dripped from his nose ears and hair the blue cotton shirt and wool pants were saturated he wore no socks or shoes he sat motionless never flinching with each additional dousing he had lost touch some distant object on the side fence attracted and held his attention an unopened bottle of heineken sat in a puddle on the concrete beside his chair mitch surveyed the back lawn in part to make sure the neighbors could not see they could not an eightfoot cypress fence ensured complete privacy he walked around the pool and stopped at the edge of the dry area lamar noticed him nodded attempted a weak smile and motioned to a wet chair mitch pulled it a few feet away and sat down just as the next barrage of water landed his stare returned to the fence or whatever it was in the distance for an eternity they sat and listened to the thrashing sound of the sprinkler lamar would sometimes shake his head and attempt to mumble mitch smiled awkwardly unsure of what if anything needed to be said lamar im very sorry he finally offered he acknowledged this and looked at mitch me too i wish i could say something his eyes left the fence and he cocked his head sideways in mitchs direction his dark hair was soaked and hung in his eyes the eyes were red and pained he stared and waited until the next round of water passed over i know but theres nothing to say im sorry it had to happen now today we didnt feel like cooking that should be the least of your concerns i lost my appetite a moment ago do you remember them he asked blowing water from his lips i remember kozinski but not hodge marty kozinski was one of my best friends from chicago he joined three years ahead of me and was next in line for a partnership a great lawyer one we all admired and turned to probably the best negotiator in very cool and dry under pressure he wiped his eyebrows and stared at the ground when he talked the water dripped from his nose and interfered with his enunciation three kids his twin girls are a month older than our son and theyve always played together he closed his eyes bit his lip and started crying mitch wanted to leave he tried not to look at his friend im very sorry lamar very sorry after a few minutes the crying stopped but the water continued mitch surveyed the spacious lawn in search of the outside faucet twice he summoned the courage to ask if he could turn off the sprinkler and twice he decided he could last if lamar could maybe it helped he checked his watch darkness was an hour and a half away what about the accident mitch finally asked we werent told much they were scuba diving and there was an explosion on the boat the dive captain was also killed a native of the islands theyre trying to get the bodies home now where were their wives at home thankfully it was a business trip i cant picture hodge joe was a tall blondheaded guy who didnt say much the kind you meet but dont remember he was a harvard man like yourself how old was he he and marty were both thirtyfour he wouldve made partner after marty they were very close i guess were all close especially now with all ten fingernails he combed his hair straight back he stood and walked to dry ground water poured from his shirttail and the cuffs of his pants he stopped near mitch and looked blankly at the treetops next door hows the bmw its great a fine car thanks for delivering it when did you arrive this morning ive already put three hundred miles on it did the interior woman show up yeah she and abby spent next years salary thats nice nice house were glad youre here mitch im just sorry about the circumstances youll like it here you dont have to apologize i still dont believe it im numb paralyzed i shudder at the thought of seeing martys wife and the kids id rather be lashed with a bullwhip than go over there the women appeared walked across the wooden patio deck and down the steps to the pool kay found the faucet and the sprinkler was silenced they left chickasaw gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown into the fading sun they held hands but said little mitch opened the sunroof and rolled down the windows abby picked through a box of old cassettes and found springsteen the stereo worked fine hungry heart blew from the windows as the little shiny roadster made its way toward the river the warm sticky humid memphis summer air settled in with the dark softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and limegreen and fluorescentyellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle cars full of teenagers crowded into fastfood joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex mitch began to smile he tried to forget about lamar and kozinski and hodge why should he be sad they were not his friends he was sorry for their families but he did not really know these people and he mitchell y mcdeere a poor kid with no family had much to be happy about beautiful wife new house new car new job new harvard degree a brilliant mind and a solid body that did not gain weight and needed little sleep eighty thousand a year for now in two years he could be in six figures and all he had to do was work ninety hours a week piece of cake he pulled into a selfserve and pumped fifteen gallons he paid inside and bought a sixpack of michelob abby opened two and they darted back into the traffic he was smiling now lets eat he said were not exactly dressed she said he stared at her long brown legs she wore a white cotton skirt above the knees with a white cotton buttondown he had shorts deck shoes and a faded black polo with legs like that you could get us into any restaurant in new york how about the rendezvous the dress seemed casual great idea they paid to park in a lot downtown and walked two blocks to a narrow alley the smell of barbecue mixed with the summer air and hung like a fog close to the pavement the aroma filtered gently through the nose mouth and eyes and caused a rippling sensation deep in the stomach smoke poured into the alley from vents running underground into the massive ovens where the best pork ribs were barbecued in the best barbecue restaurant in a city known for worldclass barbecue the rendezvous was downstairs beneath the alley beneath an ancient redbrick building that would have been demolished decades earlier had it not been for the famous tenant in the basement there was always a crowd and a waiting list but thursdays were slow it seemed they were led through the cavernous sprawling noisy restaurant and shown a small table with a redchecked tablecloth there were stares along the way always stares men stopped eating froze with ribs hanging from their teeth as abby mcdeere glided by like a model on a runway she had stopped traffic from a sidewalk in boston whistles and catcalls were a way of life and her husband was used to it he took great pride in his beautiful wife an angry black man with a red apron stood before them okay sir he demanded the menus were mats on the tables and completely unnecessary ribs ribs and ribs two whole orders cheese plate pitcher of beer mitch shot back at him the waiter wrote nothing but turned and screamed in the direction of the entrance gimme two whole cheese pitcher when he left mitch grabbed her leg under the table she slapped his hand youre beautiful he said when was the last time i told you that you are beautiful about two hours ago two hours how thoughtless of me dont let it happen again he grabbed her leg again and rubbed the knee she allowed it she smiled seductively at him dimples forming perfectly teeth shining in the dim light soft pale brown eyes glowing her dark brunet hair was straight and fell perfectly a few inches below her shoulders the beer arrived and the waiter filled two mugs without saying a word abby took a small drink and stopped smiling do you think lamars okay she asked i dont know i thought at first he was drunk i felt like an idiot sitting there watching him get soaked poor guy kay said the funerals will probably be monday if they can get the bodies back in time lets talk about something else i dont like funerals any funeral even when im there out of respect and dont know the deceased ive had some bad experiences with funerals the ribs arrived they were served on paper plates with aluminum foil to catch the grease a small dish of slaw and one of baked beans sat around a footlong slab of dry ribs sprinkled heavily with the secret sauce they dug in with fingers what would you like to talk about she asked getting pregnant i thought we were going to wait a few years we are but i think we should practice diligently until then weve practiced in every roadside motel between here and boston i know but not in our new home mitch ripped two ribs apart slinging sauce into his eyebrows we just moved in this morning i know whatre we waiting for mitch you act as though youve been neglected i have since this morning i suggest we do it tonight as soon as we get home to sort of christen our new house well see is it a date look did you see that guy over there hes about to break his neck trying to see some leg i oughta go over and whip his ass yes its a date dont worry about those guys theyre staring at you they think youre cuteji very funny mitch stripped his ribs clean and ate half of hers when the beer was gone he paid the check and they climbed into the alley he drove carefully across town and found the name of a street he recognized from one of his many road trips of the day after two wrong turns he found meadowbrook and then the home of mr and mrs mitchell y mcdeere the mattress and box springs were stacked on the floor of the master bedroom surrounded by boxes hearsay hid under a lamp on the floor and watched as they practiced four days later on what should have been his first day behind his new desk mitch and his lovely wife joined the remaining thirtynine members of and their lovely wives as they paid their last respects to martin s kozinski the cathedral was full oliver lambert offered a eulogy so eloquent and touching not even mitchell mcdeere who had buried a father and a brother could resist chill bumps abbys eyes watered at the sight of the widow and the children that afternoon they met again in the presbyterian church in east memphis to say farewell to joseph m hodge the small lobby outside royce mcknights office was empty when mitch arrived precisely at eightthirty on schedule he hummed and coughed and began to wait anxiously from behind two file cabinets an ancient bluehaired secretary appeared and scowled in his general direction when it was apparent he was not welcome he introduced himself and explained he was to meet mr mcknight at this appointed hour she smiled and introduced herself as louise mr mcknights personal secretary for thirtyone years now coffee yes he said black she disappeared and returned with a cup and saucer she notified her boss through the intercom and instructed mitch to have a seat she recognized him now one of the other secretaries had pointed him out during the funerals yesterday she apologized for the somber atmosphere around the place no one felt like working she explained and it would be days before things were normal they were such nice young men the phone rang and she explained that mr mcknight was in an important meeting and could not be disturbed it rang again she listened and escorted him into the managing partners office oliver lambert and royce mcknight greeted mitch and introduced him to two other partners victor milligan and avery tolar they sat around a small conference table louise was sent for more coffee milligan was head of tax and tolar at fortyone was one of the younger partners mitch we apologize for such a depressing beginning mcknight said we appreciate your presence at the funerals yesterday and were sorry your first day as a member of our firm was one of such sadness i felt i belonged at the funerals mitch said were very proud of you and we have great plans for you weve just lost two of our finest lawyers both of whom did nothing but tax so well be asking more of you all of us will have to work a little harder louise arrived with a tray of coffee silver coffee server fine china we are quite saddened said oliver lambert so please bear with us they all nodded and frowned at the table royce mcknight looked at some notes on a legal pad mitch i think weve covered this before at this firm we assign each associate to a partner who acts as a supervisor and mentor these relationships are very important we try to match you with a partner with whom you will be compatible and able to work closely and were usually right we have made mistakes wrong chemistry or whatever but when that happens we simply reassign the associate avery tolar will be your partner mitch smiled awkwardly at his new partner you will be under his direction and the cases and files you work on will be his virtually all of it will be tax work thats fine before i forget it id like to have lunch today tolar said certainly mitch said take my limo mr lambert said i had planned to said tolar when do i get a limo mitch asked they smiled and seemed to appreciate the relief in about twenty years said mr lambert i can wait hows the bmw asked victor milligan great its ready for the fivethousandmile service did you get moved in okay yes everythings fine i appreciate s assistance in everything youve made us feel very welcome and abby and i are extremely grateful mcknight quit smiling and returned to the legal pad as ive told you mitch the bar exam has priority youve got six weeks to study for it and we assist in every way possible we have our own review courses directed by our members all areas of the exam will be covered and your progress will be closely watched by all of us especially avery at least half of each day will be spent on bar review and most of your spare time as well no associate in this firm has ever failed the exam i wont be the first if you flunk it we take away the bmw tolar said with a slight grin your secretary will be a lady named nina huff shes been with more than eight years sort of temperamental not much to look at but very capable she knows a lot of law and has a tendency to give advice especially to the newer attorneys itll be up to you to keep her in place if you cant get along with her well move her wheres my office second floor down the hall from avery the interior woman will be here this afternoon to pick out the desk and furnishings as much as possible follow her advice lamar was also on the second floor and at the moment that thought was comforting he thought of him sitting by the pool soaking wet crying and mumbling incoherently mcknight spoke mitch im afraid i neglected to cover something that shouldve been discussed during the first visit here he waited and finally said okay what is it the partners watched mcknight intently weve never allowed an associate to begin his career burdened with student loans we prefer that you find other things to worry about and other ways to spend your money how much do you owe mitch sipped his coffee and thought rapidly almost twentythree thousand have the documents on louises desk first thing in the morning you uh mean satisfies the loans thats our policy unless you object no objection i dont quite know what to say you dont have to say anything weve done it for every associate for the past fifteen years just get the paperwork to louise thats very generous mr mcknight yes it is avery tolar talked incessantly as the limo moved slowly through the noontime traffic mitch reminded him of himself he said a poor kid from a broken home raised by foster families throughout southwest texas then put on the streets after high school he worked the night shift in a shoe factory to finance junior college an academic scholarship to utep opened the door he graduated with honors applied to eleven law schools and chose stanford he finished number two in his class and turned down offers from every big firm on the west coast he wanted to do tax work nothing but tax work oliver lambert had recruited him sixteen years ago back when had fewer than thirty lawyers he had a wife and two kids but said little about the family he talked about money his passion he called it the first million was in the bank the second was two years away at four hundred thousand a year gross it wouldnt take long his specialty was forming partnerships to purchase supertankers he was the premier specialist in his field and worked at three hundred an hour sixty sometimes seventy hours a week mitch would start at a hundred bucks an hour at least five hours a day until he passed the bar and got his license then eight hours a day would be expected at onefifty an hour billing was the lifeblood of everything revolved around it promotions raises bonuses survival success everything revolved around how well one was billing especially the new guys the quickest route to a reprimand was to neglect the daily billing records avery could not remember such a reprimand it was simply unheard of for a member of to ignore his billing the average for associates was oneseventyfive per hour for partners three hundred milligan got four hundred an hour from a couple of his clients and nathan locke once got five hundred an hour for some tax work that involved swapping assets in several foreign countries five hundred bucks an hour avery relished the thought and computed five hundred per hour by fifty hours per week at fifty weeks per year one million two hundred fifty thousand a year thats how you make money in this business you get a bunch of lawyers working by the hour and you build a dynasty the more lawyers you get the more money the partners make dont ignore the billing he warned thats the first rule of survival if there were no files to bill on immediately report to his office he had plenty on the tenth day of each month the partners review the prior months billing during one of their exclusive luncheons its a big ceremony royce mcknight reads out each lawyers name then the total of his monthly billing the competition among the partners is intense but goodspirited theyre all getting rich right its very motivational as for the associates nothing is said to the low man unless its his second straight month oliver lambert will say something in passing no one has ever finished low for three straight months bonuses can be earned by associates for exorbitant billing partnerships are based on ones track record for generating fees so dont ignore it he warned again it must always have priority after the bar exam of course the bar exam was a nuisance an ordeal that must be endured a rite of passage and nothing any harvard man should fear just concentrate on the review courses he said and try to remember everything he had just learned in law school the limo wheeled into a side street between two tall buildings and stopped in front of a small canopy that extended from the curb to a black metal door avery looked at his watch and said to the driver be back at two two hours for lunch thought mitch thats over six hundred dollars in billable time what a waste the manhattan club occupied the top floor of a tenstory office building which had last been fully occupied in the early fifties avery referred to the structure as a dump but was quick to point out that the club was the most exclusive lunch and dinner refuge in the city it offered excellent food in an allwhite richmale plush environment powerful lunches for powerful people bankers lawyers executives entrepreneurs a few politicians and a few aristocrats a goldplated elevator ran nonstop past the deserted offices and stopped on the elegant tenth floor the maitre d called mr tolar by name and asked about his good friends oliver lambert and nathan locke he expressed sympathies for the loss of mr kozinski and mr hodge avery thanked him and introduced the newest member of the favorite table was waiting in the corner a courtly black man named ellis delivered the menus it does not allow drinking at lunch avery said as he opened his menu i dont drink during lunch thats good whatll you have tea with ice iced tea for him avery said to the waiter bring me a bombay martini on the rocks with three olives mitch bit his tongue and grinned behind the menu we have too many rules avery mumbled the first martini led to a second but he quit after two he ordered for both of them broiled fish of some sort the special of the day he watched his weight carefully he said he also worked out daily at a health club his own health club he invited mitch to come sweat with him maybe after the bar exam there were the usual questions about football in college and the standard denials of any greatness mitch asked about the children he said they lived with their mother the fish was raw and the baked potato was hard mitch picked at his plate ate his salad slowly and listened as his partner talked about most of the other people present for lunch the mayor was seated at a large table with some japanese one of s bankers was at the next table there were some other bigshot lawyers and corporate types all eating furiously and importantly powerfully the atmosphere was stuffy according to avery every member of the club was a compelling figure a potent force both in his field and in the city avery was at home they both declined dessert and ordered coffee he would be expected to be in the office by nine each morning avery explained as he lit a montesino the secretaries would be there at eightthirty nine to five but no one worked eight hours a day personally he was in the office by eight and seldom left before six he could bill twelve hours each day every day regardless of how many hours he actually worked twelve a day five days a week at three hundred an hour for fifty weeks nine hundred thousand dollars in billable time that was his goal last year he had billed seven hundred thousand but there had been some personal problems didnt care if mitch came in at am or am as long as the work was done what time are the doors unlocked mitch asked everyone has a key he explained so he could come and go as he pleased security was tight but the guards were accustomed to workaholics some of the work habits were legendary victor milligan in his younger days worked sixteen hours a day seven days a week until he made partner then he quit working on sundays he had a heart attack and gave up saturdays his doctor put him on tenhour days five days a week and he hasnt been happy since marty kozinski knew all the janitors by first name he was a am man who wanted to have breakfast with the kids he would come in at nine and leave at midnight nathan locke claims he cant work well after the secretaries arrive so he comes in at six it would be a disgrace to start later heres a man sixtyone years old worth ten million and works from six in the morning until eight at night five days a week and then a half day on saturday if he retired hed die nobody punched a clock the partner explained come and go as you please just get the work done mitch said he got the message sixteen hours a day would be nothing new avery complimented him on the new suit there was an unwritten dress code and it was apparent mitch had caught on he had a tailor an old korean in south memphis he would recommend when mitch could afford it fifteen hundred a suit mitch said he would wait a year or two an attorney from one of the bigger firms interrupted and spoke to avery he offered his sympathies and asked about the families he and joe hodge had worked together on a case last year and he couldnt believe it avery introduced him to mitch he was at the funeral he said they waited for him to leave but he rambled on and on about how sorry he was it was obvious he wanted details avery offered none and he finally left by two the power lunches were losing steam and the crowd thinned avery signed the check and the maltre d led them to the door the chauffeur stood patiently by the rear of the limo mitch crawled into the back and sank into the heavy leather seat he watched the buildings and the traffic he looked at the pedestrians scurrying along the hot sidewalks and wondered how many of them had seen the inside of a limo or the inside of the manhattan club how many of them would be rich in ten years he smiled and felt good harvard was a million miles away harvard with no student loans kentucky was in another world his past was forgotten he had arrived the decorator was waiting in his office avery excused himself and asked mitch to be in his office in an hour to begin work she had books full of office furniture and samples of everything he asked for suggestions listened with as much interest as he could muster then told her he trusted her judgment and she could pick out whatever she felt was appropriate she liked the solidcherry work desk no drawers burgundy leather wing chairs and a very expensive oriental rug mitch said it was marvelous she left and he sat behind the old desk one that looked fine and would have suited him except that it was considered used and therefore not good enough for a new lawyer at bendini lambert locke the office was fifteen by fifteen with two sixfoot windows facing north and staring directly into the second floor of the old building next door not much of a view with a strain he could see a glimpse of the river to the northwest the walls were sheetrock and bare she had picked out some artwork he determined that the ego wall would face the desk behind the wing chairs the diplomas etc would have to be mounted and framed the office was big for an associate much larger than the cubbyholes where the rookies were placed in new york and chicago it would do for a couple of years then on to one with a better view then a corner office one of those power ones miss nina huff knocked on the door and introduced herself as the secretary she was a heavyset woman of fortyfive and with one glance it was not difficult to understand why she was still single with no family to support it was evident she spent her money on clothes and makeupall to no avail mitch wondered why she did not invest in a fitness counselor she informed him forthrightly that she had been with eight and a half years now and knew all there was to know about office procedure if he had a question just ask her he thanked her for that she had been in the typing pool and was grateful for the return to general secretarial duties he nodded as though he understood completely she asked if he knew how to operate the dictating equipment yes he said in fact the year before he had worked for a threehundredman firm on wall street and that firm owned the very latest in office technology but if he had a problem he would ask her he promised whats your wifes name she asked why is that important he asked because when she calls i would like to know her name so that i can be real sweet and friendly to her on the phone abby how do you like your coffee black but ill fix it myself i dont mind fixing your coffee for you its part of the job ill fix it myself all the secretaries do it if you ever touch my coffee ill see to it that youre sent to the mail room to lick stamps we have an automated licker do they lick stamps on wall street it was a figure of speech well ive memorized your wifes name and weve settled the issue of coffee so i guess im ready to start in the morning be here at eightthirty yes boss she left and mitch smiled to himself she was a real smartass but she would be fun lamar was next he was late for a meeting with nathan locke but he wanted to stop by and check on his friend he was pleased their offices were close he apologized again for last thursdays dinner yes he and kay and the kids would be there at seven to inspect the new house and the furniture hunter quin was five his sister holly was seven they both ate the spaghetti with perfect manners from the brandnew dining table and dutifully ignored the grownup talk circulating around them abby watched the two and dreamed of babies mitch thought they were cute but was not inspired he was busy recalling the events of the day the women ate quickly then left to look at the furniture and talk about the remodeling the children took hearsay to the backyard im a little surprised they put you with tolar lamar said wiping his mouth why is that i dont think hes ever supervised an associate any particular reason not really hes a great guy but not much of a team player sort of a loner prefers to work by himself he and his wife are having some problems and theres talk that theyve separated but he keeps it to himself mitch pushed his plate away and sipped the iced tea is he a good lawyer yes very good theyre all good if they make partner a lot of his clients are rich people with millions to put in tax shelters he sets up limited partnerships many of his shelters are risky and hes known for his willingness to take chances and fight with the irs later most of his clients are bigtime risk takers youll do a lot of research looking for ways to bend the tax laws itll be fun he spent half of lunch lecturing on billing its vital theres always the pressure to bill more and more all we have to sell is our time once you pass the bar your billing will be monitored weekly by tolar and royce mcknight its all computerized and they can tell down to the dime how productive you are youll be expected to bill thirty to forty hours a week for the first six months then fifty for a couple of years before theyll consider you for partner youve got to hit sixty hours a week consistently over a period of years no active partner bills less than sixty a weekmost of it at the maximum rate thats a lot of hours sounds that way but its deceptive most good lawyers can work eight or nine hours a day and bill twelve its called padding its not exactly fair to the client but its something everybody does the great firms have been built by padding files its the name of the game sounds unethical so is ambulance chasing by plaintiffs lawyers its unethical for a dope lawyer to take his fee in cash if he has a reason to believe the money is dirty a lot of things are unethical what about the doctor who sees a hundred medicare patients a day or the one who performs unnecessary surgery some of the most unethical people ive met have been my own clients its easy to pad a file when your client is a multimillionaire who wants to screw the government and wants you to do it legally we all do it do they teach it no you just sort of learn it youll start off working long crazy hours but you cant do it forever so you start taking shortcuts believe me mitch after youve been with us a year youll know how to work ten hours and bill twice that much its sort of a sixth sense lawyers acquire what else will i acquire lamar rattled his ice cubes and thought for a moment a certain amount of cynicism this business works on you when you were in law school you had some noble idea of what a lawyer should be a champion of individual rights a defender of the constitution a guardian of the oppressed an advocate for your clients principles then after you practice for six months you realize were nothing but hired guns mouthpieces for sale to the highest bidder available to anybody any crook any sleazebag with enough money to pay our outrageous fees nothing shocks you its supposed to be an honorable profession but youll meet so many crooked lawyers youll want to quit and find an honest job yeah mitch youll get cynical and its sad really you shouldnt be telling me this at this stage of my career the money makes up for it its amazing how much drudgery you can endure at two hundred thousand a year drudgery you make it sound terrible im sorry its not that bad my perspective on life changed radically last thursday you want to look at the house its marvelous maybe some other time lets just talk at five am the alarm clock exploded on the new bed table under the new lamp and was immediately silenced mitch staggered through the dark house and found hearsay waiting at the back door he released him into the backyard and headed for the shower twenty minutes later he found his wife under the covers and kissed her goodbye she did not respond with no traffic to fight the office was ten minutes away he had decided his day would start at fivethirty unless someone could top that then he would be there at five or fourthirty or whenever it took to be first sleep was a nuisance he would be the first lawyer to arrive at the bendini building on this day and every day until he became a partner if it took the others ten years he could do it in seven he would become the youngest partner in the history of he had decided the vacant lot next to the bendini building had a tenfoot chainlink fence around it and a guard by the gate there was a parking place inside with his name spraypainted between the yellow lines he stopped by the gate and waited the uniformed guard emerged from the darkness and approached the drivers door mitch pushed a button lowered the window and produced a plastic card with his picture on it you must be the new man the guard said as he held the card yes mitch mcdeere i can read i shouldve known by the car whats your name mitch asked dutch hendrix worked for the memphis police department for thirtythree years nice to meet you dutch yeah same to you you start early dont you mitch smiled and took the id card no i thought everyone would be here dutch managed a smile youre the first mr locke will be along shortly the gate opened and dutch ordered him through he found his name in white on the asphalt and parked the spotless bmw all by itself on the third row from the building he grabbed his empty burgundy eelskin attache case from the rear seat and gently closed the door another guard waited by the rear entrance mitch introduced himself and watched as the door was unlocked he checked his watch exactly fivethirty he was relieved that this hour was early enough the rest of was still asleep he nipped on the light switch in his office and laid the attache case on the temporary desk he headed for the coffee room down the hall turning on lights as he went the coffeepot was one of those industrial sizes with multilevels multiburners multipots and no apparent instructions on how to operate any of it he studied this machine for a moment as he emptied a pack of coffee into the filter he poured water through one of the holes in the top and smiled when it began dripping in the right place in one corner of his office were three cardboard boxes full of books files legal pads and class notes he had accumulated in the previous three years he sat the first one on his desk and began removing its contents the materials were categorized and placed in neat little piles around the desk after two cups of coffee he found the bar review materials in box number three he walked to the window and opened the blinds it was still dark he did not notice the figure suddenly appear in the doorway good morning mitch spun from the window and gawked at the man you scared me he said and breathed deeply im sorry im nathan locke i dont believe weve met im mitch mcdeere the new man they shook hands yes i know i apologize for not meeting you earlier i was busy during your earlier visits i think i saw you at the funerals monday mitch nodded and knew for certain he had never been within a hundred yards of nathan locke he would have remembered it was the eyes the cold black eyes with layers of black wrinkles around them great eyes unforgettable eyes his hair was white and thin on top with thickets around the ears and the whiteness contrasted sharply with the rest of his face when he spoke the eyes narrowed and the black pupils glowed fiercely sinister eyes knowing eyes maybe so mitch said captivated by the most evil face he had ever encountered maybe so i see youre an early riser yes sir well good to have you nathan locke withdrew from the doorway and disappeared mitch checked the hall then closed the door no wonder they keep him on the fourth floor away from everyone he thought now he understood why he didnt meet nathan locke before he signed on he might have had second thoughts probably hid him from all the prospective recruits he had without a doubt the most ominous evil presence mitch had ever felt it was the eyes he said to himself again as he propped his feet on the desk and sipped coffee the eyes as mitch expected nina brought food when she reported at eightthirty she offered mitch a doughnut and he took two she inquired as to whether she should bring enough food every morning and mitch said he thought it would be nice of her whats that she asked pointing at the stacks of files and notes on the desk thats our project for the day we need to get this stuff organized no dictating not yet i meet with avery in a few minutes i need this mess filed away in some order how exciting she said as she headed for the coffee room avery tolar was waiting with a thick expandable file which he handed to mitch this is the capps file part of it our clients name is sonny capps he lives in houston now but grew up in arkansas worth about thirty million and keeps his thumb on every penny of it his father gave him an old barge line just before he died and he turned it into the largest towing service on the mississippi river now he has ships or boats as he calls them all over the world we do eighty percent of his legal work everything but the litigation he wants to set up another limited partnership to purchase another fleet of tankers this one from the family of some dead chink in hong kong capps is usually the general partner and hell bring in as many as twentyfive limited partners to spread the risk and pool their resources this deal is worth about sixtyfive million ive done several limited partnerships for him and theyre all different all complicated and he is extremely difficult to deal with hes a perfectionist and thinks he knows more than i do you will not be talking to him in fact no one here talks to him but me that file is a portion of the last partnership i did for him it contains among other things a prospectus an agreement to form a partnership letters of intent disclosure statements and the limited partnership agreement itself read every word of it then i want you to prepare a rough draft of the partnership agreement for this venture the file suddenly grew heavier perhaps fivethirty was not early enough the partner continued we have about forty days according to capps so were already behind marty kozinski was helping with this one and as soon as i review his file ill give it to you any questions what about the research most of it is current but youll need to update it capps earned over nine million last year and paid a pittance in taxes he doesnt believe in paying taxes and holds me personally responsible for every dime thats sent in its all legal of course but my point is that this is highpressure work millions of dollars in investment and tax savings are at stake the venture will be scrutinized by the governments of at least three countries so be careful mitch flipped through the documents how many hours a day do i work on this as many as possible i know the bar exam is important but so is sonny capps he paid us almost a half a million last year in legal fees ill get it done i know you will as i told you your rate is one hundred an hour nina will go over the time records with you today remember dont ignore the billing how could i forget oliver lambert and nathan locke stood before the metal door on the fifth floor and stared at the camera above something clicked loudly and the door opened a guard nodded devasher waited in his office good morning ollie he said quietly while ignoring the other partner whats the latest locke snapped in devashers direction without looking at him from where devasher asked calmly chicago theyre very anxious up there nat regardless of what you believe they dont like to get their hands dirty and frankly they just dont understand why they have to what do you mean theyre asking some tough questions like why cant we keep our people in line and whatre you telling them that everythings okay wonderful the great bendini firm is solid the leaks have been plugged business as usual no problems how much damage did they do asked oliver lambert were not sure well never be sure but i dont think they ever talked they had decided to no doubt about that but i dont think they did weve got it from a pretty good source there were fbi agents en route to the island the day of the accident so we think they planned to rendezvous to spill their guts how do you know this asked locke come on nat weve got our sources plus we had people all over the island we do good work you know evidently was it messy no no very professional howd the native get in the way we had to make it look good ollie what about the authorities down there what authorities its a tiny peaceful island ollie last year they had one murder and four diving accidents as far as theyre concerned its just another accident three accidental drownings what about the fbi asked locke dont know i thought you had a source we do but we cant find him weve heard nothing as of yesterday our people are still on the island and theyve noticed nothing unusual how long will you stay there couple of weeks what happens if the fbi shows up asked locke we watch them real close well see them when they get off the plane well follow them to their hotel rooms we may even bug their phones well know what they eat for breakfast and what they talk about well assign three of our guys for every one of theirs and when they go to the toilet well know it there aint nothing for them to find nat i told you it was a clean job very professional no evidence relax this makes me sick devasher lambert said you think i like it ollie what do you want us to do sit back and let them talk come on ollie were all human i didnt want to do it but lazarov said do it you wanna argue with lazarov go ahead theyll find you floating somewhere those boys were up to no good they shouldve kept quiet driven their little fancy cars and played bigshot lawyers no they gotta get sanctimonious nathan locke lit a cigarette and blew a heavy cloud of smoke in the general direction of devasher the three sat in silence for a moment as the smoke settled across his desk he glared at black eyes but said nothing oliver lambert stood and stared at the blank wall next to the door why did you want to see us he asked devasher took a deep breath chicago wants to bug the home phones of all nonpartners i told you lambert said to locke it wasnt my idea but they insist on it theyre very nervous up there and they wanna take some extra precautions you cant blame them dont you think its going a bit too far asked lambert yeah its totally unnecessary but chicago doesnt think so when asked locke next week or so itll take a few days all of them yes thats what they said even mcdeere yes even mcdeere i think tarrance will try again and he might start at the bottom this time i met him this morning said locke he was here before me five thirtytwo answered devasher the law school memorabilia were removed to the floor and the capps file spread across the desk nina brought a chicken salad sandwich back from lunch and he ate it as he read and as she filed away the junk on the floor shortly after one wally hudson or j walter hudson as letterhead declared him arrived to begin the study for the bar exam contracts were his specialty he was a fiveyear member of and the only virginia man which he found odd because virginia had the best law school in the country in his opinion he had spent the last two years developing a new review course for the contracts section of the exam he was quite anxious to try it on someone and mcdeere happened to be the man he handed mitch a heavy threering notebook that was at least four inches thick and weighed as much as the capps file the exam would last for four days and consist of three parts wally explained the first day would be a fourhour multiplechoice exam on ethics gill vaughn one of the partners was the resident expert on ethics and would supervise that portion of the review the second day would be an eighthour exam known simply as multistate it covered most areas of the law common to all states it too was multiplechoice and the questions were very deceptive then the heavy action days three and four would be eight hours each and cover fifteen areas of substantive law contracts uniform commercial code real estate torts domestic relations wills estates taxation workers compensation constitutional law federal trial procedure criminal procedure corporations partnerships insurance and debtorcreditor relations all answers would be in essay form and the questions would emphasize tennessee law had a review plan for each of the fifteen sections you mean fifteen of these mitch asked as he lifted the notebook wally smiled yes were very thorough no one in this firm has ever flunked i know i know i wont be the first you and i will meet at least once a week for the next six weeks to go through the materials each session will last about two hours so you can plan accordingly i would suggest each wednesday at three morning or afternoon afternoon thats fine as you know contracts and the uniform commercial code go hand in hand so ive incorporated the ucc into those materials well cover both but itll take more time a typical bar exam is loaded with commercial transactions those problems make great essay questions so that notebook will be very important ive included actual questions from old exams along with the model answers its fascinating reading i cant wait take the first eighty pages for next week youll find some essay questions youll need to answer you mean homework absolutely ill grade it next week its very important to practice these questions each week this could be worse than law school its much more important than law school we take it very seriously we have a committee to monitor your progress from now until you sit for the exam well be watching very closely whos on the committee myself avery tolar royce mcknight randall dunbar and kendall mahan well meet each friday to assess your progress wally produced a smaller lettersized notebook and laid it on the desk this is your daily log you are to record the hours spent studying for the exam and the subjects studied ill pick it up every friday morning before the committee meets any questions i cant think of any mitch said as he laid the notebook on top of the capps file good see you next wednesday at three less than ten seconds after he left randall dunbar walked in with a thick notebook remarkably similar to the one left behind by wally in fact it was identical but not quite as thick dunbar was head of real estate and had handled the purchase and sale of the mcdeere home in may he handed mitch the notebook labeled real estate law and explained how his specialty was the most critical part of the exam everything goes back to property he said he had carefully prepared the materials himself over the past ten years and confessed that he had often thought of publishing them as an authoritative work on property rights and land financing he would need at least one hour a week preferably on tuesday afternoon he talked for an hour about how different the exam was thirty years ago when he took it kendall mahan added a new twist he wanted to meet on saturday mornings early say seventhirty no problem mitch said as he took the notebook and placed it next to the others this one was for constitutional law a favorite of kendalls although he seldom got to use it he said it was the most important section of the exam or at least it had been when he took it five years ago he had published an article on first amendment rights in the columbia law review in his senior year there a copy of it was in the notebook in case mitch wanted to read it he promised to do so almost immediately the procession continued throughout the afternoon until half of had stopped by with notebooks assignments of homework and requests for weekly meetings no fewer than six reminded him that no member of had ever failed the bar exam when his secretary said goodbye at five the small desk was covered with enough bar review materials to choke a tenman firm unable to speak he simply smiled at her and returned to wallys version of contract law food crossed his mind an hour later then for the first time in twelve hours he thought of abby he called her i wont be home for a while he said but im cooking dinner leave it on the stove he said somewhat shortly there was a pause when will you be home she asked with slow precise words in a few hours a few hours youve already been there half the day thats right and ive got much more to do but its your first day you wouldnt believe it if i told you are you all right im fine ill be home later the starting engine awakened dutch hendrix and he jumped to his feet the gate opened and he waited by it as the last car left the lot it stopped next to him evenin dutch mitch said you just now leaving yeah busy day dutch flashed his light at his wrist and checked the time eleventhirty well be careful dutch said yeah see you in a few hours the bmw turned onto front street and raced away into the night a few hours thought dutch the rookies were indeed amazing eighteen twenty hours a day six days a week sometimes seven they all planned to be the worlds greatest lawyer and make a million dollars overnight sometimes they worked around the clock slept at their desks he had seen it all but they couldnt last the human body was not meant for such abuse after about six months they lost steam they would cut back to fifteen hours a day six days a week then five and a half then twelve hours a day no one could work a hundred hours a week for more than six months one secretary dug through a file cabinet in search of something avery needed immediately the other secretary stood in front of his desk with a steno pad occasionally writing down the instructions he gave when he stopped yelling into the receiver of his phone and listened to whoever was on the other end three red lights were blinking on the phone when he spoke into the receiver the secretaries spoke sharply to each other mitch walked slowly into the office and stood by the door quiet avery yelled to the secretaries the one in the file cabinet slammed the drawer and went to the next file cabinet where she bent over and pulled the bottom drawer avery snapped his fingers at the other one and pointed at his desk calendar he hung up without saying goodbye whats my schedule for today he asked while pulling a file from his credenza ten am meeting with the irs downtown one pm meeting with nathan locke on the spinosa file threethirty partners meeting tomorrow youre in tax court all day and youre supposed to prepare all day today great cancel everything check the flights to houston saturday afternoon and the return nights monday early monday yes sir mitch wheres the capps file on my desk how much have you done ive read through most of it we need to get in high gear that was sonny capps on the phone he wants to meet saturday morning in houston and he wants a rough draft of the limited partnership agreement mitch felt a nervous pain in his empty stomach if he recalled correctly the agreement was a hundred and fortysome pages long just a rough draft avery said as he pointed to a secretary no problem mitch said with as much confidence as he could muster it may not be perfect but ill have a rough draft i need it by noon saturday as perfect as possible ill get one of my secretaries to show nina where the form agreements are in the memory bank that will save some dictation and typing i know this is unfair but theres nothing fair about sonny capps hes very demanding he told me the deal must close in twenty days or its dead everything is waiting on us ill get it done good lets meet at eight in the morning to see where we are avery punched one of the blinking lights and began arguing into the receiver mitch walked to his office and looked for the capps file under the fifteen notebooks nina stuck her head in the door oliver lambert wants to see you when mitch asked as soon as you can get there mitch looked at his watch three hours at the office and he was ready to call it a day can it wait i dont think so mr lambert doesnt usually wait for anybody i see youd better go what does he want his secretary didnt say he put on his coat straightened his tie and raced upstairs to the fourth floor where mr lamberts secretary was waiting she introduced herself and informed him she had been with for thirtyone years in fact she was the second secretary hired by mr anthony bendini after he moved to memphis ida renfroe was her name but everyone called her mrs ida she showed him into the big office and closed the door oliver lambert stood behind his desk and removed his reading glasses he smiled warmly and laid his pipe in the brass holder good morning mitch he said softly as if time meant nothing lets sit over there he waved to the sofa would you like coffee mr lambert asked no thanks mitch sank into the couch and the partner sat in a stiff wing chair two feet away and three feet higher mitch unbuttoned his coat and tried to relax he crossed his legs and glanced at his new pair of colehaans two hundred bucks that was an hours work for an associate at this moneyprinting factory he tried to relax but he could feel the panic in averys voice and see the desperation in his eyes when he held the phone and listened to this capps fellow on the other end this his second full day on the job and his head was pounding and his stomach hurting mr lambert smiled downward with his best sincere grandfatherly smile it was time for a lecture of some sort he wore a brilliant white shirt buttondown allcotton pinpoint with a small dark silk bow tie which bestowed upon him a look of extreme intelligence and wisdom as always he was tanned beyond the usual midsummer memphis scorched bronzeness his teeth sparkled like diamonds a sixtyyearold model just a couple of things mitch he said i understand youve become quite busy yes sir quite panic is a way of life in a major law firm and clients like sonny capps can cause ulcers our clients are our only assets so we kill ourselves for them mitch smiled and frowned at the same time two things mitch first my wife and i want you and abby to have dinner with us saturday we dine out quite often and we enjoy having our friends with us i am somewhat of a chef myself and i appreciate fine food and drink we usually reserve a large table at one of our favorite restaurants in town invite our friends and spend the evening with a ninecourse meal and the rarest of wines will you and abby be free on saturday of course kendall mahan wally hudson lamar quin and their wives will also be there wed be delighted good my favorite place in memphis is justines its an old french restaurant with exquisite cuisine and an impressive wine list say seven saturday well be there second theres something we need to discuss im sure youre aware of it but its worth mentioning its very important to us i know they taught you at harvard that there exists a confidential relationship between yourself as a lawyer and your client its a privileged relationship and you can never be forced to divulge anything a client tells you its strictly confidential its a violation of our ethics if we discuss our clients business now this applies to every lawyer but at this firm we take this professional relationship very seriously we dont discuss a clients business with anyone not other lawyers not spouses sometimes not even each other as a rule we dont talk at home and our wives have learned not to ask the less you say the better off you are mr bendini was a great believer in secrecy and he taught us well you will never hear a member of this firm mention even so much as a clients name outside this building thats how serious we are wheres he going with this mitch asked himself any secondyear law student could give this speech i understand that mr lambert and you dont have to worry about me loose tongues lose lawsuits that was mr bendinis motto and he applied it to everything we simply do not discuss our clients business with anyone and that includes our wives were very quiet very secretive and we like it that way youll meet other lawyers around town and sooner or later theyll ask something about our firm or about a client we dont talk understand of course mr lambert good were very proud of you mitch youll make a great lawyer and a very rich lawyer see you saturday mrs ida had a message for mitch mr tolar needed him at once he thanked her and raced down the stairs down the hallway past his office to the big one in the corner there were now three secretaries digging and whispering to each other while the boss yelled into the telephone mitch found a safe spot in a chair by the door and watched the circus the women pulled files and notebooks and mumbled in strange tongues among themselves occasionally avery would snap his fingers and point here and there and they would jump like scared rabbits after a few minutes he slammed the phone down again without saying goodbye he glared at mitch sonny capps again the chinese want seventyfive million and hes agreed to pay it there will be fortyone limited partners instead of twentyfive we have twenty days or the deal is off two of the secretaries walked over to mitch and handed him thick expandable files can you handle it avery asked almost with a sneer the secretaries looked at him mitch grabbed the files and headed for the door of course i can handle it is that all its enough i dont want you to work on anything but that file between now and saturday understand yes boss in his office he removed the bar review materials all fifteen notebooks and piled them in a corner the capps file was arranged neatly across the desk he breathed deeply and began reading there was a knock at the door who is it nina stuck her head through i hate to tell you this but your new furniture is here he rubbed his temples and mumbled incoherently perhaps you could work in the library for a couple of hours perhaps they repacked the capps file and moved the fifteen notebooks into the hall where two large black men waited with a row of bulky cardboard boxes and an oriental rug nina followed him to the secondfloor library im supposed to meet with lamar quin at twoto study for the bar exam call him and cancel tell him ill explain later you have a two oclock meeting with gill vaughn she said cancel that one too hes a partner cancel it ill make it up later its not wise just do as i say youre the boss thank you the paperhanger was a short musclebound woman advanced in years but conditioned to hard work and superbly trained for almost forty years now she explained to abby she had hung expensive paper in the finest homes in memphis she talked constantly but wasted no motion she cut precisely like a surgeon then applied glue like an artist while it dried she removed her tape measure from her leather work belt and analyzed the remaining corner of the dining room she mumbled numbers which abby could not decipher she gauged the length and height in four different places then committed it all to memory she ascended the stepladder and instructed abby to hand her a roll of paper it fit perfectly she pressed it firmly to the wall and commented for the hundredth time on how nice the paper was how expensive how long it would look good and last she liked the color too it blended wonderfully with the curtains and the rug abby had long since grown tired of saying thanks she nodded and looked at her watch it was time to start dinner when the wall was finished abby announced it was quitting time and asked her to return at nine the next morning the lady said certainly and began cleaning up her mess she was being paid twelve dollars an hour cash and was agreeable to almost anything abby admired the room they would finish it tomorrow and the wallpapering would be complete except for two bathrooms and the den the painting was scheduled to begin next week the glue from the paper and the wet lacquer from the mantel and the newness of the furniture combined for a wonderful fresh aroma just like a new house abby said goodbye to the paperhanger and went to the bedroom where she undressed and lay across her bed she called her husband spoke briefly to nina and was told he was in a meeting and would be a while nina said he would call abby stretched her long sore legs and rubbed her shoulders the ceiling fan spun slowly above her mitch would be home eventually he would work a hundred hours a week for a while then cut back to eighty she could wait she awoke an hour later and jumped from the bed it was almost six veal piccata veal piccata she stepped into a pair of khaki walking shorts and slipped on a white polo she ran to the kitchen which was finished except for some paint and a set of curtains due in next week she found the recipe in a pasta cookbook and arranged the ingredients neatly on the countertop there had been little red meat in law school maybe an occasional hamburger steak when she cooked it had been chicken this or chicken that there had been a lot of sandwiches and hot dogs but now with all this sudden affluence it was time to learn to cook in the first week she prepared something new every night and they ate whenever he got home she planned the meals studied the cookbooks experimented with the sauces for no apparent reason mitch liked italian food and with spaghetti and pork cappellini tried and perfected it was time for veal piccata she pounded the veal scallops with a mallet until they were thin enough then laid them in flour seasoned with salt and pepper she put a pan of water on the burner for the linguine she poured a glass of chablis and turned on the radio she had called the office twice since lunch and he had not found time to return the calls she thought of calling again but said no it was his turn dinner would be fixed and they would eat whenever he got home the scallops were sauteed in hot oil for three minutes until the veal was tender then removed she poured the oil from the pan and added wine and lemon juice until it was boiling she scraped and stirred the pan to thicken the sauce she returned the veal to the pan and added mushrooms and artichokes and butter she covered the pan and let it simmer she fried bacon sliced tomatoes cooked linguine and poured another glass of wine by seven dinner was ready bacon and tomato salad with tubettini veal piccata and garlic bread in the oven he had not called she took her wine to the patio and looked around the backyard hearsay ran from under the shrubs together they walked the length of the yard surveying the bermuda and stopping under the two large oaks the remains of a longabandoned tree house were scattered among the middle branches of the largest oak initials were carved on its trunk a piece of rope hung from the other she found a rubber ball threw it and watched as the dog chased it she listened for the phone through the kitchen window it did not ring hearsay froze then growled at something next door mr rice emerged from a row of perfectly trimmed box hedges around his patio sweat dripped from his nose and his cotton undershirt was soaked he removed his green gloves and noticed abby across the chainlink fence under her tree he smiled he looked at her brown legs and smiled he wiped his forehead with a sweaty forearm and headed for the fence how are you he asked breathing heavy his thick gray hair dripped and clung to his scalp just fine mr rice how are you hot must be a hundred degrees abby slowly walked to the fence to chat she had caught his stares for a week now but did not mind he was at least seventy and probably harmless let him look plus he was a living breathing sweating human who could talk and maintain a conversation to some degree the paperhanger had been her only source of dialogue since mitch left before dawn your lawn looks great she said he wiped again and spat on the ground great you call this great this belongs in a magazine ive never seen a puttin green look this good i deserve garden of the month but they wont give it to me wheres your husband at the office hes working late its almost eight he mustve left before sunup this morning i take my walk at sixthirty and hes already gone whats with him he likes to work if i had a wife like you id stay at home couldnt make me leave abby smiled at the compliment how is mrs rice he frowned then yanked a weed out of the fence not too good im afraid not too good he looked away and bit his lip mrs rice was almost dead with cancer there were no children she had a year the doctors said a year at the most they had removed most of her stomach and the tumors were now in the lungs she weighed ninety pounds and seldom left the bed during their first visit across the fence his eyes watered when he talked of her and of how he would be alone after fiftyone years now they wont give me garden of the month wrong part of town it always goes to those rich folks who hire yard boys to do all the work while they sit by the pool and sip daiquiris it does look good doesnt it its incredible how many times a week do you mow three or four depends on the rain you want me to mow yours no i want mitch to mow it he aint got time seems like ill watch it and if it needs a little trim ill come over abby turned and looked at the kitchen window do you hear the phone she asked walking away mr rice pointed to his hearing aid she said goodbye and ran to the house the phone stopped when she lifted the receiver it was eightthirty almost dark she called the office but no one answered maybe he was driving home an hour before midnight the phone rang except for it and the light snoring the secondfloor office was without a sound his feet were on the new desk crossed at the ankles and numb from lack of circulation the rest of the body slouched comfortably in the thick leather executive chair he slumped to one side and intermittently exhaled the sounds of a deep sleep the capps file was strewn over the desk and one formidablelooking document was held firmly against his stomach his shoes were on the floor next to the desk next to a pile of documents from the capps file an empty potatochip bag was between the shoes after a dozen rings he moved then jumped at the phone it was his wife why havent you called she asked coolly yet with a slight touch of concern im sorry i fell asleep what time is it he rubbed his eyes and focused on his watch eleven i wish you would call i did call no one answered when between eight and nine where were you she did not answer she waited are you coming home no i need to work all night all night you cant work all night mitch of course i can work all night happens all the time around here its expected i expected you home mitch and the least you couldve done was call dinner is still on the stove im

you might be home are you scared no im not scared im going to bed ill come in around seven for a shower thats nice if im asleep dont wake me she hung up he looked at the receiver then put it in place on the fifth floor a security agent chuckled to himself dont wake me thats good he said as he pushed a button on the computerized recorder he punched three buttons and spoke into a small mike hey dutch wake up down there dutch woke up and leaned to the intercom yeah what is it this is marcus upstairs i think our boy plans to stay all night whats his problem right now its his wife he forgot to call her and she fixed a real nice supper aw thats too bad weve heard that before aint we yeah every rookie does it the first week anyway he told her he aint coming home till in the morning so go back to sleep marcus pushed some more buttons and returned to his magazine abby was waiting when the sun peeked between the oak trees she sipped coffee and held the dog and listened to the quiet sounds of her neighborhood stirring to life sleep had been fitful a hot shower had not eased the fatigue she wore a white terrycloth bathrobe one of his and nothing else her hair was wet and pulled straight back a car door slammed and the dog pointed inside the house she heard him unlock the kitchen door and moments later the sliding door to the patio opened he laid his coat on a bench near the door and walked over to her good morning he said then sat down across the wicker table she gave him a fake smile good morning to you youre up early he said in an effort at friendliness it did not work she smiled again and sipped her coffee he breathed deeply and gazed across the yard still mad about last night i see not really i dont carry a grudge i said i was sorry and i meant it i tried to call once you couldve called again please dont divorce me abby i swear it will never happen again just dont leave me she managed a genuine grin you look terrible she said whats under the robe nothing lets see

cutthroat business where the weak are eaten and the strong get rich its a marathon he who endures wins the gold and dies at the finish line i dont believe this we moved here a week ago and youre already worried about my health she sipped the coffee and rubbed the dog she was beautiful with tired eyes no makeup and wet hair she was beautiful he stood walked behind her and kissed her on the cheek i love you he whispered she clutched his hand on her shoulder go take a shower ill fix breakfast the table was arranged to perfection her grandmothers china was taken from the cabinet and used for the first time in the new home candles were lit in silver candlesticks grapefruit juice was poured in the crystal tea glasses linen napkins that matched the tablecloth were folded on the plates when he finished his shower and changed into a new burberry glen plaid he walked to the dining room and whistled whats the occasion its a special breakfast for a special husband he sat and admired the china the food was warming in a covered silver dish whatd you cook he asked smacking his lips she pointed and he removed the lid he stared at it whats this he asked without looking at her veal piccata veal what veal piccata he glanced at his watch i thought it was breakfast time i cooked it for dinner last night and i suggest you eat it veal piccata for breakfast she grinned firmly and shook her head slightly he looked again at the dish and for a second or two analyzed the situation finally he said smells good saturday morning he slept in and didnt get to the office until seven he didnt shave wore jeans an old buttondown no socks and bass loafers law school attire the capps agreement had been printed and reprinted late friday he made some further revisions and nina ran it again at eight friday night he assumed she had little or no social life so he didnt hesitate to ask her to work late she said she didnt mind overtime so he asked her to work saturday morning she arrived at nine wearing a pair of jeans that would fit a nose guard he handed her the agreement all two hundred and six pages with his latest changes and asked her to run it for the fourth time he was to meet with avery at ten the office changed on saturday all of the associates were there as well as most of the partners and a few of the secretaries there were no clients thus no dress code there was enough denim to launch a cattle drive no ties some of the preppier ones wore their finest starched duckheads with heavily starched buttondowns and seemed to crackle when they walked but the pressure was there at least for mitchell y mcdeere the newest associate he had canceled his bar review meetings on thursday friday and saturday and the fifteen notebooks sat on the shelf gathering dust and reminding him that he would indeed become the first member to flunk the bar exam at ten the fourth revision was complete and nina ceremoniously laid it on mitchs desk and left for the coffee room it had grown to two hundred and nineteen pages he had read every word four times and researched the tax code provisions until they were memorized he marched down the hall to his partners office and laid it on the desk a secretary was packing a mammoth briefcase while the boss talked on the phone how many pages avery asked when he hung up over two hundred this is quite impressive how rough is it not very thats the fourth revision since yesterday morning its almost perfect well see ill read it on the plane then capps will read it with a magnifying glass if he finds one mistake hell raise hell for an hour and threaten not to pay how many hours are in this fiftyfour and a half since wednesday i know ive pushed and i apologize youve had a tough first week but our clients sometimes push hard and this wont be the last time we break our necks for someone who pays us two hundred dollars an hour its part of the business i dont mind it im behind on the bar review but i can catch up is that little hudson twerp giving you a hard time no if he does let me know hes only a fiveyear man and he enjoys playing professor thinks hes a real academic i dont particularly like him hes no problem avery placed the agreement in the briefcase where are the prospectus and other documents ive done a very rough draft of each you said we had twenty days we do but lets get it done capps starts demanding things long before their deadlines are you working tomorrow i hadnt planned on it in fact my wife has sort of insisted we go to church avery shook his head wives can really get in the way cant they he said this without expecting a reply mitch did not respond lets have capps finished by next saturday fine no problem mitch said have we discussed kokerhanks avery asked while rummaging through a file no here it is kokerhanks is a big general contractor out of kansas city keeps about a hundred million under contract all over the country an outfit out of denver called holloway brothers has offered to buy kokerhanks they want to swap some stock some assets some contracts and throw in some cash pretty complicated deal familiarize yourself with the file and well discuss it tuesday morning when i get back how much time do we have thirty days it was not quite as thick as the capps file but just as imposing thirty days mitch mumbled the deal is worth eighty million and well rake off two hundred grand in fees not a bad deal every time you look at that file charge it for an hour work on it whenever you can in fact if the name kokerhanks crosses your mind while youre driving to work stick it for an hour the skys the limit on this one avery relished the thought of a client who would pay regardless of the charges mitch said goodbye and returned to his office about the time the cocktails were finished while they studied the wine list and listened to oliver lamberts comparison of the nuances the subtleties the distinctions of each of the french wines about the time mitch and abby realized they would much rather be home eating a pizza and watching tv two men with the correct key entered the shiny black bmw in the parking lot of justines they wore coats and ties and looked inconspicuous they sped away innocently and drove across midtown to the new home of mr and mrs mcdeere they parked the bmw where it belonged in the carport the driver produced another key and the two entered the house hearsay was locked in a closet in the washroom in the dark a small leather attache case was placed on the dining table thin disposable rubber gloves were pulled and stretched over the hands and each took a small flashlight do the phones first one said they worked quickly in the dark the receiver from the kitchen phone was unplugged and laid on the table the microphone was unscrewed and examined a tiny dropin transmitter the size of a raisin was glued in the cavity of the receiver and held firmly in place for ten seconds when the glue became firm the microphone was replaced and the receiver was plugged into the phone and hung on the kitchen wall the voices or signals would be transmitted to a small receiver to be installed in the attic a larger transmitter next to the receiver would send the signals across town to an antenna on top of the bendini building using the ac lines as a power source the small bugs in the phones would transmit indefinitely get the one in the den the attache case was moved to a sofa above the recliner they drove a small nail into a ridge in the paneling then removed it a thin black cylinder one twentieth of an inch by one inch was carefully placed in the hole it was cemented in place with a dab of black epoxy the microphone was invisible a wire the thickness of a human hair was gently fitted into the seam of the paneling and run to the ceiling it would be connected to a receiver in the attic identical mikes were hidden in the walls of each bedroom the men found the retractable stairs in the main hallway and climbed into the attic one removed the receiver and transmitter from the case while the other painstakingly pulled the tiny wires from the walls when he gathered them he wrapped them together and laid them under the insulation and ran them to a corner where his partner was placing the transmitter in an old cardboard box an ac line was spliced and wired to the unit to provide power and transmission a small antenna was raised to within an inch of the roof decking their breathing became heavier in the sweltering heat of the dark attic the small plastic casing of an old radio was fitted around the transmitter and they scattered insulation and old clothing around it it was in a remote corner and not likely to be noticed for months maybe years and if it was noticed it would appear to be only worthless junk it could be picked up and thrown away without suspicion they admired their handiwork for a second then descended the stairs they meticulously covered their tracks and were finished in ten minutes hearsay was released from the closet and the men crept into the carport they backed quickly out the driveway and sped into the night as the baked pompano was served the bmw parked quietly next to the restaurant the driver fished through his pockets and found the key to a maroon jaguar property of mr kendall mahan attorneyatlaw the two technicians locked the bmw and slid into the jag the mahans lived much closer than the mcdeeres and judging from the floor plans the job would be quicker on the fifth floor of the bendini building marcus stared at a panel of blinking lights and waited for some signal from east meadowbrook the dinner party had broken up thirty minutes earlier and it was time to listen a tiny yellow light flashed weakly and he draped a headset over his ears he pushed a button to record he waited a green light beside the code mcd began flashing it was the bedroom wall the signals grew clearer voices at first faint then very clear he increased the volume and listened jill mahan is a bitch the female mrs mcdeere was saying the more she drank the bitchier she got i think shes a blue blood of some sort mr mcdeere replied her husband is okay but shes a real snot mrs mcdeere said are you drunk asked mr mcdeere almost im ready for passionate sex marcus increased the volume and leaned toward the blinking lights take your clothes off demanded mrs mcdeere we havent done this in a while said mr mcdeere marcus stood and hovered above the switches and lights and whose fault is that she asked i havent forgotten how youre beautiful get in the bed she said marcus turned the dial marked volume until it would go no further he smiled at the lights and breathed heavily he loved these associates fresh from law school and full of energy he smiled at the sounds of their lovemaking he closed his eyes and watched them the capps crisis passed in two weeks without disaster thanks largely to a string of eighteenhour days by the newest member of a member who had not yet passed the bar exam and who was too busy practicing law to worry about it in july he billed an average of fiftynine hours a week a firm record for a nonlawyer avery proudly informed the partners at the monthly meeting that mcdeeres work was remarkable for a rookie the capps deal was closed three days ahead of schedule thanks to mcdeere the documents totaled four hundred pages all perfect all meticulously researched drafted and redrafted by mcdeere kokerhanks would close within a month thanks to mcdeere and would earn close to a quarter of a mill he was a machine oliver lambert expressed concern over his study habits the bar exam was less than three weeks away and it was obvious to all that mcdeere was not ready he had canceled half his review sessions in july and had logged less than twenty hours avery said not to worry his boy would be ready fifteen days before the exam mitch finally complained he was about to flunk it he explained to avery over lunch at the manhattan club and he needed time to study lots of time he could cram it in for the next two weeks and pass by the hair of his ass but he had to be left alone no deadlines no emergencies no allnighters he pleaded avery listened carefully and apologized he promised to ignore him for the next two weeks mitch said thanks on the first monday in august a firm meeting was called in the main library on the first floor it was the meeting room the largest of the four libraries the showplace half the lawyers sat around the antique cherry conference table with twenty chairs under it the rest stood next to the shelves of thick leather law books which had not been opened in decades every member was present even nathan locke he arrived late and stood next to the door by himself he spoke to no one and no one looked at him mitch stole a glance at black eyes when possible the mood was somber no smiles beth kozinski and laura hodge were escorted through the door by oliver lambert they were seated at the front of the room facing a wall where two veiled portraits hung they held hands and tried to smile mr lambert stood with his back to the wall and faced the small audience he spoke softly his rich baritone exuding sympathy and compassion he almost whispered at first but the power of his voice made every sound and every syllable clear throughout the room he looked at the two widows and told of the deep sadness felt how they would always be taken care of as long as there was a firm he talked of marty and joe of their first few years with of their importance to of the vast voids their deaths created he spoke of their love for their families their dedication to their homes the man was eloquent he spoke in prose with no forethought as to what the next sentence would be the widows cried softly and wiped their eyes and then some of the closer ones lamar quin and doug turney began to sniffle when he had said enough he unveiled the portrait of martin kozinski it was an emotional moment there were more tears there would be a scholarship established at the chicago law school in his name would set up trusts for his childrens education the family would be taken care of beth bit her lip but cried louder the seasoned hardened toughasnails negotiators of the great bendini firm swallowed rapidly and avoided looking at each other only nathan locke was unmoved he glared at the wall with his penetrating lasers and ignored the ceremony then the portrait of joe hodge and a similar biography similar scholarship and trust funds mitch had heard a rumor that hodge purchased a twomilliondollar life insurance policy four months before his death when the eulogies were complete nathan locke disappeared through the door the lawyers surrounded the widows and offered quiet words and embraces mitch did not know them and had nothing to say he walked to the front wall and examined the paintings next to those of kozinski and hodge were three slightly smaller but equally dignified portraits the one of the woman caught his attention the brass plate read alice knauss she was a mistake avery said under his breath as he stepped next to his associate what do you mean mitch asked typical female lawyer came here from harvard number one in her class and carrying a chip because she was a female thought every man alive was a sexist and it was her mission in life to eliminate discrimination superbitch after six months we all hated her but couldnt get rid of her she forced two partners into early retirement milligan still blames her for his heart attack he was her partner was she a good lawyer very good but it was impossible to appreciate her talents she was so contentious about everything what happened to her car wreck killed by a drunk driver it was really tragic was she the first woman yes and the last unless we get sued mitch nodded to the next portrait who was he robert lamm he was a good friend of mine emory law school in atlanta he was about three years ahead of me what happened no one knows he was an avid hunter we hunted moose in wyoming one winter in he was deer hunting in arkansas and turned up missing they found him a month later in a ravine with a hole through his head autopsy said the bullet entered through the rear of his skull and blew away most of his face they speculate the shot was fired from a highpowered rifle at long range it was probably an accident but well never know i could never imagine anyone wanting to kill bobby lamm the last portrait was of john mickel what happened to him mitchwhispered probably the most tragic of all he was not a strong man and the pressure got to him he drank a lot and started drugs then his wife left him and they had a bitter divorce was embarrassed after he had been here ten years he began to fear he would not become a partner the drinking got worse we spent a small fortune on treatment shrinks everything but nothing worked he became depressed then suicidal he wrote a sevenpage suicide note and blew his brains out thats terrible sure was whered they find him avery cleared his throat and glanced around the room in your office what yeah but they cleaned it up youre kidding no im serious it was years ago and the office has been used since then its okay mitch was speechless youre not superstitious are you avery asked with a nasty grin of course not i guess i shouldve told you but its not something we talk about can i change offices sure just flunk the bar exam and well give you one of those paralegal offices in the basement if i flunk it itll be because of you yes but you wont flunk it will you if you can pass it so can i from am to am the bendini building was empty and quiet nathan locke arrived around six but went straight to his office and locked the door at seven the associates began appearing and voices could be heard by seventhirty had a quorum and a handful of secretaries punched in by eight the halls were full and it was chaos as usual concentration became difficult interruptions were routine phones beeped incessantly by nine all lawyers paralegals clerks and secretaries were either present or accounted for mitch treasured the solitude of the early hours he moved his clock up thirty minutes and began waking dutch at five instead of fivethirty after making two pots of coffee he roamed the dark halls flipping light switches and inspecting the building occasionally on a clear morning he would stand before the window in lamars office and watch the dawn break over the mighty mississippi below he would count the barges lined neatly before their tugboats plowing slowly upriver he watched the trucks inch across the bridge in the distance but he wasted little time he dictated letters briefs summaries memorandums and a hundred other documents for nina to type and avery to review he crammed for the bar exam the morning after the ceremony for the dead lawyers he found himself in the library on the first floor looking for a treatise when he again noticed the five portraits he walked to the wall and stared at them remembering the brief obituaries given by avery five dead lawyers in twenty years it was a dangerous place to work on a legal pad he scribbled their names and the years they died it was fivethirty something moved in the hallway and he jerked to his right in the darkness he saw black eyes watching he stepped forward to the door and glared at mitch what are you doing he demanded mitch faced him and attempted a smile good morning to you it happens i am studying for the bar exam locke glanced at the portraits and then stared at mitch i see why are you so interested in them just curious this firm has had its share of tragedy theyre all dead a real tragedy will occur if you dont pass the bar exam i intend to pass it ive heard otherwise your study habits are causing concern among the partners are the partners concerned about my excessive billing dont get smart you were told the bar exam has priority over everything an employee with no license is of no use to this firm mitch thought of a dozen smart retorts but let it pass locke stepped backward and disappeared in his office with the door closed mitch hid the names and dates in a drawer and opened a review book on constitutional law the saturday after the bar exam mitch avoided his office and his house and spent the morning digging in the flower beds and waiting with the remodeling complete the house was now presentable and of course the first guests had to be her parents abby had cleaned and polished for a week and it was now time she promised they wouldnt stay long no more than a few hours he promised to be as nice as possible mitch had washed and waxed both new cars and they looked as if they had just left the showroom the lawn had been manicured by a kid down the street mr rice had applied fertilizer for a month and it looked like a puttin green as he liked to say at noon they arrived and he reluctantly left the flower beds he smiled and greeted them and excused himself to go clean up he could tell they were uncomfortable and he wanted it that way he took a long shower as abby showed them every piece of furniture and every inch of wallpaper these things impressed the sutherlands small things always did they dwelt on the things others did or did not have he was the president of a small county bank that had been on the verge of collapse for ten years she was too good to work and had spent all of her adult life seeking social advancement in a town where there was none to be had she had traced her ancestry to royalty in one of the old countries and this had always impressed the coal miners in danesboro kentucky with so much blue blood in her veins it had fallen her duty to do nothing but drink hot tea play bridge talk of her husbands money condemn the less fortunate and work tirelessly in the garden club he was a stuffed shirt who jumped when she barked and lived in eternal fear of making her mad as a team they had relentlessly pushed their daughter from birth to be the best achieve the best but most importantly marry the best their daughter had rebelled and married a poor kid with no family except a crazy mother and a criminal brother nice place youve got here mitch mr sutherland said in an effort to break the ice they sat for lunch and began passing dishes thanks nothing else just thanks he concentrated on the food there would be no smiles from him at lunch the less he said the more uncomfortable they would be he wanted them to feel awkward guilty wrong he wanted them to sweat to bleed it had been their decision to boycott the wedding it had been their stones cast not his everything is so lovely her mother gushed in his direction thanks were so proud of it mother abby said the conversation immediately went to the remodeling the men ate in silence as the women chattered on and on about what the decorator did to this room and that one at times abby was almost desperate to fill in the gaps with words about whatever came to mind mitch almost felt sorry for her but he kept his eyes on the table the butter knife could have cut the tension so youve found a job mrs sutherland asked yes i start a week from monday ill be teaching thirdgraders at st andrews episcopal school teaching doesnt pay much her father blurted hes relentless thought mitch im not concerned with money dad im a teacher to me its the most important profession in the world if i wanted money i wouldve gone to medical school thirdgraders her mother said thats such a cute age youll be wanting children before long mitch had already decided that if anything would attract these people to memphis on a regular basis it was grandchildren and he had decided he could wait a long time he had never been around children there were no nieces or nephews except for maybe a few unknown ones ray had scattered around the country and he had developed no affinity for children maybe in a few years mother maybe after theyre both dead thought mitch you want children dont you mitch asked the motherinlaw maybe in a few years mr sutherland pushed his plate away and lit a cigarette the issue of smoking had been repeatedly discussed in the days before the visit mitch wanted it banned completely from his house especially by these people they had argued vehemently and abby won how was the bar exam the fatherinlaw asked this could be interesting mitch thought grueling abby chewed her food nervously do you think you passed i hope so when will you know four to six weeks how long did it last four days hes done nothing but study and work since we moved here i havent seen much of him this summer abby said mitch smiled at his wife the time away from home was already a sore subject and it was amusing to hear her condone it what happens if you dont pass it her father asked i dont know i havent thought about it do they give you a raise when you pass mitch decided to be nice as he had promised but it was difficult yes a nice raise and a nice bonus how many lawyers are in forty my goodness said mrs sutherland she lit up one of hers theres not that many in dane county wheres your office he asked downtown can we see it she asked maybe some other time its closed to visitors on saturdays mitch amused himself with his answer closed to visitors as if it was a museum abby sensed disaster and began talking about the church they had joined it had four thousand members a gymnasium and bowling alley she sang in the choir and taught eightyearolds in sunday school mitch went when he was not working but hed been working most sundays im happy to see youve found a church home abby her father said piously for years he had led the prayer each sunday at the first methodist church in danesboro and the other six days he had tirelessly practiced greed and manipulation he had also steadily but discreetly pursued whiskey and women an awkward silence followed as the conversation came to a halt he lit another one keep smoking old boy mitch thought keep smoking lets have dessert on the patio abby said she began clearing the table they bragged about his gardening skills and he accepted the credit the same kid down the street had pruned the trees pulled the weeds trimmed the hedges and edged the patio mitch was proficient only in pulling weeds and scooping dog crap he could also operate the lawn sprinkler but usually let mr rice do it abby served strawberry shortcake and coffee she looked helplessly at her husband but he was noncommittal this is a real nice place youve got here her father said for the third time as he surveyed the backyard mitch could see his mind working he had taken the measure of the house and neighborhood and the curiosity was becoming unbearable how much did the place cost dammit thats what he wanted to know how much down how much a month everything he would keep pecking away until he could work in the questions somewhere this is a lovely place her mother said for the tenth time when was it built her father asked mitch laid his plate on the table and cleared his throat he could sense it coming its about fifteen years old he answered how many square feet about three thousand abby answered nervously mitch glared at her his composure was vanishing its a lovely neighborhood her mother added helpfully new loan or did you assume one her father asked as if he were interviewing a loan applicant with weak collateral its a new loan mitch said then waited abby waited and prayed he didnt wait couldnt wait whatd you pay for it mitch breathed deeply and was about to say too much abby was quicker we didnt pay too much daddy she said firmly with a frown were quite capable of handling our money mitch managed a smile while biting his tongue mrs sutherland was on her feet lets go for a drive shall we i want to see the river and that new pyramid theyve built beside it shall we come on harold harold wanted more information about the house but his wife was now tugging on his arm great idea abby said they loaded into the shiny new bmw and went to see the river abby asked them not to smoke in the new car mitch drove in silence and tried to be nice nina entered the office in a rush with a stack of paper work and laid it before her boss i need signatures she demanded and handed him his pen what is all this mitch asked as he dutifully scribbled his name dont ask just trust me i found a misspelled word in the landmark partners agreement its the computer okay get the computer fixed how late are you working tonight mitch scanned the documents and signed off on each i dont know why you look tired why dont you go home early say around ten or tenthirty and get some rest your eyes are beginning to look like nathan lockes very funny your wife called ill call her in a minute when he finished she restacked the letters and documents its five oclock im leaving oliver lambert is waiting on you in the firstfloor library oliver lambert waiting on me thats what i said he called not more than five minutes ago said it was very important mitch straightened his tie and ran down the hall down the stairs and walked casually into the library lambert avery and what appeared to be most of the partners sat around the conference table all of the associates were present standing behind the partners the seat at the head of the table was empty and waiting the room was quiet almost solemn there were no smiles lamar was close by and refused to look at him avery was sheepish sort of embarrassed wally hudson twirled the end of his bow tie and slowly shook his head sit down mitch mr lambert said gravely we have something to discuss with you doug turney closed the door he sat and searched for any small sign of reassurance none the partners rolled their chairs in his direction squeezing together in the process the associates surrounded him and glared downward what is it he asked meekly looking helplessly at avery small beads of sweat surfaced above his eyebrows his heart pounded like a jackhammer his breathing was labored oliver lambert leaned across the edge of the table and removed his reading glasses he frowned sincerely as if this would be painful weve just received a call from nashville mitch and we wanted to talk with you about it the bar exam the bar exam the bar exam history had been made an associate of the great bendini firm had finally flunked the bar exam he glared at avery and wanted to scream its all your fault avery pinched his eyebrows as if a migraine had hit and avoided eye contact lambert eyed the other partners suspiciously and returned to mcdeere we were afraid this would happen mitch he wanted to speak to explain that he deserved just one more chance that the exam would be given again in six months and he would ace it that he would not embarrass them again a thick pain hit below the belt yes sir he said humbly in defeat lambert moved in for the kill we arent supposed to know these things but the folks in nashville told us that you made the highest score on the bar exam congratulations counselor the room exploded with laughter and cheers they gathered around and shook his hand patted his back and laughed at him avery rushed forward with a handkerchief and wiped his forehead kendall mahan slammed three bottles of champagne on the table and began popping corks a round was poured into plastic wineglasses he finally breathed and broke into a smile he slugged the champagne and they poured him another glass oliver lambert placed his arm gently around mitchs neck and spoke mitch we are very proud of you this calls for a little bonus i have here a firm check in the amount of two thousand dollars which i am presenting to you as a small reward for this achievement there were whistles and catcalls this is of course in addition to the substantial raise you have just earned more whistles and catcalls mitch took the check but did not look at it mr lambert raised his hand and asked for quiet on behalf of i would like to present you with this lamar handed him a package wrapped in brown paper mr lambert peeled it off and threw it on the table its a plaque which we prepared in anticipation of this day as you can see it is a bronzed replica of a piece of firm stationery complete with every name as you can also see the name of mitchell y mcdeere has been added to the letterhead mitch stood and awkwardly received the award the color had returned to his face and the champagne was beginning to feel good thank you he said softly three days later the memphis paper published the names of the attorneys who passed the bar exam abby clipped the article for the scrapbook and sent copies to her parents and ray mitch had discovered a deli three blocks from the bendini building between front street and riverside drive near the river it was a dark hole in the wall with few customers and greasy chili dogs he liked it because he could sneak away and proofread a document while he ate now that he was a fullblown associate he could eat a hot dog for lunch and bill a hundred and fifty an hour a week after his name was in the paper he sat by himself at a table in the rear of the deli and ate a chili dog with a york the place was empty he read a prospectus an inch thick the greek who ran the place was asleep behind the cash register a stranger approached his table and stopped a few feet away he unraveled a piece of juicy fruit making as much noise as possible when it was apparent he was not being seen he walked to the table and sat down mitch looked across the redcheckered tablecloth and laid the document next to the iced tea can i help you he asked the stranger glanced at the counter glanced at the empty tables and glanced behind him youre mcdeere arent you it was a rich brogue undoubtedly brooklyn mitch studled him carefully he was about forty with a short military haircut on the sides and a wisp of gray hair hanging almost to his eyebrows the suit was a threepiece navy in color made of at least ninety percent polyester the tie was cheap imitation silk he wasnt much of a dresser but there was a certain neatness about him and an air of cockiness yeah who are you mitch asked he grabbed his pocket and whipped out a badge tarranee wayne tarrance special agent fbi he raised his eyebrows and waited for a response have a seat mitch said dont mind if i do do you want to frisk me not till later i just wanted to meet you saw your name in the paper and heard you were the new man at bendini lambert locke why should that interest the fbi we watch that firm pretty close mitch lost interest in the chili dog and slid the plate to the center of the table he added more sweetener to his tea in a large styrofoam cup would you like something to drink mitch asked no thanks why do you watch the bendini firm tarrance smiled and looked toward the greek i cant really say at this point we got our reasons but i didnt come here to talk about that i came here to meet you and to warn you to warn me yes to warn you about im listening three things number one dont trust anyone theres not a single person in that firm you can confide in remember that it will become important later on number two every word you utter whether at home at the office or anywhere in the building is likely to be recorded they might even listen to you in your car mitch watched and listened intently tarrance was enjoying this and number three mitch asked number three money dont grow on trees would you care to elaborate i cant right now i think you and i will become very close i want you to trust me and i know ill have to earn your trust so i dont want to move too fast we cant meet at your office or my office and we cant talk on the phone so from time to time ill come find you in the meantime just remember those three things and be careful tarrance stood and reached for his wallet heres my card my home number is on the back use it only from a pay phone mitch studied the card why should i be calling you you wont need to for a while but keep the card mitch placed it in his shirt pocket theres one other thing tarrance said we saw you at the funerals of hodge and kozinski sad really sad their deaths were not accidental he looked down at mitch with both hands in his pockets and smiled i dont understand tarrance started for the door gimme a call sometime but be careful remember theyre listening a few minutes after four a horn honked and dutch bolted to his feet he cursed and walked in front of the headlights dammit mitch its four oclock whatre you doing here sorry dutch couldnt sleep rough night the gate opened by seventhirty he had dictated enough work to keep nina busy for two days she bitched less when her nose was glued to the monitor his immediate goal was to become the first associate to justify a second secretary at eight oclock he parked himself in lamars office and waited he proofed a contract and drank coffee and told lamars secretary to mind her own business he arrived at eightfifteen we need to talk mitch said as he closed the door if he believed tarrance the office was bugged and the conversation would be recorded he was not sure whom to believe you sound serious lamar said ever hear of a guy named tarrance wayne tarrance no fbi lamar closed his eyes fbi he mumbled thats right he had a badge and everything where did you meet him he found me at lanskys deli on union he knew who i was knew id just been admitted says he knows all about they watch us real close have you told avery no no one but you im not sure what to do lamar picked up the phone we need to tell avery i think this has happened before whats going on lamar lamar talked to averys secretary and said it was an emergency in a few seconds he was on the other end weve got a small problem avery an fbi agent contacted mitch yesterday hes in my office lamar listened then said to mitch hes got me on hold said he was calling lambert i take it this is pretty serious mitch said yes but dont worry theres an explanation its happened before lamar held the receiver closer and listened to the instructions he hung up they want us in lamberts office in ten minutes avery royce mcknight oliver lambert harold okane and nathan locke were waiting they stood nervously around the small conference table and tried to appear calm when mitch entered the office have a seat nathan locke said with a short plastic smile we want you to tell us everything whats that mitch pointed to a tape recorder in the center of the table we dont want to miss anything locke said and pointed to an empty chair mitch sat and stared across the table at black eyes avery sat between them no one made a sound okay i was eating lunch yesterday at lanskys deli on union this guy walks up and sits across my table he knows my name shows me a badge and says his name is wayne tarrance special agent fbi i look at the badge and its real he tells me he wants to meet because well get to know each other they watch this firm real close and he warns me not to trust anyone i ask him why and he said he doesnt have time to explain but he will later i dont know what to say so i just listen he says he will contact me later he gets up to leave and tells me they saw me atthe funerals then he says the deaths of kozinski and hodge were not accidents and he leaves the entire conversation lasted less than five minutes black eyes glared at mitch and absorbed every word have you ever seen this man before never whom did you tell only lamar i told him first thing this morning your wife no did he leave you a phone number to call no i want to know every word that was said locke demanded ive told you what i remember i cant recall it verbatim are you certain let me think a minute a few things he would keep to himself he stared at black eyes and knew that locke suspected more lets see he said he saw my name in the paper and knew i was the new man here thats it ive covered everything it was a very brief conversation try to remember everything locke persisted i asked him if he wanted some of my tea he declined the tape recorder was turnedoff and the partners seemed to relax a little locke walked to the window mitch weve had trouble with the fbi as well as the irs its been going on for a number of years some of our clients are high rollerswealthy individuals who make millions spend millions and expect to pay little or no taxes they pay us thousands of dollars to legally avoid taxes we have a reputation for being very aggressive and we dont mind taking chances if our clients instruct us to were talking about very sophisticated businessmen who understand risks they pay dearly for our creativeness some of the shelters and writeoffs we set up have been challenged by the irs weve slugged it out with them in tax litigation for the past twenty years they dont like us we dont like them some of our clients have not always possessed the highest degree of ethics and they have been investigated and harassed by the fbi for the past three years we too have been harassed tarrance is a rookie looking for a big name hes been here less than a year and has become a thorn you are not to speak to him again your brief conversation yesterday was probably recorded he is dangerous extremely dangerous he does not play fair and youll learn soon enough that most of the feds dont play fair how many of these clients have been convicted not a single one and weve won our share of litigation with the irs what about kozinski and hodge good question answered oliver lambert we dont know what happened it first appeared to be an accident but now were not sure there was a native of the islands on board with marty and joe he was the captain and divemaster the authorities down there now tell us they suspect he was a key link in a drug ring based in jamaica and perhaps the explosion was aimed at him he died of course i dont think well ever know royce mcknight added the police down there are not that sophisticated weve chosen to protect the families and as far as were concerned it was an accident frankly were not sure how to handle it dont breathe a word of this to anyone locke instructed stay away from tarrance and if he contacts you again let us know immediately understand yes sir dont even tell your wife avery said mitch nodded the grandfathers warmth returned to oliver lamberts face he smiled and twirled his reading glasses mitch we know this is frightening but weve grown accustomed to it let us handle it and trust us we are not afraid of mr tarrance the fbi the irs or anybody else because weve done nothing wrong anthony bendini built this firm by hard work talent and uncompromising ethics it has been drilled into all of us some of our clients have not been saints but no lawyer can dictate morals to his client we dont want you worrying about this stay away from this guyhe is very very dangerous if you feed him hell get bolder and become a nuisance locke pointed a crooked finger at mitch further contact with tarrance will jeopardize your future with this firm i understand mitch said he understands avery said defensively locke glared at tolar thats all we have mitch mr lambert said be cautious mitch and lamar hit the door and found the nearest stairway get devasher locke said to lambert who was on the phone within two minutes the two senior partners had been cleared and were sitting before devashers cluttered desk did you listen locke asked of course i listened to it nat we heard every word the boy said you handled it real well i think hes scared and will run from tarrance what about lazarov i gotta tell him hes the boss we cant pretend it didnt happen what will they do nothing serious well watch the boy around the clock and check all his phone calls and wait hes not gonna move its up to tarrance hell find him again and the next time well be there try to keep him in the building as much as possible when he leaves let us know if you can i dont think its that bad really why would they pick mcdeere asked locke new strategy i guess kozinski and hodge went to them remember maybe they talked more than we thought i dont know maybe they figure mcdeere is the most vulnerable because hes fresh out of school and full of rookie idealism and ethicslike our ethical friend ollie here that was good ollie real good shut up devasher devasher quit smiling and bit his bottom lip he let it pass he looked at locke you know what the next step is dont you if tarrance keeps pushing that idiot lazarov will call me one day and tell me to remove him silence him put him in a barrel and drop him in the gulf and when that happens all of you honorable esquires will take your early retirement and leave the country lazarov wouldnt order a hit on an agent oh it would be a foolish move but then lazarov is a fool hes very anxious about the situation down here he calls a lot and asks all sorts of questions i give him all sorts of answers sometimes he listens sometimes he cusses sometimes he says hes gotta talk to the board but if he tells me to take out tarrance then well take out tarrance this makes me sick at my stomach lambert said you wanna get sick ollie you let one of your little gucciloafered counselors get chummy with tarrance and start talking youll get a helluva lot worse than sick now i suggest you boys keep mcdeere so busy he wont have time to think about tarrance my god devasher he works twenty hours a day he started like fire and he hasnt slowed down just watch him close tell lamar quin to get real tight with him so if hes got something on his mind maybe hell unload good idea said locke he looked at ollie lets have a long talk with quin hes closest to mcdeere and maybe he can get closer look boys devasher said mcdeere is scared right now he wont make a move if tarrance contacts him again hell do what he did today hell run straight to lamar quin he showed us who he confides in did he tell his wife last night asked locke were checking the tapes now itll take about an hour weve got so damned many bugs in this city it takes six computers to find anything mitch stared through the window in lamars office and selected his words carefully he said little suppose tarrance was correct suppose everything was being recorded do you feel better lamar asked yeah i guess it makes sense its happened before just like locke said who who was approached before i dont remember seems like it was three or four years ago but you dont remember who it was no why is that important id just like to know i dont understand why they would pick me the new man the one lawyer out of forty who knows the least about this firm and its clients why would they pick me i dont know mitch look why dont you do as locke suggested try to forget about it and run from this guy tarrance you dont have to talk to him unless hes got a warrant tell him to get lost if he shows up again hes dangerous yeah i guess youre right mitch forced a smile and headed for the door were still on for dinner tomorrow night sure kay wants to grill steaks and eat by the pool make it late say around seventhirty see you then the guard called his name frisked him and led him to a large room where a row of small booths was occupied with visitors talking and whispering through thick metal screens number fourteen the guard said and pointed mitch walked to his booth and sat down a minute later ray appeared and sat between his dividers on the other side of the screen were it not for a scar on rays forehead and a few wrinkles around the eyes they could pass for twins both were sixtwo weighed about oneeighty with light brown hair small blue eyes high cheekbones and large chins they had always been told there was indian blood in the family but the dark skin had been lost through years in the coal mines mitch had not been to brushy mountain in three years three years and three months theyd exchanged letters twice a month every month for eight years now hows your french mitch finally asked rays army test scores had revealed an amazing aptitude for languages he had served two years as a vietnamese interpreter he had mastered german in six months while stationed there spanish had taken four years but he was forced to learn it from a dictionary in the prison library french was his latest project im fluent i guess ray answered its kinda hard to tell in here i dont get much practice evidently they dont teach french in the projects so most of these brothers here are unilingual its undoubtedly the most beautiful language is it easy not as easy as german of course it was easier to learn german since i was living there and everybody spoke it did you know that fifty percent of our language conies from german through old english no i didnt know that its true english and german are first cousins whats next probably italian its a romance language like french and spanish and portuguese maybe russian maybe greek ive been reading about the greek isles i plan to go there soon mitch smiled he was at least seven years away from parole you think im kidding dont you ray asked im checking out of here mitchell and it wont be long what are your plans i cant talk but im working on it dont do it ray ill need some help on the outside and enough money to get me out of the country a thousand should do it you can handle that cant you you wont be implicated arent they listening to us sometimes lets talk about something else sure hows abby shes fine where is she right now shes in church she wanted to come but i told her she wouldnt get to see you id like to see her your letters sound like yall are doing real well new house cars country club im very proud of you youre the first mcdeere in two generations to amount to a damned thing our parents were good people ray they had no opportunities and a lot of bad luck they did the best they could ray smiled and looked away yeah i guess so have you talked to mom its been a while is she still in florida i think so they paused and studied their fingers they thought of their mother painful thoughts for the most part there had been happier times when they were small and their father was alive she never recovered from his death and after rusty was killed the aunts and uncles put her in an institution ray took his finger and followed the small metal rods in the screen he watched his finger lets talk about something else mitch nodded in agreement there was so much to talk about but it was all in the past they had nothing in common but the past and it was best to leave it alone you mentioned in a letter that one of your excellmates is a private investigator in memphis eddie lomax he was a memphis cop for nine years until he got sent up for rape rape yeah he had a tough time here rapists are not well regarded around this place cops are hated they almost killed him until i stepped in hes been out about three years now he writes me all the time does mainly divorce investigations is he in the phone book why do you need him ive got a lawyer buddy whose wife is fooling around but he cant catch her is this guy good very good so he says hes made some money can i trust him are you kidding tell him youre my brother and hell kill for you hes gonna help me get out of here he just doesnt know it you might mention it to him i wish youd stop that a guard walked behind mitch three minutes he said what can i send you mitch asked id like a real favor if you dont mind anything go to a bookstore and look for one of those cassette courses on how to speak greek in twentyfour hours that plus a greektoenglish dictionary would be nice ill send it next week how about italian too no problem im undecided about whether to go to sicily or the greek isles its really got me tore up i asked the prison minister about it and he was of no help ive thought of going to the warden what do you think mitch chuckled and shook his head why dont you go to australia great idea send me some tapes in australian and a dictionary they both smiled then stopped they watched each other carefully and waited for the guard to call time mitch looked at the scar on his forehead and thought of the countless bars and countless fights that led to the inevitable killing selfdefense ray called it for years he had wanted to cuss ray for being so stupid but the anger had passed now he wanted to embrace him and take him home and help him find a job dont feel sorry for me ray said abby wants to write you id like that i barely remember her as a small girl in danesboro hanging around her daddys bank on main street tell her to send me a picture and id like a picture of your house youre the first mcdeere in a hundred years to own real estate i gotta go do me a favor i think you need to find mom just to make sure shes alive now that youre out of school it would be nice to reach out to her ive thought about that think about it some more okay sure ill see you in a month or so devasher sucked on a roitan and blew a lungful of smoke into his air purifier we found ray mcdeere he announced proudly where asked ollie brushy mountain

the building was in the lowrent section of downtown a couple of blocks from the shadows of the modern steelandglass towers which were packed together as if land was scarce in memphis a sign on a door directed ones attention upstairs where eddie lomax private investigator maintained an office hours by appointment only the door upstairs advertised investigations of all typesdivorces accidents missing relatives surveillance the ad in the phone book mentioned the police expertise but not the ending of that career it listed eavesdropping countermeasures child custody photographs courtroom evidence voicestress analysis location of assets insurance claims and premarital background review bonded insured licensed and available twentyfour hours a day ethical reliable confidential peace of mind mitch was impressed with the abundance of confidence the appointment was for pm and he arrived a few minutes early a shapely platinum blonde with a constricting leather skirt and matching black boots asked for his name and pointed to an orange vinyl chair next to a window eddie would be a minute he inspected the chair and noticing a fine layer of dust and several spots of what appeared to be grease he declined and said his back was sore tammy shrugged and returned to her gum chewing and typing of some document mitch speculated whether it was a premarital report or maybe a surveillance summary or perhaps a countermeasure attack plan the ashtray on her desk was filled with butts smeared with pink lipstick while typing with her left hand the right one instantly and precisely picked another cigarette from the pack and thrust it between her sticky lips with remarkable coordination she nicked something with her left hand and a flame shot to the tip of a very skinny and incredibly long liberated cigarette when the flame disappeared the lips instinctively compacted and hardened around the tiny protrusion and the entire body began to inhale letters became words words became sentences sentences became paragraphs as she tried desperately to fill her lungs finally with an inch of the cigarette hanging as ashes she swallowed picked it from her lips with two brilliant red fingernails and exhaled mightily the smoke billowed toward the stained plaster ceiling where it upset an existing cloud and swirled around a hanging fluorescent light she coughed a hacking irritating cough which reddened her face and gyrated her full breasts until they bounced dangerously close to the typewriter keys she grabbed a nearby cup and lapped up something then reinserted the filtertip and pecked away after two minutes mitch began to fear carbon monoxide he spotted a small hole in the window in a pane that for some reason the spiders had not draped with cobwebs he walked to within inches of the shredded dustladen curtains and tried to inhale in the direction of the opening he felt sick there was more hacking and wheezing behind him he tried to open the window but layers of cracked paint had long since welded it shut just when he began to feel dizzy the typing and smoking stopped you a lawyer mitch turned from the window and looked at the secretary she was now sitting on the edge of her desk legs crossed with the black leather skirt well above her knees she sipped a diet pepsi yes in a big firm yes i thought so i could tell by your suit and your cute little preppie buttondown with the silk paisley tie i can always spot the bigfirm lawyers as opposed to the hamandeggers who hang around city court the smoke was clearing and mitch was breathing easier he admired her legs which for the moment were positioned just so and demanded to be admired she was now looking at his shoes you like the suit huh he said its expensive i can tell sos the tie im not so sure about the shirt and shoes mitch studied the leather boots the legs the skirt and the tight sweater around the large breasts and tried to think of something cute to say she enjoyed this gazing back and forth and again sipped on her diet pepsi when shed had enough she nodded at eddies door and said you caiv go in now eddies waiting the detective was on the phone trying to convince some poor old man that his son was in fact a homosexual a very active homosexual he pointed to a wooden chair and mitch sat down he saw two windows both wide open and breathed easier eddie looked disgusted and covered the receiver hes crying he whispered to mitch who smiled obligingly as if he was amused he wore blue lizardskin boots with pointed toes levis a wellstarched peach buttondown which was unbuttoned well into the dark chest hair and exposed two heavy gold chains and one which appeared to be turquoise he favored tom jones or humperdinck or one of those bushyheaded darkeyed singers with thick sideburns and solid chins ive got photographs he said and yanked the receiver from his ear when the old man screamed he pulled five glossy eightbytens from a file and slid them across the desk into mitchs lap yes indeed they were homosexuals whoever they were eddie smiled at him proudly the bodies were somewhere on a stage in what appeared to be a queer club he laid them on the desk and looked at the window they were of high quality in color whoever took them had to have been in the club mitch thought of the rape conviction a cop sent up for rape he slammed the phone down so youre mitchell mcdeere nice to meet you they shook hands across the desk my pleasure mitch said i saw ray sunday i feel like ive known you for years you look just like ray he told me you did told me all about you i guess he told you about me the police background the conviction the rape did he explain to you it was statutory rape and that the girl was seventeen years old looked twentyfive and that i got framed he mentioned it ray doesnt say much you know that hes a helluva guy i owe him my life literally they almost killed me in prison when they found out i was a cop he stepped in and even the blacks backed down he can hurt people when he wants to hes all the family i have yeah i know you bunk with a guy for years in an eightbytwelve cell and you learn all about him hes talked about you for hours when i was paroled you were thinking about law school i finished in june of this year and went to work for bendini lambert locke never heard of them its a tax and corporate firm on front street i do a lot of sleazy divorce work for lawyers surveillance taking pictures like those and gathering filth for court he spoke quickly with short clipped words and sentences the cowboy boots were placed gingerly on the desk for display plus ive got some lawyers i run cases for if i dig up a good car wreck or personalinjury suit ill shop around to see wholl give me the best cut thats how i bought this building thats where the money ispersonal injury these lawyers take forty percent of the recovery forty percent he shook his head in disgust as if he couldnt believe greedy lawyers actually lived and breathed in this city you work by the hour mitch asked thirty bucks plus expenses last night i spent six hours in my van outside a holiday inn waiting for my clients husband to leave his room with his whore so i could take more pictures six hours thats a hundred eighty bucks for sitting on my ass looking at dirty magazines and waiting i also charged her for dinner mitch listened intently as if he wished he could do it tammy stuck her head in the door and said she was leaving a stale cloud followed her and mitch looked at the windows she slammed the door shes a great gal eddie said shes got trouble with her husband hes a truck driver who thinks hes elvis got the jetblack hair ducktail lambchop sideburns wears those thick gold sunglasses elvis wore when hes not on the road he sits around the trailer listening to elvis albums and watching those terrible movies they moved here from ohio just so this clown can be near the kings grave guess what his name is i have no idea elvis elvis aaron hemphill had his name legally changed after the king died he does an impersonation routine in dark nightclubs around the city i saw him one night he wore a white skintight jumpsuit unbuttoned to his navel which wouldve been okay except hes got this gut that hangs out and looks like a bleached watermelon it was pretty sad his voice is hilarious sounds like one of those old indian chiefs chanting around the campfire so whats the problem women you would not believe the elvis nuts who visit this city they flock to watch this buffoon act like the king they throw panties at him big panties panties made for heavy wide lardasses and he wipes his forehead and throws them back they give him their room numbers and we suspect he sneaks around and tries to play the big stud just like elvis i havent caught him yet mitch could not think of any response to all this he grinned like an idiot like this was truly an incredible story lomax read him well you got trouble with your wife no nothing like that i need some information about four people three are dead one is alive sounds interesting im listening mitch pulled the notes from a pocket i assume this is strictly confidential of course it is as confidential as you are with your client mitch nodded in agreement but thought of tammy and elvis and wondered why lomax told him that story it must be confidential i said it would be you can trust me thirty bucks an hour twenty for you ray sent you remember i appreciate that who are these people the three dead ones were once lawyers in our firm robert lamm was killed in a hunting accident somewhere in arkansas somewhere in the mountains he was missing for about two weeks and they found him with a bullet in the head there was an autopsy thats all i know alice knauss died in in a car wreck here in memphis supposedly a drunk driver hit her john mickel committed suicide in his body was found in his office there was a gun and a note thats all you know thats it whatre you looking for i want to know as much as i can about how these people died what were the circumstances surrounding each death who investigated each death any unanswered questions or suspicions what do you suspect at this point nothing im just curious youre more than curious okay im more than curious but for now lets leave it at that fair enough whos the fourth guy a man named wayne tarrance hes an fbi agent here in memphis fbi does that bother you yes it bothers me i get forty an hour for cops no problem what do you want to know check him out how long has he been here how long has he been an agent whats his reputation thats easy enough mitch folded the paper and stuck it in his pocket how long will this take about a month thats fine say what was the name of your firm bendini lambert locke those two guys who got killed last summer they were members any suspicions no just thought id ask listen eddie you must be very careful with this dont call me at home or the office ill call you in about a month i suspect im being watched very closely by whom i wish i knew avery smiled at the computer printout for the month of october you billed an average of sixtyone hours per week i thought it was sixtyfour mitch said sixtyone is good enough in fact weve never had a firstyear man average so high in one month is it legitimate no padding in fact i couldve pushed it higher how many hours are you working a week between eightyfive and ninety i could bill seventyfive if i wanted to i wouldnt suggest it at least not now it could cause a little jealousy around here the younger associates are watching you very closely you want me to slow down of course not you and i are a month behind right now im just worried about the long hours a little worried thats all most associates start like wildfireeighty and ninetyhour weeksbut they burn out after a couple of months sixtyfive to seventy is about average but you seem to have unusual stamina i dont require much sleep what does your wife think about it why is that important does she mind the long hours mitch glared at avery and for a second thought of the argument the previous night when he arrived home for dinner at three minutes before midnight it was a controlled fight but the worst one yet and it promised to be followed by others no ground was surrendered abby said she felt closer to mr rice next door than to her husband she understands i told her i would make partner in two years and retire before i was thirty looks like youre trying youre not complaining are you every hour i billed last month was on one of your files and you didnt seem too concerned about overworking me avery laid the printout on his credenza and frowned at mitch i just dont want you to burn out or neglect things at home it seemed odd receiving marital advice from a man who had left his wife he looked at avery with as much contempt as he could generate you dont need to worry about what happens at my house as long as i produce around here you should be happy avery leaned across the desk look mitch im not very good at this sort of thing this is coming from higher up lambert and mcknight are worried that maybe youre pushing a bit too hard i mean five oclock in the morning every morning even some sundays thats pretty intense mitch what did they say nothing much believe it or not mitch those guys really care about you and your family they want happy lawyers with happy wives if everything is lovely then the lawyers are productive lambert is especially paternalistic hes planning to retire in a couple of years and hes trying to relive his glory years through you and the other young guys if he asks too many questions or gives a few lectures take it in stride hes earned the right to be the grandfather around here tell them im fine abbys fine were all happy and im very productive fine now that thats out of the way you and i leave for grand cayman a week from tomorrow ive got to meet with some caymanian bankers on behalf of sonny capps and three other clients mainly business but we always manage to work in a little scuba diving and snorkeling i told royce mcknight you were needed and he approved the trip he said you probably needed the r and r do you want to go of course im just a little surprised its business so our wives wont be going lambert was a little concerned that it may cause a problem at home i think mr lambert worries too much about what happens at my home tell him im in control no problems so youre going sure im going how long will we be there couple of days well stay in one of s condos sonny capps may stay in the other one im trying to get plane but we may have to fly commercial no problem with me only two of the passengers on board the cayman airways in miami wore ties and after the first round of complimentary rum punch avery removed his and stuffed it in his coat pocket the punch was served by beautiful brown caymanian stewardesses with blue eyes and comely smiles the women were great down there avery said more than once mitch sat by the window and tried to conceal the excitement of his first trip out of the country he had found a book on the cayman islands in a library there were three islands grand cayman little cayman and cayman brae the two smaller ones were sparsely populated and seldom visited grand cayman had eighteen thousand people twelve thousand registered corporations and three hundred banks the population was twenty percent white twenty percent black and the other sixty percent wasnt sure and didnt care georgetown the capital in recent years had become an international tax haven with bankers as secretive as the swiss there were no income taxes corporate taxes capitalgains taxes estate or gift taxes certain companies and investments were given guarantees against taxation for fifty years the islands were a dependent british territory with an unusually stable government revenue from import duties and tourism funded whatever government was necessary there was no crime or unemployment grand cayman was twentythree miles long and eight miles wide in places but from the air it looked much smaller it was a small rock surrounded by clear sapphire water the landing almost occurred in a lagoon but at the last second a small asphalt strip came forth and caught the plane they disembarked and sang their way through customs a black boy grabbed mitchs bags and threw them with averys into the trunk of a ford ltd mitch tipped him generously seven mile beach avery commanded as he turned up the remnants of his last rum punch okay mon the driver drawled he gunned the taxi and laid rubber in the direction of georgetown the radio blared reggae the driver shook and gyrated and kept a steady beat with his fingers on the steering wheel he was on the wrong side of the road but so was everybody else mitch sank into the worn seat and crossed his legs the car had no airconditioning except for the open windows the muggy tropical air rushed across his face and blew his hair this was nice the island was flat and the road into georgetown was busy with small dusty european cars scooters and bicycles the homes were small onestories with tin roofs and neat colorful paint jobs the lawns were tiny with little grass but the dirt was neatly swept as they neared the town the houses became shops two and threestory white frame buildings where tourists stood under the canopies and took refuge from the sun the driver made a sharp turn and suddenly they were in the midst of a downtown crowded with modern bank buildings avery assumed the role of tour guide there are banks here from everywhere germany france great britain canada spain japan denmark even saudi arabia and israel over three hundred at last count its become quite a tax haven the bankers here are extremely quiet they make the swiss look like blabbermouths the taxi slowed in heavy traffic and the breeze stopped i see a lot of canadian banks mitch said that building right there is the royal bank of montreal well be there at ten in the morning most of our business will be with canadian banks any particular reason theyre very safe and very quiet the crowded street turned and deadended into another one beyond the intersection the glittering blue of the caribbean rose to the horizon a cruise ship was anchored in the bay thats hogsty bay avery said thats where the pirates docked their ships three hundred years ago blackbeard himself roamed these islands and buried his loot they found some of it a few years ago in a cave east of here near bodden town mitch nodded as if he believed this tale the driver smiled in the rearview mirror avery wiped the sweat from his forehead this place has always attracted pirates once it was blackbeard now its modernday pirates who form corporations and hide their money here right mon right mon the driver replied thats seven mile beach avery said one of the most beautiful and most famous in the world right mon right mon sand as white as sugar warm clear water warm beautiful women right mon right mon will they have the cookout tonight at the palms yes mon six oclock thats next door to our condo the palms is a popular hotel with the hottest action on the beach mitch smiled and watched the hotels pass he recalled the interview at harvard when oliver lambert preached about how frowned on divorce and chasing women and drinking perhaps avery had missed those sermons perhaps he hadnt the condos were in the center of seven mile beach next door to another complex and the palms asexpected the units owned by were spacious and richly decorated avery said they would sell for at least half a million each but they werent for sale they were not for rent they were sanctuaries for the weary lawyers of bendini lambert locke and a few very favored clients from the balcony off the secondfloor bedroom mitch watched the small boats drift aimlessly over the sparkling sea the sun was beginning its descent and the small waves reflected its rays in a million directions the cruise ship moved slowly away from the island dozens of people walked the beach kicking sand splashing in the water chasing sand crabs and drinking rum punch and jamaican red stripe beer the rhythmic beat of caribbean music drifted from the palms where a large openair thatchedroof bar attracted the beachcombers like a magnet from a grass hut nearby they rented snorkeling gear catamarans and volleyballs avery walked to the balcony in a pair of brilliant orangeandyellow flowered shorts his body was lean and hard with no flab he owned part interest in a health club in memphis and worked out every day evidently there were some tanning beds in the club mitch was impressed how do you like my outfit avery asked very nice youll fit right in ive got another pair if youd like no thanks ill stick to my western kentucky gyrh shorts avery sipped on a drink and took in the scenery ive been here a dozen times and i still get excited ive thought about retiring down here that would be nice you could walk the beach and chase sand crabs and play dominoes and drink red stripe have you ever had a red stripe not that i recall lets go get one the openair bar was called rumheads it was packed with thirsty tourists and a few locals who sat together around a wooden table and played dominoes avery fought through the crowd and returned with two bottles they found a seat next to the domino game i think this is what ill do when i retire ill come down here and play dominoes for a living and drink red stripe its good beer and when i get tired of dominoes ill throw some darts he nodded to a corner where a group of drunk englishmen were tossing darts at a board and cursing each other and when i get tired of darts well who knows what ill do excuse me he headed for a table on the patio where two string bikinis had just sat down he introduced himself and they asked him to have a seat mitch ordered another red stripe and went to the beach in the distance he could see the bank buildings of georgetown he walked in that direction the food was placed on folding tables around the pool grilled grouper barbecued shark pompano fried shrimp turtle and oysters lobster and red snapper it was all from the sea and all fresh the guests crowded around the tables and served themselves while waiters scurried back and forth with gallons of rum punch they ate on small tables in the courtyard overlooking rumheads and the sea a reggae band tuned up the sun dipped behind a cloud then over the horizon mitch followed avery through the buffet and as expected to a table where the two women were waiting they were sisters both in their late twenties both divorced both half drunk the one named carrie had fallen in heat with avery and the other one julia immediately began making eyes at mitch he wondered what avery had told them i see youre married julia whispered as she moved next to him yes happily she smiled as if to accept the challenge avery and his woman winked at each other mitch grabbed a glass of punch and gulped it down he picked at his food and could think of nothing but abby this would be hard to explain if an explanation became necessary having dinner with two attractive women who were barely dressed it would be impossible to explain the conversation became awkward at the table and mitch added nothing a waiter set a large pitcher on the table and it quickly was emptied avery became obnoxious he told the women mitch had played for the new york giants had two super bowl rings made a million bucks a year before a knee injury ruined his career mitch shook his head and drank some more julia drooled at him and moved closer the band turned up the volume and it was time to dance half the crowd moved to a wooden dance floor under two trees between the pool and the beach lets dance avery yelled and grabbed his woman they ran through the tables and were soon lost in the crowd of jerking and lunging tourists he felt her move closer then her hand was on his leg do you wanna dance she asked no good neither do i what would you like to do she rubbed her breasts on his biceps and gave her best seductive smile only inches away i dont plan to do anything he removed her hand aw come on lets have some fun your wife will never know look youre a very lovely lady but youre wasting your time with me its still early youve got plenty of time to pick up a real stud youre cute the hand was back and mitch breathed deeply why dont you get lost i beg your pardon the hand was gone i said get lost she backed away whats wrong with you i have an aversion to communicable diseases get lost why dont you get lost thats a wonderful idea i think i will get lost enjoyed dinner mitch grabbed a glass of rum punch and made his way through the dancers to the bar he ordered a red stripe and sat by himself in a dark corner of the patio the beach in front of him was deserted the lights of a dozen boats moved slowly across the water behind him were the sounds of the barefoot boys and the laughter of the caribbean night nice he thought but it would be nicer with abby maybe they would vacation here next summer they needed time together away from home and the office there was a distance between themdistance he could not define distance they could not discuss but both felt distance he was afraid of what are you watching the voice startled him she walked to the table and sat next to him she was a native dark skin with blue or hazel eyes it was impossible to teh in the dark but they were beautiful eyes warm and uninhibited her dark curly hair was pulled back and hung almost to her waist she was an exotic mixture of black white and probably latin and probably more she wore a white bikini top cut very low and barely covering her large breasts and a long brightly colored skirt with a slit to the waist that exposed almost everything when she sat and crossed her legs no shoes nothing really mitch said she was young with a childish smile that revealed perfect teeth where are you from she asked the states she smiled and chuckled of course you are where in the states it was the soft gentle precise confident english of the caribbean memphis a lot of people come here from memphis a lot of divers do you live here he asked yes all my life my mother is a native my father is from england hes gone now back to where he came from would you like a drink he asked yes rum and soda he stood at the bar and waited for the drinks a dull nervous something throbbed in his stomach he could slide into the darkness disappear into the crowd and find his way to the safety of the condo he could lock the door and read a book on international tax havens pretty boring plus avery was there by now with his hot little number the girl was harmless the rum and red stripe told him they would have a couple of drinks and say good night he returned with the drinks and sat across from the girl as far away as possible they were alone on the patio are you a diver she asked no believe it or not im here on business im a lawyer and i have meetings with some bankers in the morning how long will you be here couple of days he was polite but short the less he said the safer he would be she recrossed her legs and smiled innocently he felt weak how old are you he asked im twenty and my name is eilene im old enough im mitch his stomach flipped and he felt lightheaded he sipped rapidly on his beer he glanced at his watch she watched with that same seductive smile youre very handsome this was unraveling in a hurry keep cool he told himself just keep cool thank you are you an athlete sort of why do you ask you look like an athlete youre very muscular and firm it was the way she emphasized firm that made his stomach flip again he admired her body and tried to think of some compliment that would not be suggestive forget it where do you work he asked aiming for less sensual areas im a clerk in a jewelry store in town where do you live in georgetown where are you staying a condo next door he nodded in the direction and she looked to her left she wanted to see the condo he could tell she sipped on her drink why arent you at the party she asked im not much on parties do you like the beach its beautiful its prettier in the moonlight that smile again he could say nothing to this theres a better bar about a mile down the beach she said letsgo for a walk i dont know i should get back ive got some work to do before morning she laughed and stood no one goes in this early in the caymans come on i owe you a drink no id better not she grabbed his hand and he followed her off the patio onto the beach they walked in silence until the palms was out of sight and the music was growing dimmer the moon was overhead and brighter now and the beach was deserted she unsnapped something and removed her skirt leaving nothing but a string around her waist and a string running between her legs she rolled up the skirt and placed it around his neck she took his hand something said run throw the beer bottle in the ocean throw the skirt in the sand and run like hell run to the condo lock the door lock the windows run run run and something said to relax its harmless fun have a few more drinks if something happens enjoy it no one will ever know memphis is a thousand miles away avery wont know and what about avery what could he say everybody does it it had happened once before when he was in college before he was married but after he was engaged he had blamed it on too much beer and had survived with no major scars time took care of it abby would never know run run run they walked for a mile and there was no bar in sight the beach was darker a cloud conveniently hid the moon they had seen no one since rumheads she pulled his hand toward two plastic beach chairs next to the water lets rest she said he finished his beer youre not saying much she said what would you like for me to say do you think im beautiful you are very beautiful and you have a beautiful body she sat on the edge of her chair and splashed her feet in the water lets go for a swim i uh im not really in the mood come on mitch i love the water go ahead ill watch she knelt beside him in the sand and faced him niches away in slow motion she reached behind her neck she unhooked her bikini top and it fell off very slowly her breasts much larger now lay on his left forearm she handed it to him hold this for me it was soft and white and weighed less than a millionth of an ounce he was paralyzed and the breathing heavy and labored only seconds ago had now ceased altogether she walked slowly into the water the white string covered nothing from the rear her long dark beautiful hair hung to her waist she waded knee deep then turned to the beach come on mitch the water feels great she flashed a brilliant smile and he could see it he rubbed the bikini top and knew this would be his last chance to run but he was dizzy and weak running would require more strength than he could possibly muster he wanted to just sit and maybe she would go away maybe she would drown maybe the tide would suddenly materialize and sweep her out to sea come on mitch he removed his shirt and waded into the water she watched him with a smile and when he reached her she took his hand and led him to deeper water she locked her hands around his neck and they kissed he found the strings they kissed again she stopped abruptly and without speaking started for the beach he watched her she sat on the sand between the two chairs and removed the rest of her bikini he ducked under the water and held his breath for an eternity when he surfaced she was reclining resting on her elbows in the sand he surveyed the beach and of course saw no one at that precise instant the moon ducked behind another cloud there was not a boat or a catamaran or a dinghy or a swimmer or a snorkeler or anything or anybody moving on the water i cant do this he muttered through clenched teeth what did you say mitch i cant do this he yelled but i want you i cant do it come on mitch no one will ever know no one will ever know no one will ever know he walked slowly toward her no one will ever know there was complete silence in the rear of the taxi as the lawyers rode into georgetown they were late they had overslept and missed breakfast neither felt particularly well avery looked especially haggard his eyes were bloodshot and his face was pale he had not shaved the driver stopped in heavy traffic in front of the royal bank of montreal the heat and humidity were already stifling randolph osgood was the banker a stuffy british type with a navy doublebreasted suit hornrimmed glasses a large shiny forehead and a pointed nose he greeted avery like an old friend and introduced himself to mitch they were led to a large office on the second floor with a view of hogsty bay two clerks were waiting exactly what do you need avery osgood asked through his nose lets start off with some coffee i need summaries of all the accounts of sonny capps al coscia dolph hemmba ratzlaff partners and greene group yes and how far back would you like to go six months every account osgood snapped his fingers at one of the clerks she left and returned with a tray of coffee and pastries the other clerk took notes of course avery well need authorization and powers of attorney for each of these clients osgood said theyre on file avery said as he unpacked his briefcase yes but theyve expired well need current ones every account very well avery slid a file across the table theyre in there everythings current he winked at mitch a clerk took the file and spread the documents over the table each instrument was scrutinized by both clerks then by osgood himself the lawyers drank coffee and waited osgood smiled and said it all appears to be in order well get the records what else do you need i need to establish three corporations two for sonny capps and one for greene group well follow the usual procedure the bank will serve as registered agent etc ill procure the necessary documents osgood said and looked at a clerk what else thats all for now very well we should have these records within thirty minutes will you be joining me for lunch im sorry randolph i must decline mitch and i have a prior commitment maybe tomorrow mitch knew nothing of a prior commitment at least none he was involved in perhaps replied osgood he left the room with the clerks avery closed the door and removed his jacket he walked to the window and sipped coffee look mitch im sorry about last night very sorry i got drunk and quit thinking i was wrong to push that woman on you apology accepted dont let it happen again it wont i promise was she good i think so i dont remember too much what did you do with her sister she told me to get lost i hit the beach and took a walk avery bit into a pastry and wiped his mouth you know im separated well probably get a divorce in a year or so im very discreet because the divorce could get nasty theres an unwritten rule in what we do away from memphis stays away from memphis understand come on avery you know i wouldnt tell i know i know mitch was glad to hear of the unwritten rule although he awakened with the security that he had committed the perfect crime he had thought of her in bed the shower the taxi and now he had trouble concentrating on anything he had caught himself looking at jewelry stores when they reached georgetown ive got a question mitch said avery nodded and ate the pastry when i was recruited a few months ago by oliver lambert and mcknight and the gang it was impressed upon me repeatedly that frowned on divorce women booze drugs everything but hard work and money thats why i took the job ive seen the hard work and money but now im seeing other things where did you go wrong or do all the guys do it i dont like your question i knew you wouldnt but id like an answer i deserve an answer i feel like i was misled so what are you going to do leave because i got drunk and laid up with a whore i havent thought about leaving good dont but im entitled to an answer okay fair enough im the biggest rogue in and theyll come down hard when i mention the divorce i chase women now and then but no one knows it or at least they cant catch me im sure its done by other partners but youd never catch them not all of them but a few most have very stable marriages and are forever faithful to their wives ive always been the bad boy but theyve tolerated me because im so talented they know i drink during lunch and sometimes in the office and they know i violate some more of their sacred rules but they made me a partner because they need me and now that im a partner they cant do much about it im not that bad of a guy mitch i didnt say you were im not perfect some of them are believe me theyre machines robots they live eat and sleep for bendini lambert locke i like to have a little fun so youre the exception rather than the rule yes and i dont apologize for it i didnt ask you for an apology just a clarification clear enough yes ive always admired your bluntness and i admire your discipline its a strong man who can remain faithful to his wife with the temptations you had last night im not that strong dont want to be temptations he had thought of inspecting the downtown jewelry shops during lunch look avery im not a holy roller and im not shocked im not one to judgeive been judged all my life i was just confused about the rules thats all the rules never change theyre cast in concrete carved in granite etched in stone violate too many and youre out or violate as many as you want but just dont get caught fair enough osgood and a group of clerks entered the room with computer printouts and stacks of documents they made neat piles on the table and alphabetized it all this should keep you busy for a day or so osgood said with a forced smile he snapped his fingers and the clerks disappeared ill be in my office if you need something yes thanks avery said as he hovered over the first set of documents mitch removed his coat and loosened his tie exactly what are we doing here he asked two things first well review the entries into all of these accounts were looking primarily for interest earned what rate how much etc well do a rough audit of each account to make sure the interest is going where it is supposed to go for example dolph hemmba sends his interest to nine different banks in the bahamas its stupid but it makes him happy its also impossible for anyone to follow except me he has about twelve million in this bank so its worth keeping up with he could do this himself but he feels better if i do it at twofifty an hour i dont mind well check the interest this bank is paying on each account the rate varies depending on a number of factors its discretionary with the bank and this is a good way to keep them honest i thought they were honest they are but theyre bankers remember youre looking at close to thirty accounts here and when we leave well know the exact balance the interest earned and where the interest is going second we have to incorporate three companies under caymanian jurisdiction its fairly easy legal work and could be done in memphis but the clients think we must come here to do it remember were dealing with people who invest millions a few thousand in legal fees doesnt bother them mitch flipped through a printout in the hemmba stack whos this guy hemmba i havent heard of him ive got a lot of clients you havent heard of hemmba is a big farmer in arkansas one of the states largest landowners twelve million dollars thats just in this bank thats a lot of cotton and soybeans lets just say he has other ventures such as i really cant say legal or illegal lets just say hes hiding twenty million plus interest in various caribbean banks from the irs are we helping him avery spread the documents on one end of the table and began checking entries mitch watched and waited for an answer the silence grew heavier and it was obvious there would not be one he could press but he had asked enough questions for one day he rolled up his sleeves and went to work at noon he learned about averys prior commitment his woman was waiting at the condo for a little rendezvous he suggested they break for a couple of hours and mentioned a cafe downtown mitch could try instead of a cafe mitch found the georgetown library four blocks from the bank on the second floor he was directed to the periodicals where he found a shelf full of old editions of the daily caymanian he dug back six months and pulled the one dated june he laid it on a small table by a window overlooking the street he glanced out the window then looked closer there was a man he had seen only moments earlier on the street by the bank he was behind the wheel of a battered yellow chevette parked in a narrow drive across from the library he was a stocky darkhaired foreignlooking type with a gaudy greenandorange shirt and cheap touristy sunglasses the same chevette with the same driver had been parked in front of the gift shop next to the bank and now moments later it was parked four blocks away a native on a bicycle stopped next to him and took a cigarette the man in the car pointed at the library the native left his bicycle and walked quickly across the street mitch folded the newspaper and stuck it in his coat he walked past the rows of shelves found a national geographic and sat down at a table he studied the magazine and listened carefully as the native climbed the stairs noticed him walked behind him seemed to pause as if to catch a glimpse of what he was reading then disappeared down the stairs mitch waited for a moment then returned to the window the native was taking another cigarette and talking to the man in the chevette he lit the cigarette and rode away mitch spread the newspaper on the table and scanned the headline story of the two american lawyers and their dive guide who had been killed in a mysterious accident the day before he made mental notes and returned the paper the chevette was still watching he walked in front of it made the block and headed in the direction of the bank the shopping district was squeezed tightly between the bank buildings and hogsty bay the streets were narrow and crowded with tourists on foot tourists on scooters tourists in rented compacts he removed his coat and ducked into a tshirt shop with a pub upstairs henclimbed the stairs ordered a coke and sat on the balcony within minutes the native with the bicycle was at the bar drinking a red stripe and watching from behind a handprinted menu mitch sipped on the coke and scanned the congestion below no sign of the chevette but he knew it was close by he saw another man stare at him from the street then disappear then a woman was he paranoid then the chevette turned the corner two blocks away and moved slowly beneath him he went to the tshirt store and bought a pair of sunglasses he walked for a block then darted into an alley he ran through the dark shade to the next street then into a gift shop he left through the back door into an alley he saw a large clothing store for tourists and entered through a side door he watched the street closely and saw nothing the racks were full of shorts and shirts of all colors clothes the natives would not buy but the americans loved he stayed conservativewhite shorts with a red knit pullover he found a pair of straw sandals that sort of matched the hat he liked the clerk giggled and showed him to a dressing room he checked the street again nothing the clothes fit and he asked her if he could leave his suit and shoes in the back for a couple of hours no problem mon she said he paid in cash slipped her a ten and asked her to call a cab she said he was very handsome he watched the street nervously until the cab arrived he darted across the sidewalk into the back seat abanks dive lodge he said thats a long way mon mitch threw a twenty over the seat get moving watch your mirror if someone is following let me know he grabbed the money okay mon mitch sat low under his new hat in the back seat as his driver worked his way down shedden road out of the shopping district around hogsty bay and headed east past red bay out of the city of georgetown and onto the road to bodden town who are you running from mon mitch smiled and rolled down his window the internal revenue service he thought that was cute but the driver seemed confused there were no taxes and no tax collectors in the islands he remembered the driver continued in silence according to the paper the dive guide was philip abanks son of barry abanks the owner of the dive lodge he was nineteen when he was killed the three had drowned when an explosion of some sort hit their boat a very mysterious explosion the bodies had been found in eighty feet of water in full scuba gear there were no witnesses to the explosion and no explanations as to why it occurred two miles offshore in an area not known for diving the article said there were many unanswered questions sodden town was a small village twenty minutes from georgetown the dive lodge was south of town on an isolated stretch of beach did anyone follow us mitch asked the driver shook his head good job heres forty bucks mitch looked at his watch its almost one can you be here at exactly twothirty no problem mon the road ended at the edge of the beach and became a whiterock parking area shaded by dozens of royal palms the front building of the lodge was a large twostory home with a tin roof and an outer stairway leading to the center of the second floor the grand house it was called it was painted a light blue with neat white trim and it was partially hidden by bay vines and spider lilies the handwrought fretwork was painted pink the solid wooden shutters were olive it was the office and eating room of abanks dive lodge to its right the palm trees thinned and a small driveway curved around the grand house and sloped downward to a large open area of white rock on each side was a group of a dozen or so thatchedroof huts where divers roomed a maze of wooden sidewalks ran from the huts to the central point of the lodge the openair bar next to the water mitch headed for the bar to the familiar sounds of reggae and laughter it was similar to rumheads but without the crowd after a few minutes the bartender henry delivered a red stripe to mitch wheres barry abanks mitch asked he nodded to the ocean and returned to the bar half a mile out a boat cut slowly through the still water and made its way toward the lodge mitch ate a cheeseburger and watched the dominoes the boat docked at a pier between the bar and a larger hut with the words dive shop handpainted over a window the divers jumped from the boat with their equipment bags and without exception headed for the bar a short wiry man stood next to the boat and barked orders at the deckhands who were unloading empty scuba tanks onto the pier he wore a white baseball cap and not much else a tiny black pouch covered his crotch and most of his rear end from the looks of his brown leathery skin he hadnt worn much in the past fifty years he checked in at the dive shop yelled at the dive captains and deckhands and made his way to the bar he ignored the crowd and went to the freezer where he picked up a heineken removed the top and took a long drink the bartender said something to abanks and nodded toward mitch he opened another heineken and walked to mitchs table he did not smile are you looking for me it was almost a sneer are you mr abanks thats me what do you want id like to talk to you for a few minutes he gulped his beer and gazed at the ocean im too busy i have a dive boat leaving in forty minutes my name is mitch mcdeere im a lawyer from memphis abanks glared at him with tiny brown eyes mitch had his attention so so the two men who died with your son were friends of mine it wont take but a few minutes abanks sat on a stool and rested on his elbows thats not one of my favorite subjects i know im sorry the police instructed me not to talk to anyone its confidential i swear abanks squinted and stared at the brilliant blue water his face and arms bore the scars of a life at sea a life spent sixty feet down guiding novices through and around coral reefs and wrecked ships what do you want to know he asked softly can we talk somewhere else sure lets take a walk he yelled at henry and spoke to a table of divers as he left they walked on the beach id like to talk about the accident mitch said you can ask i may not answer what caused the explosion i dont know perhaps an air compressor perhaps some fuel we are not certain the boat was badly damaged and most of the clues went up in flames was it your boat yes one of my small ones a thirtyfooter your friends had chartered it for the morning where were the bodies found in eighty feet of water there was nothing suspicious about the bodies except that there were no burns or other injuries that would indicate they had been in the explosion so i guess that makes the bodies very suspicious the autopsies said they drowned yes they drowned but your friends were in full scuba gear which was later examined by one of my divemasters it worked perfectly they were good divers what about your son he was not in full gear but he could swim like a fish where was the explosion they had been scheduled to dive along a series of reef formations at rogers wreck point are you familiar with the island no its around the east bay on northeastern point your friends had never dived there and my son suggested they try it we knew your friends well they were experienced divers and took it seriously they always wanted a boat by themselves and didnt mind paying for it and they always wanted philip as their dive captain we dont know if they made any dives on the point the boat was found burning two miles at sea far from any of our dive sites could the boat have drifted impossible if there had been engine trouble philip would have used the radio we have modern equipment and our divemasters are always in touch with the dive shop theres no way the explosion could have occurred at the point no one saw it or heard it and theres always someone around secondly a disabled boat could not drift two miles in that water and most importantly the bodies were not on the boat remember suppose the boat did drift how do you explain the drifting of the bodies eighty feet below they were found within twenty meters of the boat who found them my men we caught the bulletin over the radio and i sent a crew we knew it was our boat and my men started diving they found the bodies within minutes i know this is difficult to talk about abanks finished his beer and threw the bottle in a wooden garbage box yes it is but time takes away the pain why are you so interested the families have a lot of questions i am sorry for them i met their wives last year they spent a week with us such nice people is it possible they were simply exploring new territory when it happened possible yes but not likely our boats report their movements from one dive site to the next thats standard procedure no exceptions i have fired a dive captain for not clearing a site before going to the next my son was the best captain on the island he grew up in these waters he would never fail to report his movements at sea its that simple the police believe that is what happened but they have to believe something its the only explanation they have but how do they explain the condition of the bodies they cant its simply another diving accident as far as theyre concerned was it an accident i think not the sandals had rubbed blisters by now and mitch removed them they turned and started back to the lodge if it wasnt an accident what was it abanks walked and watchea the ocean crawl along the beach he smiled for the first ume what are the other possibilities theres a rumor in memphis that drugs could have been involved tell me about this rumor weve heard that your son was active in a drug ring that possibly he was using the boat that day to meet a supplier at sea that there was a dispute and my friends got in the way abanks smiled again and shook his head not philip to my knowledge he never used drugs and i know he didnt trade in them he wasnt interested in money just women and diving not a chance no not a chance ive never heard this rumor and i doubt if they know more in memphis this is a small island and i would have heard it by now its completely false the conversation was over and they stopped near the bar ill ask you a favor abanks said do not mention any of this to the families i cannot prove what i know to be true so its best if no one knows especially the families i wont tell anyone and i will ask you not to mention our conversation someone might follow me here and ask questions about my visit just say we talked about diving as you wish my wife and i will be here next spring for our vacation ill be sure to look you up st andrews episcopal school was located behind the church of the same name on a densely wooded and perfectly manicured fiveacre estate in the middle of midtown memphis the white and yellow brick was occasionally visible where the ivy had for some reason turned and pursued another course symmetrical rows of clipped boxwoods lined the sidewalks and the small playground it was a onestory lshaped building sitting quietly in the shadows of a dozen ancient oaks cherished for its exclusivity st andrews was the most expensive private school in memphis for grades kindergarten through six affluent parents signed the waiting list shortly after birth mitch stopped the bmw in the parking lot between the church and the school abbys burgundy peugeot was three spaces down parked innocently he was unexpected the plane had landed an hour earlier and he had stopped by the house to change into something lawyerly he would see her then back to his desk for a few hours at one hundred and fifty per he wanted to see her here at the school unannounced a surprise attack a countermove he would say hello he missed her he couldnt wait to see her so he stopped by the school he would be brief the first touch and feel and words after that incident on the beach could she tell just by looking at him maybe she could read his eyes would she notice a slight strain in his voice not if she was surprised not if she was flattered by this visit he squeezed the steering wheel and stared at her car what an idiot a stupid fool why didnt he run just throw her skirt in the sand and run like hell but of course he didnt he said what the hell no one will ever know so now he was supposed to shrug it off and say what the hell everybody does it on the plane he laid his plans first he would wait until late this night and tell her the truth he would not lie had no desire to live a lie he would admit it and tell her exactly what happened maybe she would understand why almost any manhell virtually every man would have taken the dive his next move would depend on her reaction if she was cool and showed a trace of compassion he would tell her he was sorry so very sorry and that it would never happen again if she fell all to pieces he would beg literally beg for forgiveness and swear on the bible that it was a mistake and would never happen again he would tell her how much he loved her and worshipped her and please just give him one more chance and if she started packing her bags he would probably at that point realize he should not have told her deny deny deny his criminallaw professor at harvard had been a radical named moskowitz who had made a name for himself defending terrorists and assassins and child fondlers his theory of defense was simply deny deny deny never admit one fact or one piece of evidence that would indicate guilt he remembered moskowitz as they landed in miami and began working on plan b which called for this surprise visit at the school and a latenight romantic dinner at her favorite place and no mention of anything but hard work in the caymans he opened the car door thought of her beautiful smiling trusting face and felt nauseous a thick dull pain hammered deep in his stomach he walked slowly in the late autumn breeze to the front door the hallway was empty and quiet to his right was the office of the headmaster he waited for a moment in the hall waited to be seen but no one was there he walked quietly ahead until at the third classroom he heard the wonderful voice of his wife she was plowing through multiplication tables when he stuck his head in the door and smiled she froze then giggled she excused herself told them to stay in their seats and read the next page she closed the door whatre you doing here she asked as he grabbed her and pinned her to the wall she glanced nervously up and down the hall i missed you he said with conviction he bearhugged her for a good minute he kissed her neck and tasted the sweetness of her perfume and then the girl returned you piece of scum why didnt you run when did you get in she asked straightening her hair and glancing down the hall about an hour ago you look wonderful her eyes were wet those wonderfully honest eyes how was your trip okay i missed you its no fun when youre not around her smile widened and she looked away i missed you too they held hands and walked toward the front door id like a date tonight he said youre not working no im not working im going out with my wife to her favorite restaurant well eat and drink expensive wine and stay out late and then get naked when we get home you did miss me she kissed him again on the lips then looked down the hall but you better get out of here before someone sees you they walked quickly to the front door without being seen he breathed deeply in the cool air and walked quickly to his car he did it he looked into those eyes held her and kissed her like always she suspected nothing she was touched and even moved devasher paced anxiously behind his desk and sucked nervously on a roitan he sat in his worn swivel chair and tried to concentrate on a memo then he jumped to his feet and paced again he checked his watch he called his secretary he called oliver lamberts secretary he paced some more finally seventeen minutes after he was supposed to arrive ollie was cleared through security and walked into devashers office devasher stood behind his desk and glared at ollie youre late im very busy ollie answered as he sat in a worn naugahyde chair whats so important devashers face instantly changed into a sly evil smile he dramatically opened a desk drawer and proudly threw a large manila envelope across the desk into ollies lap some of the best work weve ever done lambert opened the envelope and gaped at the eightbyten blackandwhite photographs he stared at each one holding them inches from his nose memorizing each detail devasher watched proudly lambert reviewed them again and began breathing heavily these are incredible yep we though so whos the girl ollie asked still staring a local prostitute looks pretty good doesnt she weve never used her before but you can bet well use her again i want to meet her and soon no problem i kinda figured you would this is incredible howd she do it it looked difficult at first he told the first girl to get lost avery had the other one but your man wanted no part of her friend he left and went to that little bar on the beach thats when our girl there showed up shes a pro where were your people all over the place those were shot from behind a palm tree about eighty feet away pretty good arent they very good give the photographer a bonus how long did they roll in the sand long enough they were very compatible i think he really enjoyed himself we were lucky the beach was deserted and the timing was perfect lambert raised a photograph toward the ceiling in front of his eyes did you make me a set he asked from behind it of course ollie i know how much you enjoy these things i thought mcdeere would be tougher than that hes tough but hes human hes no dummy either were not sure but we think he knew we were watching him the next day durjng lunch he seemed suspicious and began darting around the shopping district then he disappeared he was an hour late for his meeting with avery at the bank whered he go we dont know we were just watching out of curiosity nothing serious hell he mightve been in a bar downtown for all we know but he just disappeared watch him carefully he worries me devasher waved another manila envelope quit worrying ollie we own him now he would kill for us if he knew about these what about tarrance not a sign mcdeere aint mentioned it to anybody at least not to anybody were listening to tarrance is hard to trail sometimes but i think hes staying away keep your eyes open dont worry about my end ollie youre the lawyer the counselor the esquire and you get your eightbytens you run i run the surveillance how are things at the mcdeere house not too good she was very cool to the trip whatd she do when he was gone well she aint one to sit around the house two nights she and quins wife went out to eat at a couple of those yuppie joints then to the movies she was out one night with a schoolteacher friend she shopped a little she also called her mother a lot collect evidently theres no love lost between our boy and her parents and she wants to patch things up she and her mom are tight and it really bothers her because they cant be a big happy family she wants to go home to kentucky for christmas and shes afraid he wont go for it theres a lot of friction a lot of undercurrents she tells her mom he works too much and her mom says its because he wants to show them up i dont like the sound of it ollie bad vibes just keep listening weve tried to slow him down but hes a machine yeah at a hundred and fifty an hour i know you want him to slack off why dont you cut all your associates back to forty hours a week so they can spend more time with their families you could cut your salary sell a jag or two hock your old ladys diamonds maybe sell your mansion and buy a smaller house by the country club shut up devasher oliver lambert stormed out of the office devasher turned red with his highpitched laughter then when his office was empty he locked the photos in a file cabinet mitchell mcdeere he said to himself with an immense smile now you are ours on a friday at noon two weeks before christmas abby said goodbye to her students and left st andrews for the holidays at one she parked in a lot full of volvos and bmws and saabs and more peugeots and walked hurriedly through the cold rain into the crowded terrarium where the young affluent gathered to eat quiche and fajitas and black bean soup among the plants this was kay quins current hot spot of the year and this was the second lunch theyd had in a month kay was late as usual it was a friendship still in the initial stages of development cautious by nature abby had never been one to rush into chumminess with a stranger the three years at harvard had been friendless and she had learned a great deal of independence in six months in memphis she had met a handful of prospects at church and one at school but she moved cautiously at first kay quin had pushed hard she was at once a tour guide shopping consultant and even a decorator but abby had moved slowly learning a little with each visit and watching her new friend carefully they had eaten several times in the quin home they had seen each other at firm dinners and functions but always in a crowd and they had enjoyed each others company over four long lunches at whatever happened to be the hottest gathering place at that moment for the young and beautiful gold mastercard holders in memphis kay noticed cars and homes and clothes but pretended to ignore it all kay wanted to be a friend a close friend a confidante an intimate abby kept the distance slowly allowing her in the reproduction of a s jukebox sat below abbys table on the first level near the bar where a standingroom crowd sipped and waited for tables after ten minutes and two roy orbisons kay emerged from the crowd at the front door and looked upward to the third level abby smiled and waved they hugged and pecked each other properly on the cheeks without transferring lipstick sorry im late kay said thats okay im used to it this place is packed kay said looking around in amazement it was always packed so youre out of school yes as of an hour ago im free until january they admired each others outfits and commented on how slim and in general how beautiful and young they were christmas shopping at once became the topic and they talked of stores and sales and children until the wine arrived abby ordered scampi in a skillet but kay stuck with the old fernbar standby of broccoli quiche whatre your plans for christmas kay asked none yet id like to go to kentucky to see my folks but im afraid mitch wont go ive dropped a couple of hints both of which were ignored he still doesnt like your parents theres been no change in fact we dont discuss them i dont know how to handle it with great caution i would imagine yeah and great patience my parents were wrong but i still need them its painful when the only man ive ever loved cant tolerate my parents i pray every day for a small miracle sounds like you need a rather large miracle is he working as hard as lamar says i dont know how a person could work any harder its eighteen hours a day monday through friday eight hours on saturday and since sunday is a day of rest he puts in only five or six hours he reserves a little time for me on sunday do i hear a touch of frustration a lot of frustration kay ive been patient but its getting worse im beginning to feel like a widow im tired of sleeping on the couch waiting for him to get home youre there for food and sex huh i wish hes too tired for sex its not a priority anymore and this is a man who could never get enough i mean we almost killed each other in law school now once a week if im lucky he comes home eats if he has the energy and goes to bed if im really lucky he might talk to me for a few minutes before he passes out im starved for adult conversation kay i spend seven hours a day with eightyearolds and i crave words with more than three syllables i try to explain this to him and hes snoring did you go through this with lamar sort of he worked seventy hours a week for the first year i think they all do its kind of like initiation into the fraternity a male ritual in which you have to prove your manliness but most of them run out of gas after a year and cut back to sixty or sixtyfive hours they still work hard but not the kamikaze routine of the rookie year does lamar work every saturday most saturdays for a few hours never on sunday ive put my foot down of course if theres a big deadline or its tax season then they all work around the clock i think mitch has them puzzled hes not slowing down any in fact hes possessed occasionally he wont come home until dawn then its just a quick shower and back to the office lamar says hes already a legend around the office abby sipped her wine and looked over the rail at the bar thats great im married to a legend have you thought about children it requires sex remember come on abby it cant be that bad im not ready for children i cant handle being a single parent i love my husband but at this point in his life he would probably have a terribly important meeting and leave me alone in the labor room eight centimeters dilated he thinks of nothing but that damned law firm kay reached across the table and gently took abbys hand itll be okay she said with a firm smile and a wise look the first year is the hardest it gets better i promise abby smiled im sorry the waiter arrived with their food and they ordered more wine the scampi simmered in the butterandgarlic sauce and produced a delicious aroma the cold quiche was all alone on a bed of lettuce with a sickly tomato wedge kay picked a glob of broccoli and chewed on it you know abby encourages children i dont care right now i dont like im competing with and im losing badly so i could care less what they want they will not plan my family for me i dont understand why they are so interested in things which are none of their business that place is eerie kay i cant put my finger on it but those people make my skin crawl they want happy lawyers with stable families and i want my husband back theyre in the process of taking him away so the family is not so stable if theyd get off his back perhaps we could be normal like everyone else and have a yard full of children but not now the wine arrived and the scampi cooled she ate it slowly and drank her wine kay searched for less sensitive areas lamar said mitch went to the caymans last month yes he and avery were there for three days strictly business or so he says have you been there every year its a beautiful place with gorgeous beaches and warm water we go in june of each year when school is out owns two huge condos right on the beach mitch wants to vacation there in march during my spring break you need to before we had kids we did nothing but lie on the beach drink rum and have sex thats one reason furnishes the condos and if youre lucky the airplane they work hard but they appreciate the need for leisure dont mention to me kay i dont want to hear about what they like or dislike or what they do or dont do or what they encourage or discourage itll get better abby i promise you must understand that your husband and my husband are both very good lawyers but they could not earn this kind of money anywhere else and you and i would be driving new buicks instead of new peugeots and mercedesbenzes abby cut a shrimp in half and rolled it through the butter and garlic she stabbed a portion with a fork then pushed her plate away the wineglass was empty i know kay i know but there is a hell of a lot more to life than a big yard and a peugeot no one around here seems tobe aware of that i swear i think we were happier living in a tworoom student apartment in cambridge youve only been here a few months mitch will slow down eventually and youll get into your routine before long there will be little mcdeeres running around the backyard and before you know it mitch will be a partner believe me abby things will get much better youre going through a period weve all been through and we made it thanks kay i certainly hope youre right the park was a small one two or three acres on a bluff above the river a row of cannons and two bronze statues memorialized those brave confederates who had fought to save the river and the city under the monument to a general and his horse a wino tucked himself away his cardboard box and ragged quilt provided little shelter from the bitter cold and the tiny pellets of frozen rain fifty yards below the evening traffic rushed along riverside drive it was dark mitch walked to the row of cannons and stood gazing at the river and the bridges leading to arkansas he zipped his raincoat and flipped the collar around his ears he looked at his watch he waited the bendini building was almost visible six blocks away he had parked in a garage in midtown and taken a taxi back to the river he was sure he had not been followed he waited the icy wind blowing up from the river reddened his face and reminded him of the winters hi kentucky after his parents were gone cold bitter winters lonely desolate winters he had worn someone elses coats passed down from a cousin or a friend and they had never been heavy enough secondhand clothes he dismissed those thoughts the frozen rain turned to sleet and the tiny pieces of ice stuck in his hair and bounced on the sidewalk around him he looked at his watch there were footsteps and a figure in a hurry walking toward the cannons whoever it was stopped then approached slowly mitch it was eddie lomax dressed in jeans and a fulllength rabbit coat with his thick mustache and white cowboy hat he looked like an ad for a cigarette the marlboro man yeah its me lomax walked closer to the other side of the cannon they stood like confederate sentries watching the river have you been followed mitch asked no i dont think so you no mitch stared at the traffic on riverside drive and beyond to the river lomax thrust his hands deep into his pockets you talked to ray lately lomax asked no the answer was short as if to say im not standing here in the sleet to chitchat whatd you find mitch asked without looking lomax lit a cigarette and now he was the marlboro man on the three lawyers i found a little info alice knauss was killed in a car wreck in police report said she was hit by a drunk driver but oddly enough no such driver was ever found the wreck happened around midnight on a wednesday she had worked late down at the office and was driving home she lived out east in sycamore view and about a mile from her condo she gets hit headon by a oneton pickup happened on new london road she was driving a fancy little fiat and it was blown to pieces no witnesses when the cops got there the truck was empty no sign of a driver they ran the plates and found that the truck had been stolen in st louis three days earlier no fingerprints or nothing they dusted for prints yeah i know the investigator who handled it they were suspicious but had zero to go on there was a broken bottle of whiskey on the floorboard so they blamed it on a drunk driver and closed the file autopsy no it was pretty obvious how she died sounds suspicious very much so all three of them are suspicious robert lamm was the deer hunter in arkansas he and some friends had a deer camp in izard county in the ozarks they went over two or three times a year during the season after a morning in the woods everyone returned to the cabin but lamm they searched for two weeks and found him in a ravine partially covered with leaves he had been shot once through the head and thats about all they know they ruled out suicide but there was simply no evidence to begin an investigation so he was murdered apparently so autopsy showed an entry at the base of the skull and an exit wound that removed most of his face suicide would have been impossible it could have been an accident possibly he could have caught a bullet intended for a deer but its unlikely he was found a good distance from the camp in an area seldom used by hunters his friends said they neither heard nor saw other hunters the morning he disappeared i talked to the sheriff who is now the exsheriff and hes convinced it was murder he claims there was evidence that the body had been covered intentionally is that all yeah on lamm what about mickel pretty sad he committed suicide in at the age of thirtyfour shot himself in the right temple with a smith wesson he left a lengthy farewell letter in which he told his exwife he hoped she would forgive him and all that crap said goodbye to the kids and his mother real touching was it in his handwriting not exactly it was typed which was not unusual because he typed a good bit he had an ibm selectric in his office and the letter came from it he had a terrible handwriting so whats suspicious the gun he never bought a gun in his life no one knows where it came from no registration no serial number nothing one of his friends in allegedly said something to the effect that mickel had told him he had bought a gun for protection evidently he was having some emotional problems what do you think lomax threw his cigarette butt in the frozen rain on the sidewalk he cupped his hands over his mouth and blew in them i dont know i cant believe a tax lawyer with no knowledge of guns could obtain one without registration or serial number if a guy like that wanted a gun he would simply go to a gun shop fill out the papers and buy a nice shiny new piece this gun was at least ten years old and had been sanitized by professionals did the cops investigate not really it was open and shut did he sign the letter yeah but i dont know who verified the signature he and his wife had been divorced for a year and she had moved back to baltimore mitch buttoned the top button of his overcoat and shook the ice from his collar the sleet was heavier and the sidewalk was covered tiny icicles were beginning to form under the barrel of the cannon the traffic slowed on riverside as wheels began to slide and spin so what do you think of our little firm mitch asked as he stared at the river in the distance its a dangerous place to work theyve lost five lawyers in the past fifteen years thats not a very good safety record five if you include hodge and kozinski ive got a source telling me there are some unanswered questions i didnt hire you to investigate those two and im not charging you for it i got curious thats all how much do i owe you sixtwenty ill pay cash no records okay suits me i prefer cash mitch turned from the river and gazed at the tall buildings three blocks from the park he was cold now but in no hurry to leave lomax watched him from the corner of his eye youve got problems dont you pal wouldnt you say so mitch answered i wouldnt work there i mean i dont know all that you do and i suspect you know a lot youre not telling but were standing here in the sleet because we dont want to be seen we cant talk on the phone we cant meet in your office now you dont want to meet in my office you think youre being followed all the time you tell me to be careful and watch my rear because they whoever they are may be following me youve got five lawyers in that firm whove died under very suspicious circumstances and you act like you may be next yeah id say you got problems big problems what about tarrance one of their best agents transferred in here about two years ago from where new york the wino rolled from under the bronze horse and fell to the sidewalk he grunted staggered to his feet retrieved his cardboard box and quilt and left in the direction of downtown lomax jerked around and watched anxiously its just a tramp mitch said they both relaxed who are we hiding from lomax asked i wish i knew lomax studied his face carefully i think you know mitch said nothing look mitch youre not paying me to get involved i realize that but my instincts tell me youre in trouble and i think you need a friend someone to trust i can help if you need me i dont know who the bad guys are but im convinced theyre very dangerous thanks mitch said softly without looking as if it was time for lomax to leave and let him stand there in the sleet for a while i would jump in that river for ray mcdeere and i can certainly help his little brother mitch nodded slightly but said nothing lomax lit another cigarette and kicked the ice from his lizardskins just call me anytime and be careful theyre out there and they play for keeps at the intersection of madison and cooper in midtown the old twostory buildings had been renovated into singles bars and watering holes and gift shops and a handful of good restaurants the intersection was known as overton square and it provided memphis with its best nightlife a playhouse and a bookstore added a touch of culture trees lined the narrow median on madison the weekends were rowdy with college students and sailors from the navy base but on weeknights the restaurants were full but quiet and uncrowded paulettes a quaint french place in a white stucco building was noted for its wine list and desserts and the gentle voice of the man at the steinway with sudden affluence came a collection of credit cards and the mcdeeres had used theirs in a quest for the best restaurants in town paulettes was the favorite so far mitch sat in the corner of the bar drinking coffee and watching the front door he was early and had planned it that way he had called her three hours earlier and asked if he could have a date for seven she asked why and he said he would explain later since the caymans he had known someone was following watching listening for the past month he had spoken carefully on the phone had caught himself watching the rearview mirror had even chosen his words around the house someone was watching and listening he was sure abby rushed in from the cold and glanced around the parlor for her husband he met her in the front of the bar and pecked her on the cheek she removed her coat and they followed the maitre d to a small table in a row of small tables which were all full with people within earshot mitch glanced around for another table but there were none he thanked him and sat across from his wife whats the occasion she asked suspiciously do i need a reason to have dinner with my wife yes its seven oclock on monday night and youre not at the office this is indeed a special occasion a waiter squeezed between their table and the next and asked if they wanted a drink two white wines please mitch glanced around the dining room again and caught a glimpse of a gentleman sitting alone five tables away the face looked familiar when mitch looked again the face slid behind a menu whats the matter mitch he laid his hand on hers and frowned abby we gotta talk her hand flinched slightly and she stopped smiling about what he lowered his voice about something very serious she exhaled deeply and said can we wait for the wine i might need it mitch looked again at the face behind the menu we cant talk here then why are we here look abby you know where the rest rooms are down the hall over there to your right yes i know theres a rear entrance at the end of the hall it goes out to the side street behind the restaurant want you to go to the rest room then out the door ill be waiting next to the street she said nothing her eyebrows lowered and the eyes narrowed her head leaned slightly to the right trust me abby i can explain later ill meet you outside and well find another place to eat i cant talk in here youre scaring me please he said firmly squeezing her hand everything is fine ill bring your coat she stood with her purse and left the room mitch looked over his shoulder at the man with the familiar face who suddenly stood and welcomed an elderly lady to his table he did not notice abbys exit in the street behind paulettes mitch draped the coat over abbys shoulders and pointed eastward i can explain he said more than once a hundred feet down the street they walked between two buildings and came to the front entrance of the bombay bicycle club a singles bar with good food and live blues mitch looked at the headwaiter then surveyed the two dining rooms then pointed to a table in the rear corner that one he said mitch sat with his back to the wall and his face toward the dining room and the front door the corner was dark candles lit the table they ordered more wine abby sat motionless staring at him watching every move and waiting do you remember a guy named rick acklin from western kentucky no she said without moving her lips he played baseball lived in the dorm i think you may have met him once a very nice guy real cleancut good student i think he was from bowling green we werent good friends but we knew each other she shook her head and waited well he finished a year before we did and went to law school at wake forest now hes with the fbi and hes working here in memphis he watched her closely to see if fbi would have an impact it did not and today im eating lunch at obleos hotdog place on main street when rick walks up out of nowhere and says hello just like it was a real coincidence we chat for a few minutes and another agent guy by the name of tarrance walks up and has a seat its the second time tarrance has chased me down since i passed the bar the second yes since august and these are fbi agents yes with badges and everything tarrance is a veteran agent from new york been here about two years acklin is a rookie they brought in three months ago what do they want the wine arrived and mitch looked around the club a band was tuning up on a small stage in a far corner the bar was crowded with welldressed professional types chitting and chatting relentlessly the waiter pointed to the unopened menus later mitch said rudely abby i dont know what they want the first visit was in august right after my name was printed in the paper for passing the bar he sipped his wine and detailed play by play the first tarrance visit at lanskys deli on union the warnings about whom not to trust and where not to talk the meeting with locke and lambert and the other partners he explained their version of why the fbi was so interested in and said that he discussed it with lamar and believed every word locke and lambert had said abby hung on every word but waited to start asking and now today while im minding my own business eating a footlong with onions this guy i went to college with walks up and tells me that they the fbi know for a fact that my phones are bugged my home is wired and somebody down at bendini lambert locke knows when i sneeze and take a crap think of it abby rick acklin was transferred here after i passed the bar exam nice coincidence huh but what do they want they wont say they cant tell me yet they want me to trust them and all that routine i dont know abby i have no idea what theyre after but theyve chosen me for some reason did you tell lamar about this visit no i havent told anyone except you and i dont plan to tell anyone she gulped the wine our phones are tapped according to the fbi but how do they know theyre not stupid mitch if the fbi told me my phones were tapped id believe them you dont i dont know whom to believe locke and lambert were so smooth and believable when they explained how fights with the irs and the fbi i want to believe them but so much of it doesnt add up look at it this wayif had a rich client who was shady and worthy of fbi scrutiny why would the fbi pick me the rookie the one who knows the least and begin following me what do i know i work on files someone else hands me i have no clients of my own i do as im told why not go after one of the partners maybe they want you to squeal on the clients no way im a lawyer and sworn to secrecy about the affairs of clients everything i know about a client is strictly confidential the feds know that no one expects a lawyer to talk about his clients have you seen any illegal deals he cracked his knuckles and gazed around the dining room he smiled at her the wine had settled and was taking effect im not supposed to answer that question even from you abby but the answer is no ive worked on files for twenty of averys clients and a few other ones here and there and ive seen nothing suspicious maybe a couple of risky tax shelters but nothing illegal ive got a few questions about the bank accounts i saw in the caymans but nothing serious caymans his stomach dropped as he thought of the girl on the beach he felt sick the waiter loitered nearby and stared at the menus more wine mitch said pointing at the glasses abby leaned forward near the candles and looked bewildered okay who tapped our phones assuming theyre tapped i have no idea at the first meeting in august tarrance implied it was someone from i mean thats the way i took it he said not to trust anyone at and that everything i said was subject to being heard and recorded i assumed he meant they were doing it and what did mr locke say about that nothing i didnt tell him i kept a few things to myself someone has tapped our phones and wired our house and maybe our cars rick acklin made a big deal of it today he kept telling me not to say anything i didnt want recorded mitch this is incredible why would a law firm do that he shook his head slowly and looked into the empty wineglass i have no idea babe no idea the waiter set two new wineglasses on the table and stood with his hands behind him will you be ordering he asked in a few minutes abby said well call you when were ready mitch added do you believe it mitch i think somethings up theres more to the story she slowly folded her hands on the table and stared at him with a look of utter fear he told the story of hodge and kozinski starting with tarrance at the deli then to the caymans and being followed and the meeting with abanks he told her everything abanks had said then eddie lomax and the deaths of alice knauss robert lamm and john mickel ive lost my appetite she said when he finished so have i but i feel better now that you know why didnt you tell me sooner i hoped it would go away i hoped tarrance would leave me alone and find someone else to torment but hes here to stay thats why rick acklin was transferred to memphis to work on me i have been selected by the fbi for a mission i know nothing about i feel weak we have to be careful abby we must continue to live as if we suspect nothing i dont believe this im sitting here listening to you but i dont believe what youre telling me this is not real mitch you expect me to live in a house thats wired and the phones are tapped and someone somewhere is listening to everything we say do you have a better idea yeah lets hire this lomax guy to inspect our house ive thought of that but what if he finds something think about it what if we know for sure that the house is wired what then what if he breaks a device thats been planted they whoever in hell they are will know that we know its too dangerous for now anyway maybe later this is crazy mitch i guess were supposed to run out in the backyard to have a conversation of course not we could use the front yard at this moment i dont appreciate your sense of humor sorry look abby lets be normal and patient for a while tarrance has convinced me hes serious and hes not going to forget about me i cant stop him he finds me remember i think they follow me and wait in ambush for the time being its important that we carry on as usual usual come to think of it theres not much conversation around our house these days i sort of feel sorry for them if theyre waiting to hear meaningful dialogue i talk to hearsay a lot the snow cleared long before christmas leaving the ground wet and making way for the traditional southern holiday weather of gray skies and cold rain memphis had seen two white christmases in the past ninety years and the experts predicted no more in the century there was snow in kentucky but the roads were clear abby called her parents early christmas morning after she packed she was coming she said but she would be alone they were disappointed they said and suggested that perhaps she should stay if it was causing trouble she insisted it was a tenhour drive traffic would be light and she would be there by dark mitch said very little he spread the morning paper on the floor next to the tree and pretended to concentrate as she loaded her car the dog hid nearby under a chair as if waiting for an explosion their gifts had been opened and arranged neatly on the couch clothes and perfume and albums and for her a fulllength fox coat for the first time in the young marriage there was money to spend at christmas she draped the coat over her arm and walked to the paper im leaving now she said softly but firmly he stood slowly and looked at her i wish you would come with me she said maybe next year it was a lie and they knew it but it sounded good it was promising please be careful take care of my dog well be fine he took her shoulders and kissed her on the cheek he looked at her and smiled she was beautiful much more so than when they married at twentyfour she looked her age but the years were becoming very generous they walked to the carport and he helped her into the car they kissed again and she backed down the driveway merry christmas he said to himself merry christmas he said to the dog after an hour of watching the walls he threw two changes of clothes in the bmw placed hearsay in the front seat and left town he drove south on interstate out of memphis into mississippi the road was deserted but he kept an eye on the rearview mirror the dog whimpered precisely every sixty minutes and mitch would stop on the shoulderif possible just over a hill he would find a cluster of trees where he could hide and watch the traffic while hearsay did his business he noticed nothing after five stops he was sure he was not being followed they evidently took off christmas day in six hours he was in mobile and two hours later he crossed the bay at pensacola and headed for the emerald coast of florida highway ran through the coastal towns of navarre fort walton beach destin and sandestin it encountered clusters of condominiums and motels miles of shopping centers then strings of rundown amusement parks and low rent tshirt shops most of which had been locked and neglected since labor day then it went for miles with no congestion no sprawl just an awesome view of the snowywhite beaches and brilliant emerald waters of the gulf east of sandestin the highway narrowed and left the coast and for an hour he drove alone on the twolane with nothing to look at but the woods and an occasional selfserve gas station or quickshop convenience store at dusk he passed a high rise and a sign said panama city beach was eight miles ahead the highway found the coast again at a point where it forked and offered a choice between the bypass to the north and the scenic route straight ahead on what was called the miracle strip he chose the scenic route next to the beachthe strip that ran for fifteen miles by the water and was lined on both sides with condos cheap motels trailer parks vacation cottages fastfood joints and tshirt shops this was panama city beach most of the ten zillion condos were empty but there were a few cars parked about and he assumed that some families vacationed on the beach for christmas a hotweather christmas at least theyre together he said to himself the dog barked and they stopped by a pier where men from pennsylvania and ohio and canada fished and watched the dark waters they cruised the miracle strip by themselves hearsay stood on the door and took in the sights barking at the occasional flashing neon of a cinderblock motel advertising its openness and cheap rates christmas on the miracle strip closed everything but a handful of diehard coffee shops and motels he stopped for gas at an allnight texaco with a clerk who seemed uncommonly friendly san luis street mitch asked yes yes the clerk said with an accent and pointed to the west second traffic light to the right first left thats san luis the neighborhood was a disorganized suburb of antique mobile homes mobile yes but it was apparent they had not moved in decades the trailers were packed tightly together like rows of dominoes the short narrow driveways seemed inches apart and were filled with old pickups and rusted lawn furniture the streets were crowded with parked cars junk cars abandoned cars motorcycles and bicycles leaned on the trailer hitches and lawnmower handles protruded from beneath each home a sign called the place a retirement villagesan pedro estatesa half mile from the emerald coast it was more like a slum on wheels or a project with a trailer hitch he found san luis street and suddenly felt nervous it was winding and narrow with smaller trailers in worse shape than the other retirement homes he drove slowly anxiously watching street numbers and observing the multitude of outofstate license plates the street was empty except for the parked and abandoned cars the home at san luis was one of the oldest and smallest it was scarcely bigger than a camper the original paint job looked to be silver but the paint was cracked and peeling and a dark green layer of mold covered the top and inched downward to a point just above the windows the screens were missing one window above the trailer hitch was badly cracked and held together with gray electrical tape a small covered porch surrounded the only entrance the storm door was open and through the screen mitch could see a small color television and the silhouette of a man walking by this was not what he wanted by choice he had never met his mothers second husband and now was not the time he drove on wishing he had not come he found on the strip the familiar marquee of a holiday inn it was empty but open he hid the bmw away from the highway and registered under the name of eddie lomax of danesboro kentucky he paid cash for a single room with an ocean view the panama city beach phone book listed three waffle huts on the strip he lay across the motel bed and dialed the first number no luck he dialed the second number and again asked for eva ainsworth just a minute he was told he hung up it was pm he had slept for two hours the taxi took twenty minutes to arrive at the holiday inn and the driver began by explaining that he had been home enjoying leftover turkey with his wife and kids and kinfolks when the dispatcher called and how it was christmas and he hoped to be with his family all day and not worry about work for one day of the year mitch threw a twenty over the seat and asked him to be quiet whats at thewaffle hut man the driver asked just drive waffles right he laughed and mumbled to himself he adjusted the radio volume and found his favorite soul station he glanced in the mirror looked out the windows whistled a bit then said what brings you down here on christmas looking for someone who a woman aint we all anyone in particular an old friend she at the waffle hut i think so you some kinda private eye or something no seems mighty suspicious to me why dont you just drive the waffle hut was a small rectangular boxlike building with a dozen tables and a long counter facing the grill where everything was cooked in the open large plateglass windows lined one side next to the tables so the customers could take in the strip and the condos in the distance while they enjoyed their pecan waffles and bacon the small parking lot was almost full and mitch directed the driver to an empty slot near the building aint you getting out the driver asked no keep the meter running man this is strange youll get paid you got that right mitch leaned forward and rested his arms on the front seat the meter clicked softly as he studied the customers inside the driver shook his head slumped in the seat but watched out of curiosity in the corner next to the cigarette machine a table of fat tourists with long shirts white legs and black socks drank coffee and all talked at the same time while glancing at the menus the leader the one with an unbuttoned shirt a heavy gold chain draped upon his chest hair thick gray sideburns and a phillies baseball cap looked repeatedly toward the grill in search of a waitress you see her asked the driver mitch said nothing then leaned forward and frowned she appeared from nowhere and stood at the table with her pen and order book the leader said something funny and the fat people laughed she never smiled just kept writing she was frail and much thinner almost too thin the blackandwhite uniform fit snugly and squeezed her tiny waist her gray hair was pulled tightly and hidden under the waffle hut bonnet she was fiftyone and from the distance she looked her age nothing worse she seemed sharp when she finished scribbling she snatched the menus from their hands said something polite almost smiled then disappeared she moved quickly among the tables pouring coffee handing ketchup bottles and giving orders to the cook mitch relaxed the meter ticked slowly is that her asked the driver yes what now i dont know well we found her didnt we mitch followed her movements and said nothing she poured coffee for a man sitting alone he said something and she smiled a wonderful gracious smile a smile he had seen a thousand times in the darkness staring at the ceiling his mothers smile a light mist began to fall and the intermittent wipers cleaned the windshield every ten seconds it was almost midnight christmas day the driver tapped the wheel nervously and fidgeted he sank lower in the seat then changed stations how long we gonna sit here not long man this is weird youll be paid man money aint everything its christmas i got kids at home kinfolks visiting turkey and wine to finish off and here i am sitting at the waffle hut so you ean look at some old woman through the window its my mother your what you heard me man oh man i get all kinds just shut up okay okay aint you gonna talk to her i mean its christmas and you found your momma you gotta go see her dont you no not now mitch sat back in the seat and looked at the dark beach across the highway lets go at daybreak he dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt no socks or shoes and took hearsay for a walk on the beach they walked east toward the first glow of orange peeking above the horizon the waves broke gently thirty yards out and rolled quietly onto shore the sand was cool and wet the sky was clear and full of sea gulls talking incessantly among themselves hearsay ran boldly into the sea then retreated furiously when the next wave of white foam approached for a house dog the endless stretch of sand and water demanded exploration he ran a hundred yards ahead of mitch after two miles they approached a pier a large concrete structure running two hundred feet from the beach into the ocean hearsay fearless now darted onto it and ran to a bucket of bait next to two men standing motionless and staring down at the water mitch walked behind them to the end of the pier where a dozen fishermen talked occasionally to each other and waited for their lines to jump the dog rubbed himself on mitchs leg and grew still a brilliant return of the sun was in progress and for miles the water glistened and turned from black to green mitch leaned on the railing and shivered in the cool wind his bare feet were frozen and gritty for miles along the beach in both directions the hotels and condos sat quietly and waited for the day there was no one on the beach another pier jutted into the water miles away the fishermen spoke with the sharp precise words of those from the north mitch listened long enough to learn the fish were not biting he studied the sea looking southeast he thought of the caymans and abanks and the girl for a moment then she was gone he would return to the islands in march for a vacation with his wife damn the girl surely he would not see her he would dive with abanks and cultivate a friendship they would drink heineken and red stripe at his bar and talk of hodge and kozinski he would follow whoever was following him now that abby was an accomplice she would assist him the man waited in the dark beside the lincoln town car he nervously checked his watch and glanced at the dimly lit sidewalk that disappeared in front of the building on the second floor a light was turned off a minute later the private eye walked from the building toward the car the man walked up to him are you eddie lomax he asked anxiously lomax slowed then stopped they were facetoface yeah who are you the man kept his hands in his pockets it was cold and damp and he was shaking al kilbury i need some help mr lomax real bad ill pay you right now in cash whatever you want just help me its late pal please ive got the money nafttehe price you gotta help mr lomax he pulled a roll of ca from his left pants pocket and stood ready to count lomax looked at the money then glanced over his shoulder whats the problem my wife in an hour shes supposed to meet a man at a motel in south memphis ive got the room number and all i just need you to go with me and take pictures of them coming and going how do you know this phone taps she works with the man and ive been suspicious im a wealthy man mr lomax and its imperative i win the divorce ill pay you a thousand in cash now he quickly peeled off ten bills and offered them lomax took the money okay let me get my camera please hurry everythings in cash okay no records suits me said lomax as he walked toward the building twenty minutes later the lincoln rolled slowly through the crowded parking lot of a days inn kilbury pointed to a secondfloor room on the back side of the motel then to a parking space next to a brown chevy van lomax backed carefully alongside the van and parked his town car kilbury again pointed to the room again checked his watch and again told lomax how much he appreciated his services lomax thought of the money a thousand bucks for two hours work not bad he unpacked a camera loaded the film and gauged the light kilbury watched nervously his eyes darting from the camera to the room across the parking lot he looked hurt he talked of his wife and their wonderful years together and why oh why was she doing this lomax listened and watched the rows of parked cars in front of him he held his camera he did not notice the door of the brown van it quietly and slowly slid open just three feet behind him a man in a black turtleneck wearing black gloves crouched low in the van and waited when the parking lot was still he jumped from the van yanked open the left rear door of the lincoln and fired three times into the back of eddies head the shots muffled with a silencer could not be heard outside the car eddie slumped against the wheel already dead kilbury bolted from the lincoln ran to the van and sped away with the assassin after three days of unbillable time of no production of exile from their sanctuaries of turkey and ham and cranberry sauce and new toys that came unassembled the rested and rejuvenated lawyers of bendini lambert locke returned to the fortress on front street with a vengeance the parking lot was full by seventhirty they sat fixed and comfortable behind their heavy desks drank coffee by the gallon meditated over mail and correspondence and documents and mumbled incoherently and furiously into their dictaphones they barked orders at secretaries and clerks and paralegals and at each other there were a few how was your christmas greetings in the halls and around the coffeepots but small talk was cheap and unbillable the sounds of typewriters intercoms and secretaries all harmonized into one glorious hum as the mint recovered from the nuisance of christmas oliver lambert walked the halls smiling with satisfaction and listening just listening to the sounds of wealth being made by the hour at noon lamar walked into the office and leaned across the desk mitch was deep into an oil and gas deal in indonesia lunch lamar asked no thanks im behind arent we all i thought we could run down to the front street deli for a bowl of chili ill pass thanks lamar glanced over his shoulder at the door and leaned closer as if he had extraordinary news to share you know what today is dont you mitch glanced at his watch the twentyeighth right and do you know what happens on the twentyeighth of december of every year you have a bowel movement yes and what else okay i give up what happens at this very moment in the dining room on the fifth floor all the partners are gathered for a lunch of roast duck and french wine wine for lunch yes its a very special occasion okay after they eat for an hour roosevelt and jessie frances will leave and lambert will lock the door then its all the partners you see only the partners and lambert will hand out a financial summary for the year its got all the partners listed and beside each name is a number that represents their total billing for the year then on the next page is a summary of the net profits after expenses then based on production they divide the pie mitch hung on every word and and last year the average piece of pie was three hundred and thirty thousand and of course its expected to be even higher this year goes up every year three hundred and thirty thousand mitch repeated slowly yep and thats just the average locke will get close to a million victor milligan will run a close second and what about us we get a piece too a very small piece last year it was around nine thousand on the average depends on how long youve been here and production can we go watch they wouldnt sell a ticket to the president its supposed to be a secret meeting but we all know about it word will begin drifting down late this afternoon when do they vote on who to make the next partner normally it would be done today but according to rumor there may not be a new partner this year because of marty and joe i think marty was next in line then joe now they might wait a year or two so whos next in line lamar stood straight and smiled proudly one year from today my friend i will become a partner in bendini lambert locke im next in line so dont get in my way this year i heard it was massengilla harvard man i might add massengill doesnt have a prayer i intend to bill a hundred and forty hours a week for the next fiftytwo weeks and those birds will beg me to become a partner ill go to the fourth floor and massengill will go to the basement with the paralegals im putting my money on massengill hes a wimp ill run him into the ground lets go eat a bowl of chili and ill reveal my strategy thanks but i need to work lamar strutted from the office and passed nina who was carrying a stack of papers she laid them on a cluttered corner of the desk im going to lunch need anything no thanks yes a diet coke the halls quietened during lunch as the secretaries escaped the building and walked toward downtown to a dozen small cafes and delicatessens nearby with half the lawyers on the fifth floor counting their money the gentle roar of commerce took an intermission mitch found an apple on ninas desk and rubbed it clean he opened a manual on irs regulations laid it on the copier behind her desk and touched the green print button a red warning lit up and flashed the message insert file number he backed away and looked at the copier yes it was a new one next to the print button was another that read bypass he stuck his thumb on it a shrill siren erupted from within the machine and the entire panel of buttons turned bright red he looked around helplessly saw no one and frantically grabbed the instruction manual whats going on here someone demanded over the wailing of the copier i dont know mitch yelled waving the manual lela pointer a secretary too old to walk from the building for lunch reached behind the machine and flipped a switch the siren died what the hell mitch said panting didnt they tell you she demanded grabbing the manual and placing it back in its place she drilled a hole in him with her tiny fierce eyes as if she had caught him in her purse obviously not whats the deal we have a new copying system she lectured downward through her nose it was installed the day after christmas you must code in the file number before the machine will copy your secretary was supposed to tell you you mean this thing will not copy unless i punch in a tendigit number thats correct what about copies in general with no particular file cant be done mr lambert says we lose too much money on unbilled copies so from now on every copy is automatically billed to a file you punch in the number first the machine records the number of copies and sends it to the main terminal where it goes on the clients billing account what about personal copies lela shook her head in total frustration i cant believe your secretary didnt tell you all this well she didnt so why dont you help me out you have a fourdigit access number for yourself at the end of each month youll be billed for your personal copies mitch stared at the machine and shook his head why the damned alarm system mr lambert says that after thirty days they will cut off the alarms right now theyre needed for people like you hes very serious about this says weve been losing thousands on unbilled copies right and i suppose every copier in the building has been replaced she smiled with satisfaction yes all seventeen thanks mitch returned to his office in search of a file number at three that afternoon the celebration on the fifth floor came to a joyous conclusion and the partners now much wealthier and slightly drunker filed out of the dining room and descended to their offices below avery oliver lambert and nathan locke walked theshort hallway to the security wall and pushed the button devashej was waiting he waved at the chairs in his office and told them to sit down lambert passed around handwrapped hondurans and everyone lit up well i see were all in a festive mood devasher said with a sneer how much was it three hundred and ninety thousand average thats correct devasher lambert said it was a very good year he puffed slowly and blew smoke rings at the ceiling did we all have a wonderful christmas devasher asked whats on your mind locke demanded merry christmas to you too nat just a few things i met with lazarov two days ago in new orleans he does not celebrate the birth of christ you know i brought him up to date on the situation down here with emphasis on mcdeere and the fbi i assured him there had been no further contact since the initial meeting he did not quite believe this and said he would check with his sources within the bureau i dont know what that means but who am i to ask questions he instructed me to trail mcdeere twentyfour hours a day for the next six months i told him we were already doing so sort of he does not want another hodgekozinski situation hes very distressed about that mcdeere is not to leave the city on firm business unless at least two of us go with him

with lazarov hell make us send five men for surveillance what an idiot ernies airport lounge was indeed near the airport mitch found it after three attempts and parked between two fourwheeldrive swampmobiles with real mud caked on the tires and headlights the parking lot was full of such vehicles he looked around and instinctively removed his tie it was almost eleven the lounge was deep and long and dark with colorful beer signs flashing in the painted windows he looked at the note again just to be sure dear mr mcdeere please meet me at ernies lounge on winchester tonightlate its about eddie lomax very important tammy hemphill his secretary the note had been tacked on the door to the kitchen when he arrived home he remembered her from the one visit to eddies office back in november he remembered the tight leather skirt huge breasts bleached hair red sticky lips and smoke billowing from her nose and he remembered the story about her husband elvis the door opened without incident and he slid inside a row of pool tables covered the left half of the room through the darkness and black smoke he could make out a small dance floor in the rear to the right was a long saloontype bar crowded with cowboys and cowgirls all drinking bud longnecks no one seemed to notice him he walked quickly to the end of the bar and slid onto the stool bud longneck he told the bartender tammy arrived before the beer she was sitting and waiting on a crowded bench by the pool tables she wore tight washed jeans faded denim shirt and kinky red highheels the hair had just received a fresh bleaching thanks for coming she said into his face ive been waiting for four hours i knew of no other way to find you mitch nodded and smiled as if to say its okay you did the right thing whats up he said she looked around we need to talk but not here where do you suggest could we maybe drive around sure but not in my car it uh it may not be a good idea ive got a car its old but itll do mitch paid for the beer and followed her to the door a cowpoke sitting near the door said getta loada this guy shows up with a suit and picks her up in thirty seconds mitch smiled at him and hurried out the door dwarfed in a row of massive mudeating machinery was a wellworn volkswagen rabbit she unlocked it and mitch doubled over and squeezed into the cluttered seat she pumped the accelerator five times and turned the key mitch held his breath until it started where would you like to go she asked where we cant be seen mitch thought youre driving youre married arent you she asked yes you yes and my husband would not understand this situation right here thats why i chose that dump back there we never go there she said this as if she and her husband were discriminating critics of dark redneck dives i dont think my wife would understand either shes out of town though tammy drove in the direction of the airport ive got an idea she said she clutched the steering wheel tightly and spoke nervously whats on your mind mitch asked well you heard about eddie yes when did you last see him we met ten days or so before christmas it was sort of a secret meeting thats what i thought he kept no records of the work he was doing for you said you wanted it that way he didnt tell me much but me and eddie well we uh we were close mitch could think of no response i mean we were very close know what i mean mitch grunted and sipped the longneck and he told me things i guess he wasnt supposed to tell me said you had a real strange case that some lawyers in your firm had died under suspicious circumstances and that you always thought somebody was following and listening thats pretty weird for a law firm so much for the confidentiality thought mitch that it is she turned made the exit to the airport and headed for the acres of parked cars and after he finished his work for you he told me once just once in bed that he thought he was being followed this was three days before christmas and i asked him who it was he said he didnt know but mentioned your case and something about it was probably related to the same people who were following you he didnt say much she parked in the shortterm section near the terminal who else would follow him mitch asked no one he was a good investigator who left no trail i mean he was an excop and an excon he was very streetsmart he got paid to follow people and collect dirt no one followed him never so who killed him whoever was following him the paper made like he got caught snooping on some rich guy and was wasted its not true suddenly from out of nowhere she produced a filtertip and shot a flame at the end mitch rolled down the window mind if i smoke she asked no just blow it that way he said pointing to her window anyway im scared eddie was convinced the people following you are extremely dangerous and extremely smart very sophisticated was what he said and if they killed him what about me maybe they think i know something i havent been to the office since the day he was killed dont plan to go back i wouldnt if i were you im not stupid i worked for him for two years and learned a lot theres a lot of nuts out there we saw all kinds how did they shoot him hes got a friend in homicide guy told me confidentially that eddie got hit three times in the back of the head pointblank range with a pistol and they dont have a clue he told me it was a very clean professional job mitch finished the longneck and laid the bottle on the floorboard with a half dozen empty beer cans a very clean professional job it doesnt make sense she repeated i mean how could anyone sneak up behind eddie somehow get in the back seat and shoot him three times in the back of the head and he wasnt even supposed to be there maybe he fell asleep and they ambushed him no he took all kinds of speed when he worked late at night stayed wired are there any records at the oflice you mean about you yeah about me i doubt it i never saw nothing in writing he said you wanted it that way thats right mitch said with relief they watched a lift off to the north the parking lot vibrated im really scared mitch can i call you mitch sure why not i think he got killed because of the work he did for you thats all it could be and if theyd kill him because he knew something they probably assume i know it too what do you think i wouldnt take any chances i might disappear for a while my husband does a little nightclub work and we can get mobile if we have to i havent told him all this but i guess i have to what do you think where would you go little rock st louis nashville hes laid off so we can move around i guess her words trailed off she lit another one a very clean professional job mitch repeated to himself he glanced at her and noticed a small tear on her cheek she was not ugly but the years in lounges and nightclubs were taking their toll her features were strong and minus the bleach and heavy makeup she would be somewhat attractive for her age about forty he guessed she took a mighty drag and sent a cloud of smoke surging from the rabbit i guess were in the same boat arent we i mean theyre after both of us theyve killed all those lawyers now eddie and i guess were next dont hold back baby just blurt it out look lets do this we need to keep in touch you cant call me on the phone and we cant be seen together my wife knows everything and ill tell her about this little meeting dont worry about her once a week write me a note and tell me where you are whats your mothers name doris good thats your code name sign the name doris on anything you send me do they read your mail too probably so doris probably so at five pm mitch turned off the light in his office grabbed both briefcases and stopped at ninas desk her phone was glued to one shoulder while she typed on the ibm she saw him and reached in a drawer for an envelope this is your confirmation at the capital hilton she said into the receiver the dictation is on my desk he said see you monday he took the stairs to the fourth floor to averys office in the corner where a small riot was in progress one secretary stuffed files into a massive briefcase another one spoke sharply to avery who was yelling on the phone to someone else a paralegal shot orders to the first secretary avery slammed the phone down are you ready he demanded at mitch waiting for you mitch replied i cant find the greenmark file a secretary snarled at the paralegal it was with the rocconi file said the paralegal i dont need the greenmark file avery shouted how many times do i have to tell you are you deaf the secretary glared at avery no i can hear very well and i distinctly heard you say tack the greenmark file the limousine is waiting said the other secretary i dont need the damned greenmark file avery shouted how about rocconi asked the paralegal yes yes for the tenth time i need the rocconi file the airplane is waiting too said the other secretary one briefcase was slammed shut and locked avery dug through a pile of documents on his desk wheres the fender file where are any of my files why cant i ever find a file heres fender said the first secretary as she stmted it into another briefcase avery stared at a piece of notepaper all right do i have fender rocconi cambridge partners greene group sonny capps to otaki burton brothers galveston freight and mcquade yes yes yes said the first secretary thats all of them said the paralegal i dont believe it avery said as he grabbed his jacket lets go he strode through the door with the secretaries paralegal and mitch in pursuit mitch carried two briefcases the paralegal had two and a secretary had one the other secretary scribbled notes as avery barked the orders and demands he wanted carried out while he was away the entourage crowded onto the small elevator for the ride to the first floor outside the chauifeur sprang into action opening doors and loading it all in the trunk mitch and avery fell into the back seat relax avery mitch said youre going to the caymans for three days just relax right right im taking with me enough work for a month ive got clients screaming for my hide threatening suits for legal malpractice im two months behind and now youre leaving for four days of boredom at a tax seminar in washington your timing is great mcdeere just great avery opened a cabinet and mixed a drink mitch declined the limo moved around riverside drive in the rushhour traffic after three swallows of gin the partner breathed deeply continuing education what a joke avery said you did it when you were a rookie and if im not mistaken you spent a week not long ago at that international tax seminar in honolulu or did you forget it was work all work are you taking your files with you of course avery im expected to attend the tax seminar eight hours a day learn the latest tax revisions congress has bestowed upon us and in my spare time bill five hours a day six if you can were behind mitch were always behind avery fix another drink you need to unwind i plan to unwind at rumheads mitch thought of the bar with its red stripe dominoes darts and yes string bikinis and the girl is this your first flight on the lear avery asked more relaxed now yes ive been here seven months and im just now seeing the plane if i had known this last march id have gone to work with a wall street firm youre not wall street material you know what those guys do theyve got three hundred lawyers in a firm right and each year they hire thirty new associates maybe more everybody wants a job because its wall street right and after about a month they get all thirty of them together in one big room and inform them theyre expected to work ninety hours a week for five years and at the end of five years half of them will be gone the turnover is incredible they try to kill the rookies bill them out at a hundred hundredfifty an hour make a bundle off them then run them off thats wall street and the little boys never get to see plane or limo you are truly lucky mitch you should thank god every day that we chose to accept you here at good old bendini lambert locke ninety hours sounds like fun i could use the rest itll pay off did you hear what my bonus was last year no foureightfive not bad huh and thats just the bonus i got six thousand mitch said stick with me and youll be in the big leagues soon enough yeah but first i gotta get my continuing legal education ten minutes later the limo turned into a drive that led to a row of hangars memphis aero the sign said a sleek silver lear taxied slowly toward the terminal thats it avery said the briefcases and luggage were loaded quickly onto the plane and within minutes they were cleared for takeoff mitch fastened his seat belt and admired the leatherandbrass cabin it was lavish and luxurious and he had expected nothing less avery mixed another drink and buckled himself in an hour and fifteen minutes later the lear began its descent into baltimorewashington international airport after it taxied to a stop avery and mitch descended to the tarmac and opened the baggage door avery pointed jto a man in a uniform standing near a gate thats your chauffeur the limo is in front just follow him youre about forty minutes from the capital hilton another limo mitch asked yeah they wouldnt do this for you on wall street they shook hands and avery climbed back on the plane the refueling took thirty minutes and when the lear took off and turned south he was asleep again three hours later it landed in georgetown grand cayman it taxied past the terminal to a very small hangar where it would spend the night a security guard waited on avery and his luggage and escorted him to the terminal and through customs the pilot and copilot ran through the post flight ritual they too were escorted through the terminal after midnight the lights in the hangar were extinguished and the half dozen planes sat in the darkness a side door opened and three men one of them avery entered and walked quickly to the lear avery opened the baggage compartment and the three hurriedly unloaded twentyfive heavy cardboard boxes in the muggy tropical heat the hangar was like an oven they sweated profusely but said nothing until all boxes were out of the plane there should be twentyfive count them avery said to a musclebound native with a tank top and a pistol on his hip the other man held a clipboard and watched intently as if he was a receiving clerk in a warehouse the native counted quickly sweat dripping onto the boxes yes twentyfive how much asked the man with the clipboard six and a half million all cash all cash us dollars hundreds and twenties lets get it loaded wheres it going quebecbanq theyre waiting for us they each grabbed a box and walked through the dark to the side door where a comrade was waiting with an uzi the boxes were loaded into a dilapidated van with cayman produce stenciled badly on the side the armed natives sat with guns drawn as the receiving clerk drove away from the hangar in the direction of downtown georgetown registration began at eight outside the century room on the mezzanine mitch arrived early signed in picked up the heavy notebook of materials with his name printed neatly on the cover and went inside he took a seat near the center of the large room registration was limited to two hundred the brochure said a porter served coffee and mitch spread the washington post before him the news was dominated by a dozen stories of the beloved redskins who were in the super bowl again the room filled slowly as tax lawyers from around the country gathered to hear the latest developments in tax laws that changed daily a few minutes before nine a cleancut boyish attorney sat to mitchs left and said nothing mitch glanced at him and returned to the paper when the room was packed the moderator welcomed everyone and introduced the first speaker congressman something or other from oregon chairman of a house ways and means subcommittee as he took the podium for what was supposed to be a onehour presentation the attorney to mitchs left leaned over and offered his hand hi mitch he whispered im grant harbison fbi he handed mitch a card the congressman started with a joke that mitch did not hear he studied the card holding it near his chest there were five people seated within three feet of him he didnt know anyone in the room but it would be embarrassing if anyone knew he was holding an fbi card after five minutes mitch shot a blank stare at harbison harbison whispered i need to see you for a few minutes what if im busy mitch asked the agent slid a plain white envelope from his seminar notebook and handed it to mitch he opened it near his chest it was handwritten across the top in small but imposing letters the words read simply office of the director fbi the note read dear mr mcdeere i would like to speak with you for a few moments during lunch please follow the instructions of agent harbison it wont take long we appreciate your cooperation thanks f denton voyles director mitch folded the letter in the envelope and slowly placed it in his notebook we appreciate your cooperation from the director of the fbi he realized the importance at this moment of maintaining his composure of keeping a straight calm face as if it was simply routine but he rubbed his temples with both hands and stared at the floor in front of him he closed his eyes and felt dizzy the fbi sitting next to him waiting on him the director and hell knows who else tarrance would be close at hand suddenly the room exploded in laughter at the congressmans punch line harbison leaned quickly toward mitch and whispered meet me in the mens room around the corner in ten minutes the agent left his notebooks on the table and exited amid the laughter mitch flipped to the first section of the notebook and pretended to study the materials the congressman was detailing his courageous battle to protect tax shelters for the wealthy while at the same time easing the burden on the working class under his fearless guidance the subcommittee had refused to report legislation limiting deductions for oil and gas exploration he was a oneman army on the hill mitch waited fifteen minutes then another five then began coughing he needed water and with hand over mouth he slid between the chairs to the back of the room and out the rear door harbison was in the mens room washing his hands for the tenth time mitch walked to the basin next to him and turned on the cold water what are you boys up to mitch asked harbison looked at mitch in the mirror im just following orders director voyles wants to personally meet you and i was sent to get you and what might he want i wouldnt want to steal his thunder but im sure its rather important mitch cautiously glanced around the rest room it was empty and what if im too busy to meet with him harbison turned oflf the water and shook his hands into the basin the meeting is inevitable mitch lets not play games when your little seminar breaks for lunch youll find a cab number outside to the left of the main entrance it will take you to the vietnam veterans memorial and well be there you must be careful two of them followed you here from memphis two of whom the boys from memphis just do as we say and theyll never know the moderator thanked the second speaker a tax professor from new york university and dismissed them for lunch mitch said nothing to the taxi driver he sped away like a maniac and they were soon lost in traffic fifteen minutes later they parked near the memorial dont get out yet the driver said with authority mitch did not move for ten minutes he did not move or speak finally a white ford escort pulled alongside the cab and honked it then drove away the driver stared ahead and said okay go to the wall theyll find you after about five minutes mitch stepped to the sidewalk and the cab left he stuck his hands deep in the pockets of his wool overcoat and walked slowly to the memorial bitter wind gusts from the north scattered leaves in all directions he shivered and flipped the collar of his coat around his ears a solitary pilgrim sat rigidly in a wheelchair and stared at the wall he was covered with a heavy quilt under his oversized camouflage beret a pair of aviators sunglasses covered his eyes he sat near the end of the wall near the names of those killed in mitch followed the years down the sidewalk until he stopped near the wheelchair he searched the names suddenly oblivious of the man he breathed deeply and was aware of a numbness in his legs and stomach he looked slowly downward and then near the bottom there it was engraved neatly matteroffactly just like all the others was the name rusty mcdeere a basket of frozen and wilted flowers sat on its side next to the monument inches under his name mitch gently laid them to one side and knelt before the wall he touched the engraved letters of rustys name rusty mcdeere age eighteen forever seven weeks in vietnam when he stepped on a land mine death was instantaneous they said they always said that according to ray mitch wiped a small tear and stood staring at the length of the wall he thought of the fiftyeight thousand families who had been told that death was instantaneous and no one suffered over there mitch theyre waiting he turned and looked at the man in the wheelchair the only human in sight the aviators glasses stared at the wall and did not look up mitch glanced around in all directions relax mitch weve got the place sealed off theyre not watching and who are you mitch asked just one of the gang you need to trust us mitch the director has important words words that could save your life where is he the man in the wheelchair turned his head and looked down the sidewalk start walking that way theyll find you mitch stared for a moment longer at his brothers name and walked behind the wheelchair he walked past the statue of the three soldiers he walked slowly waiting with hands deep in his pockets fifty yards past the monument wayne tarrance stepped from behind a tree and walked beside him keep walking he said why am i not surprised to see you here mitch said just keep walking we know of at least two goons from memphis who were flown in ahead of you theyre at the same hotel next door to you they did not follow you here i think we lost them what the hells going on tarrance youre about to find out keep walking but relax no one is watching you except for about twenty of our agents twenty yeah weve got this place sealed off we want to make sure those bastards from memphis dont show up here i dont expect them who are they the director will explain why is the director involved you ask a lot of questions mitch and you dont have enough answers tarrance pointed to the right they left the sidewalk and headed for a heavy concrete bench near a footbridge leading to a small forest the water on the pond below was frozen white have a seat tarrance instructed they sat down two men walked across the footbridge mitch immediately recognized the shorter one as voyles f denton voyles director of the fbi under three presidents a toughtalking heavyhanded crime buster with a reputation for ruthlessness mitch stood out of respect when they stopped at the bench voyles stuck out a cold hand and stared at mitch with the same large round face that was famous around the world they shook hands and exchanged names voyles pointed to the bench tarrance and the other agent walked to the footbridge and studied the horizon mitch glanced across the pond and saw two men undoubtedly agents with their identical black trench coats and close haircuts standing against a tree a hundred yards away voyles sat close to mitch their legs touching a brown fedora rested to one side of his large bald head he was at least seventy but the dark green eyes danced with intensity and missed nothing both men sat still on the cold bench with their hands stuck deep in their overcoats i appreciate you coming voyles started i didnt feel as though i had a choice you folks have been relentless yes its very important to us mitch breathed deeply do you have any idea how confused and scared i am im totally bewildered i would like an explanation sir mr mcdeere can i call you mitch sure why not fine mitch i am a man of very few words and what im about to tell you will certainly shock you you will be horrified you may not believe me but i assure you its all true and with your help we can save your life mitch braced himself and waited mitch no lawyer has ever left your law firm alive three have tried and they were killed two were about to leave and they died last summer once a lawyer joins bendini lambert locke he never leaves unless he retires and keeps his mouth shut and by the time they retire they are a part of the conspiracy and cannot talk has an extensive surveillance operation on the fifth floor your house and car are bugged your phones are tapped your desk and office are wired virtually every word you utter is heard and recorded on the fifth floor they follow you and sometimes your wife they are here in washington as we speak you see mitch is more than a firm it is a division of a very large business a very profitable business a very illegal business is not owned by the partners mitch turned and watched him closely the director looked at the frozen pond as he spoke you see mitch the law firm of bendini lambert locke is owned by the morolto crime family in chicago the mafia the mob they call the shots from up there and thats why were here he touched mitch firmly on the knee and stared at him from six inches away its mafia mitch and illegal as hell i dont believe it he said frozen with fear his voice was weak and shrill the director smiled yes you do mitch yes you do youve been suspicious for some time now thats why you talked to abanks in the caymans thats why you hired that sleazy investigator and got him killed by those boys on the fifth floor you know stinks mitch mitch leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees he stared at the ground between his shoes i dont believe it he mumbled weakly as far as we can tell about twentyfive percent of their clients or i should say your clients are legitimate there are some very good lawyers in that firm and they do tax and securities work for rich clients its a very good front most of the files youve worked on so far have been legit thats how they operate they bring in a new rookie throw money at him buy the bmw the house all that jazz wine and dine and go to the caymans and they work his ass off with what is really legitimate legal stuff real clients real lawyer stuff that goes on for a few years and the rookie doesnt suspect a thing right its a great firm great bunch of guys plenty of money hey everythings wonderful then after five or six years when the money is really good when they own your mortgage when you have a wife and kids and everything is so secure they drop the bomb and tell the truth theres no way out its the mafia mitch those guys dont play games theyll kill one of your children or your wife they dont care youre making more money than you could possibly make anywhere else youre blackmailed because youve got a family that doesnt mean a damned thing to the mob so what do you do mitch you stay you cant leave if you stay you make a million and retire young with your family intact if you want to leave youll wind up with your picture on the wall in the firstfloor library theyre very persuasive mitch rubbed his temples and began shivering look mitch i know you must have a thousand questions okay so ill just keep talking and tell you what i know the five dead lawyers all wanted out after they learned the truth we never talked to the first three because frankly we knew nothing about until seven years ago theyve done an excellent job of staying quiet and leaving no trail the first three just wanted out probably so they got out in coffins hodge and kozinski were different they approached us and over the course of a year we had several meetings they dropped the bomb on kozinski after hed been there for seven years he told hodge they whispered between themselves for a year kozinski was about to make partner and wanted out before that happened so he and hodge made the fatal decision to get out they never suspected the first three were killed or at least they never mentioned it to us we sent wayne tarrance to memphis to bring them in tarrance is an organizedcrime specialist from new york he and the two were getting real close when that thing happened in the caymans these guys in memphis are very good mitch dont ever forget that theyve got the money and they hire the best so after hodge and kozinski were killed i made the decision to get if we can bust that firm we can indict every significant member of the morolto family there could be over five hundred indictments tax evasion laundering racketeering just whatever you want it could destroy the morolto family and that would be the single most devastating blow to organized crime in the past thirty years and mitch its all in the files at the quiet little bendini firm in memphis why memphis ah good question who would suspect a small firm in memphis tennessee theres no mob activity down there its a quiet lovely peaceful city by the river it couldve been durham or topeka or wichita falls but they chose memphis its big enough though to hide a fortyman firm perfect choice you mean every partner his words trailed off yes every partner knows and plays by the rules we suspect that most of the associates know but its hard to tell theres so much we dont know mitch i cant explain how operates and whos in on it but we strongly suspect a lot of criminal activity down there such as tax fraud they do all the tax work for the morolto bunch they file nice neat properlooking tax returns each year and report a fraction of the income they launder money like crazy they set up legitimate businesses with dirty money that bank in st louis big client what is it commercial guaranty right thats it mafiaowned firm does all its legal work morolto takes in an estimated three hundred million a year from gambling dope numbers everything all cash right most of it goes to those banks in the caymans how does it move from chicago to the islands any idea the plane we suspect that goldplated lear you flew up here on runs about once a week to georgetown mitch sat straight and watched tarrance who was out of hearing range and standing now on the footbridge so why dont you get your indictments and bust it all up we cant we will i assure you ive assigned five agents to the project in memphis and three here in washington ill get them mitch i promise you but we must have someone from the inside they are very smart they have plenty of money theyre extremely careful and they dont make mistakes i am convinced that we must have help from you or another member of we need copies of files copies of bank records copies of a million documents that can only come from within its impossible otherwise and i have been chosen and you have been chosen if you decline then you can go on your way and make plenty of money and in general be a successful lawyer but we will keep trying well wait for the next new associate and try to pick him off and if that doesnt work well move in on one of the older associates one with courage and morals and guts to do whats right well find our man one day mitch and when that happens well indict you along with all the rest and ship your rich and successful ass off to prison it will happen son believe me at that moment at that place and time mitch believed him mr voyles im cold could we walk around sure mitch they walked slowly to the sidewalk and headed in the direction of the vietnam memorial mitch glanced over his shoulder tarrance and the other agent were following at a distance another agent in dark brown sat suspiciously on a park bench up the sidewalk who was anthony bendini mitch asked he married a morolto in the old mans soninlaw they had an operation in philadelphia back then and he was stationed there then in the forties for some reason he was sent to memphis to set up shop he was a very good lawyer though from what we know a thousand questions flooded his brain and fought to be asked he tried to appear calm under control skeptical what about oliver lambert a prince of a guy the perfect senior partner who just happened to know all about hodge and kozinski and the plans to eliminate them the next time you see mr lambert around the office try to remember that he is a coldblooded murderer of course he has no choice if he didnt cooperate theyd find him floating somewhere theyre all like that mitch they started off just like you young bright ambitious then suddenly one day they were in over their heads with no place to go so they play along work hard do a helluva job putting up a good front and looking like a real respectable little law firm each year or so they recruit a bright young law student from a poor background no family money with a wife who wants babies and they throw money at him and sign him up mitch thought of the money the excessive salary from a small firm in memphis and the car and lowinterest mortgage he was headed for wall street and had been sidetracked by the money only the money what about nathan locke the director smiled locke is another story he grew up a poor kid in chicago and was running errands for old man morolto by the time he was ten hes been a hood all his life scratched his way through law school and the old man sent him south to work with anthony bendini in the whitecollarcrime division of the family he was always a favorite of the old man when did morolto die eleven years ago at the age of eightyeight he has two slimy sons mickey the mouth and joey the priest mickey lives in las vegas and has a limited role in the family business joey is the boss the sidewalk reached an intersection with another one in the distance to the left the washington monument reached upward in the bitter wind to the right the walkway led to the wall a handful of people were now staring at it searching for the names of sons and husbands and friends mitch headed for the wall they walked slowly mitch spoke softly i dont understand how can do so much illegal work and keep it quiet that place is full of secretaries and clerks and paralegals good point and one i cannot fully answer we think it operates as two firms one is legitimate with the new associates most of the secretaries and support people then the senior associates and partners do the dirty work hodge and kozinski were about to give us plenty of information but they never made it hodge told tarrance once that there was a group of paralegals in the basement he knew little about they worked directly for locke and milligan and mcknight and a few other partners and no one was really sure what they did secretaries know everything and we think that some of them are probably in on it if so im sure theyre well paid and too scared to talk think about it mitch if you work there making great money with great benefits and you know that if you ask too many questions or start talking you wind up in the river what do you do you keep your mouth shut and take the money they stopped at the beginning of the wall at a point where the black granite began at ground level and started its run of feet until it angled into the second row of identical panels sixty feet away an elderly couple stared at the wall and cried softly they huddled together for warmth and strength the mother bent down and laid a framed blackandwhite photo at the base of the wall the father laid a shoebox full of high school memorabilia next to the photo football programs class pictures love letters key rings and a gold chain they cried louder mitch turned his back to the wall and looked at the washington monument the director watched his eyes so what am i supposed to do mitch asked first of all keep your mouth shut if you start asking questions your life could be in danger your wifes also dont have any kids in the near future theyre easy targets its best to play dumb as if everything is wonderful and you still plan to be the worlds greatest lawyer second you must make a decision not now but soon you must decide if you will cooperate or not if you choose to help us we will of course make it worth your while if you choose not to then we will continue to watch until we decide to approach another associate as i said one of these days well find someone with guts and nail those bastards and the morolto crime family as we know it will cease to exist well protect you mitch and youll never have to work again in your life what life ill live in fear forever if i live ive heard stories of witnesses the fbi has supposedly hidden ten years later the car explodes as they back out the driveway to go to work the body is scattered over three blocks the mob never forgets director you know that they never forget mitch but i promise you you and your wife will be protected the director looked at his watch youd better get back or theyll be suspicious tarrance will

you in return for what you give us we want the morolto family and you can deliver you name your price and this government working through the fbi will deliver within reason of course and thats coming from me mitch they walked slowly along the wall and stopped by the agent in the wheelchair voyles stuck out his hand look theres a taxi waiting where you came in number same driver youd better leave now we will not meet again but tarrance will contact you in a couple of weeks please think about what i said dont convince yourself is invincible and can operate forever because i will not allow it we will make a move in the near future i promise that i just hope youre on our side i dont understand what im supposed to do tarrance has the game plan a lot will depend upon you and what you learn once youre committed committed thats the word mitch once you commit theres no turning back they can be more ruthless than any organization on earth why did you pick me we had to pick someone no thats not true we picked you because you have the guts to walk away from it you have no family except a wife no ties no roots youve been hurt by every person you ever cared for except abby you raised yourself and in doing so became selfreliant and independent you dont need you can leave it youre hardened and calloused beyond your years and youre smart enough to pull it off mitch you wont get caught thats why we picked you good day mitch thanks for coming youd better get back voyles turned and walked quickly away tarrance waited at the end of the wall and gave mitch a quick salute as if to say so longfor now after making the obligatory stop in atlanta the delta dc landed in a cold rain at memphis international it parked at gate and the tightly packed crowd of business travelers quickly disembarked mitch carried only his briefcase and an esquire he saw abby waiting near the pay phones and moved quickly through the pack he threw the briefcase and magazine against the wall and bearhugged her the four days in washington seemed like a month they kissed again and again and whispered softly how about a date he asked ive got dinner on the table and wine in the cooler she said they held hands and walked through the mob pushing down the concourse in the general direction of the luggage pickup he spoke quietly well we need to talk and we cant do it at home she gripped his hand tighter oh yes in fact we need to have a long talk what happened itll take a while why am i suddenly nervous just keep cool keep smiling theyre watching she smiled and glanced to her right whos watching ill explain in just a moment mitch suddenly pulled her to his left they cut through the wave of human traffic and darted into a dark crowded lounge full of businessmen drinking and watching the television above the bar and waiting for their nights a small round table covered with empty beer mugs had just been vacated and they sat with their backs to the wall and a view of the bar and the concourse they sat close together within three feet of another table mitch stared at the door and analyzed every face that walked in how long are we going to be here she asked why she slid out of the fulllength fox and folded it on the chair across the table what exactly are you looking for just keep smiling for a moment pretend you really missed me here give me a kiss he pecked her on the lips and they smiled into each others eyes he kissed her cheek and returned to the door a waiter rushed to the table and cleaned it off they ordered wine she smiled at him how was your trip boring we were in class eight hours a day for four days after the first day i hardly left the hotel they crammed six months worth of tax revisions into thirtytwo hours did you get to sightsee he smiled and looked dreamily at her i missed you abby more than ive ever missed anyone in my life i love you i think youre gorgeous absolutely stunning i do not enjoy traveling alone and waking up in a strange hotel bed without you and i have something horrible to tell you she stopped smiling he slowly looked around the room they were three deep at the bar and yelling at the knickslakers game the lounge was suddenly louder ill tell you about it he said but theres a very good chance someone is in here right now watching us they cannot hear but they can observe just smile occasionally although it will be hard the wine arrived and mitch began his story he left nothing out she spoke only once he told her about anthony bendini and old man morolto and then nathan locke growing up in chicago and oliver lambert and the boys on the fifth floor abby nervously sipped her wine and tried valiantly to appear as the normal loving wife who missed her husband and was now enjoying immensely his recollection of the tax seminar she watched the people at the bar sipped a little and occasionally grinned at mitch as he told of the money laundering and the murdered lawyers her body ached with fear her breath was wildly irregular but she listened and pretended the waiter brought more wine as the crowd thinned an hour after he started mitch finished in a low whisper and voyles said tarrance would contact me in a couple of weeks to see if i will cooperate he said goodbye and walked away and this was tuesday she asked yes the first day what did you do the rest of the week i slept little ate little walked around with a dull headache most of the time i think i feel one coming im sorry abby i wanted to fly home immediately and tell you ive been in shock for three days im in shock now im not believing this mitch this is like a bad dream only much worse and this is only the beginning the fbi is dead serious why else would the director himself meet with me an insignificant rookie lawyer from memphis in fifteendegree weather on a concrete park bench hes assigned five agents in memphis and three in washington and he said theyll spend whatever it takes to get so if i keep my mouth shut ignore them and go about my business of being a good and faithful member of bendini lambert locke one day theyll show up with arrest warrants and haul everybody away and if i choose to cooperate you and i will leave memphis in the dead of the night after i hand to the feds and well go off and live in boise idaho as mr and mrs wilbur gates well have plenty of money but well have to work to avoid suspicion after my plastic surgery ill get a job driving a forklift in a warehouse and you can work parttime at a day care well have two maybe three kids and pray every night that people weve never met keep their mouths shut and forget about us well live every hour of every day in morbid fear of being discovered thats perfect mitch just perfect she was trying hard not to cry he smiled and glanced around the room we have a third option we can walk out that door buy two tickets to san diego sneak across the border and eat tortillas for the rest of our lives lets go but theyd probably follow us with my luck oliver lambert will be waiting in tijuana with a squad of goons it wont work just a thought what about lamar i dont know hes been here six or seven years so he probably knows averys a partner so hes very much a part of the conspiracy and kay who knows its very likely none of the wives know ive thought about it for four days abby and its a marvelous front looks exactly like its supposed to look they could fool anyone i mean how would you and i or any other prospective recruit even think of such an operation its perfect except now the feds know about it and now the feds expect you to do their dirty work why did they pick you mitch there are forty lawyers in because i knew nothing about it i was a sitting duck the fbi is not sure when the partners spring the surprise on the associates so they couldnt take a chance with anyone else i happened to be the new guy so they set the trap as soon as i passed the bar exam abby chewed her lip and held back tears she looked blankly at the door across the dark room and they listen to everything we say she said no just every phone call and conversation around the house and in the cars were free to meet here or in most restaurants and theres always the patio but i suggest we move farther away from the sliding door to be safe we need to sneak behind the storage shed and whisper softly are you trying to be funny i hope not this is no time for jokes im so scared angry confused mad as hell and not sure where to turn im afraid to speak in my own house i watch every word i utter on the phone even if its a wrong number every time the phone rings i jump and stare at it and now this you need another drink i need ten drinks mitch grabbed her wrist and squeezed firmly wait a minute i see a familiar face dont look around she held her breath where on the other side of the bar smile and look at me sitting on a barstool and staring intently at the tv was a welltanned blond man with a loud blueandwhite alpine sweater fresh from the slopes but mitch had seen the tan and the blond bangs and the blond mustache somewhere in washington mitch watched him carefully the blue light from the tube illuminated his face mitch hid in the dark the man lifted a bottle of beer hesitated then there shot a glance into the corner where the mcdeeres huddled closely together are you sure abby asked through clenched teeth yes he was in washington but i cant place him in fact i saw him twice is he one of them how am i supposed to know lets get out of here mitch laid a twenty on the table and they left the airport driving her peugeot he raced through the shortterm parking lot paid the attendant and sped away toward midtown after five minutes of silence she leaned across and whispered in his ear can we talk he shook his head well hows the weather been while i was away abby rolled her eyes and looked through the passenger window cold she said chance of light snow tonight it was below freezing the entire week in washington abby looked flabbergasted at this revelation any snow she asked with raised eyebrows and wide eyes as if enthralled with the conversation no just raw cold what a coincidence cold here and cold there mitch chuckled to himself they rode silently on the interstate loop so whos gonna win the super bowl he asked oilers think so huh im for the redskins thats all they talked about in washington my my must be a real fun city more silence abby placed the back of her hand over her mouth and concentrated on the taillights ahead at this moment of bewilderment she would take her chances in tijuana her husband number three in his class at harvard the one with wall street firms rolling out the red carpet the one who could have gone anywhere to any firm had signed up with the mafia with five dead lawyers notched on their belts they most surely wouldnt hesitate with number six her husband then the many conversations with kay quin swirled around her brain encourages babies permits wives to work but not forever hires no one with family money demands loyalty to has the lowest turnover rate in the country small wonder mitch watched her carefully twenty minutes after they left the airport the peugeot parked in the carport next to the bmw they held hands and walked to the end of the driveway this is crazy mitch yes but its real it will not go away what do we do i dont know babe but we gotta do it quick and we cant make mistakes im scared im terrified tarrance did not wait long one week after he waved goodbye to mitch at the wall he spotted him walking hurriedly in the cold in the direction of the federal building on north main eight blocks from the bendini building he followed him for two blocks then slid into a small coffee shop with a row of windows facing the street or the mall as it was called cars were prohibited on main street in memphis the asphalt had been covered with tile when the boulevard had ceased being a street and had been transformed into the midamerica mall an occasional useless and desolate tree rose from the tile and stretched its barren limbs between the buildings winos and urban nomads drifted aimlessly from one side of the mall to the other begging for money and food tarrance sat at a front window and watched in the distance as mitch disappeared into the federal building he ordered coffee and a chocolate doughnut he checked his watch it was am according to the docket mcdeere had a brief hearing in tax court at this moment it should be very brief the clerk of the court had informed tarrance he waited nothing is ever brief in court an hour later tarrance moved his face closer to the window and studied the scattered bodies walking quickly in the distance he drained his coffee cup for the third time laid two dollars on the table and stood hidden in the door as mitch approached on the other side of the mall tarrance moved swiftly toward him mitch saw him and slowed for a second hello mitch mind if i walk with you yes i mind tarrance its dangerous dont you think they walked briskly and did not look at each other look at that store over there tarrance said pointing to their right i need a pair of shoes they ducked into don pangs house of shoes tarrance walked to the rear of the narrow store and stopped between two rows of fake reeboks at for two pairs mitch followed him and picked up a pair of size tens don pang or some other korean eyed them suspiciously but said nothing they watched the front door through the racks the director called me yesterday tarrance said without moving his lips he asked about you said it was time you made a decision tell him im still thinking have you told the boys at the office no im still thinking thats good i dont think you should tell them he handed mitch a business card keep this there are two numbers on the back use either one from a pay phone youll get a recorder so just leave a message and tell me exactly when and where to meet you mitch put the card in his pocket suddenly tarrance ducked lower what is it mitch demanded i think weve been caught i just saw a goon walk past the store and look in listen to me mitch and listen carefully walk with me out of the store right now and the instant we get out the door yell at me to get lost and shove me away ill act like i want to fight and you run in the direction of your office youre gonna get me killed tarrance just do as i say as soon as you get to the office report this incident to the partners tell them i cornered you and you got away as soon as possible outside mitch shoved harder than necessary and yelled get the hell away from me and leave me alone he ran two blocks to union avenue then walked to the bendini building he stopped in the mens room on the first floor to catch his breath he stared at himself in the mirror and breathed deeply ten times avery was on the phone with two lights holding and blinking a secretary sat on the sofa ready with a steno pad for the onslaught of commands mitch looked at her and said would you step outside please i need to speak with avery in private she stood and mitch escorted her to the door he closed it avery watched him closely and hung up whats going on he asked mitch stood by the sofa the fbi just grabbed me as i was returning from tax court damn who was it same agent guy by the name of tarrance avery picked up the phone and kept talking where did it happen on the mall north of union i was just walking alone minding my own business is this the first contact since that other thing yes i didnt recognize the guy at first avery spoke into the receiver this is avery tolar i need to speak to oliver lambert immediately i dont care if hes on the phone interrupt him and now whats going on avery mitch asked hello oliver avery here sorry for the interruption mitch mcdeere is here in my office a few minutes ago he was walking back from the federal building when an fbi agent approached him on the mall what yes he just walked in my office and told me about it all right well be there in five minutes he hung up relax mitch weve been through this before i know avery but this does not make sense why would they bother with me im the newest man in its harassment mitch pure and simple nothing but harassment sit down mitch walked to the window and looked at the river in the distance avery was a cool liar it was now time for the theyre just picking on us routine relax mitch relax with eight fbi agents assigned to and the director mr denton voyles himself monitoring the case daily relax hed just been caught whispering to an fbi agent inside a dollar shoe store and now he was forced to act like he was an ignorant pawn being preyed upon by the evil forces of the federal government harassment then why was the goon following him on a routine walk to the courthouse answer that avery youre scared arent you avery asked as he put his arm around him and gazed out the window not really locke explained it all last time i just wish they would leave me alone its a serious matter mitch dont take it lightly lets walk over and see lambert mitch followed avery around the corner and down the hall a stranger in a black suit opened the door for them then closed it lambert nathan locke and royce mcknight stood near the small conference table again a tape recorder sat on the table mitch sat across from it black eyes sat at the head of the table and glared at mitch he spoke with a menacing frown there were no smiles in the room mitch has tarrance or anyone else from the fbi contacted you since the first meeting last august no are you certain mitch slapped the table dammit i said no why dont you put me under oath locke was startled they were all startled a heavy tense silence followed for thirty seconds mitch glared at black eyes who retreated ever so slightly with a casual movement of his head lambert ever the diplomat the mediator intervened look mitch we know this is frightening damn right it is i dont like it at all im minding my own business working my ass off ninety hours a week trying to be nothing but a good lawyer and member of this firm and for some unknown reason i keep getting these little visits from the fbi now sir i would like some answers locke pressed the red button on the recorder well talk about that in a minute first you tell us everything that happened its very simple mr locke i walked to the federal building at ten for an appearance before judge kofer on the malcolm delaney case i was there about an hour and i finished my business i left the federal building and i was walking in the direction of our officein a hurry i might add its about twenty degrees out there a block or two north of union this guy tarrance came out of nowhere grabbed my arm and pushed me into a small store i started to knock the hell out of him but after all he is an fbi agent and i didnt want to make a scene inside he tells me he wants to talk for a minute i pulled away from him and ran to the door he followed me tried to grab me and i shoved him away then i ran here went straight to averys office and here we are thats all that was said play by play everything what did he want to talk about i didnt give him a chance mr locke i have no plans to talk to any fbi agent unless he has a subpoena are you sure its the same agent i think so i didnt recognize him at first i havent seen him since last august once inside the store he pulled his badge and gave me his name again at that point i ran locke pressed another button and sat back in the chair lambert sat behind him and smiled ever so warmly listen mitch we explained this last time these guys are getting bolder and bolder just last month they approached jack aldrich while he was eating lunch in a little grill on second street were not sure what theyre up to but tarrance is out of his mind its nothing but harassment mitch watched his lips but heard little as lambert spoke he thought of kozinski and hodge and their pretty widows and children at the funerals black eyes cleared his throat its a serious matter mitch but we have nothing to hide they could better spend their time investigating our clients if they suspect wrongdoing were lawyers we may represent people who flirt with the law but we have done nothing wrong this is very baffling to us mitch smiled and opened his hands what do you want me to do he asked sincerely theres nothing you can do mitch said lambert just stay away from this guy and run if you see him if he so much as looks at you report it immediately thats what he did avery said defensively mitch looked as pitiful as possible you can go mitch lambert said and keep us posted he left the office by himself devasher paced behind his desk and ignored the partners hes lying i tell you hes lying the sonofabitch is lying i know hes lying what did your man see asked locke my man saw something different slightly different but very different he says mcdeere and tarrance walked sort of nonchalantly into the shoe store no physical intimidation by tarrance none at all tarrance walks up they talk and both sort of duck into the store my man says they disappear into the back of the store and theyre back there for three maybe four minutes then another one of our guys walks by the store looks in and sees nothing evidently they saw our man because within seconds they come flying out of the store with mcdeere shoving and yelling something aint right i tell you did tarrance grab his arm and force him into the store nathan locke asked slowly precisely hell no and thats the problem mcdeere went voluntarily and when he said the guy grabbed his arm hes lying my man says he thinks they wouldve stayed in there for a while if they hadnt seen us but youre not sure of that nathan locke said i wasnt sure dammit they didnt invite me into the store devasher kept pacing while the lawyers stared at the floor he unwrapped a roitan and crammed it into his fat mouth finally oliver lambert spoke look devasher its very possible mcdeere is telling the truth and your man got the wrong signals its very possible i think mcdeere is entitled to the benefit of the doubt devasher grunted and ignored this do you know of any contact since last august asked royce mcknight we dont know of any but that doesnt mean they aint talked does it now we didnt know about those other two until it was almost too late its impossible to watch every move they make impossible he walked back and forth by his credenza obviously deep in thought i gotta talk to him he finally said who mcdeere its time he and i had a little talk about what lambert asked nervously you let me handle it okay just stay out of my way i think its a bit premature locke said and i dont give a damn what you think if you clowns were in charge of security youd all be in prison mitch sat in his office with the door closed and stared at the walls a migraine was forming at the base of his skull and he felt sick there was a knock at the door come in he said softly avery peeked inside then walked to the desk how about lunch no thanks im not hungry the partner slid his hands into his trouser pockets and smiled warmly look mitch i know youre worried lets take a break ive got to run downtown for a meeting why dont you meet me at the manhattan club at one well have a long lunch and talk things over ive reserved the limo for you itll be waiting outside at a quarter till mitch managed a weak smile as if he was touched by this sure avery why not good ill see you at one at a quarter till mitch opened the front door and walked to the limo the driver opened the door and mitch fell in company was waiting a thick baldheaded man with a huge bulging hanging neck sat smugly in the corner of the rear seat he stuck out a hand names devasher mitch nice to meet you am i in the right limo mitch asked sure sure relax the driver pulled away from the curb what can i do for you mitch asked you can listen for a while we need to have a little talk the driver turned on riverside drive and headed for the hernando de soto bridge where are we going mitch asked for a little ride just relax son so im number six thought mitch this is it no wait a minute they were much more creative than this with their killing mitch can i call you mitch sure fine mitch im in charge of security for and why does need security just listen to me son and ill explain has an extensive security program thanks to old man bendini he was a nut about security and secrecy my job is to protect and quite frankly were very concerned about this fbi business so am i yes we believe the fbi is determined to infiltrate our firm in hopes of collecting information on certain clients which clients some high rollers with questionable tax shelters mitch nodded and looked at the river below they were now in arkansas with the memphis skyline fading behind them devasher recessed the conversation he sat like a frog with his hands folded across the gut mitch waited until it became apparent that lapses in conversation and awkward silence did not bother devasher several miles across the river the driver left the interstate and found a rough county road that circled and ran back to the east then he turned onto a gravel road that went for a mile through lowlying bean fields next to the river memphis was suddenly visible again across the water where are we going mitch asked with some alarm relax i want to show you something a gravesite thought mitch the limo stopped on a cliff that fell ten feet to a sandbar next to the bank the skyline stood impressively on the other side the top of the bendini building was visible lets take a walk devasher said where to mitch asked come on its okay devasher opened his door and walked to the rear bumper slowly mitch followed him as i was saying mitch we are very troubled by this contact with the fbi if you talk to them they will get bolder then who knows what the fools will try its imperative that you not speak to them ever again understand yes ive understood since the first visit in august suddenly devasher was in his face nose to nose he smiled wickedly i have something that will keep you honest he reached in his sport coat and pulled out a manila envelope take a look at these he said with a sneer and walked away mitch leaned on the limo and nervously opened the envelope there were four photographs black and white eight by ten very clear on the beach the girl oh my god who took these mitch yelled at him what difference does it make its you aint it there was no doubt about who it was he ripped the photographs into small pieces and threw them in devashers direction we got plenty at the office devasher said calmly bunch of them we dont want to use them but one more little conversation with mr tarrance or any other fibbie and well mail them to your wife how would you like that mitch imagine your pretty little wife going to the mailbox to get her redbook and catalogues and she sees this sftrange envelope addressed to her try to think of that mitch the next time you and tarrance decide to shop for plastic shoes think about us mitch because well be watching who knows about these mitch asked me and the photographer and now you nobody in the firm knows and i dont plan to tell them but if you screw up again i suspect theyll be passing them around at lunch i play hardball mitch he sat on the trunk and rubbed his temples devasher walked up next to him listen son youre a very bright young man and youre on your way to big bucks dont screw it up just work hard play the game buy new cars build bigger homes the works just like all the other guys dont try to be no hero i dont want to use the pictures okay okay for seventeen days and seventeen nights the troubled lives of mitch and abby mcdeere proceeded quietly without interference from wayne tarrance or any of his confederates the routines returned mitch worked eighteen hours a day every day of the week and never left the office for any reason except to drive home lunch was at the desk avery sent other associates to run errands or file motions or appear in court mitch seldom left his office the fifteenbyfifteen sanctuary where he was certain tarrance could not get him if possible he stayed out of the halls and mens rooms and coffee room they were watching he was sure he was not sure who they were but there was no doubt that a bunch of folks were vitally interested in his movements so he stayed at his desk with the door shut most of the time working diligently billing like crazy and trying to forget that the building had a fifth floor and on the fifth floor was a nasty little bastard named devasher who had a collection of photographs that could ruin him with each uneventful day mitch withdrew even more into his asylum and became even more hopeful that perhaps the last episode in the korean shoe store had scared tarrance or maybe gotten him fired maybe voyles would just simply forget the entire operation and mitch could continue along his happy way of getting rich and making partner and buying everything in sight but he knew better to abby the house was a prison though she could come and go at will she worked longer hours at school spent more time walking the malls and made at least one trip each day to the grocery store she watched everyone especially men in dark suits who looked at her she wore black sunglasses so they could not see her eyes she wore them when it was raining late at night after supper alone while she waited for him she stared at the walls and resisted the temptation to investigate the phones could be examined with a magnifying glass the wires and mikes could not be invisible she told herself more than once she thought of finding a book on such devices so she could identify them but mitch said no they were in the house he assured her and any attempt to find them could be disastrous so she moved silently around her own house feeling violated and knowing it could not last much longer they both knew the importance of appearing normal of sounding normal they tried to engage in normal talk about how the day went about the office and her students about the weather about this and that but the conversations were flat often forced and strained when mitch was in law school the lovemaking had been frequent and rowdy now it was practically nonexistent someone was listening midnight walks around the block became a habit after a quick sandwich each night they would deliver the rehearsed lines about needing exercise and head for the street they held hands and walked in the cold talking about and the fbi and which way to turn always the same conclusion there was no way out none seventeen days and seventeen nights the eighteenth day brought a new twist mitch was exhausted by pm and decided to go home he had worked nonstop for fifteen and a half hours at two hundred per as usual he walked the halls of the second floor then took the stairs to the third floor he casually checked each office to see who was still working no one on the third floor he followed the stairs to the fourth floor and walked the wide rectangular hallway as if in search of something all lights except one were off royce mcknight was working late mitch eased by his office without being seen averys door was closed and mitch grabbed the doorknob it was locked he walked to the library down the hall looking for a book he did not need after two weeks of the casual latenight inspections he had found no closedcircuit cameras above the halls or offices they just listen he decided they do not see he said goodbye to dutch hendrix at the front gate and drove home abby was not expecting him at such an early hour he quietly unlocked the door from the carport and eased into the kitchen he flipped on a light switch she was in the bedroom between the kitchen and the den was a small foyer with a rolltop desk where abby left each days mail he laid his briefcase softly on the desk then saw it a large brown envelope addressed with a black felt marker to abby mcdeere no return address scrawled in heavy black letters were the words photographsdo not bend his heart stopped first then his breathing he grabbed the envelope it had been opened a heavy layer of sweat broke across his forehead his mouth was dry and he could not swallow his heart returned with the fury of a jackhammer the breathing was heavy and painful he was nauseous slowly he backed away from the desk holding the envelope shes in the bed he thought hurt sick devastated and mad as hell he wiped his forehead and tried to collect himself face it like a man he said she was in the bed reading a book with the television on the dog was in the backyard mitch opened the bedroom door and abby bolted upright in horror she almost screamed at the intruder until she recognized him you scared me mitch her eyes glowed with fear then fun they had not been crying they looked fine normal no pain no anger he could not speak why are you home she demanded sitting up in bed smiling now smiling i live here he said weakly why didnt you call do i have to call before i can come home his breathing was now almost normal she was fine it would be nice come here and kiss me he leaned across the bed and kissed her he handed her the envelope whats this he asked nonchalantly you tell me its addressed to me but there was nothing inside not a thing she closed her book and laid it on the night table not a thing he smiled at her and kissed her again are you expecting photographs from anyone he asked in complete ignorance not that i know of must be a mistake he could almost hear devasher laughing at this very moment on the fifth floor the fat bastard was standing up there somewhere in some dark room full of wires and machines with a headset stretched around his massive bowling ball of a head laughing uncontrollably thats strange mitch said abby pulled on a pair of jeans and pointed to the backyard mitch nodded the signal was simple just a quick point or a nod of the head in the direction of the patio mitch laid the envelope on the rolltop desk and for a second touched the scrawled markings on it probably devashers handwriting he could almost hear him laughing he could see his fat face and nasty smile the photographs had probably been passed around during lunch in the partners dining room he could see lambert and mcknight and even avery gawking admiringly over coffee and dessert theyd better enjoy the pictures dammit theyd better enjoy the remaining few months of their bright and rich and happy legal careers abby walked by and he grabbed her hand whats for dinner he asked for the benefit of those listening why dont we go out we should celebrate since youre home at a decent hour they walked through the den good idea said mitch they eased through the rear door across the patio and into the darkness what is it mitch asked you got a letter today from doris she said shes in nashville but will return to memphis on the twentyseventh of february she says she needs to see you its important it was a very short letter the twentyseventh that was yesterday i know i presume shes already in town i wonder what she wants yeah and i wonder where she is she said her husband had an engagement here in town good shell find us mitch said nathan locke closed his office door and pointed devasher in the direction of the small conference table near the window the two men hated each other and made no attempt to be cordial but business was business and they took orders from the same man lazarov wanted me to talk to you alone devasher said ive spent the past two days with him in vegas and hes very anxious theyre all anxious locke and he trusts you more than anyone else around here he likes you more than he likes me thats understandable locke said with no smile the ripples of black around his eyes narrowed and focused intently on devasher anyway there are a few things he wants us to discuss im listening mcdeeres lying you know how lazarovs always bragged about having a mole inside the fbi well ive never believed him and still dont for the most part but according to lazarov his little source is telling him that there was some kind of secret meeting involving mcdeere and some fbi heavyweights when your boy was in washington back in january we were there and our men saw nothing but its impossible to track anyone twentyfour hours a day without getting caught its possible he couldve slipped away for a little while without our knowledge do you believe it its not important whether i believe it lazarov believes it and thats all that matters at any rate he told me to make preliminary plans to uh take care of him damn devasher we cant keep eliminating people just preliminary plans nothing serious i told lazarov i thought it was much too early and that it would be a mistake but they are very worried locke this cant continue devasher i mean damn we have reputations to consider we have a higher casualty rate than oil rigs people will start talking were gonna reach a point where no law student in his right mind would take a job here i dont think you need to worry about that lazarov has put a freeze on hiring he told me to tell you that he also wants to know how many associates are still in the dark five i think lets see lynch sorrell buntin myers and mcdeere forget mcdeere lazarov is convinced he knows much more than we think are you certain the other four know nothing locke thought for a moment and mumbled under his breath well we havent told them you guys are listening and watching what do you hear nothing from those four they sound ignorant and act as if they suspect nothing can you fire them fire them theyre lawyers devasher you dont fire lawyers theyre loyal members of is changing locke lazarov wants to fire the ones who dont know and stop hiring new ones its obvious the fibbies have changed their strategy and its time for us to change as well lazarov wants to circle the wagons and plug the leaks we cant sit back and wait for them to pick off our boys fire them locke repeated in disbelief this firm has never fired a lawyer very touching locke weve disposed of five but never fired one thats real good youve got a month to do it so start thinking of a reason i suggest you fire all four at one time tell them you lost a big account and youre cutting back we have clients not accounts okay fine your biggest client is telling you to fire lynch sorrell buntin and myers now start making plans how do we fire those four without firing mcdeere youll think of something nat you got a month get rid of them and dont hire any new boys lazarov wants a tight little unit where everyone can be trusted hes scared nat scared and mad i dont have to tell you what could happen if one of your boys spilled his guts no you dont have to tell me what does he plan to do with mcdeere right now nothing but the same were listening twentyfour hours a day and the kid has never mentioned a word to his wife or anyone else not a word hes been corralled twice by tarrance and he reported both incidents to you i still think the second meeting was somewhat suspicious so were being very careful lazarov on the other hand insists there was a meeting in washington hes trying to confirm he said his sources knew little but they were digging if in fact mcdeere met with the fibbies up there and failed to report it then im sure lazarov will instruct me to move quickly thats why he wants preliminary plans to take mcdeere out how do you plan to do it its too early i havent given it much thought you know he and his wife are going to the caymans in two weeks for a vacation theyll stay in one of our condos the usual we wouldnt do it there again too suspicious lazarov instructed me to get her pregnant mcdeeres wife yep he wants them to have a baby a little leverage shes on the pill so we gotta break in take her little box match up the pills and replace them with placebos at this the great black eyes saddened just a touch and looked through the window what the hells going on devasher he asked softly this place is about to change nat it appears as though the feds are extremely interested and they keep pecking away one day who knows one of your boys may take the bait and youll all leave town in the middle of the night i dont believe that devasher a lawyer here would be a fool to risk his life and his family for a few promises from the feds i just dont believe it will happen these boys are too smart and theyre making too much money i hope youre right the leasing agent leaned against the rear of the elevator and admired the black leather miniskirt from behind he followed it down almost to the knees where it ended and the seams in the black silk stockings began and snaked downward to black heels kinky heels with little red bows across the toes he slowly worked his way back up the seams past the leather pausing to admire the roundness of her rear then upward to the red cashmere sweater which from his vantage point revealed little but from the other side was quite impressive as he had noticed in the lobby the hair landed just below the shoulder blades and contrasted nicely with the red he knew it was bleached but add the bleach to the leather mini and the seams and the kinky heels and the tight sweater hugging those things around the front add all that together and he knew this was a woman he could have he would like to have her in the building she just wanted a small office the rent was negotiable the elevator stopped the door opened and he followed her into the narrow hall this wayhe pointed flipping on a light switch in the corner he moved in front of her and stuck a key in a badly aged wooden door its just two rooms he said nipping on another switch about two hundred square feet she walked straight to the window the view is okay tammy said staring into the distance yes a nice view the carpet is new painted last fall rest rooms down the hall its a nice place the entire buildings been renovated within the past eight years he stared at the black seams as he spoke its not bad tammy said not in response to anything he had mentioned she continued to stare out the window whats the name of this place the cotton exchange building one of the oldest in memphis its really a prestigious address how prestigious is the rent he cleared his throat and held a file before him he did not look at the file he was gaping at the heels now well its such a small office what did you say you needed it for secretarial work freelance secretarial she moved to the other window ignoring him he followed every move i see how long will you need it six months with an option for a year okay for six months we can lease it for threefifty a month she did not flinch or look from the window she slid her right foot out of the shoe and rubbed the left calf with it the seam continued he observed under the heel and along the bottom of the foot the toenails were red she cocked her rear to the left and leaned on the windowsill his file was shaking ill pay twofifty a month she said with authority he cleared his throat there was no sense being greedy the tiny rooms were dead space useless to anyone else and had not been occupied in years the building could use a freelance secretary hell he might even need a freelance secretary three hundred but no less this building is in demand ninety percent occupied right now three hundred a month and thats too low were barely covering costs at that she turned suddenly and there they were staring at him the cashmere was stretched tightly around them the ad said there were furnished offices available she said we can furnish this one he said eager to cooperate what do you need she looked around the office i would like a secretarial desk with credenza in here several file cabinets a couple of chairs for clients nothing fancy the other room does not have to be furnished ill put a copier in there no problem he said with a smile and ill pay three hundred a month furnished good he said as he opened a file and withdrew a blank lease he laid it on a folding table and began writing your name doris greenwood her mother was doris greenwood and she had been tammy inez greenwood before she ran up on buster hemphill who later became legally elvis aaron hemphill and life had pretty much been downhill since her mother lived in effingham illinois okay doris he said with an effort at suaveness as if they were now on a firstname basis and growing closer by the moment home address why do you need that she asked with irritation well uh we just need that information its none of your business okay okay no problem he dramatically scratched out that portion of the lease he hovered above it lets see well run it from today march for six months until september is that okay she nodded and lit a cigarette he read the next paragraph okay we require a threehundreddollar deposit and the first months rent in advance from a pocket in the tight black leather skirt she produced a roll of cash she counted six onehundreddollar bills and laid them on the table receipt please she demanded certainly he continued writing what floor are we on she asked returning to the windows ninth theres a ten percent late charge past the fifteenth of the month we have the right to enter at any reasonable time to inspect premises cannot be used for any illegal purpose you pay all utilities and insurance on contents you get one parking space in the lot across the street and here are two keys any questions yeah what if i work odd hours i mean real late at night no big deal you can come and go as you please after dark the security guard at the front street door will let you pass tammy stuck the cigarette between her sticky lips and walked to the table she glanced at the lease hesitated then signed the name of doris greenwood they locked up and he followed her carefully down the hall to the elevator by noon the next day the odd assortment of furniture had been delivered and doris greenwood of greenwood services arranged the rented typewriter and the rented phone next to each other on the secretarial desk sitting and facing the typewriter she could look slightly to her left out the window and watch the traffic on front street she filled the desk drawers with typing paper notepads pencils odds and ends she placed magazines on the filing cabinets and the small table between the two chairs where her clients would sit there was a knock at the door who is it she asked its your copier a voice answered she unlocked the door and opened it a short hyperactive little man named gordy rushed in looked around the room and said rudely okay where do you want it in there tammy said pointing to the eightbyten empty room with no door on the hinges two young men in blue uniforms pushed and pulled the cart holding the copier gordy laid the paperwork on her desk its a mighty big copier for this place were talking ninety copies a minute with a collator and automatic feed its a big machine where do i sign she asked ignoring the small talk he pointed with the pen six months at twoforty a month that includes service and maintenance and five hundred sheets of paper for the first two months you want legal or lettersized legal first payment due on the tenth and same thereafter for five months operators manual is on the rack call me if you have any questions the two servicemen gawked at the tight stonewashed jeans and the red heels and slowly left the office gordy ripped off the yellow copy and handed it to her thanks for the business he said she locked the door behind them she walked to the window next to her desk and looked north along front two blocks up on the opposite side floors four and five of the bendini building were visible he kept to himself with his nose buried deep in the books and the piles of paperwork he was too busy for any of them except lamar he was very much aware that his withdrawal was not going unnoticed so he worked harder perhaps they would not be suspicious if he billed twenty hours a day perhaps money could insulate him nina left a box of cold pizza when she checked out after lunch he ate it while he cleared his desk he called abby said he was going to see ray and that he would return to memphis late sunday he eased through the side door and into the parking lot for three and a half hours he raced along interstate with his eyes on the rearview mirror nothing he never saw them they probably just call ahead he thought and wait for him somewhere up there in nashville he made a sudden exit into downtown using a map he had scribbled he darted in and out of traffic making uturns wherever possible and in general driving like a nut to the south of town he turned quickly into a large apartment complex and cruised between the buildings it was nice enough the parking lots were clean and the faces were white all of them he parked next to the office and locked the bmw the pay phone by the covered pool worked he called a cab and gave an address two blocks away he ran between the buildings down a side street and arrived precisely with the cab greyhound bus station he said to the driver and in a hurry ive got ten minutes relax pal its only six blocks away mitch ducked low in the rear seat and watched the traffic the driver moved with a slow confidence and seven minutes later stopped in front of the station mitch threw two fives over the seat and darted into the terminal he bought a oneway ticket on the fourthirty bus to atlanta it was four thirtyone according to the clock on the wall the clerk pointed through the swinging doors bus no she said leaving in a moment the driver slammed the baggage door took his ticket and followed mitch onto the bus the first three rows were filled with elderly blacks a dozen more passengers were scattered toward the rear mitch walked slowly down the aisle gazing at each face and seeing no one he took a window seat on the fourth row from the rear he slipped on a pair of sunglasses and glanced behind him no one dammit was it the wrong bus he stared out the dark windows as the bus moved quickly into traffic they would stop in knoxville maybe his contact would be there when they were on the interstate and the driver reached his cruising speed a man in blue jeans and madras shirt suddenly appeared and slid into the seat next to mitch it was tarrance mitch breathed easier where have you been he asked in the rest room did you lose them tarrance spoke in a low voice while surveying the backs of the heads of the passengers no one was listening no one could hear i never see them tarrance so i cannot say if i lost them but i think they would have to be supermen to keep my trail this time did you see our man in the terminal yes by the pay phone with the red falcons cap black dude thats him he wouldve signaled if they were following he gave me the goahead tarrance wore silver reflective sunglasses under a green michigan state baseball cap mitch could smell the fresh juicy fruit sort of out of uniform arent you mitch said with no smile did voyles give you permission to dress like that i forgot to ask him ill mention it in the morning sunday morning mitch asked of course hell wanna know all about our little bus ride i briefed him for an hour before i left town well first things first what about my car well pick it up in a few minutes and babysit it for you itll be in knoxville when you need it dont worry you dont think theyll find us no way no one followed you out of memphis and we detected nothing in nashville youre clean as a whistle pardon my concern but after that fiasco in the shoe store i know you boys are not above stupidity it was a mistake all right we a big mistake one that could get me on the hit list you covered it well it wont happen again promise me tarrance promise me no one will ever again approach me in public tarrance looked down the aisle and nodded no tarrance i need to hear it from your mouth promise me okay okay it wont happen again i promise thanks now maybe i can eat at a restaurant without fear of being grabbed youve made your point an old black man with a cane inched toward them smiled and walked past the restroom door slammed the greyhound rode the left lane and blew past the lawful drivers tarrance flipped through a magazine mitch gazed into the countryside the man with the cane finished his business and wobbled to his seat on the front row so what brings you here tarrance asked flipping pages i dont like airplanes i always take the bus i see where would you like to start voyles said you had a game plan i do i just need a quarterback good ones are very expensive weve got the money itll cost a helluva lot more than you think the way i figure it ill be throwing away a fortyyear legal career at say an average of half a million a year thats twenty million bucks i know but we can negotiate thats good to hear youre assuming that youll work or practice as you say for forty years thats a very precarious assumption just for fun lets assume that within five years we bust up and indict you along with all of your buddies and that we obtain convictions and you go off to prison for a few years they wont keep you long because youre a whitecollar type and of course youve heard how nice the federal pens are but at any rate youll lose your license your house your little bmw probably your wife when you get out you can open up a private investigation service like your old friend lomax its easy work unless you sniff the wrong underwear like i said its negotiable all right lets negotiate how much do you want for what tarrance closed the magazine placed it under his seat and opened a thick paperback he pretended to read mitch spoke from the corner of his mouth with his eyes on the median thats a very good question tarrance said softly just above the distant grind of the diesel engine what do we want from you good question first you have to give up your career as a lawyer youll have to divulge secrets and records that belong to your clients that of course is enough to get you disbarred but that wont seem important you and i must agree that you will hand us on a silver platter once we agree if we agree the rest will fall in place second and most important you will give us enough documentation to indict every member of and most of the top morolto people the records are in the little building there on front street how do you know this tarrance smiled because we spend billions of dollars fighting organized crime because weve tracked the moroltos for twenty years because we have sources within the family because hodge and kozinski were talking when they were murdered dont sell us short mitch and you think i can get the information out yes counselor you can build a case from the inside that will collapse and break up one of the largest crime families in the country you gotta lay out for us whose office is where names of all secretaries clerks paralegals who works on what files whos got which clients the chain of command whos on the fifth floor whats up there where are the records kept is there a central storage area how much is computerized how much is on microfilm and most important you gotta bring the stuff out and hand it to us once we have probable cause we can go in with a small army and get everything but thats an awfully big step we gotta have a very tight and solid case before we go crashing in with search warrants is that all you want no youll have to testify against all of your buddies at their trials could take years mitch breathed deeply and closed his eyes the bus slowed behind a caravan of mobile homes split in two dusk was approaching and one at a time the cars in the westbound lane brightened with headlights testifying at trial this he had not thought of with millions to spend for the best criminal lawyers the trials could drag on forever tarrance actually began reading the paperback a louis lamour he adjusted the reading light above them as if he was indeed a real passenger on a real journey after thirty miles of no talk no negotiation mitch removed his sunglasses and looked at tarrance what happens to me youll have a lot of money for what thats worth if you have any sense of morality you can face yourself each day you can live anywhere in the country with a new identity of course well find you a job fix your nose do anything you want really mitch tried to keep his eyes on the road but it was impossible he glared at tarrance morality dont ever mention that word to me again tarrance im an innocent victim and you know it tarrance grunted with a smartass grin they rode in silence for a few miles what about my wife yeah you can keep her very funny sorry shell get everything she wants how much does she know everything he thought of the girl on the beach well almost everything well get her a fat government job with the social security administration anywhere you want it wont be that bad mitch itll be wonderful until an unknown point in the future when one of your people opens his or her mouth and lets something slip to the wrong person and youll read about me or my wife in the paper the mob never forgets tarrance theyre worse than elephants and they keep secrets better than your side you guys have lost people so dont deny it i wont deny it and ill admit to you that they can be ingenious when they decide to kill thanks so where do i go its up to you right now we have about two thousand witnesses living all over the country under new names with new homes and new jobs the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor so i play the odds yes you either take the money and run or you play bigshot lawyer and bet that we never infiltrate thats a hell of a choice tarrance it is im glad its yours the female companion of the ancient black man with the cane rose feebly from her seat and began shuffling toward them she grabbed each aisle seat as she progressed tarrance leaned toward mitch as she passed he would not dare speak with this stranger in the vicinity she was at least ninety half crippled probably illiterate and could care less if tarrance received his next breath of air but tarrance was instantly mute fifteen minutes later the restroom door opened and released the sounds of the toilet gurgling downward into the pit of the greyhound she shuffled to the front and tookher seat who is jack aldrich mitch asked he suspected a coverup with this one and he carefully watched the reaction from the corner of his eye tarrance looked up from the book and stared at the seat in front of him names familiar i cant place him mitch returned his gaze to the window tarrance knew he had flinched and his eyes had narrowed too quickly before he answered mitch watched the westbound traffic so who is he tarrance finally asked you dont know him if i knew him i wouldnt ask who he was hes a member of our firm you shouldve known that tarrance the citys full of lawyers i guess you know them all i know the ones at bendini lambert locke the quiet little firm you guys have been studying for seven years aldrich is a sixyear man who allegedly was approached by the fbi a couple of months ago true or false absolutely false who told you this it doesnt matter just a rumor around the office its a lie weve talked to no one but you since august you have my word and we have no plans to talk to anyone else unless of course you decline and we must find another prospect youve never talked to aldrich thats what i said mitch nodded and picked up a magazine they rode in silence for thirty minutes tarrance gave up on his novel and finally said look mitch well be in knoxville in an hour or so we need to strike a deal if were going to director voyles will have a thousand questions in the morning how much money half a million bucks any lawyer worth his salt knew the first offer had to be rejected always he had seen averys mouth drop open in shock and his head shake wildly in absolute disgust and disbelief with first offers regardless of how reasonable there would be counteroffers and countercounteroffers and further negotiations but always the first offer was rejected so by shaking his head and smiling at the window as if this was what he expected mitch said no to half a million did i say something funny tarrance the nonlawyer the nonnegotiator asked thats ridiculous tarrance you cant expect me to walk away from a gold mine for half a million bucks after taxes i net three hundred thousand at best and if we close the gold mine and send all you guccifooted hotshots to jail if if if if you knew so much why havent you done something voyles said you boys have been watching and waiting for seven years thats real good tarrance do you always move so fast do you wanna take that chance mcdeere lets say it takes us another five years okay after five years we bust the joint and send your ass to jail at that point it wont make any difference how long it took us will it the result will be the same mitch im sorry i thought we were negotiating not threatening ive made you an offer your offer is too low you expect me to make a case that will hand you hundreds of indictments against a group of the sleaziest criminals in america a case that could easily cost me my life and you offer a pittance three million at least tarrance did not flinch or frown he received the counteroffer with a good straight poker face and mitch the negotiator knew it was not out of the ballpark thats a lot of money tarrance said almost to himself i dont think weve ever paid that much but you can cant you i doubt it ill have to talk to the director the director i thought you had complete authority on this case are we gonna run back and forth to the director until we have a deal what else do you want ive got a few things in mind but we wont discuss them until the money gets right the old man with the cane apparently had weak kidneys he stood again and began the awkward wobble to the rear of the bus tarrance again started his book mitch flipped through an old copy of field stream the greyhound left the interstate in knoxville two minutes before eight tarrance leaned closer and whispered take the front door out of the terminal youll see a young man wearing an orange university of tennessee sweat suit standing beside a white bronco hell recognize you and call you jeffrey shake hands like lost friends and get in the bronco hell take you to your car where is it mitch whispered behind a dorm on campus have they checked it for bugs i think so ask the man in the bronco if they were tracking you when you left memphis they might be suspicious by now you should drive to cookeville its about a hundred miles this side of nashville theres a holiday inn there spend the night and go see your brother tomorrow well be watching also and if things look fishy ill find you monday morning whens the next bus ride your wifes birthday is tuesday make reservations for eight at grisantis that italian place on airways at precisely nine go to the cigarette machine in the bar insert six quarters and buy a pack of anything in the tray where the cigarettes are released you will find a cassette tape buy yourself one of those small tape players that joggers wear with earphones and listen to the tape in your car not at home and sure as hell not at the office use the earphones let your wife listen to it ill be on the cassette and ill give you our top dollar ill also explain a few things after youve listened to it a few times dispose of it this is rather elaborate isnt it yes but we dont need to speak to each other for a couple of weeks theyre watching and listening mitch and theyre very good dont forget that dont worry what was your football jersey number in high school fourteen and college fourteen okay your code number is thursday night from a touchtone pay phone call youll get a voice that will lead you through a little routine involving your code number once youre cleared you will hear my recorded voice and i will ask you a series of questions well go from there why cant i just practice law the bus pulled into the terminal and stopped im going on to atlanta tarrance said i will not see you for a couple of weeks if theres an emergency call one of the two numbers i gave you before mitch stood in the aisle and looked down at the agent three million tarrance not a penny less if you guys can spend billions fighting organized crime surely you can find three million for me and tarrance i have a third option i can disappear in the middle of the night vanish into the air if that happens you and the moroltos can fight each other till hell freezes over and ill be playing dominoes in the caribbean sure mitch you might play a game or two but theyd find you within a week and we wouldnt be there to protect you so long buddy mitch jumped from the bus and darted through the terminal at eightthirty am on tuesday nina formed neat piles out of the rubble and debris on his desk she enjoyed this earlymorning ritual of straightening the desk and planning his day the appointment book lay unobstructed on a corner of his desk she read from it you have a very busy day today mr mcdeere mitch flipped through a file and tried to ignore her every day is busy you have a meeting at ten oclock in mr mahans office on the delta shipping appeal i cant wait mitch mumbled you have a meeting at eleventhirty in mr tolars office on the greenbriar dissolution and his secretary informed me it would last at least two hours why two hours im not paid to ask those questions mr mcdeere if i do i might get fired at threethirty victor milligan wants to meet with you about what again mr mcdeere im not supposed to ask questions and youre due in frank mulhollands office downtown in fifteen minutes yes i know where is it the cotton exchange building four or five blocks up front at union youve walked by it a hundred times fine what else shall i bring you something back from lunch no ill grab a sandwich downtown wonderful do you have everything for mulholland he pointed to the heavy black briefcase and said nothing she left and seconds later mitch walked down the hall down the stairs and out the front door he paused for a second under a streetlight then turned and walked quickly toward downtown the black briefcase was in his right hand the burgundy eelskin attache was in his left the signal in front of a green building with boarded windows he stopped next to a fire hydrant he waited a second then crossed front street another signal on the ninth floor of the cotton exchange building tammy greenwood of greenwood services backed away from the window and put on her coat she locked the door behind her and pushed the elevator button she waited she was about to encounter a man who could easily get her killed mitch entered the lobby and went straight to the elevators he noticed no one in particular a half dozen businessmen were in the process of talking as they came and went a woman was whispering into a pay phone a security guard loitered near the union avenue entrance he pushed the elevator button and waited alone as the door opened a young cleancut merrill lynch type in a black suit and sparkling wing tips stepped into the elevator mitch had hoped for a solitary ride upward mulhollands office was on the seventh floor mitch pushed the seven button and ignored the kid in the black suit as the elevator moved both men dutifully stared at the blinking numbers above the door mitch eased to the rear of the small elevator and set the heavy briefcase on the floor next to his right foot the door opened on the fourth floor and tammy walked nervously in the kid glanced at her her attire was remarkably conservative a simple short knit dress with no plunging necklines no kinky shoes her hair was tinted to a soft shade of red he glanced again and pushed the close door button tammy brought aboard a large black briefcase identical to mitchs she ignored his eyes stood next to him quietly setting it next to his on the seventh floor mitch grabbed her briefcase and left the elevator on the eighth floor the cute young man in the black suit made his departure and on the ninth floor tammy picked up the heavy black briefcase full of files from bendini lambert locke and took it to her office she locked and bolted the door quickly removed her coat and went to the small room where the copier was waiting and running there were seven files each at least an inch thick she laid them neatly on the folding table next to the copier and took the one marked kokerhanks to east texas pipe she unhooked the aluminum clasp removed the contents from the file and carefully placed the stack of documents and letters and notes into the automatic feed she pushed the print button and watched as the machine made two perfect copies of everything thirty minutes later the seven files were returned to the briefcase the new files fourteen of them were locked away in a fireproof file cabinet hidden in a small closet which was also locked tammy placed the briefcase near the door and waited frank mulholland was a partner in a tenman firm that specialized in banking and securities his client was an old man who had founded and built a chain of doityourself hardware stores and at one point had been worth eighteen million before his son and a renegade board of directors took control and forced him into retirement the old man sued the company countersued everybody sued everybody and the suits and countersuits had been hopelessly deadlocked for eighteen months now that the lawyers were fat and happy it was time to talk settlement bendini lambert locke handled the tax advice for the son and the new board and two months earlier avery had introduced mitch to the hostilities the plan was to offer the old man a fivemilliondollar package of common stock convertible warrants and a few bonds mulholland was not impressed with the plan his client was not greedy he explained repeatedly and he knew he would never regain control of the company his company remember but five million was not enough any jury of any degree of intelligence would be sympathetic to the old man and a fool could see the lawsuit was worth at least well at least twenty million after an hour of sliding proposals and offers and counteroffers across mulhollands desk mitch had increased the package to eight million and the old mans lawyer said he might consider fifteen mitch politely repacked his attache case and mulholland politely escorted him to the door they promised to meet again in a week they shook hands like best friends the elevator stopped on the fifth floor and tammy walked casually inside it was empty except for mitch when the door closed he said any problems nope two copies are locked away how long did it take thirty minutes it stopped on the fourth floor and she picked up the empty briefcase noon tomorrow she asked yes he replied the door opened and she disappeared onto the fourth floor he rode alone to the lobby which was empty except for the same security guard mitchell mcdeere attorney and counselor at law hurried from the building with a heavy briefcase in each hand and walked importantly back to his office the celebration of abbys twentyfifth birthday was rather subdued through the dim candlelight in a dark corner of grisantis they whispered and tried to smile at each other it was difficult somewhere at that moment in the restaurant an invisible fbi agent was holding a cassette tape that he would insert into a cigarette machine in the lounge at precisely nine oclock and mitch was supposed to be there seconds later to retrieve it without being seen or caught by the bad guys whoever they were and whatever they looked like and the tape would reveal just how much cold hard cash the mcdeeres would receive in return for evidence and a subsequent life on the run they picked at their food tried to smile and carry on an extended conversation but mainly they fidgeted and glanced at their watches the dinner was brief by eight fortyfive they were finished with the plates mitch left in the direction of the rest room and he stared into the dark lounge as he walked by the cigarette machine was in the corner exactly where it should be they ordered coffee and at exactly nine mitch returned to the lounge to the machine where he nervously inserted six quarters and pulled the lever under marlboro lights in memory of eddie lomax he quickly reached into the tray took the cigarettes and fishing around in the darkness found the cassette tape the pay telephone next to the machine rang and he jumped he turned and surveyed the lounge it was empty except for two men at the bar watching the television behind and above the bartender drunk laughter exploded from a dark corner far away abby watched every step and move until he sat across from her she raised her eyebrows and i got it your basic black sony cassette tape mitch sipped coffee and smiled innocently while quickly surveying the crowded dining room no one was watching no one cared he handed the check and the american express card to the waiter were in a hurry he said rudely the waiter returned within seconds mitch scribbled his name the bmw was indeed wired heavily wired tarrances gang had very quietly and very thoroughly examined it with magnifying glasses while waiting for the greyhound four days earlier expertly wired with terribly expensive equipment capable of hearing and recording the slightest sniffle or cough but the bugs could only listen and record they could not track mitch thought that was awfully nice of them just to listen but not follow the movements of the bmw it left the parking lot of grisantis with no conversation between its occupants abby carefully opened a portable tape recorder and placed the cassette inside she handed mitch the earphones which he stuck onto his head she pushed the play button she watched him as he listened and drove aimlessly toward the interstate the voice belonged to tarrance hello mitch today is tuesday march sometime after nine pm happy birthday to your lovely wife this tape will run about ten minutes and i instruct you to listen to it carefully once or twice then dispose of it i had a facetoface meeting with director voyles last sunday and briefed him on everything by the way i enjoyed the bus ride director voyles is very pleased with the way things are going but he thinks weve talked long enough he wants to cut a deal and rather quickly he explained to me in no uncertain terms that we have never paid three million dollars and were not about to pay it to you he cussed a lot but to make a long story short director voyles said we could pay a million cash no more he said the money would be deposited in a swiss bank and no one not even the irs would ever know about it a million dollars taxfree thats our best deal and voyles said you can go to hell if you said no were gonna bust that little firm mitch with or without you mitch smiled grimly and stared at the traffic racing past them on the loop abby watched for a sign a signal a grunt or groan anything to indicate good news or bad she said nothing the voice continued well take care of you mitch youll have access to fbi protection anytime you think you need it well check on you periodically if you want and if you want to move on to another city after a few years well take care of it you can move every five years if you want and well pick up the tab and find jobs for you good jobs with the va or social security or postal service voyles said wed even find you a highpaying job with a private government contractor you name it mitch and its yours of course well provide new identities for you and your wife arid you can change every year if you desire no problem or if you got a better idea well listen you wanna live in europe or australia just say so youll get special treatment i know were promising a lot mitch but were dead serious and well put it in writing well pay a million in cash taxfree and set you up wherever you choose so thats the deal and in return you must hand us and the moroltos well talk about that later for now your time is up voyles is breathing down my neck and things must happen quickly call me at that number thursday night at nine from the pay phone next to the mens rest room in houstons on poplar so long mitch he sliced a finger across his throat and abby pushed the stop button then rewind he handed her the earphones and she began to listen intently it was an innocent walk in the park two lovebirds holding hands and strolling casually through the cool clear moonlight they stopped by a cannon and gazed at the majestic river inching ever so slowly toward new orleans the same cannon where the late eddie lomax once stood in a sleet storm and delivered one of his last investigative reports abby held the cassette in her hand and watched the river below she had listened to it twice and refused to leave it in the car where who knows who might snatch it after weeks of practicing silence and then speaking only outdoors words were becoming difficult you know abby mitch finally said as he tapped the wooden wheel of the cannon ive always wanted to work with the post office i had an uncle once who was a rural mail carrier that would be neat it was a gamble this attempt at humor but it worked she hesitated for three seconds then laughed slightly and he could tell she indeed thought it was funny yeah and i could mop floors in a va hospital you wouldnt have to mop floors you could change bedpans something meaningful something inconspicuous wed live in a neat little white frame house on maple street in omaha id be harvey and youd be thelma and wed need a short unassuming last name poe abby added thats great harvey and thelma poe the poe family wed have a million dollars in the bank but couldnt spend a dime because everyone on maple street would know it and then wed become different which is the last thing we want id get a nose job but your nose is perfect abbys nose is perfect but what about thelmas wed have to get it fixed dont you think yeah i suppose he was immediately tired of the humor and became quiet abby stepped in front of him and he draped his arms over her shoulders they watched a tug quietly push a hundred barges under the bridge an occasional cloud dimmed the moonlight and the cool winds from the west rose intermittently then dissipated do you believe tarrance abby asked in what way lets suppose you do nothing do you believe one day theyll eventually infiltrate im afraid not to believe so we take the money and run its easier for me to take the money and run abby i have nothing to leave behind for you its different youll never see your family again where would we go i do not know but i wouldnt want to stay in this country the feds cannot be trusted entirely ill feel safer in another country but i wont tell tarrance whats the next step we cut a deal then quickly go about the job of gathering enough information to sink the ship i have no idea what they want but i can find it for them when tarrance has enough we disappear we take our money get our nose jobs and disappear how much money more than a million theyre playing games with the money its all negotiable how much will we get two million cash taxfree not a dime less will they pay it yes but thats not the question the question is will we take it and run she was cold and he draped his coat over her shoulders he held her tightly its a rotten deal mitch she said but at least well be together the names harvey not mitch do you think well be safe harvey were not safe here i dont like it here im lonely and scared im tired of being a lawyer lets take the money and haul ass youve got a deal thelma she handed the cassette tape to him he glanced at it then threw it far below beyond riverside drive in the direction of the river they held hands and strolled quickly through the park toward the bmw parked on front street for only the second time in his career mitch was allowed to visit the palatial dining room on the fifth floor averys invitation came with the explanation that the partners were all quite impressed with the seventyone hours per week he averaged in billing for the month of february and thus they wished to offer the small reward of lunch it was an invitation no associate could turn down regardless of schedules and meetings and clients and deadlines and all the other terribly important and urgently critical aspects of careers at bendini lambert locke never in history had an associate said no to an invitation to the dining room each received two invitations per year records were kept mitch had two days to prepare for it his first impulse was to decline and when avery first mentioned it a dozen lame excuses crossed his mind eating and smiling and chatting and fraternizing with criminals f egardless of how rich and polished was less attractive than sharing a bowl of soup with a homeless down at the bus station but to say no would be a grievous breach of tradition and as things were going his movements were already suspicious enough so he sat with his back to the window and forced smiles and small talk in the direction of avery and royce mcknight and of course oliver lambert he knew he would eat at the same table with those three knew it for two days he knew they would watch him carefully but nonchalantly trying to detect any loss of enthusiasm or cynicism or hopelessness anything really he knew they would hang on his every word regardless of what he said he knew they would lavish praise and promises upon his weary shoulders oliver lambert had never been more charming seventyone hours a week for a february for an associate was a firm record he said as roosevelt served prime rib all the partners were amazed and delighted he explained softly while glancing around the room mitch forced a smile and sliced his serving the other partners amazed or indifferent were talking idly and concentrating on the food mitch counted eighteen active partners and seven retirees those with the khakis and sweaters and relaxed looks about them you have remarkable stamina mitch royce mcknight said with a mouthful he nodded politely yes yes i practice my stamina all the time he thought to himself as much as possible he kept his mind off joe hodge and marty kozinski and the other three dead lawyers memorialized on the wall downstairs but it was impossible to keep his mind off the pictures of the girl in the sand and he wondered if they all knew had they all seen the pictures passed them around during one of these little lunches when it was just the partners and no guests devasher had promised to keep them to himself but whats a promise from a thug of course theyd seen them voyles said every partner and most of the associates were in on the conspiracy for a man with no appetite he managed the food nicely he even buttered and devoured an extra roll just to appear normal nothing wrong with his appetite so you and abby are going to the caymans next week oliver lambert said yes its her spring break and we booked one of the condos two months ago looking forward to it its a terrible time to go avery said in disgust were a month behind right now were always a month behind avery so whats another week i guess you want me to take my files with me not a bad idea i always do dont do it mitch oliver lambert said in mock protest this place will be standing when you return you and abby deserve a week to yourselves youlllove it down there royce mcknight said as if mitch hap never been and that thing on the beach didnt happen and no one knew anything about any photographs when do you leave lambert asked sunday morning early are you taking the lear no delta nonstop lambert and mcknight exchanged quick looks that mitch was not supposed to see there were other looks from the other tables occasional quick glances filled with curiosity that mitch had caught since he entered the room he was there to be noticed do you scubadive asked lambert still thinking about the lear versus the delta nonstop no but we plan to do some snorkeling theres a guy on rum point on the north end name of adrian bench whos got a great dive lodge and will certify you in one week its a hard week lot of instruction but its worth it in other words stay away from abanks mitch thought whats the name of the lodge he asked rum point divers great place mitch frowned intelligently as if making a mental note of this helpful advice suddenly oliver lambert was hit with sadness be careful mitch it brings back memories of marty and joe avery and mcknight stared at their plates in a splitsecond memorial to the dead boys mitch swallowed hard and almost sneered at oliver lambert but he kept a straight face even managed to look sad with the rest of them marty and joe and their young widows and fatherless children marty and joe two young wealthy lawyers expertly killed and removed before they could talk marty and joe two promising sharks eaten by their own voyles had told mitch to think of marty and joe whenever he saw oliver lambert and now for a mere million bucks he was expected to do what marty and joe were about to do without getting caught perhaps a year from now the next new associate would be sitting here and watching the saddened partners talk about young mitch mcdeere and his remarkable stamina and what a helluva lawyer he would have been but for the accident how many would they kill he wanted two million plus a couple of other items after an hour of important talk and good food the lunch began breaking up as partners excused themselves spoke to mitch and left the room they were proud of him they said he was their brightest star of the future the future of bendini lambert locke he smiled and thanked them about the time roosevelt served the banana cream pie and coffee tammy greenwood hemphill of greenwood services parked her dirty brown rabbit behind the shiny peugeot in the st andrews episcopal school parking lot she left the motor running she took four steps stuck a key into the trunk of the peugeot and removed the heavy black briefcase she slammed the trunk and sped away in the rabbit from a small window in the teachers lounge abby sipped coffee and stared through the trees across the playground and into the parking lot in the distance she could barely see her car she smiled and checked her watch twelvethirty as planned tammy weaved her way carefully through the noon traffic in the direction of downtown driving was tedious when watching the rearview mirror as usual she saw nothing she parked in her designated place across the street from the cotton exchange building there were nine files in this load she arranged them neatly on the folding table and began making copies sigalas partners lettie plunk trust handyman hardware and two files bound loosely with a thick rubber band and marked averys files she ran two copies of every sheet of paper in the files and meticulously put them back together in a ledger book she entered the date time and name of each file there were now twentynine entries he said there would eventually be about forty she placed one copy of each file into the locked and hidden cabinet in the closet then repacked the briefcase with the original files and one copy of each pursuant to his instructions a week earlier she had rented in her name a twelvebytwelve storage room at the summer avenue mini storage it was fourteen miles from downtown and thirty minutes later she arrived and unlocked number c in a small cardboard box she placed the other copies of the nine files and scribbled the date on the end of the flap she placed it next to three other boxes on the floor at exactly pm she wheeled into the parking lot stopped behind the peugeot opened its trunk and left the briefcase where shed found it seconds later mitch stepped from the front door of the bendini building and stretched his arms he breathed deeply and gazed up and down front street a lovely spring day three blocks to the north and nine floors up in the window he noticed the blinds had been pulled all the way down the signal good everythings fine he smiled to himself and returned to his office at three oclock the next morning mitch eased out of bed and quietly pulled on a pair of faded jeans flannel law school shirt white insulated socks and a pair of old work boots he wanted to look like a truck driver without a word he kissed abby who was awake and left the house east meadowbrook was deserted as were all the streets between home and the interstate surely they would not follow him at this hour he drove interstate south for twentyfive miles to senatobia mississippi a busy allnight truck stop called the shone brightly a hundred yards from the fourlane he darted through the trucks to the rear where a hundred semis were parked for the night he stopped next to the truck wash bay and waited a dozen eighteenwheelers inched and weaved around the pumps a black guy wearing a falcons football cap stepped from around the corner and stared at the bmw mitch recognized him as the agent in the bus terminal in knoxville he killed the engine and stepped from the car mcdeere the agent asked of course who else wheres tarrance inside in a booth by the window hes waiting mitch opened the door and handed the keys to the agent where are you taking it down the road a little piece well take care of it you were clean coming out of memphis relax he climbed into the car eased between two diesel pumps and headed for the interstate mitch watched his little bmw disappear as he entered the truckstop cafe it was three fortyfive the noisy room was filled with heavy middleaged men drinking coffee and eating storebought pies they picked their teeth with colored toothpicks and talked of bass fishing and politics back at the terminal many spoke with loud northern twangs merle haggard wailed from the jukebox the lawyer moved awkwardly toward the rear until he saw in an unlit corner a familiar face hidden beneath aviators sunshades and the same michigan state baseball cap then the face smiled tarrance was holding a menu and watching the front door mitch slid into the booth hello good buddy tarrance said hows the truckin wonderful i think i prefer the bus though next time well try a train or something just for variety laney get your car laney the black dude hes an agent you know we havent been properly introduced yes hes got my car where is he taking it down the interstate hell be back in an hour or so well try to have you on the road by five so you can be at the office by six wed hate to mess up your day its already shot to hell a partially crippled waitress named dot ambled by and demanded to know what they wanted just coffee a surge of roadway drivers swarmed in the front door and filled up the cafe merle could barely be heard so how are the boys at the office tarrance asked cheerfully everythings fine the meters are ticking as we speak and everyones getting richer thanks for asking no problem hows my old pal voyles doing mitch asked hes quite anxious really he called me twice today and repeated for the tenth time his desire to have an answer from you said youd had plenty of time and all that i told him to relax told him about our little roadside rendezvous tonight and he got real excited im supposed to call him in four hours to be exact tell him a million bucks wont do it tarrance you boys like to brag about spending billions fighting organized crime so i say throw a little my way whats a couple of million cash to the federal government so its a couple of million now damned right its a couple of million and not a dime less i want a million now and a million later im in the process of copying all of my files and i should be finished in a few days legitimate files i think if i gave them to anyone id be permanently disbarred so when i give them to you i want the first million lets just call it goodfaith money how do you want it paid deposited in an account in a bank in zurich but well discuss the details later dot slid two saucers onto the table and dropped two mismatched cups on them she poured from a height of three feet and splashed coffee in all directions free refills she grunted and left and the second million tarrance asked ignoring the coffee when you and i and voyles decide ive supplied you with enough documents to get the indictments then i get half after i testify for the last time i get the other half thats incredibly fair tarrance it is youve got a deal mitch breathed deeply and felt weak a deal a contract an agreement one that could never be put in writing but one that was terribly enforceable nonetheless he sipped the coffee but didnt taste it they had agreed on the money he was on a roll keep pushing and theres one other thing tarrance the head lowered and turned slightly to the right yeah mitch leaned closer resting on his forearms it wont cost you a dime and you boys can pull it off with no sweat okay im listening my brother ray is at brushy mountain seven years until parole i want him out thats ridiculous mitch we can do a lot of things but we damned sure cant parole state prisoners federal maybe but not state no way listen to me tarrance and listen good if i hit the road with the mafia on my tail my brother goes with me sort of like a package deal and i know if director voyles wants him out of prison hell get out of prison i know that now you boys just figure out a way to make it happen but we have no authority to interfere with state prisoners mitch smiled and returned to his coffee james earl ray escaped from brushy mountain and he had no help from the outside oh thats great we attack the prison like commandos and rescue your brother beautiful dont play dumb with me tarrance its not negotiable all right all right ill see what i can do anything else any more surprises no just questions about where we go and what we do where do we hide initially where do we hide during the trials where do welive for the rest of our lives just minor questions like that we can discuss it later what did hodge and kozinski tell you not enough weve got a notebook a rather thick notebook in which weve accumulated and indexed everything we know about the moroltos and most of its morolto crap their organization key people illegal activities and so on you need to read it all before we start to work which of course will be after ive received the first million of course when can we see your files in about a week ive managed to copy four files that belong to someone else i may get my hands on a few more of those whos doing the copying none of your business tarrance thought for a second and let it pass how many files between forty and fifty i have to sneak them out a few at a time some ive worked on for eight months others only a week or so as far as i can tell theyre all legitimate clients how many of these clients have you personally met two or three dont bet theyre all legitimate hodge told us about some dummy files or sweat files as they are known to the partners that have been around for years and every new associate cuts his teeth on them heavy files that require hundreds of hours and make the rookies feel like real lawyers sweat files thats what hodge said its an easy game mitch they lure you with the money they smother you with work that looks legitimate and for the most part probably is legitimate then after a few years youve unwittingly become a part of the conspiracy youre nailed and theres no getting out even you mitch you started work in july eight months ago and youve probably already touched a few of the dirty files you didnt knowit had no reason to suspect it but theyve already set you up two million tarrance two million and my brother tarrance sipped the lukewarm coffee and ordered a piece of coconut pie as dot came within earshot he glanced at his watch and surveyed the crowd of truckers all smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee and gossiping he adjusted the sunglasses so what do i tell mr voyles tell him we aint got a deal until he agrees to get ray out of prison no deal tarrance we can probably work something out im confident you can when do you leave for the caymans early sunday why just curious thats all well id like to know how many different groups will be following me down there is that asking too much im sure well attract a crowd and frankly we had hoped for a little privacy firm condo of course forget privacy its probably got more wires than a switchboard maybe even some cameras thats comforting we might stay a couple of nights at abanks dive lodge if you boys are in the neighborhood stop by for a drink very funny if were there itll be for a reason and you wont know it tarrance ate the pie in three bites he left two bucks on the table and they walked to the dark rear of the truck stop the dirty asphalt pavement vibrated under the steady hum of an acre of diesel engines they waited in the dark ill talk to voyles in a few hours tarrance said why dont you and your wife take a leisurely saturdayafternoon drive tomorrow anyplace in particular yeah theres a town called holly springs thirty miles east of here old place full of antebellum homes and confederate history women love to drive around and look at the old mansions make your appearance around four oclock and well find you our buddy laney will be driving a bright red chevy blazer with tennessee plates follow him well find a place and talk is it safe trust us if we see or smell something well break off drive around town for an hour and if you dont see laney grab a sandwich and go back home youll know they were too close we wont take chances thanks a great bunch of guys laney eased around the corner in the bmw and jumped out everythings clear no trace of anyone good tarrance said see you tomorrow mitch happy truckin they shook hands its not negotiable tarrance mitch said again you can call me wayne see you tomorrow the black thunderheads and driving rain had long since cleared the tourists from seven mile beach when the mcdeeres soaked and tired arrived at the luxury condominium duplex mitch backed the rented mitsubishi jeep over the curb across the small lawn and up to the front door unit b his first visit had been to unit a they appeared to be identical except for the paint and trim the key fit and they grabbed and threw luggage as the clouds burst and the rain grew thicker once inside and dry they unpacked in the master bedroom upstairs with a long balcony facing the wet beach cautious with their words they inspected the town house and checked out each room and closet the refrigerator was empty but the bar was very well stocked mitch mixed two drinks rum and coke in honor of the islands they sat on the balcony with their feet in the rain and watched the ocean churn and spill toward the shore rumheads was quiet and barely visible in the distance two natives sat at the bar drinking and watching the sea thats rumheads over there mitch said pointing with his drink rumheads i told you about it its a hot spot where tourists drink and the locals play dominoes i see abby was unimpressed she yawned and sank lower into the plastic chair she closed her eyes oh this is great abby our first trip out of the country our first real honeymoon and youre asleep ten minutes after we hit land im tired mitch i packed all night while you were sleeping you packed eight suitcasessix for you and two for me you packed every garment we own no wonder you were awake all night i dont want to run out of clothes run out how many bikinis did you pack ten twelve six great one a day why dont you put one on what you heard me go put on that little blue one with high legs and a couple of strings around front the one that weighs half a gram and cost sixty bucks and your buns hang out when you walk i wanna see it mitch its raining youve brought me here to this island during the monsoon season look at those clouds dark and thick and extremely stationary i wont need any bikinis this week mitch smiled and began rubbing her legs i rather like the rain in fact i hope it rains all week itll keep us inside in the bed sipping rum and trying to hurt each other im shocked you mean you actually want sex weve already done it once this month twice i thought you wanted to snorkel and scubadive all week nope theres probably a shark out there waiting for me the winds blew harder and the balcony was being drenched lets go take off our clothes mitch said after an hour the storm began to move the rain slackened then turned to a soft drizzle then it was gone the sky lightened as the dark low clouds left the tiny island and headed northeast toward cuba shortly before its scheduled departure over the horizon the sun suddenly emerged for a brief encore it emptied the beach cottages and town homes and condos and hotel rooms as the tourists strolled through the sand toward the water rumheads was suddenly packed with dart throwers and thirsty beachcombers the domino game picked up where it had left off the reggae band next door at the palms tuned up mitch and abby walked aimlessly along the edge of the water in the general direction of georgetown away from the spot where the girl had been he thought of her occasionally and of the photographs he had decided she was a pro and had been paid by devasher to seduce and conquer him in front of the hidden cameras he did not expect to see her this time as if on cue the music stopped the beach strollers froze and watched the noise at rumheads quietened as all eyes turned to watch the sun meet the water gray and white clouds the trailing remnants of the storm lay low on the horizon and sank with the sun slowly they turned shades of orange and yellow and red pale shades at first then suddenly brilliant tones for a few brief moments the sky was a canvas and the sun splashed its awesome array of colors with bold strokes then the bright orange ball touched the water and within seconds was gone the clouds became black and dissipated a cayman sunset with great fear and caution abby slowly maneuvered the jeep through the earlymorning traffic in the shopping district she was from kentucky she had never driven on the left side of the road for any substantial period of time mitch gave directions and watched the rearview mirror the narrow streets and sidewalks were already crowded with tourists windowshopping for dutyfree china crystal perfume cameras and jewelry mitch pointed to a hidden side street and the jeep darted between two groups of tourists he kissed her on the cheek ill meet you right here at five be careful she said ill go to the bank then stay on the beach near the condo he slammed the door and disappeared between two small shops the alley led to a wider street that led to hogsty bay he ducked into a crowded tshirt store filled with racks and rows of tourist shirts and straw hats and sunglasses he selected a gaudy greenandorange flowered shirt and a panama hat two minutes later he darted from the store into the back seat of a passing taxi airport he said and make it quick watch your tail someone may be following the driver made no response just eased past the bank buildings and out of town ten minutes later he stopped in front of the terminal anybody follow us mitch asked pulling money from his pocket no mon four dollars and ten cents mitch threw a five over the seat and walked quickly into the terminal the cayman airways flight to cayman brae would leave at nine at a gift shop mitch bought a cup of coffee and hid between two rows of shelves filled with souvenirs he watched the waiting area and saw no one of course he had no idea what they looked like but he saw no one sniffing around and searching for lost people perhaps they were following the jeep or combing the shopping district looking for him perhaps for seventyfive cayman dollars he had reserved the last seat on the tenpassenger threeengine trislandef abby had made the reservation by pay phone the night they arrived at the last possible second he jogged from the terminal onto the tarmac and climbed on board the pilot slammed and locked the doors and they taxied down the runway no other planes were visible a small hangar sat to the right the ten tourists admired the brilliant blue sea and said little during the twentyminute flight as they approached cayman brae the pilot became the tour guide and made a wide circle around the small island he pajd special attention to the tall bluffs that fell into the sea on the east end without the bluffs he said the island would be as flat as grand cayman he landed the plane softly on a narrow asphalt strip next to the small white frame building with the word airport painted on all sides a cleancut caucasian waited and watched the passengers quickly disembark he was rick acklin special agent and sweat dripped from his nose and glued his shirt to his back he stepped slightly forward mitch he said almost to himself mitch hesitated and then walked over cars out front acklin said wheres tarrance mitch looked around hes waiting does the car have air conditioning afraid not sorry the car was minus air power anything and signal lights it was a ltd and acklin explained as they followed the dusty road that there simply was not much of a selection of rental cars on cayman brae and the reason the us government had rented the car was because he and tarrance had been unable to find a taxi they were lucky to find a room on such late notice the small neat homes were closer together and sea appeared they parked in the sand parking lot of an establishment called brae divers an aging pier jutted into the water and anchored a hundred boats of all sizes to the west along the beach a dozen thatchedroof cabins sat two feet above the sand and housed divers who came from around the world next to the pier was an openair bar nameless but complete with a domino game and a dartboard oakandbrass fans hung from the ceiling through the rafters and rotated slowly and silently cooling the domino players and the bartender wayne tarrance sat at a table by himself drinking a coke and watching a dive crew load a thousand identical yellow tanks from the pier onto a boat even for a tourist his dress was hysterical dark sunglasses with yellow frames brown straw sandals obviously brandnew with black socks a tight hawaiian luau shirt with twenty loud colors and a pair of gold gym shorts that were very old and very short and covered little of the shiny sicklywhite legs under the table he waved his coke at the two empty chairs nice shirt tarrance mitch said in undisguised amusement thanks you gotta real winner yourself nice tan too yeah yeah gotta look the part you know the waiter hovered nearby and waited for them to speak acklin ordered a coke mitch said he wanted a coke with a splash of rum in it all three became engrossed with the dive boat and the divers loading their bulky gear what happened in holly springs mitch finally asked sorry we couldnt help it they followed you out of memphis and had two cars waiting in holly springs we couldnt get near you did you and your wife discuss the trip before you left asked acklin i think so we probably mentioned it around the house a couple of times acklin seemed satisfied they were certainly ready for you a green skylark followed you for about twenty miles then got lost we called it off then tarrance sipped his coke and said late saturday night the lear left memphis and flew nonstop to grand cayman we think two or three of the goons were on board the plane left early sunday morning and returned to memphis so theyre here and theyre following us of course they probably had one or two people on the plane with you and abby might have been men women or both couldve been a black dude or an oriental woman who knows remember mitch they have plenty of money there are two that we recognize one was in washington when you were there a blond fellow about forty sixone maybe sixtwo with real short hair almost a crew cut and real strong nordiclooking features he moves quickly we saw him yesterday driving a red escort he got from coconut car rentals on the island i think ive seen him mitch said where asked acklin in a bar in the memphis airport the night i returned from washington i caught him watching me and i thought at the time that i had seen him in washington thats him hes here whos the other one tony verkler or twoton tony as we call him hes a con with an impressive record of convictions most of it in chicago hes worked for morolto for years weighs about three hundred pounds and does a great job of watching people because no one would ever suspect him he was at rumheads last night acklin added last night we were there last night with great ceremony the dive boat pushed from the pier and headed for open water beyond the pier fishermen in their small catboats pulled their nets and sailors navigated their brightly colored catamarans away from land after a gentle and dreamy start the island was awake now half the boats tied to the pier had left or were in the process of leaving so when did you boys get in towji mitch asked sipping his drink which was more rum than coke sunday night tarrance answered while watching the dive boat slowly disappear just out of curiosity how many men do you have on the islands four men two women said tarrance acklin became mute and deferred all conversation to his supervisor and why exactly are you here mitch asked oh several reasons number one we wanted to talk to you and nail down our little deal director voyles is terribly anxious about reaching an agreement you can live with number two we want to watch them to determine how many goons are here well spend the week trying to identify these people the island is small and its a good place to observe and number three you wanted to work on your suntan acklin managed a slight giggle tarrance smiled and then frowned no not exactly were here for your protection my protection yes the last time i sat at this very table i was talking to joe hodge and marty kozinski about nine months ago the day before they were killed to be exact and you think im about to be killed no not yet mitch motioned at the bartender for another drink the domino game grew heated and he watched the natives argue and drink beer look boys as we speak the goons as you call them are probably following my wife all over grand cayman ill be sort of nervous until i get back now what about the deal tarrance left the sea and the dive boat and stared at mitch two millions fine and of course its fine tarrance we agreed on it did we not relax mitch well pay a million when you turn over all of your files at that point theres no turning back as they say youre in up to your neck tarrance i understand that it was my suggestion remember but thats the easy part we really dont want your files because theyre clean files good files legitimate files we want the bad files mitch the ones with indictments written all over them and these files will be much harder to come by but when you do so well pay another half million and the rest after the last trial and my brother well try not good enough tarrance i want a commitment we cant promise to deliver your brother hell hes got at least seven more years but hes my brother tarrance i dont care if hes a serial murderer sitting on death row waiting for his last meal hes my brother and if you want me you have to release him i said well try but we cant commit theres no legal formal legitimate way to get him out so we must try other means what if he gets shot during the escape just get him out tarrance well try youll throw the power and resources of the fbi in assisting my brother in escaping from prison right tarrance you have my word mitch sat back in his chair and took a long sip of his drink now the deal was final he breathed easier and smiled in the direction of the magnificent caribbean so when do we get your files tarrance asked thought you didnt want them theyre too clean remember we want the files mitch because when we get the files then weve got you youve proved yourself when you hand us your files your license to practice law so to speak ten to fifteen days how many files between forty and fifty the small ones are an inch thick the big ones wouldnt fit on this table i cant use the copiers around the office so weve had to make other arrangements perhaps we could assist in the copying said acklin perhaps not perhaps if i need your help perhaps ill ask for it how do you propose to get them to us tarrance asked acklin withdrew again very simple wayne when ive copied them all and once i get the million where i want it then ill hand you a key to a certain little room in the memphis area and you can get them in your pickup i told you wed deposit the money in a swiss bank account tarrance said and now i dont want it in a swiss bank account okay ill dictate the terms of the transfer and itll be done exactly as i say its my neck on the line from now on boys so i call the shots most of them anyway tarrance smiled and grunted and stared at the pier so you dont trust the swiss lets just say i have another bank in mind i work for money launderers remember wayne so ive become an expert on hiding money in offshore accounts well see when do i see this notebook on the moroltos after we get your files and pay our first installment well brief you as much as we can but for the most part youre on your own you and i will need to meet a lot and of course thatll be rather dangerous may have to take a few bus rides okay but the next time i get the aisle seat sure sure anybody worth two million can surely pick his seat on a greyhound ill never live to enjoy it wayne you know i wont three miles out of georgetown on the narrow and winding road to sodden town mitch saw him the man was squatting behind an old volkswagen beetle with the hood up as if engine trouble had stopped him the man was dressed like a native without tourist clothes he could easily pass for one of the brits who worked for the government or the banks he was well tanned the man held a wrench of some sort and appeared to study it and watch the mitsubishi jeep as it roared by on the lefthand side of the road the man was the nordic he was supposed to have gone unnoticed mitch instinctively slowed to thirty miles per hour to wait for him abby turned and watched the road the narrow highway to bodden town clung to the shoreline for five miles then forked and the ocean disappeared within minutes the nordics green vw came racing around a slight bend the mcdeere jeep was much closer than the nordic anticipated being seen he abruptly slowed then turned into the first whiterock driveway on the ocean side mitch gunned the jeep and sped to bodden town west o the small settlement he turned south and less than a mile later found the ocean it was am and the parking lot of abanks dive lodge was half full the two morning dive boats had left thirty minutes earlier the mcdeeres walked quickly to the bar where henry was already shuffling beer and cigarettes to the domino players barry abanks leaned on a post supporting the thatched roof of the bar and watched as his two dive boats disappeared around the corner of the island each would make two dives at places like bonnies arch devils grotto eden rock and rogers wreck point places he had dived and toured and guided through a thousand times some of the places he had discovered himself the mcdeeres approached and mitch quietly introduced his wife to mr abanks who was not polite but not rude they started for the small pier where a deckhand was preparing a thirtyfoot fishing boat abanks unloaded an indecipherable string of commands in the general direction of the young deckhand who was either deaf or unafraid of his boss mitch stood next to abanks the captain now and pointed to the bar fifty yards away down the pier do you know all those people at the bar he asked abanks frowned at mitch they tried to follow me here just curious mitch said the usual gang abanks said no strangers have you noticed any strangers around this morning look this place attracts strange people i keep no ledger of the strange ones and the normal ones have you seen a fat american red hair at least three hundred pounds abanks shook his head the deckhand eased the boat uckward away from the pier then toward the horizon abby sat on a small padded bench and watched the dive lodge disappear in a vinyl bag between her feet were two new sets of snorkeling fins and dive masks it was ostensibly a snorkeling trip with maybe a little light fishing if they were biting the great man himself had agreed to accompany them but only after mitch insisted and told him they needed to discuss personal matters private matters regarding the death of his son from a screened balcony on the second floor of a cayman kai beach house the nordic watched the two snorkeled heads bob and disappear around the fishing boat he handed the binoculars to twoton tony verkler who quickly bored handed them back a striking blonde in a black onepiece with legs cut high almost to the rib cage stood behind the nordic and took the binoculars of particular interest was the deckhand tony spoke i dont understand if they were talking serious why the boy why have another set of ears around perhaps theyre talking about snorkeling and fishing said the nordic i dont know said the blonde its unusual for abanks to spend time on a fishing boat he likes the divers there must be a good reason for him to waste a day with two novice snorkelers somethings up whos the boy asked tony just one of the gofers she said hes got a dozen can you talk to him later asked the nordic yeah said tony show him some skin snort some candy hell talk ill try she said whats his name asked the nordic keith rook keith rook maneuvered the boat alongside the pier at rum point mitch abby and abanks climbed from the boat and headed for the beach keith was not invited to lunch he stayed behind and lazily washed the deck the shipwreck bar sat inland a hundred yards under a heavy cover of rare shade trees it was dark and damp with screened windows and squeaky ceiling fans there was no reggae dominoes or dartboard the noon crowd was quiet with each table engrossed in its own private talk the view from their table was out to sea to the north they ordered cheeseburgers and beerisland food this bar is different mitch observed quietly very much so said abanks and with good reason its a hangout for drug dealers who own many of the nice homes and condos around here they fly in on their private jets deposit their money in our many fine banks and spend a few days around here checking their real estate nice neighborhood very nice really they have millions and they keep to themselves the waitress a husky wellmixed mulatto dropped three bottles of jamaican red stripe on the table without saying a word abanks leaned forward on his elbows with his head lowered the customary manner of speaking in the shipwreck bar so you think you can walk away he said mitch and abby leaned forward in unison and all three heads met low in the center of the table just over the beer not walk but run run like hell but ill get away and ill need your help he thought about this for a moment and raised his head he shrugged but what am i to do he took the first sip of his red stripe abby saw her first and it would take a woman to spot another woman straining ever so elegantly to eavesdrop on their little conversation her back was to abanks she was a solid blonde partially hidden under cheap black rubber sunglasses that covered most of her face and she had been watching the ocean and listening a bit too hard when the three of them leaned over she sat up straight and listened like hell she was by herself at a table for two abby dug her fingernails into her husbands leg and their table became quiet the blonde in black listened then turned to her table and her drink wayne tarrance had improved his wardrobe by friday of cayman week gone were the straw sandals and tight shorts and teenybop sunglasses gone were the sicklypale legs now they were bright pink burned beyond recognition after three days in the tropical outback known as cayman brae he and acklin acting on behalf of the us government had pounced on a rather cheap room on grand cayman miles from seven mile beach and not within walking distance of any remote portion of the sea here they had established a command post to monitor the comings and goings of the mcdeeres and other interested people here at the coconut motel they had shared a small room with two single beds and cold showers wednesday morning they had contacted the subject mcdeere and requested a meeting as soon as possible he said no said he was too busy said he and his wife were honeymooning and had no time for such a meeting maybe later was all he said then late thursday while mitch and abby were enjoying grilled grouper at the lighthouse on the road to bodden town laney agent laney dressed in appropriate island garb and looking very much like an island negro stopped at their table and laid down the law tarrance insisted on a meeting chickens had to be imported into the cayman islands and not the best ones only mediumgrade chickens to be consumed not by native islanders but by americans away from home without this most basic staple colonel sanders had the damnedest time teaching the island girls though black or close to it how to fry chicken it was foreign to them and so it was that special agent wayne tarrance of the bronx arranged a quick secret meeting at the kentucky fried chicken franchise on the island of grand cayman the only such franchise he thought the place would be deserted he was wrong a hundred hungry tourists from georgia alabama texas and mississippi packed the place and devoured extracrispy with cole slaw and creamed potatoes it tasted better in tupelo but it would do tarrance and acklin sat in a booth in the crowded restaurant and nervously watched the front door it was not too late to abort there were just too many people finally mitch entered by himself and stood in the long line he brought his little red box to their table and sat down he did not say hello or anything he began eating the threepiece dinner for which he paid cayman dollars imported chicken where have you been tarrance asked mitch attacked a thigh on the island its stupid to meet here tarrance too many people we know what were doing yeah like the korean shoe store cute why wouldnt you see us wednesday i was busy wednesday i didnt want to see you wednesday am i clean of course youre clean laney wouldve tackled you at the front door if you werent clean this place makes me nervous tarrance why did you go to abanks mitch wiped his mouth and held the partially devoured thigh a rather small thigh hes got a boat i wanted to fish and snorkel so we cut a deal where were you tarrance in a submarine trailing us around the island what did abanks say oh he knows lots of words hello give me a beer whos following us buncha words they followed you you know they which they your they or their they im being followed so much im causing traffic jams the bad guys mitch those from memphis and chicago and new york the ones wholl kill you tomorrow if you get real cute im touched so they followed me whered i take them snorkeling fishing come on tarrance they follow me you follow them you follow me they follow you if i slam on brakes i get twenty noses up my ass why are we meeting here tarrance this place is packed tarrance glanced around in frustration mitch closed his chicken box look tarrance im nervous and ive lost my appetite relax you were clean coming from the condo im always clean tarrance i suppose hodge and kozinski were clean every time they moved clean at abanks clean on the dive boat clean at the funerals this was not a good idea tarrance im leaving okay when does your plane leave why you guys plan to follow will you follow me or them what if they follow you what if we all get real confused and i follow everybody come on mitch nineforty in the morning ill try to save you a seat you can have the window next to twoton tony when do we get your files mitch stood with his chicken box in a week or so give me ten days and tarrance no more meetings in public they kill lawyers remember not stupid fbi agents at eight monday morning oliver lambert and nathan locke were cleared through the concrete wall on the fifth floor and walked through the maze of small rooms and offices devasher was waiting he closed the door behind them and pointed to the chairs his walk was not as quick the night had been a long losing battle with the vodka the eyes were red and the brain expanded with each breath i talked with lazarov yesterday in las vegas i explained as best i could why you boys were so reluctant to fire your four lawyers lynch sorrell buntin and myers i gave him all your good reasons he said hed think about it but in the meantime make damned sure those four work on nothing but clean files take no chances and watch them closely hes really a nice guy isnt he oliver lambert said oh yes a real charmer he said mr morolto has asked about once a week for six weeks now said theyre all anxious what did you tell him told him things are secure for now leaks are plugged for now i dont think he believes me what about mcdeere asked locke he had a wonderful week with his wife have you ever seen her in a string bikini she wore one all week outstanding we got some pictures just for fun i didnt come here to look at pictures locke snapped you dont say they spent an entire day with our little pal abanks just the three of them and a deckhand they played in the water did some fishing and they did a lot of talking about what we dont know never could get close enough but it makes me very suspicious guys very suspicious i dont see why said oliver lambert what can they talk about besides fishing and diving and of course hodge and kozinski and so they talk about hodge and kozinski whats the harm he never knew hodge and kozinski oliver said locke why would he be so interested in their deaths keep in mind said devasher that tarrance told him at their first meeting that the deaths were not accidental so now hes sherlock holmes looking for clues he wont find any will he devasher hell no it was a perfect job oh sure there are a few unanswered questions but the caymanian police damned sure cant answer them neither can our boy mcdeere then why are you worried asked lambert because theyre worried in chicago ollie and they pay me real good money to stay worried down here and until the fibbies leave us alone everybody stays worried okay what else did he do the usual cayman vacation sex sun rum a little shopping and sightseeing we had three people on the island and they lost him a couple of times but nothing serious i hope like ive always said you cant trail a man twentyfour hours a day seven days a week without getting caught so we have to play it cool sometimes you think mcdeeres talking asked locke i know he lies nat he lied about the incident in the korean shoe store a month ago you guys didnt want to believe it but im convinced he went into that store voluntarily because he wanted to talk with tarrance one of our guys made a mistake got too close so the little meeting broke up that aint mcdeeres version but thats what happened yeah nat i think hes talking maybe lie meets with tarrance and tells him to go to hell maybe theyre smoking dope together i dont know but you have nothing concrete devasher ollie said the brain expanded and pressed mightily against the skull it hurt too much to get mad no ollie nothing like hodge and kozinski if thats what you mean we had those boys on tape and knew they were about to talk mcdeeres a little different hes also a rookie said nat an eightmonth lawyer who knows nothing hes spent a thousand hours on sweat files and the only clients hes handled have been legitimate averys been extremely careful about the files mcdeeres touched weve talked about it he has nothing to say because he knows nothing added ollie marty and joe knew a helluva lot but theyd been here for years mcdeeres a new recruit devasher gently massaged his temples so youve hired a real dumbass lets just suppose the fbi has a hunch who our biggest client is okay think along with me and lets just suppose hodge and kozinski fed them enough to confirm the identity of this particular client see where im going and lets suppose the fibbies have told mcdeere all they know along with a certain amount of embellishment suddenly your ignorant rookie recruit is a very smart man and a very dangerous one how do you prove this we step up surveillance for starters put his wife under twentyfourhour watch ive already called lazarov and requested more men told him we needed some fresh faces im going to chicago tomorrow to brief lazarov and maybe mr morolto lazarov thinks morolto has a lead on a mole within the bureau some guy whos close to voyles and will sell information but its expensive supposedly they wanna assess things and decide where to go and youll tell them mcdeeres talking asked locke ill tell them what i know and what i suspect im afraid that if we sit back and wait for concrete it might be too late im sure lazarov will wanna discuss plans to eliminate him preliminary plans ollie asked with a touch of hope weve passed the preliminary stage ollie the hourglass tavern in new york city faces fortysixth street near its corner with ninth avenue a small dark holeinthewall with twentytwo seats it grew to fame with its expensive menu and fiftynineminute time limit on each meal on the walls not far above the tables hourglasses with white sand silently collect the seconds and minutes until the taverns timekeeperthe waitressfinally makes her calculations and calls time frequented by the broadway crowd it is usually packed with loyal fans waiting on the sidewalk lou lazarov liked the hourglass because it was dark and private conversations were possible short conversations under fiftynine minutes he liked it because it was not in little italy and he was not italian and although he was owned by sicilians he did not have to eat their food he liked it because he was born and spent the first forty years of his life in the theater district then corporate headquarters was moved to chicago and he was transferred but business required his presence in new york at least twice a week and when the business included meeting a member of equal stature from another family lazarov always suggested the hourglass tubertini had equal stature and a little extra reluctantly he agreed on the hourglass lazarov arrived first and did not wait for a table he knew from experience the crowd thinned around pm especially on thursdays he ordered a glass of red wine the waitress tipped the hourglass above his head and the race was on he sat at a front table facing the street his back to the other tables he was a heavy man of fiftyeight with a thick chest and ponderous belly he leaned hard on the redcheckered tablecloth and watched the traffic on fortysixth thankfully tubertini was prompt less than a fourth of the white sand was wasted on him they shook hands politely while tubertini scornfully surveyed the tiny sliver of a restaurant he flashed a plastic smile at lazarov and glared at his seat in the window his back would face the street and this was extremely irritating and dangerous but his car was just outside with two of his men he decided to be polite he deftly maneuvered around the tiny table and sat down tubertini was polished he was thirtyseven the soninlaw of old man palumbo himself family married his only daughter he was beautifully thin and tanned with his short black hair oiled to perfection and slicked back he ordered red wine hows my pal joey morolto he asked with a perfect brilliant smile fine and mr palumbo very ill and very illtempered as usual please give him my regards certainly the waitress approached and looked menacingly at the timepiece just wine said tubertini i wont be eating lazarov looked at the menu and handed it to her sauteed blackfish with another glass of wine tubertini glanced at his men in the car they appeared to be napping so whats wrong in chicago nothings wrong we just need a little information thats all weve heard unconfirmed of course that you have a very reliable man somewhere deep in the bureau somewhere close to voyles and if we do we need some information from this man we have a small unit in memphis and the fibbies are trying like hell to infiltrate we suspect one of our employees may be working with them but we cant seem to catch him and if you caught him wed slice out his liver and feed it to the rats serious huh extremely serious something tells me the feds have targeted our little unit down there and weve grown quite nervous lets say his name is alfred and lets say hes very close to voyles okay we need a very simple answer from alfred we need to know yes or no if our employee is working with the fibbies tubertini watched lazarov and sipped his wine alfred specializes in simple answers he prefers the yes and no variety weve used him twice only when its critical and both times it was a question of are the feds coming here or there hes extremely cautious i dont think he would provide too many details is he accurate deadly accurate then he should be able to help us if the answer is yes we move accordingly if no the employee is off the hook and its business as usual alfreds very expensive i was afraid so how much well he has sixteen years with the bureau and is a career man thats why hes so cautious he has much to lose how much half a million damn of course we have to make a small profit on the transaction after all alfred is ours a small profit quite small really most of it goes to alfred he talks to voyles daily you know his office is two doors down all right well pay tubertini flashed a conquering smile and tasted his wine i think you lied mr lazarov you said it was a small unit in memphis thats not true is it no whats the name of this unit the bendini firm old man moroltos daughter married a bendini thats it whats the employees name mitchell mcdeere it might take two or three weeks meeting with alfred is a major production yes just be quick about it it was highly unusual for wives to appear at the quiet little fortress on front street they were certainly welcome they were told but seldom invited so abby mcdeere arrived through the front door into the reception area uninvited and unannounced it was imperative that she see her husband she insisted the receptionist phoned nina on the second floor and within seconds she appeared in a rush and warmly greeted her bosss wife mitch was in a meeting she explained hes always in a damned meeting abby replied get him out they rushed to his office where abby closed the door and waited mitch was observing another one of averys chaotic departures secretaries bumped into each other and packed briefcases while avery yelled into the phone mitch sat on the sofa with a legal pad and watched his partner was scheduled for two days on grand cayman april loomed on the calendar like a date with a firing squad and the banks down there had certain records that had become critical it was all work avery insisted he talked about the trip for five days dreading it cursing it but finding it completely unavoidable he would take the lear and it was now waiting said a secretary probably waiting with a load of cash thought mitch avery slammed the phone down and grabbed his coat nina walked through the door and glared at mitch mr mcdeere your wife is here she says its an emergency the chaos became silent he looked blankly at avery the secretaries froze what is it he asked standing shes in your office nina said mitch ive gotta go avery said ill call you tomorrow i hope things are okay sure he followed nina down the hall saying nothing to his office abby sat on his desk he closed and locked the door he watched her carefully mitch i have to go home why whats happened my father just called at school they found a tumor in one of mothers lungs theyre operating tomorrow he breathed deeply im so sorry he did not touch her she was not crying i must go ive taken a leave of absence at school for how long it was a nervous question she looked past him to the ego wall i dont know mitch we need some time apart im tired of a lot of things right now and i need time i think it will be good for both of us lets talk about it youre too busy to talk mitch ive been trying to talk for six months but you cant hear me how long will you be gone abby i dont know i guess it depends on mother no it depends on a lot of things youre scaring me abby ill be back i promise i dont know when maybe a week maybe a month i need to sort out some things a month i dont know mitch i just need some time and i need to be with mother i hope shes okay i mean that i know im going home to pack a few things and ill leave in an hour or so all right be careful i love you mitch he nodded and watched as she opened the door there was no embrace on the fifth floor a technician rewound the tape and pushed the emergency button direct to devashers office he appeared instantly and slapped the headphones over his extralarge cranium he listened for a moment rewind he demanded he was quiet for another moment when did this happen he asked the technician looked at a panel of digital numbers two minutes fourteen seconds ago in his office second floor damn damn shes leaving him aint she no talk of separation or divorce before this no you wouldve known about it theyve argued about his workaholic routine and he hates her parents but nothing like this yeah yeah check with marcus and see if hes heard anything before check the tapes in case weve missed something damn damn damn abby started for kentucky but did not make it an hour west of nashville she left interstate and turned north on highway she had noticed nothing behind her she drove eighty at times then fifty nothing at the small town of clarksville near the kentucky line she abruptly turned east on highway an hour later she entered nashville through a county highway and the red peugeot was lost in city traffic she parked it in the longterm section at nashville airport and caught a shuttle to the terminal in a rest room on the first floor she changed into khaki walking shorts bass loafers and a navy knit pullover it was a cool outfit a little out of season but she was headed for warmer weather she pulled her shoulderlength hair into a ponytail and forced it under her collar she changed sunglasses and stuffed the dress heels and panty hose into a canvas gym bag almost five hours after she left memphis she walked to the delta boarding gate and presented her ticket she asked for a window seat no delta flight in the free world can bypass atlanta but fortunately she was not forced to change planes she waited by her window and watched darkness fall on the busy airport she was nervous but tried not to think about it she drank a glass of wine and read a newsweek two hours later she landed in miami and left the plane she walked rapidly through the airport catching stares but ignoring them theyre just the usual everyday stares of admiration and lust she told herself nothing more at the one and only cayman airways boarding gate she produced her roundtrip ticket and the required birth certificate and drivers license wonderful people these caymanians but they wont allow you in their country unless youve already purchased a ticket to get out please come and spend your money then leave please she sat in a corner of the crowded room and tried to read a young father with a pretty wife and two babies kept staring at her legs but no one else noticed her the flight to grand cayman would leave in thirty minutes after a rough start avery gained momentum and spent seven hours at the royal bank of montreal georgetown grand cayman branch when he left at pm the complimentary conference room was filled with computer printouts and account summaries he would finish tomorrow he needed mcdeere but circumstances had worked to seriously curtail his travel plans avery was now exhausted and thirsty and things were hot on the beach at rumheads he picked up a beer at the bar and worked his welltanned body through the crowd to the patio where he looked for a table as he strode confidently past the domino game tammy greenwood hemphill of greenwood services nervously but nonchalantly entered the crowd and sat on a stool at the bar she watched him her tan was storebought machineinflicted with some areas browner than others but on the whole it was an enviable tan for late march the hair was now colored not bleached to a soft sandy blond and the makeup likewise had been tempered the bikini was state of the art bright fluorescent orange that demanded attention the large breasts hung wonderfully and stretched the strings and patches to their limit the small patch across the rear was woefully incapable of covering anything she was forty but twenty sets of hungry eyes followed her to the bar where she ordered a club soda and fired up a cigarette she smoked it and watched him he was a wolf he looked good and he knew it he sipped his beer and slowly examined every female within fifty yards he locked into one a young blonde and seemed ready to pounce when her man arrived and she sat in his lap he sipped his beer and continued to survey tammy ordered another club soda with a twist of lime and started for the patio the wolf locked into the big breasts immediately and watched them bounce his way mind if i sit down she asked he half stood and reached for the chair please do it was a great moment for him of all the hungry wolves lusting around the bar and patio at rumheads she picked him hed had younger babes but at this moment at this place she was the hottest im avery tolar from memphis nice to meet you im libby libby lox from birmingham now she was libby she had a sister named libby a mother named doris and her name was tammy and she hoped to hell she could keep it all straight although she wore no rings she had a husband whose legal name was elvis and he was supposed to be in oklahoma city impersonating the king and probably screwing teenage girls with love me tender tshirts what brings you here avery asked just fun got in this morning staying at the palms you im a tax lawyer and believe it or not im here on business im forced to come down several times a year real torture where are you staying he pointed my firm owns those two condos over there its a nice little writeoif very pretty the wolf did not hesitate would you like to see them she giggled like a sophomore maybe later he smiled at her this would be easy he loved the islands whatre you drinking he asked gin and tonic twist of lime he left for the bar and returned with the drinks he moved his chair closer to her now their legs were touching the breasts were resting comfortably on the table he looked down between them are you alone obvious question but he had to ask it yeah you yeah do you have plans for dinner not really good theres this great cookout there at the palms beginning at six the best seafood on the island good music rum punch the works no dress code im game they moved closer together and his hand was suddenly between her knees his elbow nestled next to her left breast and he smiled she smiled this was not altogether unpleasant she thought but there was business at hand the barefoot boys began to tune up and the festival began beachcombers from all directions flocked to the palms natives in white jackets and white shorts lined up folding tables and laid heavy cotton cloths over them the smell of boiled shrimp and grilled amberjack and barbecued shark filled the beach the lovebirds avery and libby walked hand in hand into the courtyard of the palms and lined up for the buffet for three hours they dined and danced drank and danced and fell madly in heat over each other once he became drunk she returned to straight club soda business was at hand by ten he was sloppy and she led him away from the dance floor to the condo next door he attacked her at the front door and they kissed and groped for five minutes he managed the key and they were inside one more drink she said ever the party girl he went to the bar and fixed her a gin and tonic he was drinking scotch and water they sat on the balcony outside the master bedroom and watched a halfmoon decorate the gentle sea she had matched him drink for drink he thought and if she could handle another then so could he but nature was calling again and he excused himself the scotch and water sat on the wicker table between them and she smiled at it much easier than she had prayed for she took a small plastic packet from the orange strap between her legs and dumped one capsule of chloral hydrate into his drink she sipped her gin and tonic drink it up big boy she said when he returned im ready for bed he grabbed his whiskey and gulped it down the taste buds had been numb for hours he took another swallow then began to relax another swallow his head wobbled from shoulder to shoulder and finally his chin hit his chest the breathing became heavy sleep well lover boy she said to herself with a man of a hundred eighty pounds one shot of chloral hydrate would induce a dead sleep for ten hours she took his glass and gauged what was left not much eight hours to be safe she rolled him out of the chair and dragged him to the bed head first then feet very gently she pulled his yellowandblue surfer shorts down his legs and laid them on the floor she stared for a long second then tucked the sheets and blankets around him she kissed him good night on the dresser she found two key rings eleven keys downstairs in the hall between the kitchen and the great room with a view of the beach she found the mysterious locked door mitch had found in november he had paced off every room upstairs and down and determined this room to be at least fifteen by fifteen it was suspicious because the door was metal and because it was locked and because a small storage sign was affixed to it it was the only labeled room in the condo a week earlier in unit b he and abby had found no such room one key ring held a key to a mercedes two keys to the bendini building a house key two apartment keys and a desk key the keys on the other ring were unmarked and fairly generic she tried it first and the fourth key fit she held her breath and opened the door no electric shocks no alarms nothing mitch told her to open the door wait five minutes and if nothing happened then turn on the light she waited ten minutes ten long and frightful minutes mitch had speculated that unit a was used by the partners and trusted guests and that unit b was used by the associates and others who required constant surveillance thus he hoped unit a would not be laden with wires and cameras and recorders and alarms after ten minutes she opened the door wide and turned on the light she waited again and heard nothing the room was square about fifteen by fifteen with white walls no carpet and as she counted twelve fireproof legalsize file cabinets slowly she walked over to one and pulled the top drawer it was unlocked she turned off the light closed the door and returned to the bedroom upstairs where avery was now comatose and snoring loudly it was tenthirty she would work like crazy for eight hours and quit at six in the morning near a desk in a corner three large briefcases sat neatly in a row she grabbed them turned off the lights and left through the front door the small parking lot was dark and empty with a gravel drive leading to the highway a sidewalk ran next to the shrubbery in front of both units and stopped at a white board fence along the property line a gate led to a slight grassy knoll with the first building of the palms just over it it was a short walk from the condos to the palms but the briefcases had grown much heavier when she reached room it was on the first floor front side with a view of the pool but not of the beach she was panting and sweating when she knocked on the door abby yanked it open she took the briefcases and placed them on the bed any problems not yet i think hes dead tammy wiped her face with a towel and opened a can of coke where is he abby was all business no smiles in his bed i figure weve got eight hours until six did you get in the room abby asked as she handed her a pair of shorts and a bulky cotton shirt yeah theres a dozen big file cabinets unlocked a few cardboard boxes and other junk but not much else a dozen yeah tall ones all legal size well be lucky to finish by six it was a single motel room with a queensize bed the sofa coffee table and bed were pushed to the wall and a canon model copier with automatic feed and collator sat in the center with engines running on lease from island office supply it came at the scalpers price of three hundred dollars for twentyfour hours delivered it was the newest and largest rental copier on the island the salesman had explained and he was not excited about parting with it for only a day but abby charmed him and began laying hundreddollar bills on the counter two cases of copy paper ten thousand sheets sat next to the bed they opened the first briefcase and removed six thin files same type of files tammy mumbled to herself she unhitched the twoprong clasp on the inside of the file and removed the papers mitch says theyre very particular about their files tammy explained as she unstapled a tenpage document he says lawyers have a sixth sense and can almost smell if a secretary or a clerk has been in a file so youll have to be careful work slowly copy one document and when you restaple it try to line up with the old staple holes its tedious copy only one document at a time regardless of the number of pages then put it back together slowly and in order then staple your copy so everything stays in order with the automatic feed the tenpage document took eight seconds pretty fast tammy said the first briefcase was finished in twenty minutes tammy handed the two key rings to abby and picked up two new empty allcanvas samsonite handbags she left for the condo abby followed her out the door then locked it she walked to the front of the palms to tammys rented nissan stanza dodging at oncoming traffic from the wrong side of the road she drove along seven mile beach and into georgetown two blocks behind the stately swiss bank building on a narrow street lined with neat frame houses she found the one owned by the only locksmith on the island of grand cayman at least he was the only one shed been able to locate without assistance he owned a green house with open windows and white trim around the shutters and the doors she parked in the street and walked through the sand to the tiny front porch where the locksmith and his neighbors were drinking and listening to radio cayman solidgold reggae they quietened when she approached and none of them stood it was almost eleven he had said that he would do the job in his shop out back and that his fees were modest and that he would like a fifth of myerss rum as a down payment before he started mr dantley im sorry im late ive brought you a little gift she held out the fifth of rum mr dantley emerged from the darkness and took the rum he inspected the bottle boys a bottle of myerss abby could not understand the chatter but it was obvious the gang on the porch was terribly excited about the bottle of myerss dantley handed it to them and led abby behind his house to a small outbuilding full of tools and small machines and a hundred gadgets a single yellow light bulb hung from the ceiling and attracted mosquitoes by the hundreds she handed dantley the eleven keys and he carefully laid them on a bare section of a cluttered workbench this will be easy he said without looking up although he was drinking at eleven at night dantley appeared to be in control perhaps his system had built an immunity to rum he worked through a pair of thick goggles drilling and carving each replica after twenty minutes he was finished he handed abby the two original sets of keys and their copies thank you mr dantley how much do i owe you they were quite easy he drawled a dollar per key she paid him quickly and left tammy filled the two small suitcases with the contents of the top drawer of the first file cabinet five drawers twelve cabinets sixty trips to the copier and back in eight hours it could be done there were files notebooks computer printouts and more files mitch said to copy it all he was not exactly sure what he was looking for so copy it all she turned off the light and ran upstairs to check on lover boy he had not moved the snoring was in slow motion the samsonites weighed thirty pounds apiece and her arms ached when she reached room first trip tut of sixty she would not make it abby had not returned from georgetown so tammy unloaded the suitcases neatly on the bed she took one drink from her coke and left with the empty bags back to the condo drawer two was identical she fitted the files in order into the suitcases and strongarmed zippers she was sweating and gasping for breath four packs a day she thought she vowed to cut back to two maybe even one pack up the stairs to check on him he had not breathed since her last trip the copier was clicking and humming when she returned from trip two abby was finishing the second briefcase about to start on the third did you get the keys tammy asked yeah no problem whats your man doing if the copier wasnt running you could hear him snoring tammy unpacked into another neat stack on the bed she wiped her face with a wet towel and left for the condo abby finished the third briefcase and started on the stacks from the file cabinets she quickly got the hang of the automatic feed and after thirty minutes she moved with the efficient grace of a seasoned copyroom clerk she fed copies and unstapled and restapled while the machine clicked rapidly and spat the reproductions through the collator tammy arrived from trip three out of breath and with sweat dripping from her nose third drawer she reported hes still snoring she unzipped the suitcases and made another neat pile on the bed she caught her breath wiped her face and loaded the now copied contents of drawer one into the bags for the rest of the night she would be loaded coming and going at midnight the barefoot boys sang their last song and the palms settled down for the night the quiet hum of the copier could not be heard outside room the door was kept locked the shades pulled tightly and all lights extinguished except for a lamp near the bed no one noticed the tired lady dripping with sweat lugging the same two suitcases to and from the room after midnight they did not speak they were tired too busy and scared and there was nothing to report except lover boys movements in bed if any and there was none until around am when he subconsciously rolled onto his side where he stayed for about twenty minutes then returned to his back tammy checked on him with each visit and asked herself each time what she would do if his eyes suddenly opened and he attacked she had a small tube of mace in her shorts pocket just in case a confrontation occurred and escape became necessary mitch had been vague on the details of such an escape just dont lead him back to the motel room he said hit him with the mace then run like crazy and scream rape but after twentyfive trips she became convinced he was hours away from consciousness and it was bad enough hiking like a pack mule to and from but she also had to climb the stairs fourteen of them each trip to check on casanova so she went to check every other trip then one out of three by am halfway through the project they had copied the contents from five of the file cabinets they had made over four thousand copies and the bed was covered with neat little stacks of materials their copies stood along the wall next to the sofa in seven even rows almost waist high they rested for fifteen minutes at fivethirty the first flicker of sunrise rose in the east and they forgot about being tired abby quickened her movements around the copier and hoped it would not burn up tammy rubbed the cramps in her calves and walked quickly back to the condo it was either trip number fiftyone or fiftytwo she had lost count it would be her last trip for a while he was waiting she opened the door and went straight to the storage room as usual she set the packed samsonites on the floor as usual she quietly walked up the stairs into the bedroom and froze avery was sitting on the edge of the bed facing the balcony he heard her and turned slowly to face her his eyes were swollen and glazed he scowled at her instinctively she unbuttoned the khaki shorts and they fell to the floor hey big boy she said trying to breathe normally and act like a party girl she walked to the edge of the bed where he was sitting youre up kinda early lets get some more sleep his gaze returned to the window he said nothing she sat beside him and rubbed the inside of his thigh she slid her hand up the inside of his leg and he did not move are you awake she asked no response avery talk to me baby lets get some more sleep its still dark out there he fell sideways onto his pillow he grunted no attempt at speech just a grunt then he closed his eyes she lifted his legs onto the bed and covered him again she sat by him for ten minutes and when the snoring returned to its former intensity she slid into the shorts and ran to the palms he woke up abby she reported in panic he woke up then passed out again abby stopped and stared both women looked at the bed which was covered with uncopied documents okay take a quick shower abby said coolly then go get in bed with him and wait lock the door to the storage room and call me when he wakes up and gets in the shower ill keep copying whats left and well try to move it later after he goes to work thats awfully risky its all risky hurry five minutes later tammydorislibby with the bright orange string bikini made another tripwithout the suitcasesto the condo she locked the front door and the storage door and went to the bedroom she removed the orange top and crawled under the covers the snoring kept her awake for fifteen minutes then she dozed she sat up in bed to prevent sleep she was scared sitting there in bed with a nude man who would kill her if he knew her tired body relaxed and sleep became unavoidable she dozed again lover boy broke from his coma at three minutes past nine he moaned loudly and rolled to the edge of the bed his eyelids were stuck together they opened slowly and the bright sun came piercing through he moaned again the head weighed a hundred pounds and rocked awkwardly from right to left shifting the brain violently each time he breathed deeply and the fresh oxygen went screaming through his temples his right hand caught his attention he tried to raise it but the nerve impulses would not penetrate the brain slowly it went up and he squinted at it he tried to focus with the right eye first then the left the clock he looked at the digital clock for thirty seconds before he could decipher the red numbers nineohfive damn he was expected at the bank at nine he moaned the woman she had felt him move and heard his sounds and she lay still with her eyes shut she prayed he would not touch her she felt him staring for this career rogue and bad boy there had been many hangovers but none like this he looked at her face and tried to remember how good she had been he could always remember that if nothing else regardless of the size of the hangover he could always remember the women he watched her for a moment then gave it up damn he said as he stood and tried to walk his feet were like lead boots and only reluctantly complied with his wishes he braced himself against the sliding door to the balcony the bathroom was twenty feet away and he decided to go for it the desk and dresser served as braces one painful clumsy step after another and he finally made it he hovered above the toilet and relieved himself she rolled to face the balcony and when he finished she felt him sit on her side of the bed he gently touched her shoulder libby wake up he shook her and she bolted stiff wake up dear he said a gentleman she gave him her best sleepy smile the morningafter smile of fulfillment and commitment the scarlett ohara smile the morning after rhett nailed her you were great big boy she cooed with her eyes closed in spite of the pain and nausea in spite of the lead boots and bowlingball head he was proud of himself the woman was impressed suddenly he remembered that he was great last night look libby weve overslept i gotta go to work im already late not in the mood huh she giggled she prayed he wasnt in the mood naw not now how about tonight ill be here big boy good i gotta take a shower wake me up when you get out he stood and mumbled something then locked the bathroom door she slid across the bed to the phone and called abby after three rings she answered hes in the shower are you okay yeah fine he couldnt do it if he had to what took so long he wouldnt wake up is he suspicious no he remembers nothing i think hes in pain how long will you be there ill kiss him goodbye when he gets out of the shower ten maybe fifteen minutes okay hurry abby hung up and tammy slid to her side of the bed in the attic above the kitchen a recorder clicked reset itself and was ready for the next call by tenthirty they were ready for the final assault on the condo the contraband was divided into three equal parts three daring raids in open daylight tammy slid the shiny new keys into her blouse pocket and took off with the suitcases she walked quickly her eyes darting in all directions behind the sunglasses the parking lot in front of the condos was still empty traffic was light on the highway the new key fit and she was inside the key to the storage door also fit and five minutes later she left the condo the second and third trips were equally quick and uneventful when she left the storage room for the last time she studied it carefully everything was in order just as she found it she locked the condo and took the empty wellworn samsonites back to her room for an hour they lay beside each other on the bed and laughed at avery and his hangover it was over now for the most part and they had committed the perfect crime and lover boy was a willing but ignorant participant it had been easy they decided the small mountain of evidence filled eleven and a half corrugated storage boxes at twothirty a native with a straw hat and no shirt knocked on the door and announced he was from an outfit called cayman storage abby pointed at the boxes with no place to go and no hurry to get there he took the first box and ever so slowly carried it to his van like all the natives he operated on cayman time no hurry mon they followed him in the stanza to a warehouse in georgetown abby inspected the proposed storage room and paid cash for three months rental wayne tarrance sat on the back row of the pm greyhound from louisville to indianapolis to chicago although he sat by himself the bus was crowded it was friday night the bus left kentucky thirty minutes earlier and by now he was convinced something had gone wrong thirty minutes and not a word or signal from anyone maybe it was the wrong bus maybe mcdeere had changed his mind maybe a lot of things the rear seat was inches above the diesel engine and wayne tarrance of the bronx now knew why greyhound frequent milers fought for the seats just behind the driver his louis lamour vibrated until he had a headache thirty minutes nothing the toilet flushed across the aisle and the door flew open the odor filtered out and tarrance looked away to the southbound traffic from nowhere she slid into the aisle seat and cleared her throat tarrance jerked to his right and there she was hed seen her before somewhere are you mr tarrance she wore jeans white cotton sneakers and a heavy green rag sweater she hid behind dark glasses yeah and you she grabbed his hand and shook it firmly abby mcdeere i was expecting your husband i know he decided not to come and so here i am well uh i sort of wanted to talk to him yes but he sent me just think of me as his agent tarrance laid his paperback under the seat and watched the highway where is he why is that important mr tarrance he sent me to talk business and youre here to talk business so lets talk okay keep your voice down and if anybody comes down the aisle grab my hand and stop talking act like were married or something okay now mr voylesdo you know who he is i know everything mr tarrance good mr voyles is about to stroke out because we havent got mitchs files yet the good files you understand why theyre important dont you very much so so we want the files and we want a million dollars yes thats the deal but we get the files first no thats not the deal the deal mr tarrance is that we get the million dollars exactly where we want it then we hand over the files you dont trust us thats correct we dont trust you voyles or anyone else the money is to be deposited by wire transfer to a certain numbered account in a bank in freeport bahamas we will immediately be notified and the money will then be wired by us to another bank once we have it where we want it the files are yours where are the files in a ministorage in memphis there are fiftyone files in all all boxed up real neat and proper like youll be impressed we do good work we have you seen the files of course helped box them up there are these surprises in box number eight okay what mitch was able to copy three of avery tolars files and they appear to be questionable two deal with a company called dunn lane ltd which we know to be a mafiacontrolled corporation chartered in the caymans it was established with ten million laundered dollars in the files deal with two construction projects financed by the corporation youll find it fascinating reading how do you know it was chartered in the caymans and how do you know about the ten million surely thats not in the files no its not we have other records tarrance thought about the other records for six miles it was obvious he wouldnt see them until the mcdeeres had the first million he let it pass im not sure we can wire the money as you wish without first getting the files it was a rather weak bluff she read it perfectly and smiled do we have to play games mr tarrance why dont you just give us the mbney and quit sparring a foreign student of some sort probably an arab sauntered down the aisle and into the rest room tarrance froze and stared at the window abby patted his arm like a real girlfriend the flushing sounded like a short waterfall how soon can this happen tarrance asked she was not touching him anymore the files are ready how soon can you round up a million bucks tomorrow abby looked out the window and talked from the left corner of her mouth todays friday next tuesday at ten am eastern time bahamas time you transfer by wire the million dollars from your account at the chemical bank in manhattan to a numbered account at the ontario bank in freeport its a clean legitimate wire transfertake about fifteen seconds tarrance frowned and listened hard what if we dont have an account at the chemical bank in manhattan you dont now but you will monday im sure youve got someone in washington who can handle a simple wire transfer im sure we do good but why the chemical bank mitchs orders mr tarrance trust him he knows what hes doing i see hes done his homework he always does his homework and theres something you need to always remember hes much smarter than you are tarrance snorted and faked a light chuckle they rode in silence for a mile or two each thinking of the next question and answer okay tarrance said almost to himself and when do we get the files when the moneys safe in freeport well be notified wednesday morning before tenthirty youll receive at your memphis office a federal express package with a note and the key to the ministorage so i can tell mr voyles well have the files by wednesday afternoon she shrugged and said nothing tarrance felt stupid for asking the question quickly he thought of a good one well need the account number in freeport its written down ill give it to you when the bus stops the particulars were now complete he reached under the seat and retrieved his book he nipped pages and pretended to read just sit here a minute he said any questions she asked yeah can we talk about these other records you mentioned sure where are they good question the way the deal was explained to me we would first get the next installment a half million i believe in return for enough evidence to allow you to obtain the indictments these other records are part of the next installment tarrance flipped a page you mean youve already obtained the uh dirty files we have most of what we need yes we have a bunch of dirty files where are they she smiled softly and patted his arm i assure you theyre not in the ministorage with the clean files but you have possession of them sort of would you like to see a couple he closed the book and breathed deeply he looked at her certainly i thought so mitch says well give you ten inches of documents on dunn lane ltdcopies of bank records corporate charters minutes bylaws officers stockholders wiretransfer records letters from nathan locke to joey morolto working papers a hundred other juicy morsels thatll make you lose sleep wonderful stuff mitch says you can probably get thirty indictments just from the dunn lane records tarrance hung on every word and believed her when can i see it he asked quietly but so eagerly when ray is out of prison its part of the deal remember aw yes ray aw yes he goes over the wall mr tarrance or you can forget the bendini firm mitch and i will take our paltry million and disappear into the night im working on it better work hard it was more than a threat and he knew it he opened the book again and stared at it abby pulled a bendini lambert locke business card from her pocket and dropped it on the book on the back she had written the account number dl ontario bank freeport im going back to my seat near the front away from the engine are we clear about next tuesday no problems mon are you getting off in indianapolis yes where are you going to my parents home in kentucky mitch and i are separated she was gone tammy stood in one of a dozen long hot lines at miami customs she wore shorts sandals halter top sunglasses and a straw hat and looked just like the other thousand weary tourists returning from the sundrenched beaches of the caribbean in front of her were two illtempered newlyweds carrying bags of dutyfree liquor and perfume and obviously in the middle of a serious disagreement behind her were two brandnew hartman leather suitcases filled with enough documents and records to indict forty lawyers her employer also a lawyer had suggested she purchase luggage with little wheels on the bottom so they could be pulled through the miami international airport she also had a small overnight bag with a few clothes and a toothbrush to look legitimate about every ten minutes the young couple moved forward six inches and tammy followed with her baggage an hour after she entered the line she made it to the checkpoint no declarations the agent snapped in broken english no she snapped back he nodded at the big leather bags whats in there papers papers papers what kind of papers toilet paper she thought i spend my vacations traveling the caribbean collecting toilet paper legal documents crap like that im a lawyer yeah yeah he unzipped the overnight bag and glanced in okay next she carefully pulled the bags just so they were inclined to tip over a bellboy grabbed them and loaded all three pieces onto a twowheeler delta flight to nashville gate concourse b she said as she handed him a fivedollar bill tammy and all three bags arrived in nashville at midnight saturday she loaded them into her rabbit and left the airport in the suburb of brentwood she parked in her designated parking place and one at a time pulled the hartmans into a onebedroom apartment except for a rented foldaway sofa there was no furniture she unpacked the suitcases in the bedroom and began the tedious process of arranging the evidence mitch wanted a list of each document each bank record each corporation he wanted it just so he said one day he would pass through in a great hurry and he wanted it all organized for two hours she took inventory she sat on the floor and made careful notes after three oneday trips to grand cayman the room was beginning to fill monday she would leave again she felt like shed slept three hours in the past two weeks but it was urgent he said a matter of life and death tarry ross alias alfred sat in the darkest corner of the lounge of the washington phoenix park hotel the meeting would be terribly brief he drank coffee and waited on his guest he waited and vowed to wait only five more minutes the cup shook when he tried to sip it coffee splashed on the table he looked at the table and tried desperately not to look around he waited his guest arrived from nowhere and sat with his back to the wall his name was vinnie cozzo a thug from new york from the palumbo family vinnie noticed the shaking cup and the spilled coffee relax alfred this place is dark enough what do you want alfred hissed i wanna drink no time for drinks im leaving settle down alfred relax pal there aint three people in here what do you want he hissed again just a little information itll cost you it always does a waiter ventured by and vinnie ordered chivas and water hows my pal denton voyles vinnie asked kiss my ass cozzo im leaving im walking outta here okay pal relax i just need some info make it quick alfred scanned the lounge his cup was empty most of it on the table the chivas arrived and vinnie took a good drink gotta little situation down in memphis some of the boysre sorta worried about it ever hear of the bendini firm instinctively alfred shook his head in the negative always say no at first then after careful digging return with a nice little report and say yes yes hed heard of the bendini firm and their prized client operation laundromat voyles himself had named it and was so proud of his creativity vinnie took another good drink well theres a guy down there named mcdeere mitchell mcdeere who works for this bendini firm and we suspect hes also playing grabass with your people know what i mean we think hes selling info on bendini to the feds just need to know if its true thats all alfred listened with a straight face although it was not easy he knew mcdeeres blood type and his favorite restaurant in memphis he knew that mcdeere had talked to tarrance half a dozen times now and that tomorrow tuesday mcdeere would become a millionaire piece of cake ill see what i can do lets talk money vinnie lit a salem light well alfred its a serious matter i aint gonna lie two hundred thousand cash alfred dropped the cup he pulled a handkerchief from his rear pocket and furiously rubbed his glasses two hundred cash thats what i said whatd we pay you last time seventyfive see what i mean its pretty damned serious alfred can you do it yes when give me two weeks a week before april the workaholics at bendini lambert locke reached maximum stress and ran at full throttle on nothing but adrenaline and fear fear of missing a deduction or a writeoff or some extra depreciation that would cost a rich client an extra million or so fear of picking up the phone and calling the client and informing him that the return was now finished and sorry to say an extra eight hundred thousand was due fear of not finishing by the fifteenth and being forced to file extensions and incurring penalties and interest the parking lot was full by am the secretaries worked twelve hours a day tempers were short talk was scarce and hurried with no wife to go home to mitch worked around the clock sonny capps had cursed and berated avery because he owed on earned income of six million avery had cursed mitch and together they plowed through the capps files again digging and cursing mitch created two very questionable writeoffs that lowered it to capps said he was considering a new tax firm one in washington with six days to go capps demanded a meeting with avery in houston the lear was available and avery left at midnight mitch drove him to the airport receiving instructions along the way shortly after am he returned to the office three mercedeses a bmw and a jaguar were scattered through the parking lot the security guard opened the rear door and mitch rode the elevator to the fourth floor as usual avery locked his office door the partners doors were always locked at the end of the hall a voice could be heard victor milligan head of tax sat at his desk and said ugly things to his computer the other offices were dark and locked mitch held his breath and stuck a key into averys door the knob turned and he was inside he switched on all the lights and went to the small conference table where he and his partner had spent the day and most of the night files were stacked like bricks around the chairs papers thrown here and there irs reg books were piled on top of each other mitch sat at the table and continued his research for capps according to the fbi notebook capps was a legitimate businessman who had used for at least eight years the fibbies werent interested in sonny capps after an hour the talking stopped and milligan closed and locked the door he took the stairs without saying good night mitch quickly checked each office on the fourth floor then the third all empty it was almost am next to the bookshelves on one wall of averys office four solidoak file cabinets sat undisturbed mitch had noticed them for months but had never seen them used the active files were kept in three metal cabinets next to the window secretaries dug through these usually while avery yelled at them he locked the door behind him and walked to the oak cabinets locked of course he had narrowed it down to two small keys each less than an inch long the first one fit the first cabinet and he opened it from tammys inventory of the contraband in nashville he had memorized many of the names of the cayman companies operating with dirty money that was now clean he thumbed through the files in the top drawer and the names jumped at him dunn lane ltd eastpointe ltd virgin bay ltd inland contractors ltd gulfsouth ltd he found more familiar names in the second and third drawers the files were filled with loan documents from cayman banks wiretransfer records warranty deeds leases mortgage deeds and a thousand other papers he was particularly interested in dunn lane and gulfsouth tammy had recorded a significant number of documents for these two companies he picked out a gulfsouth file full of wiretransfer records and loan documents from the royal bank of montreal he walked to a copier in the center of the fourth floor and turned it on while it warmed he casually glanced around the place was dead he looked along the ceilings no cameras he had checked it many times before the access number light flashed and he punched in the file number for mrs lettie plunk her tax return was sitting on his desk on the second floor and it could spare a few copies he laid the contents on the automatic feed and three minutes later the file was copied one hundred twentyeight copies charged to lettie plunk back to the file cabinet back to the copier with another stack of gulfsouth evidence he punched in the access number for the file of greenmark partners a real estate development company in bartlett tennessee legitimate folks the tax return was sitting on his desk and could spare a few copies ninetyone to be exact mitch had eighteen tax returns sitting in his office waiting to be signed and filed with six days to go he had finished his deadline work all eighteen received automatic billings for copies of gulfsouth and dunn lane evidence he had scribbled their access numbers on a sheet of notepaper and it sat on the table next to the copier after using the eighteen numbers he accessed with three numbers borrowed from lamars files and three numbers borrowed from the capps files a wire ran from the copier through a hole in the wall and down the inside of a closet where it connected with wires from three other copiers on the fourth floor the wire larger now ran down through the ceiling and along a baseboard to the billing room on the third floor where a computer recorded and billed every copy made within an innocuouslooking little gray wire ran from the computer up a wall and through the ceiling to the fourth floor and then up to the fifth where another computer recorded the access code the number of copies and the location of the machine making each copy at pm april bendini lambert locke shut down by six the parking lot was empty and the expensive automobiles reassembled two miles away behind a venerable seafood establishment called andertons a small banquet room was reserved for the annual april blowout every associate and active partner was present along with eleven retired partners the retirees were tanned and well rested the actives were haggard and frayed but they were all in a festive spirit ready to get plastered the stringent rules of clean living and moderation would be forgotten this night another firm rule prohibited any lawyer or secretary from working on april platters of cold boiled shrimp and raw oysters sat on tables along the walls a huge wooden barrel filled with ice and cold moosehead greeted them ten cases stood behind the barrel roosevelt popped tops as quickly as possible late in the night he would get drunk with the rest of them and oliver lambert would call a taxi to haul him home to jessie frances it was a ritual roosevelts cousin little bobby blue baker sat at a baby grand and sang sadly as the lawyers filed in for now he was the entertainment later he would not be needed mitch ignored the food and took an icy green bottle to a table near the piano lamar followed with two pounds of shrimp they watched their colleagues shake off coats and ties and attack the moosehead get em all finished lamar asked devouring the shrimp yeah i finished mine yesterday avery and i worked on sonny cappss until five pm its finished how much quarter of a mill ouch lamar turned up the bottle and drained half of it hes never paid that much has he no and hes furious i dont understand the guy he cleared six million from all sorts of ventures and hes mad as hell because he had to pay five percent in taxes hows avery somewhat worried capps made him fly to houston last week and it did not go well he left on the lear at midnight told me later capps was waiting at his office at four in the morning furious over his tax mess blamed it all on avery said he might change firms i think he says that all the time you need a beer lamar left and returned with four mooseheads hows abbys mom mitch borrowed a shrimp and peeled it shes okay for now they removed a lung and hows abby lamar was watching his friend and not eating mitch started another beer shes fine look mitch our kids go to st andrews its no secret abby took a leave of absence shes been gone for two weeks we know it and were concerned things will work out she wants to spend a little time away its no big deal really come on mitch its a big deal when your wife leaves home without saying when shell return at least thats what she told the headmaster at school thats true she doesnt know when shell come back probably a month or so shes had a hard time coping with the hours at the office the lawyers were all present and accounted for so roosevelt shut the door the room became noisier bobby blue took requests have you thought about slowing down lamar asked no not really why should i look mitch im your friend right im worried about you you cant make a million bucks the first year oh yeah he thought i made a million bucks last week in ten seconds the little account in freeport jumped from ten thousand to a million ten thousand and fifteen minutes later the account was closed and the money was resting safely in a bank in switzerland ah the wonder of wire transfer and because of the million bucks this would be the first and only april party of his short but distinguished legal career and his good friend who is so concerned about his marriage will most likely be in jail before long along with everyone else in the room except for roosevelt hell tarrance might get so excited hell indict roosevelt and jessie frances just for the fun of it then the trials i mitchell y mcdeere do solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god and hed sit in the witness chair and point the finger at his good friend lamar quin and kay and the kids would be sitting in the front row for jury appeal crying softly he finished the second beer and started the third i know lamar but i have no plans to slow down abby will adjust thingsll be fine if you say so kay wants you over tomorrow for a big steak well cook on the grill and eat on the patio how about it yes on one condition no discussion about abby she went home to see her mother and shell be back okay fine sure avery sat across the table with a plate of shrimp he began peeling them we were just discussing capps lamar said thats not a pleasant subject avery replied mitch watched the shrimp intently until there was a little pile of about six freshly peeled he grabbed them across the table and shoved the handful into his mouth avery glared at him with tired sad eyes red eyes he struggled for something appropriate then began eating the unpeeled shrimp i wish the heads were still on them he said between bites much better with the heads mitch raked across two handfuls and began crunching i like the tails myself always been a tail man lamar stopped eating and gawked at them you must be kidding nope said avery when i was a kid in el paso we used to go out with our nets and scoop up a bunch of fresh shrimp wed eat em on the spot while they were still wiggling chomp chomp the heads are the best part because of all the brain juices shrimp in el paso yeah rio grandes full of them lamar left for another round of beer the wear tear stress and fatigue mixed quickly with the alcohol and the room became rowdier bobby blue was playing steppenwolf even nathan locke was smiling and talking loudly just one of the boys roosevelt added five cases to the barrel of ice at ten the singing started wally hudson minus the bow tie stood on a chair by the piano and led the howling chorus through a riotous medley of australian drinking songs the restaurant was closed now so who cared kendall mahan was next he had played rugby at cornell and had an amazing repertoire of raunchy beer songs fifty untalented and drunk voices sang happily along with him mitch excused himself and went to the rest room a busboy unlocked the rear door and he was in the parking lot the singing was pleasant at this distance he started for his car but instead walked to a window he stood in the dark next to the corner of the building and watched and listened kendall was now on the piano leading his choir through an obscene refrain joyous voices of rich and happy people he studied them one at a time around the tables their faces were red their eyes were glowing they were his friendsfamily men with wives and childrenall caught up in this terrible conspiracy last year joe hodge and marty kozinski were singing with the rest of them last year he was a hotshot harvard man with job offers in every pocket now he was a millionaire and would soon have a price on his head funny what a year can do sing on brothers mitch turned and walked away around midnight the taxis lined up on madison and the richest lawyers in town were carried and dragged into the back seats of course oliver lambert was the soberest of the lot and he directed the evacuation fifteen taxis in all with drunk lawyers lying everywhere at the same time across town on front street two identical navyblueandyellow ford vans with dustbusters painted brightly on the sides pulled up to the gate dutch hendrix opened it and waved them through they backed up to the rear door and eight women with matching shirts began unloading vacuum cleaners and buckets filled with spray bottles they unloaded brooms and mops and rolls of paper towels they chattered quietly among themselves as they went through the building as directed from above the technicians cleaned one floor at a time beginning with the fourth the guards walked the floors and watched them carefully the women ignored them and buzzed about their business of emptying garbage cans polishing furniture vacuuming and scrubbing bathrooms the new girl was slower than the others she noticed things she pulled on desk drawers and file cabinets when the guards werent looking she paid attention it was her third night on the job and she was learning her way around shed found the tolar office on the fourth floor the first night and smiled to herself she wore dirty jeans and ragged tennis shoes the blue dustbusters shirt was extra large to hide the figure and make her appear plump like the other technicians the patch above the pocket read doris doris the cleaning technician when the crew was half finished with the second floor a guard told doris and two others susie and charlotte to follow him he inserted a key in the elevator panel and it stopped in the basement he unlocked a heavy metal door and they walked into a large room divided into a dozen cubicles each small desk was cluttered and dominated by a large computer there were terminals everywhere black file cabinets lined the walls no windows the supplies are in there the guard said pointing to a closet they pulled out a vacuum cleaner and spray bottles and went to work dont touch the desks he said mitch tied the laces of his nike air cushion jogging shoes and sat on the sofa waiting by the phone hearsay depressed after two weeks without the woman around sat next to him and tried to doze at exactly tenthirty it rang it was abby there was no mushy sweethearts and babes and honeys the dialogue was cool and forced hows your mother he asked doing much better shes up and around but very sore her spirits are good thats good to hear and your dad the same always busy hows my

eight laps be careful at the track its awfully dark thanks another long pause i need to go she said moms ready for bed will you call tomorrow night yes same time she hung up without a goodbye or i love you or anything just hung up mitch pulled on his white athletic socks and tucked in his white longsleeved tshirt he locked the kitchen door and trotted down the dark street west junior high school was six blocks to the east of east meadowbrook behind the redbrick classrooms and gymnasium was the baseball field and farther away at the end of a dark driveway was the football field a cinder track circled the field and was a favorite of local joggers but not at pm especially with no moon the track was deserted and that was fine with mitch the spring air was light and cool and he finished the first mile in eight minutes he began walking a lap as he passed the aluminum bleachers on the home side he saw someone from the corner of his eye he kept walking pssssssst mitch stopped yeah who is it a hoarse scratchy voice replied joey morolto mitch started for the bleachers very funny tarrance am i clean sure youre clean laneys sitting up there in a school bus with a flashlight he flashed green when you passed and if you see something red flash get back to the track and make like carl lewis they walked to the top of the bleachers and into the unlocked press box they sat on stools in the dark and watched the school the buses were parked in perfect order along the driveway is this private enough for you mitch asked itll do whos the girl i know you prefer to meet in daylight preferably where a crowd has gathered say like a fastfood joint or a korean shoe store but i like these places better great whos the girl pretty clever huh good idea who is she an employee of mine whered you find her what difference does it make why are you always asking questions that are irrelevant irrelevant i get a call today from some woman ive never met tells me she needs to talk to me about a little matter at the bendini building says we gotta change phones instructs me to go to a certain pay phone outside a certain grocery store and be there at a certain time and shell call exactly at onethirty and i go there and she calls at exactly onethirty keep in mind ive got three men within a hundred feet of the phone watching everybody that moves and she tells me to be here at exactly ten fortyfive tonight to have the place sealed off and that youll come trotting by worked didnt it yeah so far but who is she i mean now you got someone else involved and that really worries me mcdeere who is she and how much does she know trust me tarrance shes my employee and she knows everything in fact if you knew what she knows youd be serving indictments right now instead of sitting here bitching about her tarrance breathed deeply and thought about it okay so tell me what she knows she knows that in the last three years the morolto gang and its accomplices have taken over eight hundred million bucks in cash out of this country and deposited it in various banks in the caribbean she knows which banks which accounts the dates a bunch of stuff she knows that the moroltos control at least three hundred and fifty companies chartered in the caymans and that these companies regularly send clean money back into the country she knows the dates and amounts of the wire transfers she knows of at least forty us corporations owned by cayman corporations owned by the moroltos she knows a helluva lot tarrance shes a very knowledgeable woman dont you think tarrance could not speak he stared fiercely into the darkness up the driveway mitch found it enjoyable she knows how they take their dirty cash trade it up to onehundreddollar bills and sneak it out of the country how lear of course but they also mule it theyve got a small army of mules usually their minimumwage thugs and their girlfriends but also students and other freelancers and theyll give them ninetyeight hundred in cash and buy them a ticket to the caymans or the bahamas no declarations are required for amounts under ten thousand you understand and the mules will fly down like regular tourists with pockets full of cash and take the money to their banks doesnt sound like much money but you get three hundred people making twenty trips a year and thats some serious cash walking out of the country its also called smurfing you know tarrance nodded slightly as if he knew a lot of folks wanna be smurfers when they can get free vacations and spending money then theyve got their super mules these are the trusted morolto people who take a million bucks in cash wrap it up real neat in newspaper so the airport machines wont see it put it in big briefcases and walk it onto the planes like everybody else they wear coats and ties and look like wall streeters or they wear sandals and straw hats and mule it in carryon bags you guys catch them occasionally about one percent of the time i believe and when that happens the super mules go to jail but they never talk do they tarrance and every now and then a smurfer will start thinking about all this money in his briefcase and how easy it would be just to keep flying and enjoy all the money himself and hell disappear but the mob never forgets and it may take a year or two but theyll find him somewhere the money be gone of course but then so will he the mob never forgets does it tarrance just like they wont forget about me tarrance listened until it was obvious he needed to say something you got your million bucks appreciate it im almost ready for the next installment almost yeah me and the girl have a couple more jobs to pull were trying to get a few more records out of front street how many documents do you have over ten thousand the lower jaw collapsed and the mouth fell open he stared at mitch damn whered they come from another one of your questions ten thousand documents said tarrance at least ten thousand bank records wiretransfer records corporate charters corporate loan documents internal memos correspondence between all sorts of people a lot of good stuff tarrance your wife mentioned a company called dunn lane ltd weve reviewed the files youve already given us pretty good material what else do you know about it a lot chartered in with ten million which was transferred into the corporation from a numbered account in banco de mexico the same ten million that arrived in grand cayman in cash on a certain lear jet registered to a quiet little law firm in memphis except that it was originally fourteen million but after payoffs to cayman customs and cayman bankers it was reduced to ten million when the company was chartered the registered agent was a guy named diego sanchez who happens to be a vp with banco de mexico the president was a delightful soul named nathan locke the secretary was our old pal royce mcknight and the treasurer of this cozy little corporation was a guy named al rubinstein im sure you know him i dont hes a morolto operative surprise surprise want more keep talking after the seed money of ten million was invested into this venture another ninety million in cash was deposited over the next three years very profitable enterprise the company began buying all sorts of things in the uscotton farms in texas apartment complexes in dayton jewelry stores in beverly hills hotels in st petersburg and tampa most of the transactions were by wire transfer from four or five different banks in the caymans its a basic moneylaundering operation and youve got all this documented stupid question wayne if i didnt have the documents how would i know about it i only work on clean files remember how much longer will it take you couple of weeks me and my employee are still snooping around front street and it doesnt look good itll be very difficult to get files out of there whered the ten thousand documents come from mitch ignored the question he jumped to his feet and started for the door abby and i want to live in albuquerque its a big town sort of out of the way start working on it dont jump the gun theres a lot of work to do i said two weeks tarrance ill be ready to deliver in two weeks and that means ill have to disappear not so fast i need to see a few of these documents you have a short memory tarrance my lovely wife promised a big stack of dunn lane documents just as soon as ray goes over the wall tarrance looked across the dark field ill see what i can do mitch walked to him and pointed a finger in his face listen to me tarrance and listen closely i dont think were getting through today is april two weeks from today is may and on may i will deliver to you as promised over ten thousand very incriminating and highly admissible documents that will seriously cripple one of the largest organized crime families in the world and eventually it will cost me my life but i promised to do it and youve promised to get my brother out of prison you have a week until april if not ill disappear and so will your case and career whats he gonna do when he gets out you and your stupid questions hell run like hell thats what hell do hes got a brother with a million dollars whos an expert in money laundering and electronic banking hell be out of the country within twelve hours and hell go find the million bucks the bahamas bahamas youre an idiot tarrance that money spent less than ten minutes in the bahamas you cant trust those corrupt fools down there mr voyles doesnt like deadlines he gets real upset tell mr voyles to kiss my ass tell him to get the next half million because im almost ready tell him to get my brother out or the deals off tell him whatever you want tarrance but ray goes over the wall in a week or im gone mitch slammed the door and started down the bleachers tarrance followed when do we talk again he yelled mitch jumped the fence and was on the track my employee will call you just do as she says nathan lockes annual threeday postapril vacation in vail had been canceled by devasher on orders from lazarov locke and oliver lambert sat in the office on the fifth floor and listened devasher was reporting the bits and pieces and trying unsuccessfully to put the puzzle together his wife leaves says shes gotta go home to her mother whos got lung cancer and that shes tired of a bunch of his crap weve detected a little trouble here and there over the months she bitched a little about his hours and all but nothing this serious so she goes home to mommy says she dont know when shes coming back mommys sick right removed a lung right but we cant find a hospital thats heard of maxine sutherland weve checked every hospital in kentucky indiana and tennessee seems odd doesnt it fellas come on devasher lambert said my wife had surgery four years ago and we flew to the mayo clinic i know of no law requiring one to have surgery within a hundred miles of home thats absurd and these are society people maybe she checked in under another name to keep it quiet happens all the time locke nodded and agreed how much has he talked to her she calls about once a day theyve had some good talks about this and that the dog her mom the office she told him last night she aint coming back for at least two months has she ever indicated which hospital asked locke never shes been real careful doesnt talk much about the surgery mommy is supposedly home now if she ever left whatre you getting at devasher asked lambert shut up and ill finish just suppose its all a ruse to get her outta town to get her away from us from whats coming down follow youre assuming hes working with them asked locke i get paid for making those assumptions nat im assuming he knows the phones are bugged and thats why theyre so careful on the phone im assuming he got her outta town to protect her pretty shaky said lambert pretty shaky devasher paced behind his desk he glared at ollie and let it pass about ten days ago somebody makes a bunch of unusual copies on the fourth floor strange because it was three in the morning according to our records when the copies were made only two lawyers were here mcdeere and scott kimble neither of whom had any business on the fourth floor twentyfour access numbers were used three belong to lamar quins files three belong to sonny capps the other eighteen belong to mcdeeres files none belong to kimble victor milligan left his office around twothirty and mcdeere was working in averys office he had taken him to the airport avery says he locked his office but he could have forgotten either he forgot or mcdeeres got a key i pressed avery on this and he feels almost certain he locked it but it was midnight and he was dead tired and in a hurry couldve forgotten right but he did not authorize mcdeere to go back to his office and work no big deal really because they had spent the entire day in there working on the capps return the copier was number eleven which happens to be the closest one to averys office i think its safe to assume mcdeere made the copies how many two thousand and twelve which files the eighteen were all tax clients now im sure hed explain it all by saying he had finished the returns and was merely copying everything sounds pretty legitimate right except the secretaries always make the copies and what the hell was he doing on the fourth floor at three am running two thousand copies and this was the morning of april how many of your boys finish their april work and run all the copies a week early he stopped pacing and watched them they were thinking he had them and heres the kicker five days later his secretary entered the same eighteen access numbers on her copier on the second floor she ran about three hundred copies which i aint no lawyer but i figure to be more in line dont you think they both nodded but said nothing they were lawyers trained to argue five sides of every issue but they said nothing devasher smiled wickedly and returned to his pacing now we caught him making two thousand copies that cannot be explained so the big question is what was he copying if he was using wrong access numbers to run the machine what the hell was he copying i dont know all of the offices were locked except of course averys so i asked avery hes got a row of metal cabinets where he keeps the real files he keeps em locked but he and mcdeere and the secretaries have been rummaging through those files all day couldve forgot to lock em when he ran to meet the plane big deal why would mcdeere copy legitimate files he wouldnt like everybody else on the fourth floor averys got those four wooden cabinets with the secret stuff no one touches them right firm rules not even other partners locked up tighter than my files so mcdeere cant get in without a key avery showed me his keys told me he hadnt touched those cabinets in two days before the seventh avery has gone through those files and everything seems in order he cant tell if theyve been tampered with but can you look at one of your files and tell if its been copied no you cant neither can i so i pulled the files this morning and im sending them to chicago theyre gonna check em for fingerprints take about a week he couldnt copy those files lambert said what else would he copy ollie i mean everythings locked on the fourth floor and the third floor everything except averys office and assuming he and tarrance are whispering in each others ears what would he want from averys office nothing but the secret files now youre assuming hes got keys locke said yes im assuming hes made a set of averys keys ollie snorted and gave an exasperated laugh this is incredible i dont believe it black eyes glared at devasher with a nasty smile how would he get a copy of the keys good question and one that i cant answer avery showed me his keys two rings eleven keys he keeps em with him at all times firm rule right like a good little lawyers supposed to do when hes awake the keys are in his pocket when hes asleep away from home the keys are under the mattress wheres he traveled in the last month black eyes asked forget the trip to see capps in houston last week too recent before that he went to grand cayman for two days on april i remember said ollie listening intently good for you ollie i asked him what he did both nights and he said nothing but work sat at a bar one night but thats it swears he slept by himself both nights devasher pushed a button on a portable tape recorder but hes lying this call was made at ninefifteen april from the phone in the master bedroom of unit a the tape began hes in the shower first female voice are you okay second female voice yeah fine he couldnt do it if he had to what took so long he wouldnt wake up is he suspicious no he remembers nothing i think hes in pain how long will you be there ill kiss him goodbye when he gets out of the shower ten maybe fifteen minutes okay hurry devasher punched another button and continued pacing i have no idea who they are and i havent confronted avery yet he worries me his wife has filed for divorce and hes lost control chases women all the time this is a pretty serious breach of security and i suspect lazarov will go through the roof she talked like it was a bad hangover locke said evidently you think she copied the keys ollie asked devasher shrugged and sat in his worn leather chair the cockiness vanished its possible but i doubt it ive thought about it for hours assuming it was some woman he picked up in a bar and they got drunk then it was probably late when they went to bed how would she make copies of the keys in the middle of the night on that tiny island i just dont think so but she had an accomplice locke insisted yeah and i cant figure that out maybe they were trying to steal his wallet and something went wrong he carries a couple of thousand in cash and if he got drunk who knows what he told them maybe she planned to lift the money at the last second and haul ass she didnt do it i dont know no more assumptions ollie asked not now i love to make them but it goes too far to assume these women took the keys somehow managed to copy them in the middle of the night on the island without his knowledge and then the first one crawled back in the bed with him and that somehow all of this is related to mcdeere and his use of the copier on the fourth floor its just too much i agree said ollie what about the storage room asked black eyes ive thought about that nat in fact ive lost sleep thinking about it if she was interested in the records in the storage room there must be some connection with mcdeere or someone else poking around and i cant make that connection lets say she found the room and the records what could she do with them in the middle of the night with avery asleep upstairs she could read them yeah theres only a million keep in mind now she must have been drinking along with avery or he wouldve been suspicious so shes spent the night drinking and screwing she waits until he goes to sleep then suddenly she has this urge to go downstairs and read bank records it dont work boys she could work for the fbi ollie said proudly no she couldnt why its simple ollie the fbi wouldnt do it because the search would be illegal and the records would be inadmissible and theres a much better reason what if she was a fibbie she wouldnt have used the phone no professional wouldve made that call i think she was a pickpocket the pickpocket theory was explained to lazarov who poked a hundred holes but could devise nothing better he ordered changes in all the locks on the third and fourth floors and the basement and both condos on grand cayman he ordered a search for all the locksmiths on the islandthere couldnt be many he saidto determine if any had reproduced keys the night of april or the early morning of april bribe them he told devasher theyll talk for a little money he ordered a fingerprint examination of the files from averys office devasher proudly explained he had already started this mcdeeres prints were on file with the state bar association he also ordered a sixtyday suspension of avery tolar devasher suggested this might alert mcdeere to something unusual fine said lazarov tell tolar to check into the hospital with chest pains two months offdoctors orders tell tolar to clean up his act lock up his office assign mcdeere to victor milligan you said you had a good plan to eliminate mcdeere devasher said lazarov grinned and picked his nose yeah i think well use the plane well send him down to the islands on a little business trip and there will be this mysterious explosion waste two pilots asked devasher yeah it needs to look good dont do it anywhere around the caymans thatll be too coincidental okay but it needs to happen over water less debris well use a big device so they wont find much that planes expensive yeah ill run it by joey first youre the boss let me know if we can help down there sure start thinking about it what about your man in washington devasher asked im waiting i called new york this morning and theyre checking into it we should know in a week that would make it easy yeah if the answer is yes we need to eliminate him within twentyfour hours ill start planning the office was quiet for a saturday morning a handful of partners and a dozen associates loitered about in khakis and polos there were no secretaries mitch checked his mail and dictated correspondence after two hours he left it was time to visit ray for five hours he drove east on interstate drove like an idiot he drove fortyfive then eightyfive he darted into every rest stop and weigh station he made sudden exits from the left lane he stopped at an underpass and waited and watched he never saw them not once did he notice a suspicious car or truck or van he even watched a few eighteenwheelers nothing they simply were not back there he would have caught them his care package of books and cigarettes was cleared through the guard station and he was pointed to stall number nine minutes later ray sat through the thick screen where have you been he said with a hint of irritation youre the only person in the entire world who visits me and this is only the second time in four months i know its tax season and ive been swamped ill do better ive written though yeah once a week i get two paragraphs hi ray hows the bunk hows the food how are the walls hows the greek or italian im fine abbys great dogs sick gotta run ill come visit soon love mitch you write some rich letters little brother i really

spanish speak slowly ray smiled slightly tcudndo when la semana proximo next week ique dia what day mitch thought for a second maries o miercoles tuesday or wednesday ique tiempo what time mitch smiled and shrugged and looked around hows abby ray asked shes been in kentucky for a couple of weeks her mothers sick he stared at ray and softly mouthed the words trust me whats wrong with her they removed a lung cancer shes smoked heavy all her life you should quit i will if i ever get out of here mitch smiled and nodded slowly youve got at least seven more years yeah and escape is impossible they try it occasionally but theyre either shot or captured james earl ray went over the wall didnt he mitch nodded slowly as he asked the question ray smiled and watched his brothers eyes but they caught him they bring in a bunch of mountain boys with bloodhounds and it gets pretty nasty i dont think anyones ever survived the mountains after they got over the wall lets talk about something else mitch said good idea two guards stood by a window behind the row of visitors booths they were enjoying a stack of dirty pictures someone took with a polaroid and tried to sneak through the guard station they giggled among themselves and ignored the visitors on the prisoners side a single guard with a stick walked benignly back and forth half asleep when can i expect little nieces and nephews ray asked maybe in a few years abby wants one of each and she would start now if i would im not ready the guard walked behind ray but did not look they stared at each other trying to read each others eyes jaddnde voy ray asked quickly where am i going perdido beach hilton we went to the cayman islands last month abby and i had a beautiful vacation never heard of the place where is it in the caribbean below cuba ique es mi nombre what is my name lee stevens did some snorkeling the water is warm and gorgeous owns two condos right on seven mile beach all i paid for was the airfare it was great get me a book id like to read about it jpasaporte mitch nodded with a smile the guard walked behind ray and stopped they talked of old times in kentucky at dusk he parked the bmw on the dark side of a suburban mall in nashville he left the keys in the ignition and locked the door he had a spare in his pocket a busy crowd of easter shoppers moved en masse through the sears doors he joined them inside he ducked into the mens clothing department and studied socks and underwear while watching the door nobody suspicious he left sears and walked quickly through the crowd down the mall a black cotton sweater in the window of a mens store caught his attention he found one inside tried it on and decided to wear it out of there he liked it so much as the clerk laid his change on the counter he scanned the yellow pages for the number of a cab back into the mall he rode the escalator to the first floor where he found a pay phone the cab would be there in ten minutes it was dark now the cool early dark of spring in the south he watched the mall entrance from inside a singles bar he was certain he had not been followed through the mall he walked casually to the cab brentwood he said to the driver and disappeared into the back seat brentwood was twenty minutes away savannah creek apartments he said the cab searched through the sprawling complex and found number e he threw a twenty over the seat and slammed the door behind an outside stairwell he found the door to e it was locked who is it a nervous female voice asked from within he heard the voice and felt weak barry abanks he said abby pulled the door open and attacked they kissed violently as he lifted her walked inside and slammed the door with his foot his hands were wild in less than two seconds he pulled her sweater over her head unsnapped her bra and slid the rather loosefitting skirt to her knees they continued kissing with one eye he glanced apprehensively at the cheap flimsy rented foldabed that was waiting either that or the floor he laid her gently on it and took off his clothes the bed was too short and it squeaked the mattress was two inches of foam rubber wrapped in a sheet the metal braces underneath jutted upward and were dangerous but the mcdeeres did not notice when it was good and dark and the crowd of shoppers at the mall thinned for a moment a shiny black chevrolet silverado pickup pulled behind the bmw and stopped a small man with a neat haircut and sideburns jumped out looked around and stuck a pointed screwdriver into the door lock of the bmw months later when he was sentenced he would tell the judge that he had stolen over three hundred cars and pickups in eight states and that he could break into a car and start the engine faster than the judge could with the keys said his average time was twentyeight seconds the judge was not impressed occasionally on a very lucky day an idiot would leave the keys in the car and the average time was reduced dramatically a scout had found this car with the keys he smiled and turned them the silverado raced away followed by the bmw the nordic jumped from the van and watched it was too fast he was too late the pickup just pulled up blocked his vision for an instant then wham the bmw was gone stolen before his very eyes he kicked the van now how would he explain this he crawled back into the van and waited for mcdeere after an hour on the couch the pain of loneliness had been forgotten they walked through the small apartment holding hands and kissing in the bedroom mitch had his first viewing of what had become known among the three as the bendini papers he had seen tammys notes and summaries but not the actual documents the room was like a chessboard with rows of neat stacks of papers on two of the walls tammy had tacked sheets of white poster board then covered them with the notes and lists and flowcharts one day soon he would spend hours in the room studying the papers and preparing his case but not tonight in a few minutes he would leave her and return to the mall she led him back to the couch the hall on the tenth floor madison wing of the baptist hospital was empty except for an orderly and a male nurse writing on his clipboard visiting hours had ended at nine and it was tenthirty he eased down the hall spoke to the orderly was ignored by the nurse and knocked on the door come in a strong voice said he pushed the heavy door open and stood by the bed hello mitch avery said can you believe this what happened i woke up at six this morning with stomach cramps i thought i took a shower and felt a sharp pain right here on my shoulder my breathing got heavy and i started sweating i thought no not me hell im fortyfour in great shape work out all the time eat pretty good drink a little too much maybe but not me i called my doctor and he said to meet him here at the hospital he thinks it was a slight heart attack nothing serious he hopes but theyre running tests for the next few days a heart attack thats what he said im not surprised avery its a wonder any lawyer in that firm lives past fifty capps did it to me mitch sonny capps this is his heart attack he called friday and said hed found a new tax firm in washington wants all his records thats my biggest client i billed him almost four hundred thousand last year about what he paid in taxes hes not mad about the attorneys fees but hes furious about the taxes it doesnt make sense mitch hes not worth dying for mitch looked for an iv but did not see one there were no tubes or wires he sat in the only chair and laid his feet on the bed jean filed for divorce you know i heard thats no surprise is it surprised she didnt do it last year ive offered her a small fortune as a settlement i hope she takes it i dont need a nasty divorce who does thought mitch what did lambert say it was kind of fun really in nineteen years ive never seenhim lose his cool but he lost it he told me i was drinking too much chasing women and who knows what else said i had embarrassed suggested i see a psychiatrist avery spoke slowly deliberately and at times with a raspy weak voice it seemed phony a sentence later he would forget about it and return to his normal voice he lay perfectly still like a corpse with the sheets tucked neatly around him his color was good i think you need a psychiatrist maybe two thanks i need a month in the sun doc said he would discharge me in three or four days and that i couldnt work for two months sixty days mitch said i cannot under any circumstances go near the office for sixty days what a blessing i think ill have a slight heart attack at your pace its guaranteed what are you a doctor now no just scared you get a scare like this and you start thinking about things today is the first time in my life ive ever thought about dying and if you dont think about death you dont appreciate life this is getting pretty heavy yeah i know hows abby okay i guess i havent seen her in a while youd better go see her and bring her home and get her happy sixty hours a week is plenty mitch youll ruin your marriage and kill yourself if you work more she wants babies then get them i wish i had done things differently damn avery whens the funeral youre fortyfour and you had a slight heart attack youre not exactly a vegetable the male nurse glided in and glared at mitch visiting hours are over sir you need to leave mitch jumped to his feet yeah sure he slapped averys feet and walked out see you in a couple of days thanks for coming tell abby i said hello the elevator was empty mitch pushed the button to the sixteenth floor and seconds later got off he ran two flights of stairs to the eighteenth caught his breath and opened the door down the hall away from the elevators rick acklin watched and whispered into a dead telephone receiver he nodded at mitch who walked toward him acklin pointed and mitch stepped into a small area used as a waiting room by worried relatives it was dark and empty with two rows of folding chairs and a television that did not work a coke machine provided the only light tarrance sat next to it and flipped through an old magazine he wore a sweat suit headband navy socks and white canvas sneakers tarrance the jogger mitch sat next to him facing the hall youre clean they followed you from the office to the parking lot then left acklins in the hall laneys around somewhere relax i like the headband thanks i see you got the message obviously real clever mcdeere im sitting at my desk this afternoon minding my own business trying to work on something other than the bendini case ive got others you know and my secretary comes in and says theres a woman on the phone who wants to talk about a man named marty kozinski i jump from my chair grab the phone and of course its your girl she says its urgent as always so i say okay lets talk no she dont play it she makes me drop everything im doing run over to the peabody go to the loungewhats

thats me i felt stupid mitch and he says i have a call i walk over to the bar and its your girl tolars had a heart attack or something and youll be here around eleven real clever worked didnt it yeah and it would work just as easily if she would talk to me on my phone in my office i like it better my way its safer besides it gets you out of the office damned right it does me and three others look tarrance well do it my way okay its my neck on the line not yours yeah yeah what the hell are you driving a rented celebrity nice huh what happened to the little black lawyers car it had an insect problem full of bugs i parked it at a mall saturday night in nashville and left the keys in it someone borrowed it i love to sing but i have a terrible voice ever since i could drive ive done my singing in the car alone but with the bugs and all i was too embarrassed to sing i just got tired of it tarrance could not resist a smile thats pretty good mcdeere pretty good you shouldve seen oliver lambert this morning when i walked in and laid the police report on his desk he stuttered and stammered and told me how sorry he was i acted like i was real sad insurance will cover it so old oliver says theyll get me another one then he says theyll go get me a rental car for the meantime i told him i already had one got it in nashville saturday night he didnt like this because he knew it was insectfree he calls the bmw dealer himself while im standing there to check on a new one for me he asked me what color i wanted i said i was tired of black and wanted a burgundy one with tan interior i drove to the bmw place yesterday and looked around i didnt see a burgundy of any model he told the guy on the phone what i wanted and then he tells him they dont have it how about black or navy or gray or red or white no no no i want a burgundy one theyll have to order it he reports fine i said he hung up the phone and asked me if i was sure i couldnt use another color burgundy i said he wanted to argue but realized it would seem foolish so for the first time in ten months i can sing in my car but a celebrity for a hotshot tax lawyer thats got to hurt i can deal with it tarrance was still smiling obviously impressed i wonder what the boys in the chop shop will do when they strip it down and find all those bugs probably sell it to a pawnshop as stereo equipment how much was it worth our boys said it was the best ten fifteen thousand i dont know thats funny two nurses walked by talking loudly they turned a corner and the hall was quiet acklin pretended to place another phone call hows tolar tarrance asked superb i hope my heart attack is as easy as his hell be here for a few days then off for two months nothing serious can you get in his office why should i ive already copied everything in it tarrance leaned closer and waited for more no i cannot get in his office theyve changed the locks on the third and fourth floors and the basement how do you know this the girl tarrance in the last week shes been in every office in the building including the basement shes checked every door pulled on every drawer looked in every closet shes read mail looked at files and rummaged through the garbage theres not much garbage really the building has ten paper shredders in it four in the basement did you know that tarrance listened intently and did not move a muscle how did she dont ask tarrance because i wont tell you she works there shes a secretary or something shes helping you from the inside mitch shook his head in frustration brilliant tarrance she called you twice today once at about twofifteen and then about an hour later now how would a secretary make two calls to the fbi an hour apart maybe she didnt work today maybe she called from home youre wrong tarrance and quit guessing dont waste time worrying about her she works for me and together well deliver the goods to you whats in the basement one big room with twelve cubicles twelve busy desks and a thousand file cabinets electronically wired file cabinets i think its the operations center for their moneylaundering activities on the walls of the cubicles she noticed names and phone numbers of dozens of banks in the caribbean theres not much information lying around down there theyre very careful theres a smaller room off to the side heavily locked and full of computers larger than refrigerators sounds like the place it is but forget it theres no way to get the stuff out without alerting them impossible i know of only one way to bring the goods out okay a search warrant forget it no probable cause listen to me tarrance this is how its gonna be okay i cant give you all the documents you want but i can give you all you need i have in my possession over ten thousand documents and although i have not reviewed all of them ive seen enough to know that if you had them you could show them to a judge and get a search warrant for front street you can take the records i have now and obtain indictments for maybe half but the same documents will get your search warrant and consequently a truckload of indictments theres no other way to do it tarrance walked to the hall and looked around empty he stretched his legs and walked to the coke machine he leaned on it and looked through the small window to the east why only half initially only half plus a number of retired partners scattered through my documents are various names of partners whove set up the bogus cayman companies with morolto money those indictments will be easy once you have all the records your conspiracy theory will fall in place and you can indict everyone where did you get the documents i got lucky very lucky i sort of figured had more sense than to keep the cayman bank records in this country i had a hunch the records might be in the caymans fortunately i was right we copied the documents in the caymans we the girl and a friend where are the records now you and your questions tarrance theyre in my possession thats all you need to know i want those documents from the basement listen to me tarrance pay attention the documents in the basement are not coming out until you go in with a search warrant it is impossible do you hear who are the guys in the basement dont know ive been there ten months and never seen them i dont know where they park or how they get in and out theyre invisible i figure the partners and the boys in the basement do the dirty work what kind of equipment is down there two copiers four shredders highspeed printers and all those computers state of the art tarrance walked to the window obviously deep in thought that makes sense makes a lot of sense ive always wondered how with all those secretaries and clerks and paralegals could maintain such secrecy about morolto its easy the secretaries and clerks and paralegals know nothing about it theyre kept busy with the real clients the partners and senior associates sit in their big offices and dream up exotic ways to launder money and the basement crew does the grunt work its a great setup so there are plenty of legitimate clients hundreds theyre talented lawyers with an amazing clientele its a great cover and youre telling me mcdeere that youve got the documents now to support indictments and search warrants youve got themtheyre in your possession thats what i said in this country yes tarrance the documents are in this country very close to here actually tarrance was fidgety now he rocked from one foot to the other and cracked his knuckles he was breathing quickly what else can you get out of front street nothing its too dangerous theyve changed the locks and that sort of worries me i mean why would they change the locks on the third and fourth floors and not on the first and second i made some copies on the fourth floor two weeks ago and i dont think it was a good idea im getting bad vibes no more records from front street what about the girl she no longer has access tarrance chewed his fingernails rocking back and forth still staring at the window i want the records mcdeere and i want them real soon like tomorrow when does ray get his walking papers todays monday i think its set up for tomorrow night you wouldnt believe the cussing ive taken from voyles hes had to pull every string in the book you think im kidding he called in both senators from

stairs to the ninth tammy opened the door and locked it behind him he walked to the window were you watching he asked of course the guard by your parking lot stood on the sidewalk and watched you walk

for the door how about another fifty thousand ill take it he winked at her and closed the door wondering if he would ever see her again the cell was eight by eight with a toilet in a corner and a set of bunk beds the top bunk was uninhabited and had been for a year ray lay on the bottom bunk with wires running from his ears he spoke to himself in a very foreign language turkish at that moment on that floor it was safe to bet he was the only soul listening to berlitz jabber in turkish there was quiet talk up and down the hall but most lights were out eleven oclock tuesday night the guard walked silently to his cell mcdeere he said softly secretly through the bars ray sat on the edge of the bed under the bunk above and stared at him he removed the wires warden wants to see you sure he thought the wardens sitting at his desk at pm waiting on me where are we going it was an anxious question put your shoes on and come on ray glanced around the cell and took a quick inventory of his worldly possessions in eight years he had accumulated a blackandwhite television a large cassette player two cardboard boxes full of tapes and several dozen books he made three dollars a day working in the prison laundry but after cigarettes there had been little to spend on tangibles these were his only assets eight years the guard fitted a heavy key in the door and slid it open a few inches he turned off the light just follow me and no cute stuff i dont know who you are mister but you got some heavyduty friends other keys fit other doors and they were outside under the basketball hoop stay behind me the guard said rays eyes darted around the dark compound the wall loomed like a mountain in the distance beyond the courtyard and walking area where he had paced a thousand miles and smoked a ton of cigarettes it was sixteen feet tall in the daylight but looked much larger at night the guard towers were fifty yards apart and well lit and heavily armed the guard was casual and unconcerned of course he had a uniform and a gun he moved confidently between two cinderblock buildings telling ray to follow and be cool ray tried to be cool they stopped at the corner of a building and the guard gazed at the wall eighty feet away floodlights made a routine sweep of the courtyard and they backed into the darkness why are we hiding ray asked himself are those guys up there with the guns on our side he would like to know before he made any dramatic moves the guard pointed to the exact spot on the wall where james earl ray and his gang went over a rather famous spot studied and admired by most of the inmates at brushy mountain most of the white ones anyway in about five minutes theyll throw a ladder up there the wire has already been cut on top youll find a heavy rope on the other side mind if i ask a few questions make it quick what about all these lights theyll be diverted youll have total darkness and those guns up there dont worry theyll look the other way dammit are you sure look man ive seen some inside jobs before but this takes the cake warden lattemer himself planned this one hes right up there the guard pointed to the nearest tower the warden yep just so nothingll go wrong whos throwing up the ladder coupla guards ray wiped his forehead with his sleeve and breathed deeply his mouth was dry and his knees were weak the guard whispered therell be a dude waiting for you his name is bud white dude hell find you on the other side and just do what he says the floodlights swept through again then died get ready the guard said darkness settled in followed by a dreadful silence the wall was now black from the nearest tower a whistle blew two short signals ray knelt and watched from behind the next building he could see the silhouettes running to the wall they grabbed at something in the grass then hoisted it run dude the guard said run ray sprinted with his head low the homemade ladder was in place the guards grabbed his arms and threw him to the first step the ladder bounced as he scurried up the two byfours the top of the wall was two feet wide a generous opening had been cut in the coiled barbed wire he slid through without touching it the rope was right where it was supposed to be and he eased down the outside of the wall eight feet from pay dirt he turned loose and jumped he squatted and looked around still dark the floodlights were on hold the clearing stopped a hundred feet away and the dense woods began over here the voice said calmly ray started for it bud was waiting in the first cluster of black bushes hurry follow me ray followed him until the wall was out of sight they stopped in a small clearing next to a dirt trail he stuck out a hand im bud riley kinda fun aint it unbelievable ray mcdeere bud was a stocky man with a black beard and a black beret he wore combat boots jeans and a camouflage jacket no gun was in sight he offered ray a cigarette who are you with ray asked nobody i just do a little freelance work for the warden they usually call me when somebody goes over the wall course this is a little different usually i bring my dogs i thought wed wait here for a minute until the sirens go off so you can hear wouldnt be right if you didnt get to hear em i mean theyre sorta in your honor thats okay ive heard them before yeah but its different out here when they go off its a beautiful sound look bud i just listen ray we got plenty of time they wont chase you much much yeah they gotta make a big scene wake everbody up just like a real escape but they aint coming after you i dont know what kinda pull you got but its something the sirens began screaming and ray jumped lights flashed across the black sky and the faint voices of the tower guards were audible see what i mean lets go ray said and began walking my trucks just up the road a piece i brought you some clothes warden gave me your sizes hope you like them bud was out of breath when they reached the truck ray quickly changed into the olive duckheads and navy cotton work shirt very nice bud he said just throw them prison clothes in the bushes they drove the winding mountain trail for two miles then turned onto blacktop bud listened to conway twitty and said nothing where are we going bud ray finally asked well the warden said he didnt care and really didnt want to know said it was up to you id suggest we get to a big town where theres a bus station after that youre on your own how far will you drive me i got all night ray you name the town id like to get some miles behind us before i start hanging around a bus station how about knoxville knoxville it is where are you going from there i dont know i need to get out of the country with your friends that should be no problem be careful though by tomorrow your picture will be hanging in every sheriffs office in ten states three cars with blue lights came blazing over the hill in front of them ray ducked onto the floorboard relax ray they cant see you he watched them disappear through the rear window what about roadblocks look ray aint gonna be no roadblocks okay trust me bud stuck a hand in a pocket and threw a wad of cash on the seat five hundred bucks handdelivered by the warden you got some stout friends buddy wednesday morning tarry ross climbed the stairs to the fourth floor of the phoenix park hotel he paused on the landing outside the hall door and caught his breath sweat beaded across his eyebrows he removed the dark sunglasses and wiped his face with the sleeve of his overcoat nausea hit below the belt and he leaned on the stair rail he dropped his empty briefcase on the concrete and sat on the bottom step his hands shook like severe palsy and he wanted to cry he clutched his stomach and tried not to vomit the nausea passed and he breathed again be brave man be brave theres two hundred thousand waiting down the hall if you got guts you can go in there and get it you can walk out with it but you must have courage he breathed deeper and his hands settled down guts man guts the weak knees wobbled but he made it to the door down the hall past the rooms eighth door on the right he held his breath and knocked seconds passed he watched the dark hall through the dark glasses and could see nothing yeah a voice inside said inches away its alfred ridiculous name he thought whered it come from the door cracked and a face appeared behind the little chain the door closed then opened wide alfred walked in good morning alfred vinnie cozzo said warmly would you like coffee i didnt come here for coffee alfred snapped he placed the briefcase on the bed and stared at cozzo youre always so nervous alfred why dont you relax theres no way you can get caught shut up cozzo wheres the money vinnie pointed to a leather handbag he stopped smiling talk to me alfred the nausea hit again but he kept his feet he stared at them his heart beat like pistons okay your man mcdeere has been paid a million bucks already another million is on the way hes delivered one load of bendini documents and claims to have ten thousand more a sharp pain hit his groin and he sat on the edge of the bed he removed his glasses keep talking cozzo demanded mcdeeres talked to our people many times in the last six months hell testify at the trials then hit the road as a protected witness he and his wife where are the other documents dammit i dont know he wont tell but theyre ready to be delivered i want my money cozzo vinnie threw the handbag on the bed alfred opened it and the briefcase he attacked the stacks of bills his hands shaking violently two hundred thousand he asked desperately vinnie smiled that was the deal alfred i got another job for you in a couple of weeks no way cozzo i cant take any more of this he slammed the briefcase shut and ran to the door he stopped and tried to calm himself what will you do with mcdeere he asked staring at the door what do you think alfred he bit his lip clenched the briefcase and walked from the room vinnie smiled and locked the door he pulled a card from his pocket and placed a call to the chicago home of mr lou lazarov tarry ross walked in panic down the hall he could see little from behind the glasses seven doors down almost to the elevator a huge hand reached from the darkness and pulled him into a room the hand slapped him hard and another fist landed in his stomach another fist to the nose he was on the floor dazed and bleeding the briefcase was emptied on the bed he was thrown into a chair and the lights came on three fbi agents his comrades glared at him director voyles walked up to him shaking his head in disbelief the agent with the huge efficient hands stood nearby within striking distance another agent was counting money voyles leaned into his face youre a traitor ross the lowest form of scum i cant believe it ross bit his lip and began sobbing who is it voyles asked intently the crying was louder no answer voyles swung wildly and slapped rosss left temple he shrieked in pain who is it ross talk to me vinnie cozzo he blurted between sobs i know its cozzo dammit i know that but what did you tell him tears ran from his eyes and blood poured from his nose his body shook and gyrated pitifully no answer voyles slapped him again and again tell me you little sonofabitch tell me what cozzo wants he slapped him again ross doubled over and dropped his head on his knees the crying softened two hundred thousand dollars an agent said voyles dropped to one knee and almost whispered to ross is it mcdeere ross please oh please tell me its not mcdeere tell me tarry tell me its not mcdeere tarry stuck his elbows on his knees and stared at the floor the blood dripped neatly into one little puddle on the carpet gut check tarry you dont get to keep your money youre on the way to jail youre a disgrace tarry youre a slimy little scuzzball of a chicken and its over what could possibly be gained by keeping secrets gut check tarry voyles was pleading softly sinners wont you come please say it aint mcdeere tarry please tell me it aint tarry sat straight and wiped his eyes with his fingers he breathed deeply cleared his throat he bit his lip looked squarely at voyles and nodded devasher had no time for the elevator he ran down the stairs to the fourth floor to the corner a power one and barged into lockes office half the partners were there locke lambert milligan mcknight dunbar denton lawson banahan kruger welch and shottz the other half had been summoned a quiet panic filled the room devasher sat at the head of the conference table and they gathered around okay boys its not time to haul ass and head for brazil not yet anyway we confirmed this morning that he has talked extensively to the fibbies that they have paid him a million cash that they have promised another million that he has certain documents that are believed to be fatal this came straight from the fbi lazarov and a small army are flying into memphis as we speak it appears as though the damage has not been done yet according to our sourcea very highranking fibbiemcdeere has over ten thousand documents in his possession and he is ready to deliver but he has only delivered a few so far we think evidently we have caught this thing in time if we can prevent further damage we should be okay i say this even though they have some documents obviously they dont have much or they wouldve been here with search warrants devasher was onstage he enjoyed this immensely he spoke with a patronizing smile and looked at each of the worried faces now where is mcdeere milligan spoke in his office i just talked to him he suspects nothing wonderful hes scheduled to leave in three hours for grand cayman correct lambert thats correct around noon boyi the plane will never make it the pilot will land in new orleans for an errand then hell take off for the island about thirty minutes over the gulf the little blip will disappear from radar forever debris will scatter over a thirtysquaremile area and no bodies will ever be found its sad but necessary the lear asked denton yes son the lear well buy you another toy were assuming a lot devasher locke said were assuming the documents already in their possession are harmless four days ago you thought mcdeere had copied some of averys secret files what gives they studied the files in chicago yeah theyre full of incriminating evidence but not enough to move with they couldnt get the first conviction you guys know the damning materials are on the island and of course in the basement no one can penetrate the basement we checked the files in the condo everything looked in order locke was not satisfied then where did the ten thousand come from youre assuming he has ten thousand i rather doubt it keep in mind hes trying to collect another one million bucks before he takes off hes probably lying to them and snooping around for more documents if he had ten thousand why wouldnt the fibbies have them by now then whats to fear asked lambert the fear is the unknown ollie we dont know what hes got except that hes got a million bucks hes no dummy and he just might stumble across something if left alone we cannot allow that to happen lazarov you see said to blow his ass outta the air quote unquote theres no way a rookie associate could find and copy that many incriminating records kruger said boldly and looked around the group for approval several nodded at him with intense frowns why is lazarov coming asked dunbar the real estate man he said lazarov as if charles manson was coming to dinner thats a stupid question devasher snapped and looked around for the idiot first weve got to take care of mcdeere and hope the damage is minimal then well take a long look at this unit and make whatever changes are necessary locke stood and glared at oliver lambert make sure mcdeeres on that plane tarrance acklin and laney sat in stunned silence and listened to the speaker phone on the desk it was voyles in washington explaining exactly what had happened he would leave for memphis within the hour he was almost desperate you gotta bring him in tarrance and quick cozzo doesnt know that we know about tarry ross but ross told him mcdeere was on the verge of delivering the records they could take him out at any time youve got to get him now do you know where he is hes at the office tarrance said okay fine bring him in ill be there in two hours i wanna talk to him goodbye tarrance punched the phone then dialed the number who are you calling acklin asked bendini lambert locke attorneysatlaw are you crazy wayne laney asked just listen the receptionist answered the phone mitch mcdeere please tarrance said one moment please she said then the secretary mr mcdeeres office i need to speak to mitchell mcdeere im sorry sir hes in a meeting listen young lady this is judge henry hugo and he was supposed to be in my courtroom fifteen minutes ago were waiting for him its an emergency well i see nothing on his calendar for this morning do you schedule his appointments well yes sir then its your fault now get him on the phone nina ran across the hall and into his office mitch theres a judge hugo on the phone says youre supposed to be in court right now youd better talk to him mitch jumped to his feet and grabbed the phone he was pale yes he said mr mcdeere tarrance said judge hugo youre late for my court get over here yes judge he grabbed his coat and briefcase and frowned at nina im sorry she said its not on your calendar mitch raced down the hall down the stairs past the receptionist and out the front door he ran north on front street to union and darted through the lobby of the cotton exchange building on union he turned east and ran toward the midamerica mall the sight of a welldressed young man with a briefcase running like a scared dog may be a common sight in some cities but not in memphis people noticed he hid behind a fruit stand and caught his breath he saw no one running behind him he ate an apple if it came to a footrace he hoped twoton tony was chasing him he had never been particularly impressed with wayne tarrance the korean shoe store was a fiasco the chicken place on grand cayman was equally dumb his notebook on the moroltos would bore a cub scout but his idea about a mayday code a dont ask questions just run for your life alert was a brilliant idea for a month mitch knew if judge hugo called he had to hit the door on a dead run something bad had gone wrong and the boys on the fifth floor were moving in where was abby he thought a few pedestrians walked in pairs along union he wanted a crowded sidewalk but there was none he stared at the corner of front and union and saw nothing suspicious two blocks east he casually entered the lobby of the peabody and looked for a phone on the mezzanine overlooking the lobby he found a neglected one in a short hallway near the mens room he dialed the memphis office of the federal bureau of investigation wayne tarrance please its an emergency this is mitch mcdeere tarrance was on the phone in seconds mitch where are you okay tarrance whats going on where are you im

washington they paid him two hundred thousand for the story on you were in shock mitch oh im touched im truly concerned over your shock and pain tarrance i guess now you want me to run down there to

sit tight and ill call you in thirty minutes from another phone no mitch listen youre dead if you dont come in goodbye wayne sit by the phone mitch dropped the receiver and looked around he walked to a marble column and peeked at the lobby below the ducks were swimming around the fountain the bar was deserted a table was surrounded with rich old ladies sipping their tea and gossiping a solitary guest was registering suddenly the nordic stepped from behind a potted tree and stared at him up there he yelled across the lobby to an accomplice they watched him intently and glanced at the stairway under him the bartender looked up at mitch then at the nordic and his friend the old ladies stared in silence call the police mitch yelled as he backed away from the railing both men sprang across the lobby and hit the stairs mitch waited five seconds and returned to the railing the bartender had not moved the ladies were frozen there were heavy noises on the stairs mitch sat on the railing dropped his briefcase swung his legs over paused then jumped twenty feet onto the carpet of the lobby he fell like a rock but landed squarely on both feet pain shot through his ankles and hips the football knee buckled but did not collapse behind him next to the elevators was a small haberdashery with windows full of ties and ralph laurens latest he limped into it a kid of no more than nineteen waited eagerly behind the counter there were no customers an outside door opened onto union is that door locked mitch asked calmly yes sir you wanna make a thousand dollars cash nothing illegal mitch quickly peeled off ten hundreddollar bills and threw them on the counter uh sure i guess nothing illegal okay i swear i wouldnt get you in trouble unlock that door and when two men come running in here in about twenty seconds tell them i ran through that door and jumped in a cab the kid smiled even brighter and raked up the money sure no problem wheres the dressing room yes sir over there next to the closet unlock the door mitch said as he slid into the dressing room and sat down he rubbed his knees and ankles the clerk was straightening ties when the nordic and his partner ran through the door from the lobby good morning he said cheerfully did you see a man running through here medium build dark gray suit red tie yes sir he just ran through there through that door and jumped in a cab a cab damn the door opened and closed and the store was silent the kid walked to a shoe rack near the closet theyre gone sir mitch was rubbing his knees good go to the door and watch for two minutes let me know if you see them two minutes later he was back theyre gone mitch kept his seat and smiled at the door great i want one of those kellygreen sport coats fortyfour long and a pair of white buckskins ten d bring them here would you and keep watching yes sir he whistled around the store as he collected the coat and shoes then slid them under the door mitch yanked off his tie and changed quickly he sat down how much do i owe you mitch asked from the room well lets see how about five hundred fine call me a cab and let me know when its outside tarrance walked three miles around his desk the call was traced to the peabody but laney arrived too late he was back now sitting nervously with acklin forty minutes after the first call the secretarys voice blasted through the intercom mr tarrance its mcdeere tarrance lunged at the phone where are you in town but not for long look mitch you wont last two days on your own theyll fly in enough thugs to start another war youve got to let us help you i dont know tarrance for some strange reason i just dont trust you boys right now i cant imagine why just a bad feeling please mitch dont make this mistake i guess you want me to believe you boys can protect me for the rest of my life sorta funny isnt it tarrance i cut a deal with the fbi and i almost get gunned in my own office thats real protection tarrance breathed deeply into the phone there was a long pause what about the documents weve paid you a million for them youre cracking up tarrance you paid me a million for my clean files you got them and i got the million of course that was just part of the deal protection was also a part of it give us the damned files mitch theyre hidden somewhere close to us you told me that take off if you want to but leave the files wont work tarrance right now i can disappear and the moroltos may or may not come after me if you dont get the files you dont get the indictments if the moroltos dont get indicted maybe if im lucky one day

wednesday ray sat in the rear and studied every person who climbed in and found a seat he looked sporty he had taken a cab to a mall in birmingham and in thirty minutes had purchased a new pair of faded levis a plaid shortsleeved golf shirt and a pair of redandwhite reeboks he had also eaten a pizza and received a severe marinestyle haircut he wore aviator sunshades and an auburn cap a short fat darkskinned lady sat next to him he smiled at her jde donde es usted he asked where are you from her face broke into unrestrained delight a wide smile revealed few teeth mexico she said proudly jhabla espanol she asked eagerly si for two hours they jabbered in spanish as the bus rolled along to montgomery she had to repeat occasionally but he surprised himself he was eight years out of practice and a little rusty behind the bus special agents jenkins and jones followed in a dodge aries jenkins drove while jones slept the trip had become boring ten minutes out of knoxville just routine surveillance they were told if you lose him no big deal but try not to lose him the flight from huntington to atlanta was two hours away and abby sat in a secluded corner of a dark lounge watching just watching in the chair next to her was a carryon bag contrary to her urgent instructions she had packed a toothbrush makeup and a few clothes she had also written a note to her parents giving a brief story about how she had to run to memphis needed to see mitch everythings fine dont worry hugs and kisses love abby she ignored the coffee and watched the arriving and departing she did not know if he was dead or alive tammy said he was scared but very much in control as always she said he was flying to nashville and she tammy was flying to memphis confusing but she was certain he knew what he was doing get to perdido beach and wait abby had never heard of perdido beach and she was certain hed never been there either the lounge was nerveracking every ten minutes a drunk businessman would venture over and throw something suggestive at her get lost she said a dozen times after two hours they boarded abby was stuck in the aisle seat she buckled her belt and relaxed and then she saw her she was a striking blonde with high cheekbones and a firm jaw that was almost unfeminine yet strong and attractive abby had seen the partial face before partial because the eyes were covered as before she looked at abby and glanced away as she passed and went to her seat somewhere in the rear the shipwreck bar the blonde in the shipwreck bar the blonde who was eavesdropping on her and mitch and abanks they had found her and if they had found her where was her husband what had they done to him she thought of the twohour drive from danesboro to huntington through the winding mountain roads she had driven like a maniac they could not have followed her they taxied from the terminal and minutes later lifted off for atlanta for a second time in three weeks abby watched dusk from the inside of a at the airport in atlanta she and the blonde they were on the ground for thirty minutes and then left for mobile from cincinnati mitch flew to nashville he arrived at pm wednesday long after the banks had closed he found a uhaul truck rental place in the phone book and flagged a cab he rented one of the smaller models a sixteenfooter he paid cash but was forced to use his drivers license and a credit card for a deposit if devasher could track him to a uhaul place in nashville so be it he bought twenty cardboard packing boxes and left for the apartment he had not eaten since tuesday night but he was in luck tammy had left a bag of microwave popcorn and two beers he ate like a pig at eight he made his first call to the perdido beach hilton he asked for lee stevens he had not arrived she said he stretched out on the den floor and thought of a hundred things that could happen to abby she could be dead in kentucky and he wouldnt know he couldnt call the couch had not been folded and the cheap sheets hung off the end and fell to the floor tammy was not much for housework he looked at the small temporary bed and thought of abby only five nights ago they had tried to kill each other on the bed hopefully she was on the plane alone in the bedroom he sat on the unopened sony box and marveled at the roomful of documents across the carpet she had built perfect columns of paper all painstakingly divided into cayman banks and cayman companies on top of each stack was a yellow legal pad with the company name followed by pages of dates and entries and names even tarrance could follow the paper trail a grand jury would eat it up the us attorney would call press conferences and the trial juries would convict and convict and convict special agent jenkins yawned into the telephone receiver and punched the numbers to the memphis office he had not slept in twentyfour hours jones was snoring in the car fbi a male voice said yeah whos there jenkins asked just a routine checkin acklin hey rick this is jenkins weve jenkins where have you been hold on jenkins quit yawning and looked around the bus terminal an angry voice yelled into the earpiece jenkins where

jenkins grabbed the phone tighter and waited another voice hello jenkins yes director voyles here what the hell happened jenkins held his breath and looked wildly around the terminal sir we lost him we followed him for twenty hours and when he got off the bus here in mobile we lost him in the crowd thats great son how long ago twenty minutes all right listen we desperately need to find him his

later at ten mitch called the perdido beach hilton for the second time he asked for rachel james no arrival he asked for lee stevens one moment she said mitch sat on the floor and waited intently the line to the room was ringing after a dozen rings someone picked up yeah it was quick lee mitch asked a pause yeah this is mitch congratulations ray fell on the bed and closed his eyes it was so easy mitch howd you do it ill tell you when we have time right now there are a bunch of folks trying to kill me and abby were on the run who mitch it would take ten hours to tell the first chapter well do

brother and ive got the answers but not now take care of my wife and call me when she gets there will do and mitch thanks adios an hour later abby turned off highway onto the winding driveway to the hilton she parked the fourdoor cutlass with alabama tags and walked nervously under the sprawling veranda to the front doors she stopped for a second looked behind her at the driveway and went inside two minutes later a yellow cab from mobile stopped under the veranda behind the shuttle vans ray watched the cab a woman was in the back seat leaning forward and talking to the driver they waited a minute she pulled money from her purse and paid him she got out and waited until the cab drove away the woman was a blonde and that was the first thing he noticed very shapely with tight black corduroy pants and black sunglasses which seemed odd to him because it was pushing midnight she walked suspiciously to the front doors waited a minute then went in he watched her carefully he moved toward the lobby the blonde approached the only clerk behind the registration desk a single room please he heard her say the clerk slid a registration form across the counter the blonde wrote her name and asked that lady who just checked in before me whats her name i think shes an old friend the clerk nipped through the registration cards rachel james yeah thats her wheres she from its a memphis address the clerk said whats her room number id like to say hello i cant give room numbers the clerk said the blonde quickly pulled two twenties from her purse and slid them across the counter i just want to say hello the clerk took the money room the woman paid in cash where are the phones around the corner the clerk said ray slid around the corner and found four pay phones he grabbed a middle one and began talking to himself the blonde took a phone on the end and turned her back to him she spoke softly he could hear only pieces checked in room mobile some help i cant an hour yes hurry she hung up and he talked louder into his dead phone ten minutes later there was a knock at the door the blonde jumped from the bed grabbed her and stuck it in the corduroys under the shirt she ignored the safety chain and cracked the door it burst open and knocked her against the wall ray lunged at her grabbed the gun and pinned her to the floor with her face in the carpet he stuck the barrel of the in her ear if you make a sound ill kill you she stopped struggling and closed her eyes no response who are you ray demanded he pushed the barrel deeper into her ear again no response not a move not a sound okay id love to blow your head off he relaxed still sitting on her back and ripped open her flight bag he dumped its contents on the floor and found a pair of clean tennis socks open your mouth he demanded she did not move the barrel returned to her ear and she slowly opened her mouth ray crammed the socks in between her teeth then tightly blindfolded her with the silk nightshirt he bound her feet and hands with panty hose then ripped the bedsheets into long strips the woman did not move when he finished the binding and gagging she resembled a mummy he slid her under the bed the purse contained six hundred dollars in cash and a wallet with an illinois drivers license karen adair from chicago date of birth march he took the wallet and gun the phone rang at am and mitch was not asleep he was in bank records up to his waist fascinating bank records highly incriminating hello he answered cautiously is this mission control the voice was in the vicinity of a loud jukebox where are you ray a joint called the floribama lounge right on the state line wheres abby shes in the car shes fine mitch breathed easier and grinned into the phone he listened we had to leave the hotel a woman followed abby in same woman you saw in some bar in the caymans abby is trying to explain everything the woman followed her all day and showed up at the hotel i took care of her and we disappeared you took care of her yeah she wouldnt talk but shes out of the way for a short time abbys fine yeah were both dead tired exactly what do you have in mind youre about three hours away from panama city beach i know youre dead tired but you need to get away from there get to panama city beach ditch the car and get two rooms at the holiday inn call me when you check in i hope you know what youre doing trust me ray i do but im beginning to wish i was back in prison you cant go back ray we either disappear or were dead the cab stopped at a red light in downtown nashville and mitch hopped out on stiff and aching legs he limped through the busy intersection dodging the morning traffic the southeastern bank building was a thirtystory glass cylinder designed along the same lines as a tennisball can the tint was dark almost black it stood prominently away from the street corner amidst a maze of sidewalks and fountains and manicured greenery mitch entered the revolving doors with a swarm of employees rushing to work in the marbleladen atrium he found the directory and rode the escalators to the third floor he opened a heavy glass door and walked into a large circular office a striking woman of forty or so watched him from behind the glass desk she offered no smile mr mason laycook please he said she pointed have a seat mr laycook wasted no time he appeared from around a corner and was as sour as his secretary may i help you he asked through his nose mitch stood yes i need to wire a little money yes do you have an account at southeastern yes and your name its a numbered account in other words you dont get a name mr laycook you dont need a name very well follow me his office had no windows no view a row of keyboards and monitors sat on the credenza behind his glass desk mitch sat down the account number please it came from memory laycook pecked at his keyboard and watched a monitor thats a code three account opened by a t hemphill with access only by her and a certain male meeting the following physical requirements approximately six feet tall one seventyfive to one eightyfive blue eyes brown hair about twentyfive or twentysix years old you fit that description sir laycook studied the screen and the last four digits of your social security number are very well you are accessed now what can i do for you i want to wire in some funds from a bank in grand cayman laycook frowned and took a pencil from his pocket which bank in grand cayman royal bank of montreal what type of account its a numbered account i presume you have the number dfh laycook wrote the number and stood ill be just a moment he left the room ten minutes passed mitch tapped his bruised feet and looked at the monitors across the desk laycook returned with his supervisor mr nokes a vice president of something nokes introduced himself from behind the desk both men appeared nervous they stared downward at mitch nokes did the talking he held a small sheet of computer paper sir that is a restricted account you must have certain information before we can start the wire mitch nodded confidently the dates and amounts of the last three deposits sir they watched him intently knowing he would fail again it came from memory no notes february third of this year six and a half million december fourteenth last year nine point two million and october eighth last year eleven million laycook and nokes gaped at the small printout nokes managed a tiny professional smile very well you are cleared to the pen number laycook stood ready with his pencil sir what is your pen number nokes asked mitch smiled and recrossed his damaged legs and the terms of the wire ten million dollars wired immediately into this bank account ill wait its not necessary to wait sir ill wait when the wire is complete ive got a few more for you well be a moment would you like some coffee no thanks do you have a newspaper certainly laycook said on the table there they scurried from the office and mitchs pulse began its descent he opened the nashville tennessean and scanned three sections before he found a brief paragraph about the escape at brushy mountain no picture few details they were safe at the holiday inn on the miracle strip in panama city beach florida their trail was clear so far he thought he hoped laycook returned alone he was friendly now a real backslapper wires complete the money is here now what can we do for you i want to wire it out most of it anyway how many transfers three give me the first one a million dollars to the coast national bank in pensacola to a numbered account accessible to only one person a white female approximately fifty years of age i will provide her with the pen number is this an existing account no i want you to open it with the wire very well the second transfer one million dollars to the dane county bank in danesboro kentucky to any account in the name of harold or maxine sutherland or both its a small bank but it has a correspondent relationship with united kentucky in louisville very well the third transfer seven million to the deutschebank in zurich account number bl the remainder of the money stays here this will take about an hour laycook said as he wrote ill call you in an hour to confirm very well thank you mr laycook each step was painful but the pain was not felt he moved in a controlled jog down the escalators and out of the building on the top floor of the royal bank of montreal grand cayman branch a secretary from wire transfers slid a computer printout under the very pointed and proper nose of randolph osgood she had circled an unusual transfer of ten million unusual because the money in this account did not normally return to the united states and unusual because it went to a bank they had never dealt with osgood studied the printout and called memphis mr tolar was on leave of absence the secretary informed him then nathan locke he asked mr locke is out of town victor milligan mr milligan is away also osgood placed the printout in the pile of things to do tomorrow along the emerald coast of florida and alabama from the outskirts of mobile east through pensacola fort walton beach destin and panama city the warm spring night had been peaceful only one violent crime along the coast a young woman was robbed beaten and raped in her room at the perdido beach hilton her boyfriend a tall blondheaded man with strong nordic features had found her bound and gagged in her room his name was rimmer aaron rimmer and he was from memphis the real excitement of the night was a massive manhunt in the mobile area for the escaped murderer ray mcdeere he had been seen arriving at the bus station after dark his mug shot was on the front page of the morning paper and before ten three witnesses had come forth and reported sightings his movements were traced across mobile bay to foley alabama then to gulf shores since the hilton is only ten miles from gulf shores along highway and since the only known escaped murderer was in the vicinity when the only violent crime occurred the conclusion was quick and inescapable the hotels night clerk made a probable id of ray mcdeere and the records reflected that he checked in around ninethirty as a mr lee stevens and he paid cash later the victim checked in and was attacked the victim also identified mr ray mcdeere the night clerk remembered that the victim asked about a rachel james who checked in five minutes before the victim and paid cash rachel james vanished sometime during the night without bothering to check out likewise for ray mcdeere alias lee stevens a parkinglot attendant made a probable id of mcdeere and said he got in a white fourdoor cutlass with a woman between midnight and one said she was driving and appeared to be in a hurry said they went east on calling from his room on the sixth floor of the hilton aaron rimmer anonymously told a baldwin county sheriffs deputy to check the car rental companies in mobile check them for an abby mcdeere thats your white cutlass he told him from mobile to miami the search began for the cutlass rented from avis by abby mcdeere the sheriffs investigator promised to keep the victims boyfriend aaron rimmer posted on all developments mr rimmer would wait at the hilton he shared a room with tony verkler next door was his boss devasher fourteen of his friends sat in their rooms on the seventh floor and waited it took seventeen trips from the apartment to the uhaul but by noon the bendini papers were ready for shipment mitch rested his swollen legs he sat on the couch and wrote instructions to tammy he detailed the transactions at the bank and told her to wait a week before contacting his mother she would soon be a millionaire he set the telephone in his lap and prepared himself for an unpleasant task he called the dane county bank and asked for harold sutherland it was an emergency he said hello his fatherinlaw answered angrily mr sutherland this is mitch have you wheres my daughter is she okay yes shes fine shes with me well be leaving the country for a few days maybe weeks maybe months i see he replied slowly and where might you be going not sure well just knock around for a while is something wrong mitch yes sir something is very wrong but i cant explain now maybe one of these days watch the newspapers closely youll see a major story out of memphis within two weeks are you in danger sort of have you received any unusual wire transfers this morning as a matter of fact we have somebody parked a million bucks here about an hour ago that somebody was me and the money is yours there was a very long pause mitch i think i deserve an explanation yes sir you do but i cant give you one if we make it safely out of the country youll be notified in a week or so enjoy the money gotta run mitch waited a minute and called room at the holiday inn panama city beach hello it was abby hi babe how are you terrible mitch rays picture is on the cover of every newspaper down here at first it was the escape and the fact that someone saw him in mobile now the tv news is claiming he is the prime suspect in a rape last night what where at the perdido beach hilton ray caught that blonde following me into the hotel he jumped her in her room and tied her up nothing serious he took her gun and her money and now shes claiming she was beaten and raped by ray mcdeere every cop in florida is looking for the car i rented last night in mobile wheres the car we left it about a mile west of here at a big condo development im so scared mitch wheres ray hes lying on the beach trying to sunburn his face the picture in the paper is an old one hes got long hair and looks real pale its not a good picture now hes got a crew cut and hes trying to turn pink i think it will help are both rooms in your name rachel james listen abby forget rachel and lee and ray and abby wait until almost dark then leave the rooms just walk away about a half a mile east is a small motel called the blue tide you and ray enjoy a little walk on the beach until you find it you go to the desk and get two rooms next to each other pay in cash tell them your name is jackie nagel got that jackie nagel use that name because when i get there ill ask for it what if they dont have two rooms next to each other okay if anything goes wrong two doors down is another dump called the seaside check in there same name im leaving here now say one oclock and i should be there in ten hours what if they find the car theyll find it and theyll throw a blanket over panama city beach youve got to be careful after dark try to sneak into a drugstore and buy some hair dye cut your hair extremely short and dye it blond blond or red i dont give a damn but change it tell ray not to leave his room do not take any chances hes got a gun mitch tell him i said not to use it there will be a thousand cops around there probably tonight he cant win a gunfight i love you mitch im so scared its okay to be scared babe just keep thinking they dont know where you are and they cant catch you if you move ill be there by midnight lamar quin wally hudson and kendall mahan sat in the conference room on the third floor and contemplated their next move as senior associates they knew about the fifth floor and the basement about mr lazarov and mr morolto about hodge and kozinski they knew that when one joined one did not leave they told their stories about the day they compared it to the day they learned the sad truth about santa claus a sad and frightening day when nathan locke talked to them in his office and told them about their biggest client and then he introduced them to devasher they were employees of the morolto family and they were expected to work hard spend their handsome paychecks and remain very quiet about it all three did there had been thoughts of leaving but never serious plans they were family men in time it sort of went away there were so many clean clients to work for so much hard legitimate work the partners handled most of the dirty work but growing seniority had brought increasing involvement in the conspiracy they would never be caught the partners assured them they were too smart they had too much money it was a perfect cover of particular concern at the conference table was the fact that the partners had skipped town there was not a single partner in memphis even avery tolar had disappeared he had walked out of the hospital they talked about mitch he was out there somewhere scared and running for his life if devasher caught him he was dead and they would bury him like hodge and kozinski but if the feds caught him they got the records and they got which of course included the three of them what if they speculated no one caught him what if he made it just vanished along with his documents of course what if he and abby were now somewhere on a beach drinking rum and counting their money they liked this thought and talked about it for a while finally they decided to wait until tomorrow if mitch was gunned down somewhere they would stay in memphis if he was never found they would stay in memphis if the feds caught him they would hit the road jack run mitch run the rooms at the blue tide motel were narrow and tacky the carpet was twenty years old and badly worn the bedspreads had cigarette burns but luxury was unimportant after dark thursday ray stood behind abby with a pair of scissors and snipped delicately around her ears two towels under the chair were covered with her dark hair she watched him carefully in the mirror next to the antique color television and was free with her instructions it was a boyish cut well above the ears with bangs he stepped back and admired his work not bad he said she smiled and brushed hair from her arms i guess i need to color it now she said sadly she walked to the tiny bathroom and closed the door she emerged an hour later as a blonde a yellowish blonde ray was asleep on the bedspread she knelt on the dirty carpet and scooped up the hair she picked it from the floor and filled a plastic garbage bag the empty dye bottle and the applicator were thrown in with the hair and she tied the bag there was a knock at the door abby froze and listened the curtains were pulled tightly she slapped rays feet another knock ray jumped from the bed and grabbed the gun who is it she whispered loudly at the window sam fortune he whispered back ray unlocked the door and mitch stepped in he grabbed abby and bearhugged ray the door was locked the lights turned off and they sat on the bed in the darkness he held abby tightly with so much to say the three said nothing a tiny weak ray of light from the outside filtered under the curtains and as minutes passed gradually lit the dresser and television no one spoke there were no sounds from the blue tide the parking lot was virtually empty i can almost explain why im here ray finally said but im not sure why youre here weve got to forget why were here mitch said and concentrate on leaving here all together all safe abbys told me everything ray said i dont know everything she said i dont know whos chasing us im assuming theyre all out there mitch said devasher and his gang are nearby pensacola i would guess its the nearest airport of any size tarrance is somewhere along the coast directing his boys in their allout search for ray mcdeere the rapist and his accomplice abby mcdeere what happens next abby asked theyll find the car if they havent already done so that will pinpoint panama city beach the paper said the search extended from mobile to miami so now theyre spread out when they find the car they zero in here now theres a thousand cheap motels just like this one along the strip for twelve miles nothing but motels condos and tshirt shops thats a lot of people a lot of tourists with shorts and sandals and tomorrow well be tourists too shorts sandals the whole bit i figure even if they have a hundred men after us weve got two or three days once they decide were here what happens she asked you and ray could have simply abandoned the car and taken off in another one they cant be certain were on the strip but theyll start looking here but theyre not the gestapo they cant crash a door and search without probable cause devasher can ray said yeah but theres a million doors around here theyll set up roadblocks and watch every store and restaurant theyll talk to every hotel clerk show them rays mug shot theyll swarm like ants for a few days and with luck theyll miss us what are you driving mitch ray asked a uhaul i dont understand why we dont get in the uhaul right now and haul ass i mean the car is sitting a mile down the road just waiting to be found and we know theyre coming i say we haul it listen ray they might be setting roadblocks right now trust me did i get you out of prison come on a siren went screaming past on the strip they froze and listened to it fade away okay gang mitch said were moving out i dont like this place the parking lot is empty and too close to the highway ive parked the uhaul three doors down at the elegant sea gulls rest motel ive got two lovely rooms there the roaches are much smaller were taking a quiet stroll on the beach then we get to unpack the truck sound exciting joey morolto and his squad of storm troopers landed at the pensacola airport in a chartered dc before sunrise friday lazarov waited with two limos and eight rented vans he briefed joey on the past twentyfour hours as the convoy left pensacola and traveled east on highway after an hour of briefing they arrived at a twelvefloor condo called the sandpiper in the middle of the strip at destin an hour from panama city beach the penthouse on the top floor had been procured by lazarov for only four thousand dollars a week offseason rates the remainder of the twelfth floor and all of the eleventh had been leased for the goons mr morolto snapped orders like an agitated drill sergeant a command post was set up in the great room of the penthouse overlooking the calm emerald water nothing suited him he wanted breakfast and lazarov sent two vans to a delchamps supermarket nearby he wanted mcdeere and lazarov asked him to be patient by daybreak the troops had settled into their condos they waited three miles away along the beach and within view of the sandpiper f denton voyles and wayne tarrance sat on the balcony of an eighthfloor room at the sandestin hilton they drank coffee watched the sun rise gently on the horizon and talked strategy the night had not gone well the car had not been found no sign of mitch with sixty fbi agents and hundreds of locals scouring the coast they should have at least found the car with each passing hour the mcdeeres were farther away in a file by a coffee table inside were the warrants for ray mcdeere the warrant read escape unlawful flight robbery and rape abbys sin was merely being an accomplice the charges for mitch required more creativity obstruction of justice and a nebulous racketeering charge and of course the old standby mail fraud tarrance was not sure where the mail fraud fit but he worked for the fbi and had never seen a case that did not include mail fraud the warrants were issued and ready and had been fully discussed with dozens of reporters from newspapers and television stations throughout the southeast trained to maintain a stone face and loathe the press tarrance was having a delightful time with the reporters publicity was needed publicity was critical the authorities must find the mcdeeres before the mob did rick acklin ran through the room to the balcony theyve found the car tarrance and voyles jumped to their feet where panama city beach in the parking lot of a high rise call our men in every one of them voyles yelled stop searching everywhere i want every agent in panama city beach well turn the place inside out get all the locals you can tell them to set up roadblocks on every highway and gravel road in and out of there dust the car for prints whats the town look like similar to destin a twelvemile strip along

and rays mug shot in the hands of every agent and cop i want people walking up and down the strip waving those damn composites yes sir how far away is panama city beach about fifty minutes due east get my car the phone woke aaron rimmer in his room at the perdido beach hilton it was the investigator with the baldwin county sheriffs department they found the car mr rimmer he said in panama city beach just a few minutes ago about a mile from the holiday inn on highway sorry again about the girl he said hope shes doing better he said mr rimmer said thanks and immediately called lazarov at the sandpiper ten minutes later he and his roommate tony and devasher and fourteen others were speeding east panama city beach was three hours away in destin lazarov mobilized the storm troopers they moved out quickly piled into the vans and headed east the blitzkrieg had begun it took only a matter of minutes for the uhaul to become a hot item the assistant manager of the rental company in nashville was a guy named billy weaver he opened the office early friday morning fixed his coffee and scanned the paper on the bottom half of the front page billy read with interest the story about ray mcdeere and the search along the coast and then abby was mentioned then the escapees brother mitch mcdeere was mentioned the name rang a bell billy opened a drawer and flipped through the records of outstanding rentals sure enough a man named mcdeere had rented a sixteenfooter late wednesday night m y mcdeere said the signature but the drivers license read mitchell y from memphis being a patriot and honest taxpayer billy called his cousin at metro police the cousin called the nashville fbi office and fifteen minutes later the uhaul was a hot item tarrance took the call on the radio while acklin drove voyles was in the back seat a uhaul why would he need a uhaul he left memphis without his car clothes shoes or toothbrush he left the dog unfed he took nothing with him so why the uhaul the bendini records of course either he left nashville with the records in the truck or he was in the truck en route to get them but why nashville mitch was up with the sun he took one long lustful look at his wife with the cute blond hair and forgot about sex it could wait he let her sleep he walked around the stacks of boxes in the small room and went to the bathroom he showered quickly and slipped on a gray sweat suit hed bought at a walmart in montgomery he eased along the beach for a half mile until he found a convenience store he bought a sackful of cokes pastries and chips sunglasses caps and three newspapers ray was waiting by the uhaul when he returned they spread the papers on rays bed it was worse than they expected mobile pensacola and montgomery had frontpage stories with composites of ray and mitch along with the mug shot again abbys composite had not been released according to the pensacola paper as composites go they were close here and there and badly off in other areas but it was hard to be objective hell mitch was staring at his own composite and trying to give an unbiased opinion about how close it was the stories were full of all sorts of wild statements from one wayne tarrance special agent fbi tarrance said mitchell mcdeere had been spotted in the gulf shorespensacola area that he and ray both were known to be heavily armed and extremely dangerous that they had vowed not to be taken alive that reward money was being gathered that if anyone saw a man who faintly resembled either of the mcdeere brothers please call the local police they ate pastries and decided the composites were not close the mug shot was even comical they eased next door and woke abby they began unpacking the bendini papers and assembling the video camera at nine mitch called tammy collect she had the new ids and passports he instructed her to federal express them to sam fortune front desk sea gulls rest motel highway west panama city beach florida she read to him the frontpage story about himself and his small gang no composites he told her to ship the passports then leave nashville drive four hours to knoxville check into a big motel and call him at room sea gulls rest he gave her the number two fbi agents knocked on the door of the old ragged trailer at san luis mr ainsworth came to the door in his underwear they flashed their badges so whatta you want with me he growled an agent handed him the morning paper do you know those two men he studied the paper i guess theyre my wifes boys never met them and your wifes name

not to my knowledge thanks mr ainsworth weve got orders to set up watch here in the street but we wont bother you good these boys are crazy ive always said that a mile away another pair of agents parked discreetly next to a waffle hut and set up watch by noon all highways and county roads into the coast around panama city beach were blocked along the strip cops stopped traffic every four miles they walked from one tshirt shop to the next handing out composites they posted them on the bulletin boards in shoneys pizza hut taco bell and a dozen more fastfood places they told the cashiers and waitresses to keep their eyes open for the mcdeeres very dangerous people lazarov and his men camped at the best western two miles west of the sea gulls rest he rented a large conference room and set up command four of his troops were dispatched to raid a tshirt shop and they returned with all sorts of tourist clothes and straw hats and caps he rented two ford escorts and equipped them with police scanners they patrolled the strip and listened to the endless squawking they immediately caught the search for the uhaul and joined in devasher strategically spread the rented vans along the strip they sat innocently in large parking lots and waited with their radios around two lazarov received an emergency call from an employee on the fifth floor of the bendini building two things first an employee snooping around the caymans had found an old locksmith who after being paid recalled making eleven keys around midnight of april eleven keys on two rings said the woman a very attractive american a brunette with nice legs had paid cash and was in a hurry said the keys had been easy except for the mercedes key he wasnt sure about that one second a banker from grand cayman called thursday at am ten million dollars had been wired from the royal bank of montreal to the southeastern bank in nashville between four and fourthirty the police scanners went wild the squawking was nonstop a clerk at the holiday inn made a probable id of abby as the woman who paid cash for two rooms at am thursday she paid for three nights but had not been seen since the rooms were cleaned around one on thursday evidently neither room had been slept in thursday night she had not checked out and the rooms were paid for through noon saturday the clerk saw no sign of a male accomplice the holiday inn was swamped with cops and fbi agents and morolto thugs for an hour tarrance himself interrogated the clerk they were there somewhere in panama city beach ray and abby were confirmed it was suspected mitch was with them but it was unconfirmed until friday afternoon the bombshell a county deputy pulled into a cheap motel and noticed the grayandwhite hood of a truck he walked between two buildings and smiled at the small uhaul truck hidden neatly between a row of twostory rooms and a large garbage dumpster he wrote down all the numbers on the truck and called it in it hit in five minutes the motel was surrounded the owner charged from the front office and demanded an explanation he looked at the composites and shook his head five fbi badges napped in his face and he became cooperative accompanied by a dozen agents he took the keys and went door to door fortyeight doors only seven were occupied the owner explained as he unlocked doors that it was a slow time of the year at the beachcomber inn all of the smaller motels struggle until memorial day he explained even the sea gulls rest four miles to the west was struggling andy patrick received his first felony conviction at the age of nineteen and served four months for bad checks branded as a felon he found honest work impossible and for the next twenty years worked unsuccessfully as a smalltime criminal he drifted across the country shoplifting writing bad checks and breaking into houses here and there a small frail nonviolent man he was severely beaten by a fat arrogant county deputy in texas when he was twentyseven he lost an eye and lost all respect for the law six months earlier he landed in panama city beach and found an honest job paying four bucks an hour working the night shift at the front and only desk of the sea gulls rest motel around nine friday night he was watching tv when a fat arrogant county deputy swaggered through the door got a manhunt going on he announced and laid copies of the composites and mug shot on the dirty counter looking for these folks we think theyre around here andy studied the composites the one of mitchell y mcdeere looked pretty familiar the wheels in his smalltime felonious brain began to churn with his one good eye he looked at the fat arrogant county deputy and said aint seen them but ill keep an eye out theyre dangerous the deputy said youre the dangerous one andy thought post these up on the wall there the deputy instructed do you own this damned place andy thought im sorry but im not authorized to post anything on the walls the deputy froze cocked his head sideways and glared at andy through thick sunglasses listen peewee i authorized it im sorry sir but i cant post anything on the walls unless my boss tells me to and where is your boss i dont know probably in a bar somewhere the deputy carefully picked up the composites walked behind the counter and tacked them on the bulletin board when he finished he glared down at andy and said ill come back in a coupla hours if you remove these ill arrest you for obstruction of justice andy did not flinch wont stick they got me for that one time in kansas so i know all about it the deputys fat cheeks turned red and he gritted his teeth youre a little smartass arent you yes sir you take these down and i promise you youll go to jail for something ive been there before and it aint no big deal red lights and sirens screamed by oiuihe strip a few feet away and the deputy turned and watched the excitement he mumbled something and swaggered out the door andy threw the composites in the garbage he watched the squad cars dodge each other on the strip for a few minutes then walked through the parking lot to the rear building he knocked on the door of room he waited and knocked again who is it a woman asked the manager andy replied proud of his title the door opened and the man who favored the composite of mitchell y mcdeere slid out yes sir he said whats going on he was nervous andy could tell cops just came by know what i mean what do they want he asked innocently your ass andy thought just asking questions and showing pictures i looked at the pictures you know uhhuh he said pretty good pictures andy said mr mcdeere stared at andy real hard andy said cop said one of them escaped from prison know what i mean i been in prison and i think everybody ought to escape you know mr mcdeere smiled a rather nervous smile whats your name he asked andy ive got a deal for you andy ill give you a thousand bucks now and tomorrow if youre still unable to recognize anybody ill give you another thousand bucks same for the next day a wonderful deal thought andy but if he could afford a thousand bucks a day certainly he could afford five thousand a day it was the opportunity of his career nope andy said firmly five thousand a day mr mcdeere never hesitated its a deal let me get the money he went in the room and returned with a stack of bills five thousand a day andy thats our deal andy took the money and glanced around he would count it later i guess you want me to keep the maids away andy asked great idea that would be nice another five thousand andy said mr mcdeere sort of hesitated okay ive got another deal tomorrow morning a fed ex package will arrive at the desk for sam fortune you bring it to me and keep the maids away and ill give you another five thousand wont work i do the night shift okay andy what if you worked all weekend around the clock kept the maids away and delivered my package can you do that sure my boss is a drunk hed love for me to work all weekend how much money andy go for it andy thought another twenty thousand mr mcdeere smiled you got it andy grinned and stuck the money in his pocket he walked away without saying a word and mitch retreated to room who was it ray snapped mitch smiled as he glanced between the blinds and the windows i knew we would have to have a lucky break to pull this off and i think we just found it mr morolto wore a black suit and a red tie and sat at the head of the plasticcoated executive conference table in the dunes room of the best western on the strip the twenty chairs around the table were packed with his best and brightest men around the four walls stood more of his trusted troops though they were thicknecked killers who did their deeds efficiently and without remorse they looked like clowns in their colorful shirts and wild shorts and amazing potpourri of straw hats he would have smiled at their silliness but the urgency of the moment prevented smiling he was listening on his immediate right was lou lazarov and on his immediate left was devasher and every ear in the small room listened as the two played tag team back and forth across the table theyre here i know theyre here devasher said dramatically slapping both palms on the table with each syllable the man had rhythm lazarovs turn i agree theyre here two came in a car one came in a truck weve found both vehicles abandoned covered with fingerprints yes theyre here devasher but why panama city beach it makes no sense lazarov for one hes been here before came here christmas remember hes familiar with this place so he figures with all these cheap motels on the beach its a great place to hide for a while not a bad idea really but hes had some bad luck for a man on the run hes carrying too much baggage like a brother who everybody wants and a wife and a truckload of documents we presume typical schoolboy mentality if i gotta run im taking everybody who loves me then his brother rapes a girl they think and suddenly every cop in alabama and florida is looking for them some pretty bad luck really what about his mother mr morolto asked lazarov and devasher nodded at the great man and acknowledged this very intelligent question lazarov no purely coincidental shes a very simple woman who serves waffles and knows nothing weve watched her since we got here devasher i agree theres been no contact morolto nodded intelligently and lit a cigarette lazarov so if theyre here and we know theyre here then the feds and the cops also know theyre here weve got sixty people here and they got hundreds odds are on them youre sure theyre all three together mr morolto asked devasher absolutely we know the woman and the convict checked in the same night at perdido that they left and three hours later she checked in here at the holiday inn and paid cash for two rooms and that she rented the car and his fingerprints were on it no doubt we know mitch rented a uhaul wednesday in nashville that he wired ten million bucks of our money into a bank in nashville thursday morning and then evidently hauled ass the uhaul was found here four hours ago yes sir they are together lazarov if he left nashville immediately after the money was wired he would have arrived here around dark the uhaul was found empty so they had to unload it somewhere around here then hide it that was probably sometime late last night thursday now you gotta figure they need to sleep sometime i figure they stayed here last night with plans of moving on today but they woke up this morning and their faces were in the paper cops running around bumping into each other and suddenly the roads were blocked so theyre trapped here devasher to get out theyve got to borrow rent or steal a car no rental records anywhere around here she rented a car in mobile in her name mitch rented a uhaul in nashville in his name real proper id so you gotta figure they aint that damned smart after all lazarov evidently they dont have fake ids if they rented a car around here for the escape the rental records would be in the real name no such records exist mr morolto waved his hand in frustration all right all right so theyre here you guys are geniuses im so proud of you now what devashers turn the fibbies are in the way theyre in control of the search and we cant do nothing but sit and watch lazarov ive called memphis every senior associate in is on the way down here they know mcdeere and his wife real well so well put them on the beach and in restaurants and hotels maybe theyll see something devasher i figure theyre in one of the little motels they can give fake names pay in cash and nobodyll be suspicious fewer people too less likelihood of being seen they checked in at the holiday inn but didnt stay long i bet they moved on down the strip lazarov first well get rid of the feds and the cops they dont know it yet but theyre about to move their show on down the road then early in the morning we start door to door at the small motels most of these dumps have less than fifty rooms i figure two of our men can search one in thirty minutes i know itll be slow but we cant just sit here maybe when the cops pull out the mcdeeres will breathe a little and make a mistake you mean you want our men to start searching hotel rooms mr morolto asked devasher theres no way we can hit every door but we gotta try mr morolto stood and glanced around the room so what about the water he asked in the direction of lazarov and devasher they stared at each other thoroughly confused by the question the water mr morolto screamed what about the water all eyes shot desperately around the table and quickly landed upon lazarov im sorry sir im confused mr morolto leaned into lazarovs face what about the water lou were on a beach right theres land and highways and railroads and airports on one side and theres water and boats on the other now if the roads are blocked and the airports and railroads are out of the question where do you think they might go it seems obvious to me they would try to find a boat and ease out in the dark makes sense dont it boys every head in the room nodded quickly devasher spoke first makes a hell of a lot of sense to me wonderful said mr morolto then where are our boats lazarov jumped from his seat turned to the wall and began barking orders at his lieutenants go down to the docks rent every fishing boat you can find for tonight and all day tomorrow pay them whatever they want dont answer any questions just pay em the money get our men on those boats and start patrolling as soon as possible stay within a mile of shore shortly before eleven friday night aaron rimmer stood at the checkout counter at an allnight texaco in tallahassee and paid for a root beer and twelve gallons of gas he needed change for the call outside next to the car wash he flipped through the blue pages and called the tallahassee police department it was an emergency he explained himself and the dispatcher connected him with a shift captain listen rimmer yelled urgently im here at this texaco and five minutes ago i saw these convicts everybody is looking for i know it was them which convicts asked the captain the mcdeeres two men and a woman i left panama city beach not two hours ago and i saw their pictures in the paper then i stopped here and filled up and i saw them rimmer gave his location and waited thirty seconds for the first patrol car to arrive with blue lights flashing it was quickly followed by a second third and fourth they loaded rimmer in a front seat and raced him to the south precinct the captain and a small crowd waited anxiously rimmer was escorted like a celebrity into the captains oflice where the three composites and mug shot were waiting on the desk thats them he shouted i just saw them not ten minutes ago they were in a green ford pickup with tennessee plates and it was pulling a long doubleaxle uhaul trailer exactly where were you asked the captain the cops hung on every word i was pumping gas pump number four regular unleaded and they eased into the parking lot real suspicious like they parked away from the pumps and the woman got out and went inside he picked up abbys composite and studied it yep thats her no doubt her hairs a lot shorter but its dark she came right back out didnt buy a thing she seemed nervous and in a hurry to get back to the truck i was finished pumping so i walked inside right when i opened the door they drove within two feet of me i saw all three of them who was driving asked the captain rimmer stared at rays mug shot not him the other one he pointed at mitchs composite could i see your drivers license a sergeant said rimmer carried three sets of identification he handed the sergeant an illinois drivers license with his picture and the name franktemple which direction were they headed the captain asked east at the same moment about four miles away tony verkler hung up the pay phone smiled to himself and returned to the burger king the captain was on the phone the sergeant was copying information from rimmertemples drivers license and a dozen cops chatted excitedly when a patrolman rushed into the office just got a call another sighting at a burger king east of town same info all three of them in a green ford pickup pulling a uhaul guy wouldnt leave a name but said he saw their pictures in the paper said they pulled through the carryout window bought three sacks of food and took off its gotta be them the captain said with a huge smile the bay county sheriff sipped thick black coffee from a styrofoam cup and rested his black boots on the executive conference table in the caribbean room at the holiday inn fbi agents were in and out fixing coffee whispering and updating each other on the latest his hero the big man himself director f denton voyles sat across the table and studied a street map with three of his underlings imagine denton voyles in bay county the room was a beehive of police activity florida state troopers filtered in and out radios and telephones rang and squawked on a makeshift command post in a corner sheriffs deputies and city policemen from three counties loitered about thrilled with the chase and suspense and presence of all those fbi agents and voyles a deputy burst through the door with a wildeyed glow of sheer excitement just got a call from tallahassee theyve got two positive ids in the last fifteen minutes all three of them in a green ford pickup with tennessee tags voyles dropped his street map and walked over to the deputy where were the sightings the room was silent except for the radios first one was at a texaco quick shop second one was four miles away at a burger king they drove through the drivein window both witnesses were positive and gave identical ids voyles turned to the sheriff sheriff call tallahassee and confirm how far away is it the black boots hit the floor hour and a half straight down interstate voyles pointed at tarrance and they stepped into a small room used as the bar the quiet roar returned to mission control if the sightings are real voyles said quietly in tarranees face were wasting our time here yes sir they sound legitimate a single sighting could be a fluke or a prank but two that close together sound awfully legitimate how the hell did they get out of here its gotta be that woman chief shes been helping him for a month i dont know who she is or where he found her but shes on the outside watching us and feeding him whatever he needs do you think shes with them doubt it shes probably just following closely away from the action and taking directions from him hes brilliant wayne hes been planning this for months evidently you mentioned the bahamas once yes sir the million bucks we paid him was wired to a bank in freeport he later told me it didnt stay there long you think maybe hes headed there who knows obviously he has to get out of the country i talked to the warden today he told me ray mcdeere can speak five or six languages fluently they could be going anywhere i think we should pull out voyles said lets get the roadblocks set up around tallahassee they wont last long if weve got a good description of the vehicle we should have them by morning i want every cop in central florida on the highways in an hour roadblocks everywhere every ford pickup is automatically searched okay our men will wait here until daybreak then well pull up stakes yes sir tarrance answered with a weary grin word of the tallahassee sightings spread instantly along the emerald coast panama city beach relaxed the mcdeeres were gone for reasons unknown only to them their flight had moved inland sighted and positively identified not once but twice they were now somewhere else speeding desperately toward the inevitable confrontation on the side of a dark highway the cops along the coast went home a few roadblocks remained through the night in bay county and gulf county the predawn hours of saturday were almost normal both ends of the strip remained blocked with cops making cursory exams of drivers licenses the roads north of town were free and clear the search had moved east on the outskirts of ocala florida near silver springs on highway tony verkler lumbered from a eleven and stuck a quarter in a pay phone he called the ocala police department with the urgent report that he had just seen those three convicts everybody was looking for up around panama city beach the mcdeeres said he saw their pictures in the paper the day before when he was driving through pensacola and now he had just seen them the dispatcher informed him all patrolmen were on the scene of a bad accident and asked if he would mind driving over to the police station so they could file a report tony said he was in a hurry but since it was somewhat important he would be there in a minute when he arrived the chief of police was waiting in a tshirt and blue jeans his eyes were swollen and red and his hair was not in place he led tony into his office and thanked him for coming by he took notes as tony explained how he was pumping gas in front of the eleven and a green ford pickup with a uhaul trailer behind it pulled up next to the store and a woman got out and used the phone tony was in the process he explained of driving from mobile to miami and had driven through the manhunt up around panama city he had seen the newspapers and had been listening to his radio and knew all about the three mcdeeres anyway he went in and paid for the gas and thought that he had seen the woman somewhere before then he remembered the papers he walked over to a magazine rack in the front window and got a good look at the men no doubt in his mind she hung up got back in the truck between the men and they left green ford with tennessee plates the chief thanked him and called the marion county sheriffs department tony said goodbye and returned to his car where aaron rimmer was asleep in the back seat they headed north in the direction of panama city beach saturday am andy patrick looked east and west along the strip then walked quickly across the parking lot to room he knocked gently after a delay she asked who is it the manager he answered the door opened and the man who resembled the composite of mitchell y mcdeere slid out his hair was now very short and goldcolored andy stared at his hair good morning andy he said politely while glancing around the parking lot good morning i was kinda wondering if you folks were still here mr mcdeere nodded and continued to look around the parking lot i mean according to the television this morning you folks traveled halfway across florida last night yeah were watching it theyre playing games arent they andy andy kicked at a rock on the sidewalk television said there were three positive identifications last night at three different places kinda strange i thought i was here all night working and being on the lookout and all and i didnt see you leave before sunrise i sneaked across the highway to a coffee shop just over there and as usual there were cops in there i sat close to them according to them the search has been called off around here they said the fbi moved out right after the last sighting came in around four this morning most of the other cops left too theyre gonna keep the strip blocked until noon and call it off rumor has it youve got help from the outside and youre trying to get to the bahamas mr mcdeere listened closely as he watched the parking lot what else did they say they kept talking about a uhaul truck full of stolen goods and how they found the truck and it was empty and how nobody can figure out how you loaded the stolen goods into a trailer and sneaked outta town right under their noses theyre very impressed all right of course i didnt say nothing but i figured it was the same uhaul you drove in here thursday night mr mcdeere was deep in thought and did not say anything he didnt appear to be nervous andy studied his face carefully you dont seem too pleased andy said i mean the cops are leaving and calling off the search thats good aint it andy can i tell you something sure its more dangerous now than before andy thought about this for a long minute then said hows that the cops just wanted to arrest me andy but there are some people who want to kill me professional killers andy many of them and theyre still here andy narrowed his good eye and stared at mr mcdeere professional killers around here on the strip andy took a step backward he wanted to ask exactly who they were and why they were chasing him but he knew he wouldnt get much of an answer he saw an opportunity why dont you escape escape how could we escape andy kicked another rock and nodded in the direction of a pontiac bonneville parked behind the office well you could use my car you could get in the trunk all three of you and i could drive you outta town you dont appear to be broke so you could catch a plane and be gone just like that and how much would that cost andy studied his feet and scratched his ear the guy was probably a doper he thought and the boxes were probably full of cocaine and cash and the colombians were probably after him thatd be pretty expensive you know i mean right now at five thousand a day im just an innocent motel clerk whos not very observant not part of nothing you understand but if i drive you outta here then i become an accomplice subject to indictment and jail and all that other crap ive been through you know so itd be pretty expensive how much andy a hundred thousand mr mcdeere did not flinch or react he just kept a straight face and glanced across the beach to the ocean andy knew immediately it was not out of the question let me think about it andy for right now you keep your eyes open now that the cops are gone the killers will move in this could be a very dangerous day andy and i need your help if you see anyone suspicious around here call us quick were not leaving these rooms okay andy returned to the front desk any fool would jump in the trunk and haul ass it was the boxes the stolen goods thats why they wouldnt leave the mcdeeres enjoyed a light breakfast of stale pastries and warm soft drinks ray was dying for a cold beer but another trip to the convenience store was too risky they ate quickly and watched the earlymorning news occasionally a station along the coast would flash their composites on the screen it scared them at first but they got used to it a few minutes after am saturday mitch turned off the television and resumed his spot on the floor among the boxes he picked up a stack of documents and nodded at abby the camera operator the deposition continued lazarov waited until the maids were on duty then scattered his troops along the strip they worked in pairs knocking on doors peeking in windows and sliding through dark hallways most of the small places had two or three maids who knew every room and every guest the procedure was simple and most of the time it worked a goon would find a maid hand her a hundreddollar bill and show her the composites if she resisted he would continue giving money until she became cooperative if she was unable to make the id he would ask if she had noticed a uhaul truck or a room full of boxes or two men and a woman acting suspicious or scared or anything unusual if the maid was of no help he would ask which rooms were occupied then go knock on the doors start with the maids lazarov had instructed them enter from the beach side stay away from the front desks pretend to be cops and if you hit pay dirt kill them instantly and get to a phone devasher placed four of the rented vans along the strip near the highway lamar quin kendall mahan wally hudson and jack aldrich posed as drivers and watched every vehicle that passed they had arrived in the middle of the night on a private plane with ten other senior associates of bendini lambert locke in the souvenir shops and cafes the former friends and colleagues of mitch mcdeere milled about with the tourists and secretly hoped they would not see him the partners had been called home from airports around the country and by midmorning they were walking the beach and inspecting pools and hotel lobbies nathan locke stayed behind with mr morolto but the rest of the partners disguised themselves with golf caps and sunglasses and took orders from general devasher only avery tolar was missing since walking out of the hospital he had not been heard from including the thirtythree lawyers mr morolto had almost a hundred men participating in his private little manhunt at the blue tide motel a janitor took a hundreddollar bill looked at the composites and said he thought he might have seen the woman and one of the men check into two rooms early thursday evening he stared at abbys sketch and became convinced it was her he took some more money and went to the office to check the registration records he returned with the information that the woman had checked in as jackie nagel and paid cash for two rooms for thursday friday and saturday he took some more money and the two gunmen followed him to the rooms he knocked on both doors no answer he unlocked them and allowed his new friends to inspect them the rooms had not been used friday night one of the troops called lazarov and five minutes later devasher was poking around the rooms looking for clues he found none but the search was immediately constricted to a fourmile stretch of beach between the blue tide and the beachcomber where the uhaul was found the vans moved the troops closer the partners and senior associates scoured the beach and restaurants and the gunmen knocked on doors andy signed the federal express ticket at and inspected the package for sam fortune it had been shipped by doris greenwood whose address was listed as poplar avenue memphis tennessee no phone number he was certain it was valuable and for a moment contemplated another quick profit but its delivery had already been contracted for he gazed along both ends of the strip and left the office with the package after years of dodging and hiding andy had subconsciously trained himself to walk quickly in the shadows near the corners never in the open as he turned the corner to cross the parking lot he saw two men knocking on the door to room the room happened to be vacant and he was immediately suspicious of the two they wore oddfitting matching white shorts that fell almost to their knees although it was difficult to tell exactly where the shorts stopped and the snowwhite legs began one wore dark socks with battered loafers the other wore cheap sandals and walked in obvious pain white panama hats adorned their beefy heads after six months on the strip andy could spot a fake tourist the one beating on the door hit it again and when he did andy saw the bulge of a large handgun stuck in the back of his shorts he quickly retraced his quiet footsteps and returned to the office he called room and asked for sam fortune this is sam sam this is andy at the desk dont look out but there are two very suspicious men knocking on doors across the parking lot are they cops i dont think so they didnt check in here where are the maids sam asked they dont come in till eleven on saturday good were turning off the lights watch them and call when they leave from a dark window in a closet andy watched the men go from door to door knocking and waiting occasionally getting one to open eleven of the fortytwo rooms were occupied no response at and they returned to the beach and disappeared professional killers at his motel across the strip in the parking lot of a miniature golf course andy saw two identical fake tourists talking to a man in a white van they pointed here and there and seemed to be arguing he called sam listen sam theyregone but this place is crawling with these people how many i can see two more across the strip you folks better run for it relax andy they wont see us if we stay in here but you cant stay forever my bossll catch on before much longer were leaving soon andy what about the package its here good i need to see it say andy what about food could you ease across the street and get something hot andy was a manager not a porter but for five thousand a day the sea gulls rest could provide a little room service sure be there in a minute wayne tarrance grabbed the phone and fell across the single bed in his ramada inn room in orlando he was exhausted furious baffled and sick of f denton voyles it was pm saturday he called memphis the secretary had nothing to report except that mary alice called and wanted to talk to him they had traced the call to

take a nap you gotta be tired ill call around five or six tarrance laid the phone on the nightstand and took a nap the dragnet lost its steam saturday afternoon when the panama city beach police received the fourth complaint from motel owners the cops were dispatched to the breakers motel where an irate owner told of armed men harassing the guests more cops were sent to the strip and before long they were searching the motels for gunmen who were searching for the mcdeeres the emerald coast was on the brink of war weary and hot devashers men were forced to work alone they spread themselves even thinner along the beach and stopped the doortodoor work they lounged in plastic chairs around the pools watching the tourists come and go they lay on the beach dodging the sun hiding behind dark shades watching the tourists come and go as dusk approached the army of goons and thugs and gunmen and lawyers slipped into the darkness and waited if the mcdeeres were going to move they would do it at night a silent army waited for them devashers thick forearms rested uncomfortably on a balcony railing outside his best western room he watched the empty beach below as the sun slowly disappeared on the horizon aaron rimmer walked through the sliding glass door and stopped behind devasher we found tolar rimmer said devasher did not move where hiding in his girlfriends apartment in memphis was he alone yeah they iced him made it look like a robbery in room ray inspected for the hundredth time the new passports visas drivers licenses and birth certificates the passport photos for mitch and abby were current with plenty of dark hair after the escape time would take care of the blondness rays photo was a slightly altered harvard law school mug shot of mitch with the long hair stubble and rough academic looks the eyes noses and cheekbones were similar after careful analysis but nothing else the documents were in the names of lee stevens rachel james and sam fortune all with addresses in murfreesboro tennessee doc did good work and ray smiled as he studied each one abby packed the sony video camera into its box the tripod was folded and leaned against the wall fourteen videocassette tapes with stickon labels were stacked neatly on the television after sixteen hours the video deposition was over starting with the first tape mitch had faced the camera raised his right hand and sworn to tell the truth he stood next to the dresser with documents covering the floor around him using tammys notes summaries and flowcharts he methodically walked through the bank records first he identified over two hundred and fifty secret accounts in eleven cayman banks some had names but most were just numbered using copies of computer printouts he constructed the histories of the accounts cash deposits wire transfers and withdrawals at the bottom of each document used in his deposition he wrote with a black marker the initials mm and then the exhibit number mm mm mm and so on after exhibit mm he had identified nine hundred million dollars hiding in cayman banks after the bank records he painstakingly pieced together the structure of the empire in twenty years more than four hundred cayman corporations had been chartered by the moroltos and their incredibly rich and incredibly corrupt attorneys many of the corporations owned all or pieces of each other and used the banks as registered agents and permanent addresses mitch learned quickly that he had only a fraction of the records and speculated on camera that most documents were hidden in the basement in memphis he also explained for the benefit of the jury that it would take a small army of irs investigators a year or so to piece together the morolto corporate puzzle he slowly explained each exhibit marked it carefully and filed it away abby operated the camera ray watched the parking lot and studied the fake passports he testified for six hours on various methods used by the moroltos and their attorneys to turn dirty money into clean easily the most favored method was to fly in a load of dirty cash on a bendini plane usually with two or three lawyers on board to legitimate the trip with dope pouring in by land air and sea us customs cares little about whats leaving the country it was a perfect setup the planes left dirty and came back clean once the money landed on grand cayman a lawyer on board handled the required payoffs to cayman customs and to the appropriate banker on some loads up to twentyfive percent went for bribes once deposited usually in unnamed numbered accounts the money became almost impossible to trace but many of the bank transactions coincided nicely with significant corporate events the money was usually deposited into one of a dozen numbered holding accounts or super accounts as mitch called them he gave the jury these account numbers and the names of the banks then as the new corporations were chartered the money was transferred from the super accounts to the corporate accounts often in the same bank once the dirty money was owned by a legitimate cayman corporation the laundering began the simplest and most common method was for the company to purchase real estate and other clean assets in the united states the transactions were handled by the creative attorneys at bendini lambert locke and all money moved by wire transfer often the cayman corporation would purchase another cayman corporation that happened to own a panama corporation that owned a holding company in denmark the danes would purchase a ballbearing factory in toledo and wire in the purchase money from a subsidiary bank in munich and the dirty money was now clean after marking exhibit mm mitch quit the deposition sixteen hours of testimony was enough it would not be admissible at trial but it would serve its purpose tarranee and his buddies could show the tapes to a grand jury and indict at least thirty lawyers from the bendini firm he could show the tapes to a federal magistrate and get his search warrants mitch had held to his end of the bargain although he would not be around to testify in person he had been paid only a million dollars and was about to deliver more than was expected he was physically and emotionally drained and sat on the edge of the bed with the lights off abby sat in a chair with her eyes closed ray peeked through the blinds we need a cold beer he said forget it mitch snapped ray turned and stared at him relax little brother its dark and the store is just a short walk down the beach i can take care of myself forget it ray there is no need to take chances were leaving in a few hours and if all goes well youll have the rest of your life to drink beer ray was not listening he pulled a baseball cap firmly over his forehead stuck some cash in his pockets and reached for the gun ray please at least forget the gun mitch pleaded ray stuck the gun under his shirt and eased out the door he walked quickly in the sand behind the small motels and shops hiding in the shadows and craving a cold beer he stopped behind the convenience store looked quickly around and was certain no one was watching then walked to the front door the beer cooler was in the rear in the parking lot next to the strip lamar quin hid under a large straw hat and made small talk with some teenagers from indiana he saw ray enter the store and thought he might recognize something there was a casualness about the mans stride that looked vaguely familiar lamar moved to the front window and glanced in the direction of the beer cooler the mans eyes were covered with sunglasses but the nose and cheekbones were certainly familiar lamar eased inside the small store and picked up a sack of potato chips he waited at the checkout counter and came facetoface with the man who was not mitchell mcdeere but greatly resembled him it was ray it had to be the face was sunburned and the hair was too short to be stylish the eyes were covered same height same weight same walk hows it going lamar said to the man fine you the voice was similar lamar paid for his chips and returned to the parking lot he calmly dropped the bag in a garbage can next to a phone booth and quickly walked next door to a souvenir shop to continue his search for the mcdeeres arkness brought a cool breeze to the beach along the strip the sun disappeared quickly and there was no moon to replace it a distant ceiling of harmless dark clouds covered the sky and the water was black darkness brought fishermen to the dan russell pier in the center of the strip they gathered in groups of three and four along the concrete structure and stared silently as their lines ran into the black water twenty feet below they leaned motionless on the railing occasionally spitting or talking to a friend they enjoyed the breeze and the quietness and the still water much more than they enjoyed the occasional fish that ventured by and hit a hook they were vacationers from the north who spent the same week each year at the same motel and came to the pier each night in the darkness to fish and marvel at the sea between them sat buckets full of bait and small coolers full of beer from time to time throughout the night a nonfisherman or a pair of lovebirds would venture onto the pier and walk a hundred yards to the end of it they would gaze at the black gentle water for a few minutes then turn and admire the glow of a million flickering lights along the strip they would watch the inert huddled fishermen leaning on their elbows the fishermen did not notice them the fishermen did not notice aaron rimmer as he casually walked behind them around eleven he smoked a cigarette at the end of the pier and tossed the butt into the ocean he gazed along the beach and thought of the thousands of motel rooms and condos the dan russell pier was the westernmost of the three at panama city beach it was the newest the longest and the only one built with nothing but concrete the other two were older and wooden in the center there was a small brick building containing a tackle shop a snack bar and rest rooms only the rest rooms were open at night it was probably a half mile east of the sea gulls rest at eleventhirty abby left room eased by the dirty pool and began walking east along the beach she wore shorts a white straw hat and a windbreaker with the collar turned up around her ears she walked slowly with her hands thrust deep in the pockets like an experienced contemplative beachcomber five minutes later mitch left the room eased by the dirty pool and followed her footsteps he gazed at the ocean as he walked two joggers approached splashing in the water and talking between breaths on a string around his neck and tucked under his black cotton shirt was a whistle just in case in all four pockets he had crammed sixty thousand in cash he looked at the ocean and nervously watched abby ahead of him when he was two hundred yards down the beach ray left room for the last time he locked it and kept a key wrapped around his waist was a fortyfoot piece of black nylon rope the gun was stuck under it a bulky windbreaker covered it all nicely andy had charged another two thousand for the clothing and items ray eased onto the beach he watched mitch and could barely see abby the beach was deserted it was almost midnight saturday and most of the fishermen had left the pier for another night abby saw three in a small cluster near the rest rooms she slipped past them and nonchalantly strolled to the end of the pier where she leaned on the concrete railing and stared at the vast blackness of the gulf red buoy lights were scattered as far as she could see blue and white channel lights formed a neat line to the east a blinking yellow light on some vessel inched away on the horizon she was alone at the end of the pier mitch hid in a beach chair under a folded umbrella near the entrance to the pier he could not see her but had a good view of the ocean fifty feet away ray sat in the darkness on a brick ledge his feet dangled in the sand they waited they checked their watches at precisely midnight abby nervously unzipped her windbreaker and untied a heavy flashlight she glanced at the water below and gripped it fiercely she shoved it into her stomach shielded it with the windbreaker aimed at the sea and pushed the switch three times on and off on and off on and off the green bulb flashed three times she held it tightly and stared at the ocean no response she waited an eternity and two minutes later flashed again three times no response she breathed deeply and spoke to herself be calm abby be calm hes out there somewhere she flashed three more times then waited no response mitch sat on the edge of the beach chair and anxiously surveyed the sea from the corner of an eye he saw a figure walking almost running from the west it jumped onto the steps of the pier it was the nordic mitch bolted across the beach after him aaron rimmer walked behind the fishermen around the small building and watched the woman in the white hat at the end of the pier she was bent over clutching something it flashed again three times he walked silently up to her abby she jerked around and tried to scream rimmer lunged at her and shoved her into the railing from the darkness mitch dived head first into the nordics legs and all three went down hard on the slick concrete mitch felt the gun at the nordics back he swung wildly with a forearm and missed rimmer whirled and landed a wicked smash to mitchs left eye abby kicked and crawled away mitch was blind and dazed rimmer stood quickly and reached for the gun but never found it ray charged like a battering ram and sent the nordic crashing into the railing he landed four bulletlike jabs to the eyes and nose each one drawing blood skills learned in prison the nordic fell to all fours and ray snapped his head with four powerful kicks he groaned pitifully and fell face first ray removed the gun and handed it to mitch who was standing now and trying to focus with his good eye abby watched the pier no one start flashing ray said as he unwound the rope from his waist abby faced the water shielded the flashlight found the switch and began flashing like crazy whatre you gonna do mitch whispered watching ray and the rope two choices we can either blow his brains out or drown him oh my god abby said as she flashed dont fire the gun mitch whispered thank you ray said he grabbed a short section of rope twisted it tightly around the nordics neck and pulled mitch turned his back and stepped between the body and abby she did not try to watch im sorry we have no choice ray mumbled almost to himself there was no resistance no movement from the unconscious man after three minutes ray exhaled loudly and announced hes dead he tied the other end of the rope to a post slid the body under the railing and lowered it quietly into the water im going down first ray said as he crawled through the railing and slid down the rope eight feet under the deck of the pier an iron cross brace was attached to two of the thick concrete columns that disappeared into the water it made a nice hideout abby was next ray grabbed her legs as she clutched the rope and eased downward mitch with his one eye lost his equilibrium and almost went for a swim but they made it they sat on the cross brace ten feet above the cold dark water ten feet above the fish and the barnacles and the body of the nordic ray cut the rope so the corpse could fall to the bottom properly before it made its ascent in a day or two they sat like three owls on a limb watching the buoy lights and channel lights and waiting for the messiah to come walking across the water the only sounds were the soft splashing of the waves below and the steady clicking of the flashlight and then voices from the deck above nervous anxious panicked voices searching for someone then they were gone well little brother what do we do now ray whispered plan b mitch said and whats that start swimming very funny abby said clicking away an hour passed the iron brace though perfectly located was not comfortable have you noticed those two boats out there ray asked quietly the boats were small about a mile oifshore and for the past hour had been cruising slowly and suspiciously back and forth in sight of the beach i think theyre fishing boats mitch said who fishes at one oclock in the morning ray asked the three of them thought about this there was no explanation abby saw it first and hoped and prayed it was not the body now floating toward them over there she said pointing fifty yards out to sea it was a black object resting on the water and moving slowly in their direction they watched intently then the sound like that of a sewing machine keep flashing mitch said it grew closer it was a man in a small boat abanks mitch whispered loudly the humming noise died abanks he said again where the hell are you came the reply over here under the pier hurry dammit the hum grew louder and abanks parked an eightfoot rubber raft under the pier they swung from the brace and landed in one joyous pile they quietly hugged each other then hugged abanks he revved up the fivehorsepower electric trolling motor and headed for open water where have you been mitch asked cruising abanks answered nonchalantly why are you late im late because ive been dodging these fishing boats filled with idiots in tourist clothes posing as fishermen you think theyre moroltos or fibbies abby asked well if theyre idiots they could be either one what happened to your green light abanks pointed to a flashlight next to the motor battery went dead the boat was a fortyfoot schooner that abanks had found in jamaica for only two hundred thousand a friend waited by the ladder and helped them aboard his name was george just george and he spoke english with a quick accent abanks said he could be trusted theres whiskey if you like in the cabinet abanks said ray found the whiskey abby found a blanket and lay down on a small couch mitch stood on the deck and admired his new boat when abanks and george had the raft aboard mitch said lets get out of here can we leave now as you wish george snapped properly mitch gazed at the lights along the beach and said farewell he went below and poured a cup of scotch wayne tarrance slept across the bed in his clothes he had not moved since the last call six hours earlier the phone rang beside him after four rings he found it hello his voice was slow and scratchy wayne baby did i wake you of course you can have the documents now room sea gulls rest motel highway panama city beach the desk clerk is a guy named andy and hell let you in the room be careful with them our friend has them all marked real nice and precise and hes got sixteen hours of videotape so be gentle i have a question tarrance said sure big boy anything where did he find you this wouldve been impossible without you gee thanks wayne he found me in memphis we got to be friends and he offered me a bunch of money how much why is that important wayne ill never have to work again gotta run baby its been real fun where is he as we speak hes on a plane to south america but please dont waste your time trying to catch him wayne baby i love you but you couldnt even catch him in memphis bye now she was gone sunday the fortyfoot schooner sped south with full sails under a clear sky abby was in a deep sleep in the master suite ray was in a scotchinduced coma on a couch abanks was somewhere below catching a nap mitch sat on the deck sipping cold coffee and listening to george expound on the basics of sailing he was in his late fifties with long gray bleached hair and dark suncured skin he was small and wiry much like abanks he was australian by birth but twentyeight years earlier had fled his country after the largest bank heist in its history he and his partner split eleven million in cash and silver and went their separate ways his partner was now dead he had heard george was not his real name but hed used it for twentyeight years and forgotten the real one he discovered the caribbean in the late sixties and after seeing its thousands of small primitive englishspeaking islands decided hed found home he put his money in banks in the bahamas belize panama and of course grand cayman he built a small compound on a deserted stretch of beach on little cayman and had spent the past twentyone years touring the caribbean in his thirtyfoot schooner during the summer and early fall he stayed close to home but from october to june he lived on his boat and hopped from island to island hed been to three hundred of them in the caribbean he once spent two years just in the bahamas there are thousands of islands he explained and theyll never find you if you move a lot are they still looking for you mitch asked i dont know i cant call and ask you know but i doubt it wheres the safest place to hide on this boat its a nice little yacht and once you learn to sail it itll be your home find you a little island somewhere perhaps little cayman or braetheyre both still primitiveand build a house do as ive done and spend most of your time on this boat when do you stop worrying about being chased oh i still think about it you know but i dont worry about it how much did you get away with eight million give or take mitch said thats nice youve got the money to do as you please so forget about them just tour the islands for the rest of your life there are worse things you know for days they sailed toward cuba then around it in the direction of jamaica they watched george and listened to his lectures after twenty years of sailing through the caribbean he was a man of great knowledge and patience ray the linguist listened to and memorized words like spinnaker mast bow stern aft tiller halyard winches masthead fittings shrouds lifelines stanchions sheet winch bow pulpit coamings transom clew outhaul genoa sheets mainsail jib jibstays jib sheets cam cleats and boom vangs george lectured on heeling luffing running blanketing backwinding heading up trimming and pointing ray absorbed the language of sailing mitch studied the technique abby stayed in the cabin saying little and smiling only when necessary life on a boat was not something she dreamed about she missed her house and wondered what would happen to it maybe mr rice would cut the grass and pull the weeds she missed the shady streets and neat lawns and the small gangs of children riding bicycles she thought of her dog and prayed that mr rice would adopt it she worried about her parentstheir safety and their fear when would she see them again it would be years she decided and she could live with that if she knew they were safe her thoughts could not escape the present the future was inconceivable during the second day of the rest of her life she began writing letters letters to her parents kay quin mr rice and a few friends the letters would never be mailed she knew but it helped to put the words on paper mitch watched her carefully but left her alone he had nothing to say really maybe in a few days they could talk by the end of the fourth day wednesday grand cayman was in sight they circled it slowly once and anchored a mile from shore after dark barry abanks said goodbye the mcdeeres simply thanked him and he eased away in the rubber raft he would land three miles from bodden town at another dive lodge then call one of his dive captains to come get him he would know if anyone suspicious had been around abanks expected no trouble georges compound on little cayman consisted of a small main house of whitepainted wood and two smaller outbuildings it was inland a quarter of a mile on a tiny bay the nearest house could not be seen a native woman lived in the smallest building and maintained the place her name was fay the mcdeeres settled in the main house and tried to begin the process of starting over ray the escapee roamed the beaches for hours and kept to himself he was euphoric but could not show it he and george took the boat out for several hours each day and drank scotch while exploring the islands they usually returned drunk abby spent the first days in a small room upstairs overlooking the bay she wrote more letters and began a diary she slept alone twice a week fay drove the volkswagen bus into town for supplies and mail she returned one day with a package from barry abanks george delivered it to mitch inside the package was a parcel sent to abanks from doris greenwood in miami mitch ripped open the thick legalsized envelope and found three newspapers two from atlanta and one from miami the headlines told of the mass indicting of the bendini law firm in memphis fiftyone present and former members of were indicted along with thirtyone alleged members of the morolto crime family in chicago more indictments were coming promised the us attorney just the tip of the iceberg director f denton voyles allowed himself to be quoted as saying it was a major blow to organized crime in america it should be a dire warning he said to legitimate professionals and businessmen who are tempted to handle dirty money mitch folded the newspapers and went for a long walk on the beach under a cluster of palms he found some shade and sat down the atlanta paper listed the names of every bendini lawyer indicted he read them slowly there was no joy in seeing the names he almost felt sorry for nathan locke almost wally hudson kendall mahan jack aldrich and finally lamar quin he could see their faces he knew their wives and their children mitch gazed across the brilliant ocean and thought about lamar and kay quin he loved them and he hated them they had helped seduce him into and they were not without blame but they were his friends what a waste maybe lamar would only serve a couple of years and then be paroled maybe kay and the kids could survive maybe i love you mitch abby was standing behind him she held a plastic pitcher and two cups he smiled at her and waved to the sand next to him whats in the pitcher rum punch fay mixed it for us is it strong she sat next to him on the sand its mostly rum i told fay we needed to get drunk and she agreed he held her tightly and sipped the rum punch they watched a small fishing boat inch through the sparkling water are you scared mitch terrified me too this is crazy but we made it abby were alive were safe were together but what about tomorrow and the next day i dont know abby things could be worse you know my name could be in the paper there with the other freshly indicted defendants or we could be dead there are worse things than sailing around the caribbean with eight million bucks in the bank do you think my parents are safe i think so what would morolto have to gain by harming your parents theyre safe abby she refilled the cups with rum punch and kissed him on the cheek ill be okay mitch as long as were together i can handle anything abby mitch said slowly staring at the water i have a confession to make im listening the truth is i never wanted to be a lawyer anyway oh really naw secretly ive always wanted to be a sailor is that so have you ever made love on the beach mitch hesitated for a slight second uh no then drink up sailor lets get drunk and make a baby
