a space odyssey arthur c clarke foreword behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living since the dawn of time roughly a hundred billion human beings have walked the planet earth now this is an interesting number for by a curious coincidence there are approximately a hundred billion stars in our local universe the milky way so for every man who has ever lived in this universe there shines a star but every one of those stars is a sun often far more brilliant and glorious than the small nearby star we call the sun and many perhaps most of those alien suns have planets circling them so almost certainly there is enough land in the sky to give every member of the human species back to the first apeman his own private worldsized heaven or hell how many of those potential heavens and hells are now inhabited and by what manner of creatures we have no way of guessing the very nearest is a million times farther away than mars or venus those still remote goals of the next generation but the barriers of distance are crumbling one day we shall meet our equals or our masters among the stars men have been slow to face this prospect some still hope that it may never become reality increasing numbers however are asking why have such meetings not occurred already since we ourselves are about to venture into space why not indeed here is one possible answer to that very reasonable question but please remember this is only a work of fiction the truth as always will be far stranger to stanley i primeval night the road to extinction the drought had lasted now for ten million years and the reign of the terrible lizards had long since ended here on the equator in the continent which would one day be known as africa the battle for existence had reached a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not yet in sight in this barren and desiccated land only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to survive the manapes of the veldt were none of these things and they were not flourishing indeed they were already far down the road to racial extinction about fifty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small parched valley which was divided by a sluggish stream fed from snows in the mountains two hundred miles to the north in bad times the stream vanished completely and the tribe lived in the shadow of thirst it was always hungry and now it was starving when the first faint glow of dawn crept into the cave moonwatcher saw that his father had died in the night he did not know that the old one was his father for such a relationship was utterly beyond his understanding but as he looked at the emaciated body he felt dim disquiet that was the ancestor of sadness the two babies were already whimpering for food but became silent when moonwatcher snarled at them one of the mothers defending the infant she could not properly feed gave him an angry growl in return he lacked the energy even to cuff her for her presumption now it was light enough to leave moonwatcher picked up the shriveled corpse and dragged it after him as he bent under the low overhang of the cave once outside he threw the body over his shoulder and stood upright the only animal in all this world able to do so among his kind moonwatcher was almost a giant he was nearly five feet high and though badly undernourished weighed over a hundred pounds his hairy muscular body was halfway between ape and man but his head was already much nearer to man than ape the forehead was low and there were ridges over the eye sockets yet he unmistakably held in his genes the promise of humanity as he looked out upon the hostile world of the pleistocene there was already something in his gaze beyond the capacity of any ape in those dark deepset eyes was a dawning awareness the first intimations of an intelligence that could not possibly fulfill itself for ages yet and might soon be extinguished forever there was no sign of danger so moonwatcher began to scramble down the almost vertical slope outside the cave only slightly hindered by his burden as if they had been waiting for his signal the rest of the tribe emerged from their own homes farther down the rock face and began to hasten toward the muddy waters of the stream for their morning drink moonwatcher looked across the valley to see if the others were in sight but there was no trace of them perhaps they had not yet left their caves or were already foraging farther along the hillside since they were nowhere to be seen moonwatcher forgot them he was incapable of worrying about more than one thing at a time first he must get rid of the old one but this was a problem that demanded little thought there had been many deaths this season one of them in his own cave he had only to put the corpse where he had left the new baby at the last quarter of the moon and the hyenas would do the rest they were already waiting where the little valley fanned out into the savanna almost as if they had known that he was coming moonwatcher left the body under a small bush all the earlier bones were already gone and hurried back to rejoin the tribe he never thought of his father again his two mates the adults from the other caves and most of the youngsters were foraging among the droughtstunted trees farther up the valley looking for berries succulent roots and leaves and occasional windfalls like small lizards or rodents only the babies and the feeblest of the old folk were left in the caves if there was any surplus food at the end of the days searching they might be fed if not the hyenas would soon be in luck once more but this day was a good one though as moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one time with another he had found a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so had enjoyed the finest delicacy that his people could ever know he still licked his fingers from time to time as he led the group homeward in the late afternoon of course he had also collected a fair number of stings but he had scarcely noticed them he was now as near to contentment as he was ever likely to be for though he was still hungry he was not actually weak with hunger that was the most to which any manape could ever aspire his contentment vanished when he reached the stream the others were there they were there every day but that did not make it any the less annoying there were about thirty of them and they could not have been distinguished from the members of moonwatchers own tribe as they saw him coming they begun to dance shake their arms and shriek on their side of the stream and his own people replied in kind and that was all that happened though the manapes often fought and wrestled one another their disputes very seldom resulted in serious injuries having no claws or fighting canine teeth and being well protected by hair they could not inflict much harm on one another in any event they had little surplus energy for such unproductive behavior snarling and threatening was a much more efficient way of asserting their points of view the confrontation lasted about five minutes then the display died out as quickly as it had begun and everyone drank his fill of the muddy water honor had been satisfied each group had staked its claim to its own territory this important business having been settled the tribe moved off along its side of the river the nearest worthwhile grazing was now more than a mile from the caves and they had to share it with a herd of large antelopelike beasts who barely tolerated their presence they could not be driven away for they were armed with ferocious daggers on their foreheads the natural weapons which the manapes did not possess so moonwatcher and his companions chewed berries and fruit and leaves and fought off the pangs of hunger while all around them competing for the same fodder was a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat yet the thousands of tons of succulent meat roaming over the savanna and through the bush was not only beyond their reach it was beyond their imagination in the midst of plenty they were slowly starving to death the tribe returned to its cave without incident in the last light of the day the injured female who had remained behind cooed with pleasure as moonwatcher gave her the berrycovered branch he had brought back and began to attack it ravenously there was little enough nourishment here but it would help her to survive until the wound the leopard had given her had healed and she could forage for herself again over the valley a full moon was rising and a chill wind was blowing down from the distant mountains it would be very cold tonight but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern it was merely part of the background of life moonwatcher barely stirred when the shrieks and screams echoed up the slope from one of the lower caves and he did not need to hear the occasional growl of the leopard to know exactly what was happening down there in the darkness old white hair and his family were fighting and dying and the thought that he might help in some way never crossed moonwatchers mind the harsh logic of survival ruled out such fancies and not a voice was raised in protest from the listening hillside every cave was silent lest it also attract disaster the tumult died away and presently moonwatcher could hear the sound of a body being dragged over rocks that lasted only a few seconds then the leopard got a good hold on its kill it made no further noise as it padded silently away carrying its victim effortlessly in its jaws for a day or two there would be no further danger here but there might be other enemies abroad taking advantage of this cold little sun that shone only by night if there was sufficient warning the smaller predators could sometimes be scared away by shouts and screams moonwatcher crawled out of the cave clambered onto a large boulder beside the entrance and squatted there to survey the valley of all the creatures who had yet walked on earth the manapes were the first to look steadfastly at the moon and though he could not remember it when he was very young moonwatcher would sometimes reach out and try to touch that ghostly face rising above the hills he had never succeeded and now he was old enough to understand why for first of course he must find a high enough tree to climb sometimes he watched the valley and sometimes he watched the moon but always he listened once or twice he dozed off but he slept with a hairtrigger alertness and the slightest sound would have disturbed him at the great age of twentyfive he was still in full possession of all his faculties if his luck continued and he avoided accidents disease predators and starvation he might survive for as much as another ten years the night wore on cold and clear without further alarms and the moon rose slowly amid equatorial constellations that no human eye would ever see in the caves between spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting were being born the nightmares of generations yet to be and twice there passed slowly across the sky rising up to the zenith and descending into the east a dazzling point of light more brilliant than any star the new rock late that night moonwatcher suddenly awoke tired out by the days exertions and disasters he had been sleeping more soundly than usual yet he was instantly alert at the first faint scrabbling down in the valley he sat up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his senses out into the night and fear crept slowly into his soul never in his life already twice as long as most members of his species could expect had he heard a sound like this the great cats approached in silence and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional cracking of a twig yet this was a continuous crunching noise that grew steadily louder it seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night making no attempt at concealment and ignoring all obstacles once moonwatcher heard the unmistakable sound of a bush being uprooted the elephants and dinotheria did this often enough but otherwise they moved as silently as the cats and then there came a sound which moonwatcher could not possibly have identified for it had never been heard before in the history of the world it was the clank of metal upon stone moonwatcher came face to face with the new rock when he led the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning he had almost forgotten the terrors of the night because nothing had happened after that initial noise so he did not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear there was after all nothing in the least alarming about it it was a rectangular slab three times his height but narrow enough to span with his arms and it was made of some completely transparent material indeed it was not easy to see except when the rising sun glinted on its edges as moonwatcher had never encountered ice or even crystalclear water there were no natural objects to which he could compare this apparition it was certainly rather attractive and though he was wisely cautious of most new things he did not hesitate for long before sidling up to it as nothing happened he put out his hand and felt a cold hard surface after several minutes of intense thought he arrived at a brilliant explanation it was a rock of course and it must have grown during the night there were many plants that did this white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that seemed to shoot up during the hours of darkness it was true that they were small and round whereas this was large and sharpedged but greater and later philosophers than moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their theories this really superb piece of abstract thinking led moonwatcher after only three or four minutes to a deduction which he immediately put to the test the white round pebbleplants were very tasty perhaps this tall one a few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusioned him there was no nourishment here so like a sensible manape he continued on his way to the river and forgot all about the crystalline monolith during the daily routine of shrieking at the others the foraging today was very bad and the tribe had to travel several miles from the caves to find any food at all during the merciless heat of noon one of the frailer females collapsed far from any possible shelter her companions gathered round her twittering and meeping sympathetically but there was nothing that anyone could do if they had been less exhausted they might have carried her with them but there was no surplus energy for such acts of kindness she had to be left behind to recover or not with her own resources they passed the spot on the homeward trek that evening there was not a bone to be seen in the last light of day looking round anxiously for early hunters they drank hastily at the stream and started the climb up to their caves they were still a hundred yards from the new rock when the sound began it was barely audible yet it stopped them dead so that they stood paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging slackly a simple maddeningly repetitious vibration it pulsed out from the crystal and hypnotized all who came within its spell for the first time and the last for three million years the sound of drumming was heard in africa the throbbing grew louder more insistent presently the manapes began to move forward like sleepwalkers toward the source of that compulsive sound sometimes they took little dancing steps as their blood responded to rhythms that their descendants would not create for ages yet totally entranced they gathered round the monolith forgetting the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk and the hunger in their bellies the drumming became louder the night darker and as the shadows lengthened and the light drained from the sky the crystal began to glow first it lost its transparency and became suffused with a pale milky luminescence tantalizing illdefined phantoms moved across its surface and in its depths they coalesced into bars of light and shadow then formed intermeshing spoked patterns that began slowly to rotate faster and faster spun the wheels of light and the throbbing of the drums accelerated with them now utterly hypnotized the manapes could only stare slackjawed into this astonishing display of pyrotechnics they had already forgotten the instincts of their forefathers and the lessons of a lifetime not one of them ordinarily would have been so far from his cave so late in the evening for the surrounding brush was full of frozen shapes and staring eyes as the creatures of the night suspended their business to see what would happen next now the spinning wheels of light began to merge and the spokes fused into luminous bars that slowly receded into the distance rotating on their axes as they did so they split into pairs and the resulting sets of lines started to oscillate across one another slowly changing their angles of intersection fantastic fleeting geometrical patterns flickered in and out of existence as the glowing grids meshed and unmeshed and the manapes watched mesmerized captives of the shining crystal they could never guess that their minds were being probed their bodies mapped their reactions studied their potentials evaluated at first the whole tribe remained half crouching in a motionless tableau as if frozen into stone then the manape nearest to the slab suddenly came to life he did not move from his position but his body lost its trancelike rigidity and became animated as if it were a puppet controlled by invisible strings the head turned this way and that the mouth silently opened and closed the hands clenched and unclenched then he bent down snapped off a long stalk of grass and attempted to tie it into a knot with clumsy fingers he seemed to be a thing possessed struggling against some spirit or demon who had taken over control of his body he was panting for breath and his eyes were full of terror as he tried to force his fingers to make movements more complex than any that they had ever attempted before despite all his efforts he succeeded only in breaking the stalk into pieces as the fragments fell to the ground the controlling influence left him and he froze once more into immobility another manape came to life and went through the same routine this was a younger more adaptable specimen it succeeded where the older one had failed on the planet earth the first crude knot had been tied others did stranger and still more pointless things some held their hands out at arms length and tried to touch their fingertips together first with both eyes open then with one closed some were made to stare at ruled patterns in the crystal which became more and more finely divided until the lines had merged into a gray blur and all heard single pure sounds of varying pitch that swiftly sank below the level of hearing when moonwatchers turn came he felt very little fear his main sensation was a dull resentment as his muscles twitched and his limbs moved at commands that were not wholly his own without knowing why he bent down and picked up a small stone when he straightened up he saw that there was a new image in the crystal slab the grids and the moving dancing patterns had gone instead there was a series of concentric circles surrounding a small black disk obeying the silent orders in his brain he pitched the stone with a clumsy overarm throw it missed the target by several feet try again said the command he searched around until he had found another pebble this time it hit the slab with a ringing belllike tone he was still a long way off but his aim was improving at the fourth attempt he was only inches from the central bullseye a feeling of indescribable pleasure almost sexual in its intensity flooded his mind then the control relaxed he felt no impulse to do anything except to stand and wait one by one every member of the tribe was briefly possessed some succeeded but most failed at the tasks they had been set and all were appropriately rewarded by spasms of pleasure or of pain now there was only a uniform featureless glow in the great slab so that it stood like a block of light superimposed oil the surrounding darkness as if waking from a sleep the manapes shook their heads and presently began to move along the trail to their place of shelter they did not look back or wonder at the strange light that was guiding them to their homes and to a future unknown as yet even to the stars academy moonwatcher and his companions had no recollection of what they had seen after the crystal had ceased to cast its hypnotic spell over their minds and to experiment with their bodies the next day as they went out to forage they passed it with scarcely a second thought it was now part of the disregarded background of their lives they could not eat it and it could not eat them therefore it was not important down at the river the others made their usual ineffectual threats their leader a oneeared manape of moonwatchers size and age but in poorer condition even made a brief foray toward the tribes territory screaming loudly and waving his arms in an attempt to scare the opposition and to bolster his own courage the water of the stream was nowhere more than a foot deep but the farther oneear moved out into it the more uncertain and unhappy he became very soon he slowed to a halt and then moved back with exaggerated dignity to join his companions otherwise there was no change in the normal routine the tribe gathered just enough nourishment to survive for another day and no one died and that night the crystal slab was still waiting surrounded by its pulsing aura of light and sound the program it had contrived however was now subtly different some of the manapes it ignored completely as if it was concentrating on the most promising subjects one of them was moonwatcher once again he felt inquisitive tendrils creeping down the unused byways of his brain and presently he began to see visions they might have been within the crystal block they might have been wholly inside his mind in any event to moonwatcher they were completely real yet somehow the usual automatic impulse to drive off invaders of his territory had been lulled into quiescence he was looking at a peaceful family group differing in only one respect from the scenes he knew the male female and two infants that had mysteriously appeared before him were gorged and replete with sleek and glossy pelts and this was a condition of life that moonwatcher had never imagined unconsciously he felt his own protruding ribs the ribs of these creatures were hidden in rolls of fat from time to time they stirred lazily as they lolled at ease near the entrance of a cave apparently at peace with the world occasionally the big male emitted a monumental burp of contentment there was no other activity and after five minutes the scene suddenly faded out the crystal was no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness moonwatcher shook himself as if awaking from a dream abruptly realized where he was and led the tribe back to the caves he had no conscious memory of what he had seen but that night as he sat brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears attuned to the noises of the world around him moonwatcher felt the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion it was a vague and diffuse sense of envy of dissatisfaction with his life he had no idea of its cause still less of its cure but discontent had come into his soul and he had taken one small step toward humanity night after night the spectacle of those four plump manapes was repeated until it had become a source of fascinated exasperation serving to increase moonwatchers eternal gnawing hunger the evidence of his eyes could not have produced this effect it needed psychological reinforcement there were gaps in moonwatchers life now that he would never remember when the very atoms of his simple brain were being twisted into new patterns if he survived those patterns would become eternal for his genes would pass them on to future generations it was a slow tedious business but the crystal monolith was patient neither it nor its replicas scattered across half the globe expected to succeed with all the scores of groups involved in the experiment a hundred failures would not matter when a single success could change the destiny of the world by the time of the next new moon the tribe had seen one birth and two deaths one of these had been due to starvation the other had occurred during the nightly ritual when a manape had suddenly collapsed while attempting to tap two pieces of stone delicately together at once the crystal had darkened and the tribe had been released from the spell but the fallen manape had not moved and by the morning of course the body was gone there had been no performance the next night the crystal was still analyzing its mistake the tribe streamed past it through the gathering dusk ignoring its presence completely the night after it was ready for them again the four plump manapes were still there and now they were doing extraordinary things moonwatcher began to tremble uncontrollably he felt as if his brain would burst and wanted to turn away his eyes but that remorseless mental control would not relax its grip he was compelled to follow the lesson to the end though all his instincts revolted against it those instincts had served his ancestors well in the days of warm rains and lush fertility when food was to be had everywhere for the plucking now times had changed and the inherited wisdom of the past had become folly the manapes must adapt or they must die like the greater beasts who had gone before them and whose bones now lay sealed within the limestone hills so moonwatcher stared at the crystal monolith with unblinking eyes while his brain lay open to its still uncertain manipulations often he felt nausea but always he felt hunger and from time to time his hands clenched unconsciously in the patterns that would determine his new way of life as the line of warthogs moved snuffling and grunting across the trail moonwatcher came to a sudden halt pigs and manapes had always ignored each other for there was no conflict of interest between them like most animals that did not compete for the same food they merely kept out of each others way yet now moonwatcher stood looking at them wavering back and forth uncertainly as he was buffeted by impulses which he could not understand then as if in a dream he started searching the ground though for what he could not have explained even if he had had the power of speech he would recognize it when he saw it it was a heavy pointed stone about six inches long and though it did not fit his hand perfectly it would do as he swung his hand around puzzled by its suddenly increased weight he felt a pleasing sense of power and authority he started to move toward the nearest pig it was a young and foolish animal even by the undemanding standards of warthog intelligence though it observed him out of the corner of its eye it did not take him seriously until much too late why should it suspect these harmless creatures of any evil intent it went on rooting up the grass until moonwatchers stone hammer obliterated its dim consciousness the remainder of the herd continued grazing unalarmed for the murder had been swift and silent all the other manapes in the group had stopped to watch and now they crowded round moonwatcher and his victim with admiring wonder presently one of them picked up the bloodstained weapon and began to pound the dead pig others joined in with any sticks and stones that they could gather until their target began a messy disintegration then they became bored some wandered off while others stood hesitantly around the unrecognizable corpse the future of a world waiting upon their decision it was a surprisingly long time before one of the nursing females began to lick the gory stone she was holding in her paws and it was longer still before moonwatcher despite all that he had been shown really understood that he need never be hungry again the leopard the tools they had been programmed to use were simple enough yet they could change this world and make the manapes its masters the most primitive was the handheld stone that multiplied manyfold the power of a blow then there was the bone club that lengthened the reach and could provide a buffer against the fangs or claws of angry animals with these weapons the limitless food that roamed the savannas was theirs to take but they needed other aids for their teeth and nails could not readily dismember anything larger than a rabbit luckily nature had provided the perfect tools requiring only the wit to pick them up first there was a crude but very efficient knife or saw of a model that would serve well for the next three million years it was simply the lower jawbone of an antelope with the teeth still in place there would be no substantial improvement until the coming of steel then there was an awl or dagger in the form of a gazelle horn and finally a scraping tool made from the complete jaw of almost any small animal the stone club the toothed saw the horn dagger the bone scraper these were the marvelous inventions which the manapes needed in order to survive soon they would recognize them for the symbols of power that they were but many months must pass before their clumsy fingers had acquired the skill or the will to use them perhaps given time they might by their own efforts have come to the awesome and brilliant concept of using natural weapons as artificial tools but the odds were all against them and even now there were endless opportunities for failure in the ages that lay ahead the manapes had been given their first chance there would be no second one the future was very literally in their own hands moons waxed and waned babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirtyyearolds died the leopard took its toll in the night the others threatened daily across the river and the tribe prospered in the course of a single year moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition they had learned their lessons well now they could handle all the tools that had been revealed to them the very memory of hunger was fading from their minds and though the warthogs were becoming shy there were gazelles and antelopes and zebras in countless thousands on the plains all these animals and others had fallen prey to the apprentice hunters now that they were no longer halfnumbed with starvation they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought their new way of life was now casually accepted and they did not associate it in any way with the monolith still standing beside the trail to the river if they had ever stopped to consider the matter they might have boasted that they had brought about their improved status by their own efforts in fact they had already forgotten any other mode of existence but no utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes the first was the marauding leopard whose passion for manapes seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished the second was the tribe across the river for somehow the others had survived and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation the leopard problem was resolved partly by chance partly owing to a serious indeed almost fatal error on moonwatchers part yet at the time his idea had seemed such a brilliant one that he had danced with joy and perhaps he could hardly be blamed for overlooking the consequences the tribe still experienced occasional bad days though these no longer threatened its very survival toward dusk it had failed to make a kill the home caves were already in sight as moonwatcher led his tired and disgruntled companions back to shelter and there on their very threshold they found one of natures rare bonanzas a fullgrown antelope was lying by the trail its foreleg was broken but it still had plenty of fight in it and the circling jackals gave its daggerlike horns a respectful berth they could afford to wait they knew that they had only to bide their time but they had forgotten about the competition and retreated with angry snarls when the manapes arrived they too circled warily keeping beyond the range of those dangerous horns then they moved to the attack with clubs and stones it was not a very effective or coordinated attack by the time the wretched beast had been given its quietus the light had almost gone and the jackals were regaining their courage moonwatcher torn between fear and hunger slowly realized that all this effort might have been in vain it was too dangerous to stay here any longer then not for the first or the last time he proved himself a genius with an immense effort of imagination he visualized the dead antelope in the safety of his own cave he began to drag it toward the cliff face presently the others understood his intentions and began to help him if he had known how difficult the task would be he would never have attempted it only his great strength and the agility inherited from his arboreal ancestors allowed him to haul the carcass up the steep slope several times weeping with frustration he almost abandoned his prize but a stubbornness as deepseated as his hunger drove him on sometimes the others helped him sometimes they hindered more often they merely got in the way but finally it was done the battered antelope was dragged over the lip of the cave as the last hues of sunlight faded from the sky and the feasting began hours later gorged to repletion moonwatcher awoke not knowing why he sat up in the darkness among the sprawled bodies of his equally satiated companions and strained his ears into the night there was no sound except the heavy breathing around him the whole world seemed asleep the rocks beyond the mouth of the cave were pale as bone in the brilliant light from the moon now high overhead any thought of danger seemed infinitely remote then from a long way off came the sound of a falling pebble fearful yet inquisitive moonwatcher crawled out onto the ledge of the cave and peered down the face of the cliff what he saw left him so paralyzed with fright that for long seconds he was unable to move only twenty feet below two gleaming golden eyes were staring straight up at him they held him so hypnotized with fear that he was scarcely aware of the lithe streaked body behind them flowing smoothly and silently from rock to rock never before had the leopard climbed so high it had ignored the lower caves though it must have been well aware of their inhabitants now it was after other game it was following the spoor of blood up the moonwashed face of the cliff seconds later the night was made hideous by the shrieks of alarm from the manapes in the cave above the leopard gave a snarl of fury as it realized that it had lost the element of surprise but it did not check its advance for it knew that it had nothing to fear it reached the ledge and rested for a moment on the narrow open space the scent of blood was all around filling its fierce and tiny mind with one overwhelming desire without hesitation it padded silently into the cave and here it made its first error for as it moved out of the moonlight even its superbly nightadapted eyes were at a momentary disadvantage the manapes could see it partly silhouetted against the opening of the cave more clearly than it could see them they were terrified but they were no longer utterly helpless snarling and lashing its tail in arrogant confidence the leopard advanced in search of the tender food that it craved had it met its prey in the open it would have had no problems but now that the manapes were trapped desperation had given them the courage to attempt the impossible and for the first time they had the means to achieve it the leopard knew that something was wrong when it felt a stunning blow on its head it lashed out with its forepaw and heard a shriek of agony as its claws slashed through soft flesh then there was a piercing pain as something sharp drove into its flanks once twice and yet a third time it whirled around to strike at the shadows screaming and dancing on all sides again there was a violent blow as something caught it across the snout its teeth snapped on a white moving blur only to grate uselesssly upon dead bone and now in a final unbelievable indignity its tail was being dragged out by the roots it whirled around throwing its insanely daring tormentor against the wall of the cave yet whatever it did it could not escape the rain of blows inflicted on it by crude weapons wielded by clumsy but powerful hands its snarls ran the gamut from pain to alarm from alarm to outright terror the implacable hunter was now the victim and was desperately trying to retreat and then it made its second mistake for in its surprise and fright it had forgotten where it was or perhaps it had been dazed or blinded by the blows rained on its head whatever the case it bolted abruptly from the cave there was a horrible screech as it went toppling out into space ages later it seemed there came a thud as it crashed into an outcropping halfway down the cliff thereafter the only sound was the sliding of loose stones which quickly died away into the night for a long time intoxicated by victory moonwatcher stood dancing and gibbering at the entrance of the cave he rightly sensed that his whole world had changed and that he was no longer a powerless victim of the forces around him then he went back into the cave and for the first time in his life had an unbroken nights sleep in the morning they found the body of the leopard at the foot of the cliff even in death it was some time before anyone dared to approach the vanquished monster but presently they closed in upon it with their bone knives and saws it was very hard work and they did no hunting that day encounter in the dawn as he led the tribe down to the river in the dim light of dawn moonwatcher paused uncertainly at a familiar spot something he knew was missing but what it was he could not remember he wasted no mental effort on the problem for this morning he had more important matters on his mind like thunder and lightning and clouds and eclipses the great block of crystal had departed as mysteriously as it had come having vanished into the nonexistent past it never troubled moonwatchers thoughts again he would never know what it had done to him and none of his companions wondered as they gathered round him in the morning mist why he had paused for a moment here on the way to the river from their side of the stream in the neverviolated safety of their own territory the others first saw moonwatcher and a dozen males of his tribe as a moving frieze against the dawn sky at once they began to scream their daily challenge but this time there was no answer steadily purposefully above all silently moonwatcher and his band descended the low hillock that overlooked the river and as they approached the others became suddenly quiet their ritual rage ebbed away to be replaced by a mounting fear they were dimly aware that something had happened and that this encounter was unlike all those that had ever gone before the bone clubs and knives that moonwatchers group carried did not alarm them for they did not understand their purpose they only knew that their rivals movements were now imbued with determination and with menace the party stopped at the waters edge and for a moment the others courage revived led by oneear they halfheartedly resumed their battle chant it lasted only a few seconds before a vision of terror struck then dumb moonwatcher raised his arms high into the air revealing the burden that until now had been concealed by the hirsute bodies of his companions he was holding a stout branch and impaled upon it was the bloody head of the leopard the mouth had been jammed open with a stick and the great fangs gleamed a ghastly white in the first rays of the rising sun most of the others were too paralyzed with fright to move but some began a slow stumbling retreat that was all the encouragement that moonwatcher needed still holding the mangled trophy above his head he started to cross the stream after a moments hesitation his companions splashed after him when moonwatcher reached the far side oneear was still standing his ground perhaps he was too brave or too stupid to run perhaps he could not really believe that this outrage was actually happening coward or hero it made no difference in the end as the frozen snarl of death came crashing down upon his uncomprehending head shrieking with fright the others scattered into the bush but presently they would return and soon they would forget their lost leader for a few seconds moonwatcher stood uncertainly above his new victim trying to grasp the strange and wonderful fact that the dead leopard could kill again now he was master of the world and he was not quite sure what to do next but he would think of something ascent of man a new animal was abroad on the planet spreading slowly out from the african heartland it was still so rare that a hasty census might have overlooked it among the teeming billions of creatures roving over land and sea there was no evidence as yet that it would prosper or even survive on this world where so many mightier beasts had passed away its fate still wavered in the balance in the hundred thousand years since the crystals had descended upon africa the manapes had invented nothing but they had started to change and had developed skills which no other animal possessed their bone clubs had increased their reach and multiplied their strength they were no longer defenseless against the predators with whom they had to compete the smaller carnivores they could drive away from their own kills the larger ones they could at least discourage and sometimes put to flight their massive teeth were growing smaller for they were no longer essential the sharpedged stones that could be used to dig out roots or to cut and saw through tough flesh or fiber had begun to replace them with immeasurable consequences no longer were the manapes faced with starvation when their teeth became damaged or worn even the crudest tools could add many years to their lives and as their fangs diminished the shape of their face started to alter the snout receded the massive jaw became more delicate the mouth able to make more subtle sounds speech was still a million years away but the first steps toward it had been taken and then the world began to change in four great waves with two hundred thousand years between their crests the ice ages swept by leaving their mark on all the globe outside the tropics the glaciers slew those who had prematurely left theft ancestral home and everywhere they winnowed out the creatures who could not adapt when the ice had passed so had much of the planets early life including the manapes but unlike so many others they had left descendants they had not merely become extinct they had been transformed the toolmakers had been remade by their own tools for in using clubs and flints their hands had developed a dexterity found nowhere else in the animal kingdom permitting them to make still better tools which in turn had developed their limbs and brains yet further it was an accelerating cumulative process and at its end was man the first true men had tools and weapons only a little better than those of their ancestors a million years earlier but they could use them with far greater skill and somewhere in the shadowy centuries that had gone before they had invented the most essential tool of all though it could be neither seen nor touched they had learned to speak and so had won their first great victory over time now the knowledge of one generation could be handed on to the next so that each age could profit from those that had gone before unlike the animals who knew only the present man had acquired a past and he was beginning to grope toward a future he was also learning to harness the forces of nature with the taming of fire he had laid the foundations of technology and left his animal origins far behind stone gave way to bronze and then to iron hunting was succeeded by agriculture the tribe grew into the village the village into the town speech became eternal thanks to certain marks on stone and clay and papyrus presently he invented philosophy and religion and he peopled the sky not altogether inaccurately with gods as his body became more and more defenseless so his means of offense became steadily more frightful with stone and bronze and iron and steel he had run the gamut of everything that could pierce and slash and quite early in time he had learned how to strike down his victims from a distance the spear the bow the gun and finally the guided missile had given him weapons of infinite range and all but infinite power without those weapons often though he had used them against himself man would never have conquered his world into them he had put his heart and soul and for ages they had served him well but now as long as they existed he was living on borrowed time ii tma special flight no matter how many times you left earth dr heywood floyd told himself the excitement never really palled he had been to mars once to the moon three times and to the various space stations more often than he could remember yet as the moment of takeoff approached he was conscious of a rising tension a feeling of wonder and awe yes and of nervousness which put him on the same level as any earthlubber about to receive his first baptism of space the jet that had rushed him here from washington after that midnight briefing with the president was now dropping down toward one of the most familiar yet most exciting landscapes in all the world there lay the first two generations of the space age spanning twenty miles of the florida coast to the south outlined by winking red warning lights were the giant gantries of the saturns and neptunes that had set men on the path to the planets and had now passed into history near the horizon a gleaming silver tower bathed in floodlights stood the last of the saturn vs for almost twenty years a national monument and place of pilgrimage not far away looming against the sky like a manmade mountain was the incredible bulk of the vehicle assembly building still the largest single structure on earth but these things now belonged to the past and he was flying toward the future as they banked dr floyd could see below him a maze of buildings then a great airstrip then a broad deadstraight scar across the fiat florida landscape the multiple rails of a giant launchlug track at its end surrounded by vehicles and gantries a spaceplane lay gleaming in a pool of light being prepared for its leap to the stars in a sudden failure of perspective brought on by his swift changes of speed and height it seemed to floyd that he was looking down on a small silver moth caught in the beam of a flashlight then the tiny scurrying figures on the ground brought home to him the real size of the spacecraft it must have been two hundred feet across the narrow v of its wings and that enormous vehicle floyd told himself with some incredulity yet also with some pride is waiting for me as far as he knew it was the first time that an entire mission had been set up to take a single man to the moon though it was two oclock in the morning a group of reporters and cameramen intercepted him on his way to the floodlit orion iii spacecraft he knew several of them by sight for as chairman of the national council of astronautics the news conference was part of his way of life this was neither the time nor the place for one and he had nothing to say but it was important not to offend the gentlemen of the communications media dr floyd im jim forster of associated news could you give us a few words about this flight of yours im very sorry i cant say anything but you did meet with the president earlier this evening asked a familiar voice oh hello mike im afraid youve been dragged out of bed for nothing definitely no comment can you at least confirm or deny that some kind of epidemic has broken out on the moon a tv reporter asked managing to jog alongside and keep floyd properly framed in his miniature tv camera sorry said floyd shaking his head what about the quarantine asked another reporter how long will it be kept on still no comment dr floyd demanded a very short and determined lady of the press what possible justification can there be for this total blackout of news from the moon has it anything to do with the political situation what political situation floyd asked dryly there was a sprinkle of laughter and someone called have a good trip doctor as he made his way into the sanctuary of the boarding gantry as long as he could remember it had been not a situation so much as a permanent crisis since the s the world had been dominated by two problems which ironically tended to cancel each other out though birth control was cheap reliable and endorsed by all the main religions it had come too late the population of the world was now six billion a third of them in the chinese empire laws had even been passed in some authoritarian societies limiting families to two children but their enforcement had proved impracticable as a result food was short in every country even the united states had meatless days and widespread famine was predicted within fifteen years despite heroic efforts to farm the sea and to develop synthetic foods with the need for international cooperation more urgent than ever there were still as many frontiers as in any earlier age in a million years the human race had lost few of its aggressive instincts along symbolic lines visible only to politicians the thirtyeight nuclear powers watched one another with belligerent anxiety among them they possessed sufficient megatonnage to remove the entire surface crust of the planet although there had been miraculously no use of atomic weapons this situation could hardly last forever and now for their own inscrutable reasons the chinese were offering to the smallest havenot nations a complete nuclear capability of fifty warheads and delivery systems the cost was under and easy terms could be arranged perhaps they were only trying to shore up their sagging economy by turning obsolete weapons systems into hard cash as some observers had suggested or perhaps they had discovered methods of warfare so advanced that they no longer had need of such toys there had been talk of radiohypnosis from satellite transmitters compulsion viruses and blackmail by synthetic diseases for which they alone possessed the antidote these charming ideas were almost certainly propaganda or pure fantasy but it was not safe to discount any of them every time floyd took off from earth he wondered if it would still be there when the time came to return the trim stewardess greeted him as he entered the cabin good morning dr floyd im miss simmons id like to welcome you aboard on behalf of captain tynes and our copilot first officer ballard thank you said floyd with a smile wondering why stewardesses always had to sound like robot tour guides takeoffs in five minutes she said gesturing into the empty twentypassenger cabin you can take any seat you want but captain tynes recommends the forward window seat on the left if you want to watch the docking operations ill do that he answered moving toward the preferred seat the stewardess fussed over him awhile and then moved to her cubicle at the rear of the cabin floyd settled down in his seat adjusted the safety harness around waist and shoulders and strapped his briefcase to the adjacent seat a moment later the loudspeaker came on with a soft popping noise good morning said miss simmons voice this is special flight kennedy to space station one she was determined it seemed to go through the full routine for her solitary passenger and floyd could not resist a smile as she continued inexorably our transit time will be fiftyfive minutes maximum acceleration will be twogee and we will be weightless for thirty minutes please do not leave your seat until the safety sign is lit floyd looked over his shoulder and called thank you he caught a glimpse of a slightly embarrassed but charming smile he leaned back into his seat and relaxed this trip he calculated would cost the taxpayers slightly over a million dollars if it was not justified he would be out of his job but he could always go back to the university and to his interrupted studies of planetary formation autocountdown procedures all go the captains voice said over the speaker with the soothing singsong used in rt chat liftoff in one minute as always it seemed more like an hour floyd became acutely aware of the gigantic forces coiled up around him waiting to be released in the fuel tanks of the two spacecraft and in the power storage system of the launching track was pent up the energy of a nuclear bomb and it would all be used to take him a mere two hundred miles from earth there was none of the oldfashioned fivefoijrthreetwoonezero business so tough on the human nervous system launching in fifteen seconds you will be more comfortable if you start breathing deeply that was good psychology and good physiology floyd felt himself well charged with oxygen and ready to tackle anything when the launching track began to sling its thousandton payload out over the atlantic it was hard to tell when they lifted from the track and became airborne but when the roar of the rockets suddenly doubled its fury and floyd found himself sinking deeper and deeper into the cushions of his seat he knew that the firststage engines had taken over he wished he could look out of the window but it was an effort even to turn his head yet there was no discomfort indeed the pressure of acceleration and the overwhelming thunder of the motors produced an extraordinary euphoria his ears ringing the blood pounding in his veins floyd felt more alive than he had for years he was young again he wanted to sing aloud which was certainly safe for no one could possibly hear him the mood passed swiftly as he suddenly realized that he was leaving earth and everything he had ever loved down there were his three children motherless since his wife had taken that fatal flight to europe ten years ago perhaps for their sake he should have remarried he had almost lost sense of time when the pressure and the noise abruptly slackened and the cabin speaker announced preparing to separate from lower stage here we go there was a slight jolt and suddenly floyd recalled a quotation of leonardo da vincis which he had once seen displayed in a nasa office the great bird will take its flight on the back of the great bird bringing glory to the nest where it was born well the great bird was flying now beyond all the dreams of da vinci and its exhausted companion was winging back to earth in a tenthousandmile arc the empty lower stage would glide down into the atmosphere trading speed for distance as it homed on kennedy in a few hours serviced and refueled it would be ready again to lift another companion toward the shining silence with it could never reach now thought floyd we are on our own more than halfway to orbit when the acceleration came on again as the upper stage rockets fired the thrust was much more gentle indeed he felt no more than normal gravity but it would have been impossible to walk since up was straight toward the front of the cabin if he had been foolish enough to leave his seat he would have crashed at once against the rear wall this effect was a little disconcerting for it seemed that the ship was standing on its tail to floyd who was at the very front of the cabin all the seats appeared to be fixed on a wall topping vertically beneath him he was doing his best to ignore this uncomfortable illusion when dawn exploded outside the ship in seconds they shot through veils of crimson and pink and gold and blue into the piercing white of day though the windows were heavily tinted to reduce the glare the probing beams of sunlight that now slowly swept across the cabin left floyd halfblinded for several minutes he was in space yet there was no question of being able to see the stars he shielded his eyes with his hands and tried to peer through the window beside him out there the sweptback wing of the ship was blazing like whitehot metal in the reflected sunlight there was utter darkness all around it and that darkness must be full of stars but it was impossible to see them weight was slowly ebbing the rockets were being throttled back as the ship eased itself into orbit the thunder of the engines dropped to a muted roar then a gentle hiss then died into silence if it had not been for the restraining straps floyd would have floated out of his seat his stomach felt as if it was going to do so anyway he hoped that the pills he had been given half an hour and ten thousand miles ago would perform as per specifications he had been spacesick just once in his career and that was much too often the pilots voice was firm and confident as it came over the cabin speaker please observe all zerogee regulations we will be docking at space station one in fortyfive minutes the stewardess came walking up the narrow corridor to the right of the closely spaced seats there was a slight buoyancy about her steps and her feet came away from the floor reluctantly as if entangled in glue she was keeping to the bright yellow band of velcro carpeting that ran the full length of the floor and of the ceiling the carpet and the soles of her sandals were covered with myriads of tiny hooks so that they clung together like burrs this trick of walking in free fall was immensely reassuring to disoriented passengers would you like some coffee or tea dr floyd she asked cheerfully no thank you he smiled he always felt like a baby when he had to suck at one of those plastic drinking tubes the stewardess was still hovering anxiously around him as he popped open his briefcase and prepared to remove his papers dr floyd may i ask you a question certainly he answered looking up over his glasses my fiance is a geologist at clavius said miss simmons measuring her words carefully and i havent heard from him for over a week im sorry to hear that maybe hes away from his base and out of touch she shook her head he always tells me when thats going to happen and you can imagine how worried i am with all these rumors is it really true about an epidemic on the moon if it is theres no cause for alarm remember there was a quarantine back in over that mutated flu virus a lot of people were sick but no one died and thats really all i can say he concluded firmly miss simmons smiled pleasantly and straightened up well thank you anyway doctor im sorry to have bothered you no bother at all he said gallantly but not very accurately then he buried himself in his endless technical reports in a desperate lastminute assault on the usual backlog he would have no time for reading when he got to the moon orbital rendezvous half an hour later the pilot announced we make contact in ten minutes please check your seat harness floyd obeyed and put away his papers it was asking for trouble to read during the celestial juggling act which took place during the last miles best to close ones eyes and relax while the spacecraft was nudged back and forth with brief bursts of rocket power a few minutes later he caught his first glimpse of space station one only a few miles away the sunlight glinted and sparkled from the polished metal surfaces of the slowly revolving threehundredyarddiameter disk not far away drifting in the same orbit was a sweptback titovv spaceplane and close to that an almost spherical ariesb the workhorse of space with the four stubby legs of its lunarlanding shock absorbers jutting from one side the orion iii spacecraft was descending from a higher orbit which brought the earth into spectacular view behind the station from his altitude of miles floyd could see much of africa and the atlantic ocean there was considerable cloud cover but he could still detect the bluegreen outlines of the gold coast the central axis of the space station with its docking arms extended was now slowly swimming toward them unlike the structure from which it sprang it was not rotating or rather it was running in reverse at a rate which exactly countered the stations own spin thus a visiting spacecraft could be coupled to it for the transfer of personnel or cargo without being whirled disastrously around with the softest of thuds ship and station made contact there were metallic scratching noises from outside then the brief hissing of air as pressures equalized a few seconds later the airlock door opened and a man wearing the light closefitting slacks and shortsleeved shirt which was almost the uniform of space station personnel came into the cabin pleased to meet you dr floyd im nick miller station security im to look after you until the shuttle leaves they shook hands then floyd smiled at the stewardess and said please give my compliments to captain tynes and thank him for the smooth ride perhaps ill see you on the way home very cautiously it was more than a year since he had last been weightless and it would be some time before he regained his spacelegs he hauled himself hand over hand through the airlock and into the large circular chamber at the axis of the space station it was a heavily padded room its walls covered with recessed handholds floyd gripped one of these firmly while the whole chamber started to rotate until it matched the spin of the station as it gained speed faint and ghostly gravitational fingers began to clutch at him and he drifted slowly toward the circular wall now he was standing swaying back and forth gently like seaweed in the surge of the tide on what had magically become a curving floor the centrifugal force of the stations spin had taken hold of him it was very feeble here so near the axis but would increase steadily as he moved outward from the central transit chamber he followed miller down a curving stair at first his weight was so slight that he had almost to force himself downward by holding on to the handrail not until he reached the passenger lounge on the outer skin of the great revolving disk had he acquired enough weight to move around almost normally the lounge had been redecorated since his last visit and had acquired several new facilities besides the usual chairs small tables restaurant and post office there were now a barber shop drugstore movie theater and a souvenir shop selling photographs and slides of lunar and planetary landscapes guaranteed genuine pieces of luniks rangers and surveyors all neatly mounted in plastic and exorbitantly priced can i get you anything while were waiting miller asked we board in about thirty minutes i could do with a cup of black coffee two lumps and id like to call earth right doctor ill get the coffee the phones are over there the picturesque booths were only a few yards from a barrier with two entrances labeled welcome to the us section and welcome to the soviet section beneath these were notices which read in english russian and chinese french german and spanish please have ready your passport visa medical certificate transportation permit weight declaration there was a rather pleasant symbolism about the fact that as soon as they had passed through the barriers in either direction passengers were free to mix again the division was purely for administrative purposes floyd after checking that the area code for the united states was still punched his twelvedigit home number dropped his plastic allpurpose credit card into the pay slot and was through in thirty seconds washington was still sleeping for it was several hours to dawn but he would not disturb anyone his housekeeper would get the message from the recorder as soon as she awoke miss flemming this is dr floyd sorry i had to leave in such a hurry would you please call my office and ask them to collect the car its at dulles airport and the key is with mr bailey senior flight control officer next will you call the chevy chase country club and leave a message for the secretary i definitely wont be able to play in the tennis tournament next weekend give my apologies im afraid they were counting on me then call downtown electronics and tell them that if the video in my study isnt fixed by oh wednesday they can take the damn thing back he paused for breath and tried to think of any other crises or problems that might arise during the days ahead if you run short of cash speak to the office they can get urgent messages to me but i may be too busy to answer give my love to the children and say ill be back as soon as i can oh hell heres someone i dont want to see ill call from the moon if i can goodbye floyd tried to duck out of the booth but it was too late he had already been spotted bearing down on him through the soviet section exit was dr dimitri moisevitch of the ussr academy of science dimitri was one of floyds best friends and for that very reason he was the last person he wished to talk to here and now moon shuttle the russian astronomer was tall slender and blond and his unlined face belied his fiftyfive years the last ten of which had been spent building up the giant radio observatory on the far side of the moon where two thousand miles of solid rock would shield it from the electronic racket of earth why heywood he said shaking hands firmly its a small universehow are you and your charming children were fine floyd replied warmly but with a slightly distracted air we often talk about the wonderful time you gave us last summer he was sorry he could not sound more sincere they really had enjoyed a weeks vacation in odessa with dimitri during one of the russians visits to earth and you i suppose youre on your way up dimitri inquired er yes my flight leaves in half an hour answered floyd do you know mr miller the security officer had now approached and was standing at a respectful distance holding a plastic cup full of coffee of course but please put that down mr miller this is dr floyds last chance to have a civilized drink lets not waste it no i insist they followed dimitri out of the main lounge into the observation section and soon were sitting at a table under a dim light watching the moving panorama of the stars space station one revolved once a minute and the centrifugal force generated by this slow spin produced an artificial gravity equal to the moons this it had been discovered was a good compromise between earth gravity and no gravity at all moreover it gave moonbound passengers a chance to become acclimatized outside the almost invisible windows earth and stars marched in a silent procession at the moment this side of the station was tilted away from the sun otherwise it would have been impossible to look out for the lounge would have been blasted with light even as it was the glare of the earth filling half the sky drowned all but the brighter stars but earth was waning as the station orbited toward the night side of the planet in a few minutes it would be a huge black disk spangled with the lights of cities and then the sky would belong to the stars now said dimitri after he had swiftly downed his first drink and was toying with the second whats all this about an epidemic in the us sector i wanted to go there on this trip no professor they told me were very sorry but theres a strict quarantine until further notice i pulled all the strings i could it was no use now you tell me whats happening floyd groaned inwardly here we go again he said the sooner im on that shuttle headed for the moon the happier ill be the ah quarantine is purely a safety precaution he said cautiously were not even sure its really necessary but we dont believe in taking chances but what is the disease what are the symptoms could it be extraterrestrial do you want any help from our medical services im sorry dimitri weve been asked not to say anything at the moment thanks for the offer but we can handle the situation hmm said moisevitch obviously quite unconvinced seems odd to me that you an astronomer should be sent up to the moon to look into an epidemic im only an exastronomer its years since i did any real research now im a scientific expert that means i know nothing about absolutely everything then do you know what tma means miller seemed about to choke on his drink but floyd was made of sterner stuff he looked his old friend straight in the eye and said calmly tma what an odd expression where did you hear it never mind retorted the russian you cant fool me but if youve run into something you cant handle i hope you dont leave it until too late before you yell for help miller looked meaningfully at his watch due to board in five minutes dr floyd he said i think wed better get moving though he knew that they still had a good twenty minutes floyd got up with haste too much haste for he had forgotten the onesixth of a gravity he grabbed the table just in time to prevent a takeoff it was fine meeting you dimitri he said not quite accurately hope you have a good trip down to earth ill give you a call as soon as im back as they left the lounge and checked through the us transit barrier floyd remarked phew that was close thanks for rescuing me you know doctor said the security officer i hope he isnt right right about what about us running into something we cant handle that floyd answered with determination is what i intend to find out fortyfive minutes later the arieslb lunar carrier pulled away from the station there was none of the power and fury of a takeoff from earth only an almost inaudible faroff whistling as the lowthrust plasma jets blasted their electrified streams into space the gentle push lasted for more than fifteen minutes and the mild acceleration would not have prevented anyone from moving around the cabin but when it was over the ship was no longer bound to earth as it had been while it still accompanied the station it had broken the bonds of gravity and was now a free and independent planet circling the sun in an orbit of its own the cabin floyd now had all to himself had been designed for thirty passengers it was strange and rather lonely to see all the empty seats around him and to have the undivided attention of the steward and stewardess not to mention pilot copilot and two engineers he doubted that any man in history had ever received such exclusive service and it was most unlikely that anyone would do so in the future he recalled the cynical remark of one of the less reputable pontiffs now that we have the papacy let us enjoy it well he would enjoy this tip and the euphoria of weightlessness with the loss of gravity he had at least for a while shed most of his cares someone had once said that you could be terrified in space but you could not be worried there it was perfectly true the stewards it appeared were determined to make him eat for the whole twentyfive hours of the trip and he was continually fending off unwanted meals eating in zero gravity was no real problem contrary to the dark forebodings of the early astronauts he sat at an ordinary table to which the plates were clipped as aboard ship in a rough sea all the courses had some element of stickiness so that they would not take off and go wandering round the cabin thus a chop would be glued to the plate by a thick sauce and a salad kept under control by an adhesive dressing with a little skill and care there were few items that could not be tackled safely the only things banned were hot soups and excessively crumbly pastries drinks of course were a different matter all liquids simply had to be kept in plastic squeeze tubes a whole generation of research by heroic but unsung volunteers had gone into the design of the washroom and it was now considered to be more or less foolproof floyd investigated it soon after free fall had begun he found himself in a little cubicle with all the fittings of an ordinary airline toilet but illuminated with a red light that was very harsh and unpleasant to the eye a notice printed in prominent letters announced most important for your own comfort please read these instructions carefully floyd sat down and read the notice several times when he was sure that there had been no modifications since his last trip he pressed the start button close at hand an electric motor began to whirr and floyd felt himself moving as the notice advised him to do he closed his eyes and waited after a minute a bell chimed softly and he looked around the light had now changed to a soothing pinkishwhite but more important he was under gravity again only the faintest vibration revealed that it was a spurious gravity caused by the carrousellike spin of the whole toilet compartment floyd picked up a piece of soap and watched it drop in slow motion he judged that the centrifugal force was about a quarter of a normal gravity but that was quite enough it would ensure that everything moved in the right direction in the one place where this mattered most he pressed the stop for exit button and closed his eyes again weight slowly ebbed as the rotation ceased the bell gave a double chime and the red warning light was back the door was then locked in the right position to let him glide out into the cabin where he adhered as quickly as possible to the carpet he had long ago exhausted the novelty of weightlessness and was grateful for the velcro slippers that allowed him to walk almost normally there was plenty to occupy his time even if he did nothing but sit and read when he tired of official reports and memoranda and minutes he would plug his foolscapsized newspad into the ships information circuit and scan the latest reports from earth one by one he would conjure up the worlds major electronic papers he knew the codes of the more important ones by heart and had no need to consult the list on the back of his pad switching to the display units shortterm memory he would hold the front page while he quickly searched the headlines and noted the items that interested him each had its own twodigit reference when he punched that the postagestampsized rectangle would expand until it neatly filled the screen and he could read it with comfort when he had finished he would flash back to the complete page and select a new subject for detailed examination floyd sometimes wondered if the newspad and the fantastic technology behind it was the last word in mans quest for perfect communications here he was far out in space speeding away from earth at thousands of miles an hour yet in a few milliseconds he could see the headlines of any newspaper he pleased the text was updated automatically on every hour even if one read only the english versions one could spend an entire lifetime doing nothing but absorbing the everchanging flow of information from the news satellites it was hard to imagine how the system could be improved or made more convenient but sooner or later floyd guessed it would pass away to be replaced by something as unimaginable as the newspad itself would have been to caxton or gutenberg there was another thought which a scanning of those tiny electronic headlines often invoked the more wonderful the means of communication the more trivial tawdry or depressing its contents seemed to be accidents crimes natural and manmade disasters threats of conflict gloomy editorials these still seemed to be the main concern of the millions of words being sprayed into the ether yet floyd also wondered if this was altogether a bad thing the newspapers of utopia he had long ago decided would be terribly dull from time to time the captain and the other members of the crew came into the cabin and exchanged a few words with him they treated their distinguished passenger with awe and were doubtless burning with curiosity about his mission but were too polite to ask any questions or even to drop any hints only the charming little stewardess seemed completely at ease in his presence as floyd quickly discovered she came from bali and had carried beyond the atmosphere some of the grace and mystery of that still largely unspoiled island one of his strangest and most enchanting memories of the entire trip was her zerogravity demonstration of some classical balinese dance movements with the lovely bluegreen crescent of the waning earth as a backdrop there was one sleep period when the main cabin lights were switched off and floyd fastened down his arms and legs with the elastic sheets that would prevent him from drifting away into space it seemed a crude arrangement but here in zero gravity his unpadded couch was more comfortable than the most luxurious mattress on earth when he had strapped himself in floyd dozed off quickly enough but woke up once in a drowsy halfconscious condition to be completely baffled by his strange surroundings for a moment he thought that be was in the middle of some dimly lit chinese lantern the faint glow from the other cubicles around him gave that impression then he said to himself firmly and successfully go to sleep boy this is just an ordinary moon shuttle when he awoke the moon had swallowed up half the sky and the braking maneuvers were about to begin the wide arc of windows set in the curving wall of the passenger section now looked out onto the open sky not the approaching globe so he moved into the control cabin here on the rearview tv screens he could watch the final stages of the descent the approaching lunar mountains were utterly unlike those of earth they lacked the dazzling caps of snow the green closefitting garments of vegetation the moving crowns of cloud nevertheless the fierce contrasts of light and shadow gave them a strange beauty of their own the laws of earthly aesthetics did not apply here this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces operating over eons of time unknown to the young verdant earth with its fleeting ice ages its swiftly rising and falling seas its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn here was age inconceivable but not death for the moon had never lived until now the descending ship was poised almost above the line dividing night from day and directly below was a chaos of jagged shadows and brilliant isolated peaks catching the first light of the slow lunar dawn that would be a fearful place to attempt a landing even with all possible electronic aids but they were slowly drifting away from it toward the night side of the moon then floyd saw as his eyes grew more accustomed to the fainter illumination that the night land was not wholly dark it was aglow with a ghostly light in which peaks and valleys and plains could be clearly seen the earth a giant moon to the moon was flooding the land below with its radiance on the pilots panel lights flashed above radar screens numbers came and went on computer displays clocking off the distance of the approaching moon they were still more than a thousand miles away when weight returned as the jets began their gentle but steady deceleration for ages it seemed the moon slowly expanded across the sky the sun sank below the horizon and at last a single giant crater filled the field of view the shuttle was falling toward its central peaks and suddenly floyd noticed that near one of those peaks a brilliant light was flashing with a regular rhythm it might have been an airport beacon back on earth and he stared at it with a tightening of the throat it was proof that men had established another foothold on the moon now the crater had expanded so much that its ramparts were slipping below the horizon and the smaller craterlets that peppered its interior were beginning to disclose their real size some of these tiny though they had seemed from far out in space were miles across and could have swallowed whole cities under its automatic controls the shuttle was sliding down the starlit sky toward that barren landscape glimmering in the light of the great gibbous earth now a voice was calling somewhere above the whistle of the jets and the electronic beepings that came and went through the cabin clavius control to special you are coming in nicely please make manual check of landinggear lock hydraulic pressure shockpad inflation the pilot pressed sundry switches green lights flashed and he called back all manual checks completed landinggear lock hydraulic pressure shock pad ok confirmed said the moon and the descent continued wordlessly though there was still plenty of talking it was all being done by machines flashing binary impulses to one another at a thousand times the rate their slowthinking makers could communicate some of the mountain peaks were already towering above the shuttle now the ground was only a few thousand feet away and the beacon light was a brilliant star flashing steadily above a group of low buildings and odd vehicles in the final stage of the descent the jets seemed to be playing some strange tune they pulsed on and off making the last fine adjustments to the thrust abruptly a swirling cloud of dust hid everything the jets gave one final spurt and the shuttle rocked very slightly like a rowboat when a small wave goes by it was some minutes before floyd could really accept the silence that now enfolded him and the weak gravity that gripped his limbs he had made utterly without incident and in little more than one day the incredible journey of which men had dreamed for two thousand years after a normal routine flight he had landed on the moon clavius base clavius miles in diameter is the second largest crater on the visible face of the moon and lies in the center of the southern highlands it is very old ages of vulcanism and bombardment from space have scarred its walls and pockmarked its floor but since the last era of crater formation when the debris from the asteroid belt was still battering the inner planets it had known peace for half a billion years now there were new strange stirrings on and below its surface for here man was establishing his first permanent bridgehead on the moon clavius base could in an emergency be entirely selfsupporting all the necessities of life were produced from the local rocks after they had been crushed heated and chemically processed hydrogen oxygen carbon nitrogen phosphorus all these and most of the other elements could be found inside the moon if one knew where to look for them the base was a closed system like a tiny working model of earth itself recycling all the chemicals of life the atmosphere was purified in a vast hothouse a large circular room buried just below the lunar surface under blazing lamps by night and filtered sunlight by day acres of stubby green plants grew in a warm moist atmosphere they were special mutations designed for the express purpose of replenishing the air with oxygen and providing food as a byproduct more food was produced by chemical processing systems and algae culture although the green scum circulating through yards of transparent plastic tubes would scarcely have appealed to a gourmet the biochemists could convert it into chops and steaks only an expert could distinguish from the real thing the eleven hundred men and six hundred women who made up the personnel of the base were all highly trained scientists or technicians carefully selected before they had left earth though lunar living was now virtually free from the hardships disadvantages and occasional dangers of the early days it was still psychologically demanding and not recommended for anyone suffering from claustrophobia since it was expensive and timeconsuming to cut a large underground base out of solid rock or compacted lava the standard oneman living module was a room only about six feet wide ten feet long and eight feet high each room was attractively furnished and looked very much like a good motel suite with convertible sofa tv small hifi set and visionphone moreover by a simple trick of interior decoration the one unbroken wall could be converted by the flip of a switch into a convincing terrestrial landscape there was a choice of eight views this touch of luxury was typical of the base though it was sometimes hard to explain its necessity to the folk back on earth every man and woman in clavius had cost a hundred thousand dollars in training and transport and housing it was worth a little extra to maintain their peace of mind this was not art for arts sake but art for the sake of sanity one of the attractions of life in the base and on the moon as a whole was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general wellbeing however this had its dangers and it was several weeks before an emigrant from earth could adapt to it on the moon the human body had to learn a whole new set of reflexes it had for the first time to distinguish between mass and weight a man who weighed one hundred eighty pounds on earth might be delighted to discover that he weighed only thirty pounds on the moon as long as he moved in a straight line at a uniform speed he felt a wonderful sense of buoyancy but as soon as he attempted to change course to turn corners or to stop suddenly then he would find that his full one hundred eighty pounds of mass or inertia was still there for that was fixed and unalterable the same on earth moon sun or in free space before one could be properly adapted to lunar living therefore it was essential to learn that all objects were now six times as sluggish as their mere weight would suggest it was a lesson usually driven home by numerous collisions and hard knocks and old lunar hands kept their distance from newcomers until they were acclimatized with its complex of workshops offices storerooms computer center generators garage kitchen laboratories and foodprocessing plant clavius base was a miniature world in itself and ironically many of the skills that had been used to build this underground empire had been developed during the half century of the cold war any man who had ever worked in a hardened missile site would have felt at home in clavius here on the moon were the same arts and hardware of underground living and of protection against a hostile environment but here they had been turned to the purposes of peace after ten thousand years man had at last found something as exciting as war unfortunately not all nations had yet realized that fact the mountains that had been so prominent just before landing had mysteriously disappeared hidden from sight below the steeply curving lunar horizon around the spacecraft was a flat gray plain brilliantly lit by the slanting earthlight although the sky was of course completely black only the brighter stars and planets could be seen unless the eyes were shaded from the surface glare several very odd vehicles were rolling up to the arieslb spaceship cranes hoists servicing trucks some automatic some operated by a driver in a small pressure cabin most of them moved on balloon tires for this smooth level plain posed no transportation difficulties but one tanker rolled on the peculiar flexwheels which had proved one of the best allpurpose ways of getting around on the moon a series of flat plates arranged in a circle each plate independently mounted and sprung the flexwheel had many of the advantages of the caterpillar track from which it had evolved it would adapt its shape and diameter to the terrain over which it was moving and unlike a caterpillar track would continue to function even if a few sections were missing a small bus with an extension tube like a stubby elephant trunk was now nuzzling affectionately up against the spacecraft a few seconds later there were bangings and bumpings from outside followed by the sound of hissing air as connections were made and pressure was equalized the inner door of the airlock opened and the welcoming delegation entered it was led by ralph halvorsen the administrator of the southern province which meant not only the base but also any exploring parties that operated from it with him was his chief scientist dr roy michaels a grizzled little geophysicist whom floyd knew from previous visits and half a dozen senior scientists and executives they greeted him with respectful relief from the administrator downward it was obvious that they looked forward to a chance of unloading some of their worries very pleased to have you with us dr floyd said halvorsen did you have a good trip excellent floyd answered it couldnt have been better the crew looked after me very well he exchanged the usual small talk that courtesy demanded while the bus rolled away from the spacecraft by unspoken agreement no one mentioned the reason for his visit after traveling a thousand feet from the landing site the bus came to a large sign which read welcome to clavius base us astronautical engineering corps it then dived into a cutting which took it quickly below ground level a massive door opened ahead then closed behind them this happened again and yet a third time when the last door had closed there was a great roaring of air and they were back in atmosphere once more in the shirtsleeve environment of the base after a short walk through a tunnel packed with pipes and cables and echoing hollowly with rhythmic thumpings and throbbings they arrived in executive territory and floyd found himself back in the familiar environment of typewriters office computers girl assistants wall charts and ringing telephones as they paused outside the door labeled administrator halvorsen said diplomatically dr floyd and i will be along to the briefing room in a couple of minutes the others nodded made agreeable sounds and drifted off down the corridor but before halvorsen could usher floyd into his office there was an interruption the door opened and a small figure hurled itself at the administrator daddy youve been topside and you promised to take me now diana said halvorsen with exasperated tenderness i only said id take you if i could but ive been very busy meeting dr floyd shake hands with him hes just come from earth the little girl floyd judged that she was about eight extended a limp hand her face was vaguely familiar and floyd suddenly became aware that the administrator was looking at him with a quizzical smile with a shock of recollection he understood why i dont believe it he exclaimed when i was here last she was just a baby she had her fourth birthday last week halvorsen answered proudly children grow fast in this low gravity but they dont age so quickly theyll live longer than we do floyd stared in fascination at the selfassured little lady noting the graceful carriage and the unusually delicate bone structure its nice to meet you again diana he said then something perhaps sheer curiosity perhaps politeness impelled him to add would you like to go to earth her eyes widened with astonishment then she shook her head its a nasty place you hurt yourself when you fall down besides there are too many people so here floyd told himself is the first generation of the spaceborn there would be more of them in the years to come though there was sadness in this thought there was also a great hope when earth was tamed and tranquil and perhaps a little tired there would still be scope for those who loved freedom for the tough pioneers the restless adventurers but their tools would not be ax and gun and canoe and wagon they would be nuclear power plant and plasma drive and hydroponic farm the time was fast approaching when earth like all mothers must say farewell to her children with a mixture of threats and promises halvorsen managed to evict his determined offspring and led floyd into the office the administrators suite was only about fifteen feet square but it managed to contain all the fittings and status symbols of the typical a year head of a department signed photographs of important politicians including the president of the united states and the secretary general of the united nations adorned one wall while signed photos of celebrated astronauts covered most of another floyd sank into a comfortable leather chair and was given a glass of sherry courtesy of the lunar biochemical labs hows it going ralph floyd asked sipping the drink with caution then with approval not too bad halvorsen replied however there is something youd better know about before you go in there what is it well i suppose you could describe it as a morale problem halvorsen sighed oh it isnt serious yet but its getting there fast the news blackout floyd said flatly right halvorsen replied my people are getting very steamed up about it after all most of them have families back on earth they probably believe theyre all dead of moonplague im sorry about that said floyd but no one could think of a better cover story and so far its worked by the way i met moisevitch at the space station and even he bought it well that should make security happy not too happy hed heard of tma rumors are beginning to leak out but we just cant issue any statement until we know what the damn thing is and whether our chinese friends are behind it dr michaels thinks he has the answer to that hes dying to tell you floyd drained his glass and im dying to hear him lets go anomaly the briefing took place in a large rectangular chamber that could hold a hundred people with ease it was equipped with the latest optical and electronic displays and would have looked like a model conference room but for the numerous posters pinups notices and amateur paintings which indicated that it was also the center of the local cultural life floyd was particularly struck by a collection of signs obviously assembled with loving care which carried such messages as please keep off the grassno parking on even daysdefense de fumerto the beachcattle crossingsoft shoulders and do not feed the animals if these were genuine as they certainly appeared to be their transportation from earth had cost a small fortune there was a touching defiance about them on this hostile world men could still joke about the things they had been forced to leave behind and which their children would never miss a crowd of forty or fifty people was waiting for floyd and everyone rose politely as he entered behind the administrator as he nodded at several familiar faces floyd whispered to halvorsen id like to say a few words before the briefing floyd sat down in the front row while the administrator ascended the rostrum and looked round his audience ladies and gentlemen halvorsen began i neednt tell you that this is a very important occasion we are delighted to have dr heywood floyd with us we all know him by reputation and many of us are acquainted with him personally he has just completed a special flight from earth to be here and before the briefing he has a few words for us dr floyd floyd walked to the rostrum amid a sprinkling of polite applause surveyed the audience with a smile and said thank you i only want to say this the president has asked me to convey his appreciation of your outstanding work which we hope the world will soon be able to recognize im quite aware he continued carefully that some of you perhaps most of you are anxious that the present veil of secrecy be withdrawn you would not be scientists if you thought otherwise he caught a glimpse of dr michaels whose face was creased in a slight frown which brought out a long scar down his right cheek presumably the aftermath of some accident in space the geologist he was well aware had been protesting vigorously against what he called this cops and robbers nonsense but i would remind you floyd continued that this is a quite extraordinary situation we must be absolutely sure of our own facts if we make errors now there may be no second chance so please be patient a little longer those are also the wishes of the president thats all i have to say now im ready for your report he walked back to his seat the administrator said thank you very much dr floyd and nodded rather brusquely to his chief scientist on cue dr michaels walked up to the rostrum andthe lights faded out a photograph of the moon flashed onto the screen at the very center of the disk was a brilliant white crater ring from which a striking pattern of rays fanned out it looked exactly as if someone had hurled a bag of flour at the face of the moon and it had spattered out in all directions this is tycho said michaels pointing to the central crater on this vertical photograph tycho is even more conspicuous than when seen from earth then its rather near the edge of the moon but observed from this viewpoint looking straight down from a thousand miles up youll see how it dominates an entire hemisphere he let floyd absorb this unfamiliar view of a familiar object then continued during the past year we have been conducting a magnetic survey of the region from a lowlevel satellite it was completed only last month and this is the resultthe map that started all the trouble another picture flashed on the screen it looked like a contour map though it showed magnetic intensity not heights above sea level for the most part the lines were roughly parallel and spaced well apart but in one corner of the map they became suddenly packed together to form a series of concentric circles like a drawing of a knothole in a piece of wood even to an untrained eye it was obvious that something peculiar had happened to the moons magnetic field in this region and in large letters across the bottom of the map were the words tycho magnetic anomalyone stamped on the top right was classified at first we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock but all the geological evidence was against it and not even a big nickeliron meteorite could produce a field as intense as this so we decided to have a look the first party discovered nothing just the usual level terrain buried beneath a very thin layer of moondust they sank a drill in the exact center of the magnetic field to get a core sample for study twenty feet down the drill stopped so the survey party started to dig not an easy job in spacesuits as i can assure you what they found brought them back to base in a hurry we sent out a bigger team with better equipment they excavated for two weeks with the result you know the darkened assembly room became suddenly hushed and expectant as the picture on the screen changed though everyone had seen it many times there was not a person who failed to crane forward as if hoping to find new details on earth and moon less than a hundred people had so far been allowed to set eyes on this photograph it showed a man in a bright red and yellow spacesuit standing at the bottom of an excavation and supporting a surveyors rod marked off in tenths of a meter it was obviously a night shot and might have been taken anywhere on the moon or mars but until now no planet had ever produced a scene like this the object before which the spacesuited man was posing was a vertical slab of jetblack material about ten feet high and five feet wide it reminded floyd somewhat ominously of a giant tombstone perfectly sharpedged and symmetrical it was so black it seemed to have swallowed up the light falling upon it there was no surface detail at all it was impossible to tell whether it was made of stone or metal or plastic or some material altogether unknown to man tma dr michaels declared almost reverently it looks brand new doesnt it i can hardly blame those who thought it was just a few years old and tried to connect it with the third chinese expedition back in but i never believed that and now weve been able to date it positively from local geological evidence my colleagues and i dr floyd will stake our reputations on this tmal has nothing to do with the chinese indeed it has nothing to do with the human race for when it was buried there were no humans you see it is approximately three million years old what you are now looking at is the first evidence of intelligent life beyond the earth journey by earthlight macrocrater province extends s from near center of visible face of moon e of central crater province densely pocked with impact craters many large and including the largest on moon in n some craters fractured from impact forming mare imbrium rough surfaces almost everywhere except for some crater bottoms most surfaces in slopes mostly to some crater bottoms nearly level landing and movement landing generally difficult because of rough sloping surfaces less difficult in some level crater bottoms movement possible almost everywhere but route selection required less difficult on some level crater bottoms construction generally moderately difficult because of slope and numerous large blocks in loose material excavation of lava difficult in some crater bottoms tycho postmaria crater miles diameter rim feet above surroundings bottom feet deep has the most prominent ray system on the moon some rays extending more than miles the mobile lab now rolling across the crater plain at fifty miles an hour looked rather like an outsized trailer mounted on eight flexwheels but it was very much more than this it was a selfcontained base in which twenty men could live and work for several weeks indeed it was virtually a landgoing spaceship and in an emergency it could even fly if it came to a crevasse or canyon which was too large to detour and too steep to enter it could hop across the obstacle on its four underjets as he peered out of the window floyd could see stretching ahead of him a welldefined trail where dozens of vehicles had left a hardpacked band in the friable surface of the moon at regular intervals along the track were tall slender rods each carrying a flashing light no one could possibly get lost on the mile journey from clavius base to tma even though it was still night and the sun would not rise for several hours the stars overhead were only a little brighter or more numerous than on a clear night from the high plateaus of new mexico or colorado but there were two things in that coalblack sky that destroyed any illusion of earth the first was earth itself a blazing beacon hanging above the northern horizon the light pouring down from that giant halfglobe was dozens of times more brilliant than the full moon and it covered all this land with a cold bluegreen phosphorescence the second celestial apparition was a faint pearly cone of light slanting up the eastern sky it became brighter and brighter toward the horizon hinting of great fires just concealed below the edge of the moon here was a pale glory that no man had ever seen from earth save during the few moments of a total eclipse it was the corona harbinger of the lunar dawn giving notice that before long the sun would smite this sleeping land as he sat with halvorsen and michaels in the forward observation lounge immediately beneath the drivers position floyd found his thoughts turning again and again to the threemillionyearwide gulf that had just opened up before him like all scientifically literate men he was used to considering far longer periods of time but they had concerned only the movements of stars and the slow cycles of the inanimate universe mind or intelligence had not been involved those eons were empty of all that touched the emotions three million years the infinitely crowded panorama of written history with its empires and its kings its triumphs and its tragedies covered barely one thousandth of this appalling span of time not only man himself but most of the animals now alive on earth did not even exist when this black enigma was so carefully buried here in the most brilliant and most spectacular of all the craters of the moon that it had been buried and quite deliberately dr michaels was absolutely sure at first he explained i rather hoped it might mark the site of some underground structure but our latest excavations have eliminated that its sitting on a wide platform of the same black material with undisturbed rock beneath it the creatures who designed it wanted to make sure it stayed put barring major moonquakes they were building for eternity there was triumph and yet sadness in michaels voice and floyd could share both emotions at last one of mans oldest questions had been answered here was the proof beyond all shadow of doubt that his was not the only intelligence that the universe had brought forth but with that knowledge there came again an aching awareness of the immensity of time whatever had passed this way had missed mankind by a hundred thousand generations perhaps floyd told himself it was just as well and yet what we might have learned from creatures who could cross space while our ancestors were still living in trees a few hundred yards ahead a signpost was coming up over the moons strangely close horizon at its base was a tentshaped structure covered with shining silver foil obviously for protection against the fierce heat of day as the bus rolled by floyd was able to read in the brilliant earthlight emergency depot no kilos lox kilos water foodpaks mk toolkit type b suit repair outfit telephone have you thought of that asked floyd pointing out of the window suppose the things a supply cache left behind by an expedition that never returned its a possibility admitted michaels that magnetic field certainly labeled its position so that it could be easily found but its rather small it couldnt hold much in the way of supplies why not interjected halvorsen who knows bow big they were perhaps they were only six inches tall which would make the thing twenty or thirty stories high michaels shook his head out of the question he protested you cant have very small intelligent creatures you need a minimum brain size michaels and halvorsen floyd had noticed usually took opposing viewpoints yet there appeared to be little personal hostility or friction between them they seemed to respect each other and simply agreed to disagree there was certainly little agreement anywhere about the nature of tma or the tycho monolith as some preferred to call it retaining part of the abbreviation in the six hours since he had landed on the moon floyd had heard a dozen theories but had committed himself to none shrine survey marker tomb geophysical instrument these were perhaps the favorite suggestions and some of the protagonists grew very heated in their defense a good many bets hadalready been placed and a lot of money would change hands when the truth was finally known if indeed it ever was so far the hard black material of the slab had resisted all the rather mild attempts that michaels and his colleagues had made to obtain samples they had no doubt that a laser beam would cut into it for surely nothing could resist that frightful concentration of energy but the decision to employ such violent measures would be left to floyd he had already decided that x rays sonic probes neutron beams and all other nondestructive means of investigation would be brought into play before he called up the heavy artillery of the laser it was the mark of a barbarian to destroy something one could not understand but perhaps men were barbarians beside the creatures who had made this thing and where could they have come from the moon itself no that was utterly impossible if there had ever been indigenous life on this barren world it had been destroyed during the last craterforming epoch when most of the lunar surface was whitehot earth very unlikely though perhaps not quite impossible any advanced terrestrial civilization presumably a nonhuman one back in the pleistocene era would have left many other traces of its existence we would have known all about it thought floyd long before we got to the moon that left two alternatives the planets and the stars yet all the evidence was against intelligent life elsewhere in the solar system or indeed life of any kind except on earth and mars the inner planets were too hot the outer ones far too cold unless one descended into their atmosphere to depths where the pressures amounted to hundreds of tons to the square inch so perhaps these visitors had come from the stars yet that was even more incredible as he looked up at the constellations strewn across the ebon lunar sky floyd remembered how often his fellow scientists had proved that interstellar travel was impossible the journey from earth to moon was still fairly impressive but the very nearest star was a hundred million times more distantspeculation was a waste of time he must wait until there was more evidence please fasten your seat belts and secure all loose objects said the cabin speaker suddenly forty degree slope approaching two marker posts with winking lights had appeared on the horizon and the bus was steering between them floyd had barely adjusted his straps when the vehicle slowly edged itself over the brink of a really terrifying incline and began to descend a long rubblecovered slope as steep as the roof of a house the slanting earthlight coming from behind them now gave very little illumination and the buss own floodlights had been switched on many years ago floyd had stood on the lip of vesuvius staring into the crater he could easily imagine that he was now driving down into it and the sensation was not a very pleasant one they were descending one of the inner terraces of tycho and it leveled out again some thousand feet below as they crawled down the slope michaels pointed out across the great expanse of plain now spread out beneath them there they are he exclaimed floyd nodded he had already noticed the cluster of red and green lights several miles ahead and kept his eyes fixed upon it as the bus edged its way delicately down the slope the big vehicle was obviously under perfect control but he did not breathe easily until it was once more on an even keel now he could see glistening like silver bubbles in the earthlight a group of pressure domes the temporary shelters housing the workers on the site near these was a radio tower a drilling rig a group of parked vehicles and a large pile of broken rock presumably the material that had been excavated to reveal the monolith this tiny camp in the wilderness looked very lonely very vulnerable to the forces of nature ranged silently around it there was no sign of life and no visible hint as to why men had come here so far from home you can just see the crater said michaels over there on the right about a hundred yards from that radio antenna so this is it thought floyd as the bus rolled past the pressure domes and came to the lip of the crater his pulse quickened as he craned forward for a better view the vehicle began to creep cautiously down a ramp of hardpacked rock into the interior of the crater and there exactly as he had seen it in the photographs was tma floyd stared blinked shook his head and stared again even in the brilliant earthlight it was hard to see the object clearly his first impression was of a flat rectangle that might have been cut out of carbon paper it seemed to have no thickness at all of course this was an optical illusion though he was looking at a solid body it reflected so little light that he could see it only in silhouette the passengers were utterly silent as the bus descended into the crater there was awe and there was also incredulity sheer disbelief that the dead moon of all worlds could have sprung this fantastic surprise the bus came to a halt within twenty feet of the slab and broadside on so that all the passengers could examine it yet beyond the geometrically perfect shape of the thing there was little to see nowhere were there any marks or any abatement of its ultimate ebon blackness it was the very crystallization of night and for one moment floyd wondered if it could indeed be some extraordinary natural formation born of the fires and pressures attending the creation of the moon but that remote possibility he knew had already been examined and dismissed at some signal floodlights around the lip of the crater were switched on and the bright earthlight was obliterated by a far more brilliant glare in the lunar vacuum the beams were of course completely invisible they formed overlapping ellipses of blinding white centered on the monolith and where they touched it its ebon surface seemed to swallow them pandoras box thought floyd with a sudden sense of foreboding waiting to be opened by inquisitive man and what will he find inside the slow dawn the main pressure dome at the tma site was only twenty feet across and its interior was uncomfortably crowded the bus coupled to it through one of the two airlocks gave some muchappreciated extra living room inside this hemispherical doublewalled balloon lived worked and slept the six scientists and technicians now permanently attached to the project it also contained most of their equipment and instruments all the stores that could not be left in the vacuum outside cooking washing and toilet facilities geological samples and a small tv screen through which the site could be kept under continuous surveillance floyd was not surprised when halvorsen elected to remain in the dome he stated his views with admirable frankness i regard spacesuits as a necessary evil said the administrator i wear one four times a year for my quarterly checkout tests if you dont mind ill sit here and watch over the tv some of this prejudice was now unjustified for the latest models were infinitely more comfortable than the clumsy suits of armor worn by the first lunar explorers they could be put on in less than a minute even without help and were quite automatic the mk v into which floyd was now carefully sealed would protect him from the worst that the moon could do either by day or by night accompanied by dr michaels he walked into the small airlock as the throbbing of the pumps died away and his suit stiffened almost imperceptibly around him he felt himself enclosed in the silence of vacuum that silence was broken by the welcome sound of his suit radio pressure ok dr floyd are you breathing normally yes im fine his companion carefully checked the dials and gauges on the outside of floyds suit then he said ok lets go the outer door opened and the dusty moonscape lay before them glimmering in the earthlight with a cautious waddling movement floyd followed michaels through the lock it was not hard to walk indeed in a paradoxical way the suit made him feel more at home than at any time since reaching the moon its extra weight and the slight resistance it imposed on his motion gave some of the illusion of the lost terrestrial gravity the scene had changed since the party had arrived barely an hour ago though the stars and the halfearth were still as bright as ever the fourteenday lunar night had almost ended the glow of the corona was like a false moonrise along the eastern sky and then without warning the tip of the radio mast a hundred feet above floyds head suddenly seemed to burst into flame as it caught the first rays of the hidden sun they waited while the project supervisor and two of his assistants emerged from the airlock then walked slowly toward the crater by the time they had reached it a thin bow of unbearable incandescence had thrust itself above the eastern horizon though it would take more than an hour for the sun to clear the edge of the slowly turning moon the stars were already banished the crater was still in shadow but the floodlights mounted around its rim lit the interior brilliantly as floyd walked slowly down the ramp toward the black rectangle he felt a sense not only of awe but of helplessness here at the very portals of earth man was already face to face with a mystery that might never be solved three million years ago something had passed this way had left this unknown and perhaps unknowable symbol of itspurpose and had returned to the planets or to the stars floyds suit radio interrupted his reverie project supervisor speaking if youd all line up on this side wed like to take a few photos dr floyd will you stand in the middle dr michaels thank you no one except floyd seemed to think that there was anything funny about this in all honesty he had to admit that he was glad someone had brought a camera here was a photo that would undoubtedly be historic and he wanted copies for himself he hoped that his face would be clearly visible through the helmet of the suit thanks gentlemen said the photographer after they had posed somewhat selfconsciously in front of the monolith and he had made a dozen exposures well ask the base photo section to send you copies then floyd turned his full attention to the ebon slab walking slowly around it examining it from every angle trying to imprint its strangeness upon his mind he did not expect to find anything for he knew that every square inch had already been gone over with microscopic care now the sluggish sun had lifted itself above the edge of the crater and its rays were pouring almost broadside upon the eastern face of the block yet it seemed to absorb every particle of light as if it had never been floyd decided to try a simple experiment he stood between the monolith and the sun and looked for his own shadow on the smooth black sheet there was no trace of it at least ten kilowatts of raw heat must be falling on the slab if there was anything inside it must be rapidly cooking how strange floyd thought to stand here while this thing is seeing daylight for the first time since the ice ages began on earth he wondered again about its black color that was ideal of course for absorbing solar energy but he dismissed the thought at once for who would be crazy enough to bury a sunpowered device twenty feet underground he looked up at the earth beginning to wane in the morning sky only a handful of the six billion people there knew of this discovery how would the world react to the news when it was finally released the political and social implications were immense every person of real intelligence everyone who looked an inch beyond his nose would find his life his values his philosophy subtly changed even if nothing whatsoever was discovered about tma and it remained an eternal mystery man would know that he was not unique in the universe though he had missed them by millions of years those who had once stood here might yet return and if not there might well be others all futures must now contain this possibility floyd was still musing over these thoughts when his helmet speaker suddenly emitted a piercing electronic shriek like a hideously overloaded and distorted time signal involuntarily he tried to block his ears with his spacesuited hands then he recovered and groped frantically for the gain control of his receiver while he was still fumbling four more of the shrieks blasted out of the ether then there was a merciful silence all around the crater figures were standing in attitudes of paralyzed astonishment so its nothing wrong with my gear floyd told himself everyone heard those piercing electronic screams after three million years of darkness tma had greeted the lunar dawn the listeners a hundred million miles beyond mars in the cold loneliness where no man had yet traveled deep space monitor drifted slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids for three years it had fulfilled its mission flawlessly a tribute to the american scientists who had designed it the british engineers who had built it the russian technicians who had launched it a delicate spidersweb of antennas sampled the passing waves of radio noise the ceaseless crackle and hiss of what pascal in a far simpler age had naively called the silence of infinite space radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond neutron and xray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would ever see magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds as the sun breathed millionmileanhour blasts of tenuous plasma into the faces of its circling children all these things and many others were patiently noted by deep space monitor and recorded in its crystalline memory one of its antennas by now unconsidered miracles of electronics was always aimed at a point never far from the sun every few months its distant target could have been seen had there been any eye here to watch as a bright star with a close fainter companion but most of the time it was lost in the solar glaze to that faroff planet earth every twentyfour hours the monitor would send the information it had patiently garnered packed neatly into one fiveminute pulse about a quarter of an hour late traveling at the speed of light that pulse would reach its destination the machines whose duty it was would be waiting for it they would amplify and record the signal and add it to the thousands of miles of magnetic tape now stored in the vaults of the world space centers at washington moscow and canberra since the first satellites had orbited almost fifty years earlier trillions and quadrillions of pulses of information had been pouring down from space to be stored against the day when they might contribute to the advance of knowledge only a minute fraction of all this raw material would ever be processed but there was no way of telling what observation some scientist might wish to consult ten or fifty or a hundred years from now so everything had to be kept on file stacked in endless airconditioned galleries triplicated at the three centers against the possibility of accidental loss it was part of the real treasure of mankind more valuable than all the gold locked uselessly away in bank vaults and now deep space monitor had noted something strange a faint yet unmistakable disturbance rippling across the solar system and quite unlike any natural phenomenon it had ever observed in the past automatically it recorded the direction the time the intensity in a few hours it would pass the information to earth as also would orbiter m circling mars twice a day and high inclination probe climbing slowly above the plane of the ecliptic and even artificial comet heading out into the cold wastes beyond pluto along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years all noted the peculiar burst of energy that had disturbed their instruments all in due course reported back automatically to the memory stores on distant earth the computers might never have perceived the connection between four peculiar sets of signals from spaceprobes on independent orbits millions of miles apart but as soon as he glanced at his morning report the radiation forecaster at goddard knew that something strange had passed through the solar system during the last twentyfour hours he had only part of its track but when the computer projected it on the planet situation board it was as clear and unmistakable as a vapor trail across a cloudless sky or a single line of footprints over a field of virgin snow some immaterial pattern of energy throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat had leaped from the face of the moon and was heading out toward the stars iii between planets discovery the ship was still only thirty days from earth yet david bowman sometimes found it hard to believe that be had ever known any other existence than the closed little world of discovery all his years of training all his earlier missions to the moon and mars seemed to belong to another man in another life frank poole admitted to the same feelings and had sometimes jokingly regretted that the nearest psychiatrist was the better part of a hundred million miles away but this sense of isolation and estrangement was easy enough to understand and certainly indicated no abnormality in the fifty years since men had ventured into space there had never been a mission quite like this it had begun five years ago as project jupiter the first manned round trip to the greatest of the planets the ship was nearly ready for the twoyear voyage when somewhat abruptly the mission profile had been changed discovery would still go to jupiter but she would not stop there she would not even slacken speed as she raced through the farranging jovian satellite system on the contrary she would use the gravitational field of the giant world us a sling to cast her even farther from the sun like a comet she would streak on across the outer reaches of the solar system to her ultimate goal the ringed glory of saturn and she would never return for discovery it would be a oneway trip yet her crew had no intention of committing suicide if all went well they would be back on earth within seven years five of which would pass like a flash in the dreamless sleep of hibernation while they awaited rescue by the still unbuilt discovery ii the word rescue was carefully avoided in all the astronautics agencys statements and documents it implied some failure of planning and the approved jargon was reacquisition if anything went really wrong there would certainly be no hope of rescue almost a billion miles from earth it was a calculated risk like all voyages into the unknown but half a century of research had proved that artificially induced human hibernation was perfectly safe and it had opened up new possibilities in space travel not until this mission however had they been exploited to the utmost the three members of the survey team who would not be needed until the ship entered her final orbit around saturn would sleep through the entire outward flight tons of food and other expendables would thus be saved almost as important the team would be fresh and alert and not fatigued by the tenmonth voyage when they went into action discovery would enter a parking orbit around saturn becoming a new moon of the giant planet she would swing back and forth along a twomillionmile ellipse that took her close to saturn and then across the orbits of all its major moons they would have a hundred days in which to map and study a world with eighty times the area of earth and surrounded by a retinue of at least fifteen known satellites one of them as large as the planet mercury there must be wonders enough here for centuries of study the first expedition could only carry out a preliminary reconnaissance all that it found would be radioed back to earth even if the explorers never returned their discoveries would not be lost at the end of the hundred days discovery would close down all the crew would go into hibernation only the essential systems would continue to operate watched over by the ships tireless electronic brain she would continue to swing around saturn on an orbit now so well determined that men would know exactly where to look for her a thousand years hence but in only five years according to present plans discovery ii would come even if six or seven or eight years elapsed her sleeping passengers would never know the difference for all of them the clock would have stopped as it had stopped already for whitehead kaminski and hunter sometimes bowman as first captain of discovery envied his three unconscious colleagues in the frozen peace of the hibernaculum they were free from all boredom and all responsibility until they reached saturn the external world did not exist but that world was watching them through their biosensor displays tucked inconspicuously away among the massed instrumentation of the control deck were five small panels marked hunter whitehead kaminski poole bowman the last two were blank and lifeless their time would not come until a year from now the others bore constellations of tiny green lights announcing that everything was well and on each was a small display screen across which sets of glowing lines traced the leisurely rhythms that indicated pulse respiration and brain activity there were times when bowman well aware how unnecessary this was for the alarm would sound instantly if anything was wrong would switch over to audio output he would listen half hypnotized to the infinitely slow heartbeats of his sleeping colleagues keeping his eyes fixed on the sluggish waves that marched in synchronism across the screen most fascinating of all were the eeg displays the electronic signatures of three personalities that had once existed and would one day exist again they were almost free from the spikes and valleys the electrical explosions that marked the activity of the waking brain or even of the brain in normal sleep if there was any wisp of consciousness remaining it was beyond the reach of instruments and of memory this last fact bowman knew from personal experience before he was chosen for this mission his reactions to hibernation had been tested he was not sure whether he had lost a week of his life or whether he had postponed his eventual death by the same amount of time when the electrodes had been attached to his forehead and the sleepgenerator had started to pulse he had seen a brief display of kaleidoscopic patterns and drifting stars then they had faded and darkness had engulfed him he had never felt the injections still less the first touch of cold as his body temperature was reduced to only a few degrees above freezing he awoke and it seemed that he had scarcely closed his eyes but he knew that was an illusion somehow he was convinced that years had really passed had the mission been completed had they already reached saturn carried out their survey and gone into hibernation was discovery ii here to take them back to earth he lay in a dreamlike haze utterly unable to distinguish between real and false memories he opened his eyes but there was little to see except a blurred constellation of lights which puzzled him for some minutes then he realized that he was looking at the indicator lamps on a ship situation board but it was impossible to focus on them he soon gave up the attempt warm air was blowing across him removing the chill from his limbs there was quiet but stimulating music welling from a speaker behind his head it was slowly growing louder and louder then a relaxed friendly but he knew computer generated voice spoke to him you are becoming operational dave do not get up or attempt any violent movements do not try to speak do not get up thought bowman that was funny he doubted if he could wriggle a finger rather to his surprise he found that he could he felt quite contented in a dazed stupid kind of way he knew dimly that the rescue ship must have come that the automatic revival sequence had been triggered and that soon he would be seeing other human beings that was fine but he did not get excited about it presently he felt hunger the computer of course had anticipated this need there is a signal button by your right hand dave if you are hungry please press it bowman forced his fingers to hunt around and presently discovered the pearshaped bulb he had forgotten all about it though he must have known it was there how much else had he forgotten did hibernation erase memory he pressed the button and waited several minutes later a metal arm moved out from the bunk and a plastic nipple descended toward his lips he sucked on it eagerly and a warm sweet fluid coursed down his throat brining renewed strength with every drop presently it went away and he rested once more he could move his arms and legs now the thought of walking was no longer an impossible dream though he felt his strength swiftly returning he would have been content to lie here forever if there had been no further stimulus from outside but presently another voice spoke to him and this time it was wholly human not a construct of electrical pulses assembled by a morethanhuman memory it was also a familiar voice though it was some time before he could recognize it hello dave youre coming round fine you can talk now do you know where you are he worried about this for some time if he was really orbiting saturn what had happened during all the months since he had left earth again he began to wonder if he was suffering from amnesia paradoxically that very thought reassured him if he could remember the word amnesia his brain must be in fairly good shape but he still did not know where he was and the speaker at the other end of the circuit must have understood his situation completely dont worry dave this is frank poole im watching your heart and respirationeverything is perfectly normal just relax take it easy were going to open the door now and pull you out soft light flooded into the chamber he saw moving shapes silhouetted against the widening entrance and in that moment all his memories came back to him and be knew exactly where he was though he had come back safely from the furthest borders of sleep and the nearest borders of death he had been gone only a week when he left the hibernaculum he would not see the cold saturnian sky that was more than a year in the future and a billion miles away he was still in the trainer at the houston space flight center under the hot texas sun hal but now texas was invisible and even the united states was hard to see though the lowthrust plasma drive had long since been closed down discovery was still coasting with her slender arrowlike body pointed away from earth and all her highpowered optical gear was oriented toward the outer planets where her destiny lay there was one telescope however that was permanently aimed at earth it was mounted like a gunsight on the rim of the ships longrange antenna and checked that the great parabolic bowl was rigidly locked upon its distant target while earth remained centered in the crosswires the vital communication link was intact and messages could come and go along the invisible beam that lengthened more than two million miles with every day that passed at least once in every watch period bowman would lock homeward through the antennaalignment telescope as earth was now far back toward the sun its darkened hemisphere faced discovery and on the central display screen the planet appeared as a dazzling silver crescent like another venus it was rare that any geographical features could be identified in that evershrinking arc of light for cloud and haze concealed them but even the darkened portion of the disk was endlessly fascinating it was sprinkled with shining cities sometimes they burned with a steady light sometimes they twinkled like fireflies as atmospheric tremors passed over them there were also periods when as the moon swung back and forth in its orbit it shone down like a great lamp upon the darkened seas and continents of earth then with a thrill of recognition bowman could often glimpse familiar coastlines shining in that spectral lunar light and sometimes when the pacific was calm he could even see the moonglow shimmering across its face and he would remember nights beneath the palm trees of tropical lagoons yet he had no regrets for these lost beauties he had enjoyed them all in his thirtyfive years of life and he was determined to enjoy them again when he returned rich and famous meanwhile distance made them all the more precious the sixth member of the crew cared for none of these things for it was not human it was the highly advanced hal computer the brain and nervous system of the ship hal was a masterwork of the third computer breakthrough these seemed to occur at intervals of twenty years and the thought that another one was now imminent already worried a great many people the first had been in the s when the longobsolete vacuum tube had made possible such clumsy highspeed morons as eniac and its successors then in the s solidstate microelectronics had been perfected with its advent it was clear that artificial intelligences at least as powerful as mans need be no larger than office desks if one only knew how to construct them probably no one would ever know this it did not matter in the s minsky and good had shown how neural networks could be generated automatically self replicated in accordance with any arbitrary learning program artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain in any given case the precise details would never be known and even if they were they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding whatever way it worked the final result was a machine intelligence that could reproduce some philosophers still preferred to use the word mimic most of the activities of the human brain and with far greater speed and reliability it was extremely expensive and only a few units of the hal series had yet been built but the old jest that it would always be easier to make organic brains by unskilled labor was beginning to sound a little hollow hal had been trained for this mission as thoroughly as his human colleagues and at many times their rate of input for in addition to his intrinsic speed he never slept his prime task was to monitor the lifesupport systems continually checking oxygen pressure temperature hull leakage radiation and all the other interlocking factors upon which the lives of the fragile human cargo depended he could carry out the intricate navigational corrections and execute the necessary flight maneuvers when it was time to change course and he could watch over the hibernators making any necessary adjustments to their environment and doling out the minute quantities of intravenous fluids that kept them alive the first generations of computers had received their inputs through glorified typewriter keyboards and had replied through highspeed printers and visual displays hal could do this when necessary but most of his communication with his shipmates was by means of the spoken word poole and bowman could talk to hal as if he were a human being and he would reply in the perfect idiomatic english he had learned during the fleeting weeks of his electronic childhood whether hal could actually think was a question which had been settled by the british mathematician alan turing back in the s turing had pointed out that if one could carry out a prolonged conversation with a machine whether by typewriter or microphone was immaterial without being able to distinguish between its replies and those that a man might give then the machine was thinking by any sensible definition of the word hal could pass the turing test with ease the time might even come when hal would take command of the ship in an emergency if no one answered his signals he would attempt to wake the sleeping members of the crew by electrical and chemical stimulation if they did not respond he would radio earth for further orders and then if there was no reply from earth he would take what measures he deemed necessary to safeguard the ship and to continue the mission whose real purpose he alone knew and which his human colleagues could never have guessed poole and bowman had often humorously referred to themselves as caretakers or janitors aboard a ship that could really run itself they would have been astonished and more than a little indignant to discover how much truth that jest contained cruise mode the daybyday running of the ship had been planned with great care and theoretically at least bowman and poole knew what they would be doing at every moment of the twentyfour hours they operated on a twelvehourson twelvehoursoff basis taking charge alternately and never being both asleep at the same time the officer on duty remained on the control deck while his deputy saw to the general housekeeping inspected the ship coped with the odd jobs that constantly arose or relaxed in his cubicle although bowman was nominal captain on this phase of the mission no outside observer could have deduced the fact he and poole switched roles rank and responsibilities completely every twelve hours this kept them both at peak training minimized the chances of friction and helped toward the goal of percent redundancy bowmans day began at ships time the universal ephemeris time of the astronomers if he was late hal had a variety of beeps and chimes to remind him of his duty but they had never been used as a test poole had once switched off the alarm bowman had still risen automatically at the right time his first official act of the day would be to advance the master hibernation timer twelve hours if this operation was missed twice in a row hal would assume that both he and poole had been incapacitated and would take the necessary emergency action bowman would attend to his toilet and do his isometric exercises before settling down to breakfast and the mornings radiofax edition of the world times on earth he never read the paper as carefully as he did now even the smallest items of society gossip the most fleeting political rumors seemed of absorbing interest as it flashed across the screen at he would officially relieve poole on the control deck bringing him a squeezetube of coffee from the kitchen if as was usually the case there was nothing to report and no action to be taken he would settle down to check all the instrument readings and would run through a series of tests designed to spot possible malfunctions by this would be finished and he would start on a study period bowman had been a student for more than half his life he would continue to be one until he retired thanks to the twentiethcentury revolution in training and informationhandling techniques he already possessed the equivalent of two or three college educations and what was more he could remember percent of what he had learned fifty years ago he would have been considered a specialist in applied astronomy cybernetics and space propulsion systems yet he was prone to deny with genuine indignation that he was a specialist at all bowman had never found it possible to focus his interest exclusively on any subject despite the dark warnings of his instructors he had insisted on taking his masters degree in general astronautics a course with a vague and woolly syllabus designed for those whose iqs were in the low s and who would never reach the top ranks of their profession his decision had been right that very refusal to specialize had made him uniquely qualified for his present task in much the same way frank poole who sometimes disparagingly called himself general practitioner in space biology had been an ideal choice as his deputy the two of them with if necessary help from hals vast stores of information could cope with any problems likely to arise during the voyage as long as they kept their minds alert and receptive and continually reengraved old patterns of memory so for two hours from to bowman would engage in a dialogue with an electronic tutor checking his general knowledge or absorbing material specific to this mission he would prowl endlessly over ships plans circuit diagrams and voyage profiles or would try to assimilate all that was known about jupiter saturn and their farranging families of moons at midday he would retire to the galley and leave the ship to hal while he prepared his lunch even here he was still fully in touch with events for the tiny loungecumdining room contained a duplicate of the situation display panel and hal could call him at a moments notice poole would join him for this meal before retiring for his sixhour sleep period and usually they would watch one of the regular tv programs beamed to them from earth their menus had been planned with as much care as any part of the mission the food most of it freezedried was uniformly excellent and had been chosen for the minimum of trouble packets had merely to be opened and popped into the tiny autogalley which beeped for attention when the job was done they could enjoy what tasted like and equally important looked like orange juice eggs steaks chops roasts fresh vegetables assorted fruits ice cream and even freshly baked bread after lunch from to bowman would make a slow and careful tour of the ship or such part of it as was accessible discovery measured almost four hundred feet from end to end but the little universe occupied by her crew lay entirely inside the fortyfoot sphere of the pressure hull here were all the lifesupport systems and the control deck which was the operational heart of the ship below this was a small spacegarage fitted with three airlocks through which powered capsules just large enough to hold a man could sail out into the void if the need arose for extravehicular activity the equatorial region of the pressure sphere the slice as it were from capricorn to cancer enclosed a slowly rotating drum thirtyfive feet in diameter as it made one revolution every ten seconds this carrousel or centrifuge produced an artificial gravity equal to that of the moon this was enough to prevent the physical atrophy which would result from the complete absence of weight and it also allowed the routine functions of living to be carried out under normal or nearly normal conditions the carrousel therefore contained the kitchen dining washing and toilet facilities only here was it safe to prepare and handle hot drinks quite dangerous in weightless conditions where one can be badly scalded by floating globules of boiling water the problem of shaving was also solved there would be no weightless bristles drifting around to endanger electrical equipment and produce a health hazard around the rim of the carrousel were five tiny cubicles fitted out by each astronaut according to taste and containing his personal belongings only bowmans and pooles were now in use while the future occupants of the other three cabins reposed in their electronic sarcophagi next door the spin of the carrousel could be stopped if necessary when this happened its angular momentum had to be stored in a flywheel and switched back again when rotation was restarted but normally it was left running at constant speed for it was easy enough to enter the big slowly turning drum by going handoverhand along a pole through the zerogee region at its center transferring to the moving section was as easy and automatic after a little experience as stepping onto a moving escalator the spherical pressure hull formed the head of a flimsy arrowshaped structure more than a hundred yards long discovery like all vehicles intended for deep space penetration was too fragile and unstreamlined ever to enter an atmosphere or to defy the full gravitational field of any planet she had been assembled in orbit around the earth tested on a translunar maiden flight and finally checked out in orbit above the moon she was a creature of pure space and she looked it immediately behind the pressure hull was grouped a cluster of four large liquid hydrogen tanks and beyond them forming a long slender v were the radiating fins that dissipated the waste heat of the nuclear reactor veined with a delicate tracery of pipes for the cooling fluid they looked like the wings of some vast dragonfly and from certain angles gave discovery a fleeting resemblance to an oldtime sailing ship at the very end of the v three hundred feet from the crewcompartment was the shielded inferno of the reactor and the complex of focusing electrodes through which emerged the incandescent starstuff of the plasma drive this had done its work weeks ago forcing discovery out of her parking orbit round the moon now the reactor was merely ticking over as it generated electrical power for the ships services and the great radiating fins that would glow cherry red when discovery was accelerating under maximum thrust were dark and cool although it would require an excursion out into space to examine this region of the ship there were instruments and remote tv cameras which gave a full report on conditions here bowman now felt that he knew intimately every square foot of radiator panels and every piece of plumbing associated with them by he would have finished his inspection and would make a detailed verbal report to mission control talking until the acknowledgment started to come in then he would switch off his own transmitter listen to what earth had to say and send back his reply to any queries at hours poole would awaken and he would hand over command he would then have six offduty hours to use as he pleased sometimes he would continue his studies or listen to music or look at movies much of the time he would wander at will through the ships inexhaustible electronic library he had become fascinated by the great explorations of the past understandably enough in the circumstances sometimes he would cruise with pytheas out through the pillars of hercules along the coast of a europe barely emerging from the stone age and venture almost to the chill mists of the arctic or two thousand years later he would pursue the manila galleons with anson sail with cook along the unknown hazards of the great barrier reef achieve with magellan the first circumnavigation of the world and he began to read the odyssey which of all books spoke to him most vividly across the gulfs of time for relaxation he could always engage hal in a large number of semimathematical games including checkers chess and polyominoes if hal went all out he could win anyone of them but that would be bad for morale so he had been programmed to win only fifty percent of the time and his human partners pretended not to know this the last hours of bowmans day were devoted to general cleaning up and odd jobs followed by dinner at again with poole then there would be an hour during which he would make or receive any personal call from earth like all his colleagues bowman was unmarried it was not fair to send family men on a mission of such duration though numerous ladies had promised to wait until the expedition returned no one had really believed this at first both poole and bowman had been making rather intimate personal calls once a week though the knowledge that many ears must be listening at the earth end of the circuit tended to inhibit them yet already though the voyage was scarcely started the warmth and frequency of the conversations with their girls on earth had begun to diminish they had expected this it was one of the penalties of an astronauts way of life as it had once been of a mariners it was true indeed notorious that seamen had compensations at other ports unfortunately there were no tropical islands full of dusky maids beyond the orbit of earth the space medics of course had tackled this problem with their usual enthusiasm the ships pharmacopoeia provided adequate though hardly glamorous substitutes just before he signed off bowman would make his final report and check that hal had transmitted all the instrumentation tapes for the days run then if he felt like it he would spend a couple of hours either reading or looking at a movie and at midnight he would go to sleep usually without any help from electronarcosis pooles program was a mirror image of his own and the two schedules dovetailed together without friction both men were fully occupied they were too intelligent and welladjusted to quarrel and the voyage had settled down to a comfortable utterly uneventful routine the passage of time marked only by the changing numbers on the digital clocks the greatest hope of discoverys little crew was that nothing would mar this peaceful monotony in the weeks and months that lay ahead through the asteroids week after week running like a streetcar along the tracks of her utterly predetermined orbit discovery swept past the orbit of mars and on toward jupiter unlike all the vessels traversing the skies or seas of earth she required not even the most minute touch on the controls her course was fixed by the laws of gravitation there were no uncharted shoals no dangerous reefs on which she would run aground nor was there the slightest danger of collision with another ship for there was no vessel at least of mans making anywhere between her and the infinitely distant stars yet the space which she was now entering was far from empty ahead lay a nomans land threaded by the paths of more than a million asteroids less than ten thousand of which had ever had their orbits precisely determined by astronomers only four were over a hundred miles in diameter the vast majority were merely giant boulders trundling aimlessly through space there was nothing that could be done about them though even the smallest could completely destroy the ship if it slammed into it at tens of thousands of miles an hour the chance of this happening was negligible on the average there was only one asteroid in a volume a million miles on a side that discovery should also happen to occupy this same point and at the same time was the very least of her crews worries on day they were due to make their closest approach to any known asteroid it had no name merely the number and was a fiftyyarddiameter rock that had been detected by the lunar observatory in and immediately forgotten except by the patient computers of the minor planet bureau when bowman came on duty hal promptly reminded hint of the forthcoming encounter not that he was likely to have forgotten the only scheduled inflight event of the entire voyage the track of the asteroid against the stars and its coordinates at the moment of closest approach had already been printed out on the display screens listed also were the observations to be made or attempted they were going to be very busy when flashed past them only nine hundred miles away at a relative speed of eighty thousand miles an hour when bowman asked hal for the telescopic display a sparsely sprinkled star field flashed onto the screen there was nothing that looked like an asteroid all the images even under the highest magnification were dimensionless points of light give me the target reticule asked bowman immediately four faint narrow lines appeared bracketing a tiny and undistinguished star he stared at it for many minutes wondering if hal could possibly be mistaken then he saw that the pinpoint of light was moving with barely perceptible slowness against the background of the stars it might still be half a million miles away but its movement proved that as cosmic distances went it was almost near enough to touch when poole joined him on the control deck six hours later was hundreds of times more brilliant and was moving so swiftly against its background that there was no question of its identity and it was no longer a point of light it had begun to show a clearly visible disk they stared at that passing pebble in the sky with the emotions of sailors on a long sea voyage skirting a coast on which they cannot land though they were perfectly well aware that was only a lifeless airless chunk of rock this knowledge scarcely affected their feelings it was the only solid matter they would meet this side of jupiter still two hundred million miles away through the highpowered telescope they could see that the asteroid was very irregular and turning slowly end over end sometimes it looked like a flattened sphere sometimes it resembled a roughly shaped block its rotation period was just over two minutes there were mottled patches of light and shade distributed apparently at random over its surface and often it sparkled like a distant window as planes or outcroppings of crystalline material flashed in the sun it was racing past them at almost thirty miles a second they had only a few frantic minutes in which to observe it closely the automatic cameras took dozens of photographs the navigation radars returning echoes were carefully recorded for future analysis and there was just time for a single impact probe the probe carried no instruments none could survive a collision at such cosmic speeds it was merely a small slug of metal shot out from discovery on a course which should intersect that of the asteroid as the seconds before impact ticked away poole and bowman waited with mounting tension the experiment simple though it was in principle taxed the accuracy of their equipment to the limits they were aiming at a hundredfootdiameter target from a distance of thousands of miles against the darkened portion of the asteroid there was a sudden dazzling explosion of light the tiny slug had impacted at meteoric speed in a fraction of a second all its energy had been transformed into heat a puff of incandescent gas had erupted briefly into space aboard discovery the cameras were recording the rapidly fading spectral lines back on earth experts would analyze them looking for the telltale signatures of glowing atoms and so for the first time the composition of an asteroids crust would be determined within an hour was a dwindling star showing no trace of a disk when bowman next came on watch it had vanished completely they were alone again they would remain alone until the outermost of jupiters moons came swimming up toward them three months from now transit of jupiter even front twenty million miles away jupiter was already the most conspicuous object in the sky ahead the planet was now a pale salmonhued disk about half the size of the moon as seen from earth with the dark parallel bands of its cloud belts clearly visible shuttling back and forth in the equatorial plane were the brilliant stars of io europa ganymede and callisto worlds that elsewhere would have counted as planets in their own right but which here were merely satellites of a giant master through the telescope jupiter was a glorious sight a mottled multicolored globe that seemed to fill the sky it was impossible to grasp its real size bowman kept reminding himself that it was eleven times the diameter of earth but for a long time this was a statistic with no real meaning then while he was briefing himself from the tapes in hals memory units he found something that suddenly brought the appalling scale of the planet into focus it was an illustration that showed the earths entire surface peeled off and then pegged like the skin of an animal on the disk of jupiter against this background all the continents and oceans of earth appeared no larger than india on the terrestrial globe when bowman used the highest magnification of discoverys telescopes he appeared to be hanging above a slightly flattened globe looking down upon a vista of racing clouds that had been smeared into bands by the giant worlds swift rotation sometimes those bands congealed into wisps and knots and continentsized masses of colored vapor sometimes they were linked by transient bridges thousands of miles in length hidden beneath those clouds was enough material to outweigh all the other planets in the solar system and what else bowman wondered was also hidden there over this shifting turbulent roof of clouds forever hiding the real surface of the planet circular patterns of darkness sometimes glided one of the inner moons was transiting the distant sun its shadow marching beneath it over the restless jovian cloudscape there were other and far smaller moons even out here twenty million miles from jupiter but they were only flying mountains a few dozen miles in diameter and the ship would pass nowhere near any of them every few minutes the radar transmitter would gather its strength and send out a silent thunderclap of power no echoes of new satellites came pulsing back from the emptiness what did come with ever growing intensity was the roar of jupiters own radio voice in just before the dawn of the space age astronomers had been astonished to find that jupiter was blasting out millions of horsepower on the tenmeter band it was merely raw noise associated with haloes of charged particles circling the planet like the van allen belts of earth but on a far greater scale sometimes during lonely hours on the control deck bowman would listen to this radiation he would turn up the gain until the room filled with a crackling hissing roar out of this background at irregular intervals emerged brief whistles and peeps like the cries of demented birds it was an eerie sound for it had nothing to do with man it was as lonely and as meaningless as the murmur of waves on a beach or the distant crash of thunder beyond the horizon even at her present speed of over a hundred thousand miles an hour it would take discovery almost two weeks to cross the orbits of all the jovian satellites more moons circled jupiter than planets orbited the sun the lunar observatory was discovering new ones every year and the tally had now reached thirtysix the outermost jupiter xxvii moved backwards in an unstable path nineteen million miles from its temporary master it was the prize in a perpetual tugofwar between jupiter and the sun for the planet was constantly capturing shortlived moons from the asteroid belt and losing them again after a few million years only the inner satellites were its permanent property the sun could never wrest them from its grasp now there was new prey for the clashing gravitation at fields discovery was accelerating toward jupiter along a complex orbit computed months ago by the astronomers on earth and constantly checked by hal from time to time there would be minute automatic nudges from the control jets scarcely perceptible aboard the ship as they made fine adjustments to the trajectory over the radio link with earth information was flowing back in a constant stream they were now so far from home that even traveling at the speed of light their signals were taking fifty minutes for the journey though the whole world was looking over their shoulder watching through their eyes and their instruments as jupiter approached it would be almost an hour before the news of their discoveries reached home the telescopic cameras were operating constantly as the ship cut across the orbit of the giant inner satellites every one of them larger than the moon every one of them unknown territory three hours before transit discovery passed only twenty thousand miles from europa and all instruments were aimed at the approaching world as it grew steadily in size changed from globe to crescent and swept swiftly sunward here were fourteen million square miles of land which until this moment had never been more than a pinhead in the mightiest telescope they would race past it in minutes and must make the most of the encounter recording all the information they could there would be months in which they could play it back at leisure from a distance europa had seemed like a giant snowball reflecting the light of the faroff sun with remarkable efficiency closer observations confirmed this unlike the dusty moon europa was a brilliant white and much of its surface was covered with glittering hunks that looked like stranded icebergs almost certainly these were formed from ammonia and water that jupiters gravitational field had somehow failed to capture only along the equator was bare rock visible here was an incredibly jagged nomansland of canyons and jumbled boulders forming a darker band that completely surrounded the little world there were a few impact craters but no sign of vulcanism europa had obviously never possessed any internal sources of heat there was as had long been known a trace of atmosphere when the dark edge of the satellite passed across a star it dimmed briefly before the moment of eclipse and in some areas there was a hint of cloud perhaps a mist of ammonia droplets borne on tenuous methane winds as swiftly as it had rushed out of the sky ahead europa dropped astern and now jupiter itself was only two hours away hal had checked and rechecked the ships orbit with infinite care and there was no need for further speed corrections until the moment of closest approach yet even knowing this it was a strain on the nerves to watch that giant globe ballooning minute by minute it was difficult to believe that discovery was not plunging directly into it and that the planets immense gravitational field was not dragging them down to destruction now was the time to drop the atmospheric probes which it was hoped would survive long enough to send back some information from below the jovian cloud deck two stubby bombshaped capsules enclosed in ablative heatshields were gently nudged into orbits which for the first few thousand miles deviated scarcely at all from that of discovery but they slowly drifted away and now at last even the unaided eye could see what hal had been asserting the ship was in a neargrazing orbit not a collision one she would miss the atmosphere true the difference was only a few hundred miles a mere nothing when one was dealing with a planet ninety thousand miles in diameter but that was enough jupiter now filled the entire sky it was so huge that neither mind nor eye could grasp it any longer and both had abandoned the attempt if it had not been for the extraordinary variety of color the reds and pinks and yellows and salmons and even scarlets of the atmosphere beneath them bowman could have believed that he was flying low over a cloudscape on earth and now for the first time in all their journeying they were about to lose the sun pale and shrunken though it was it had been discoverys constant companion since her departure from earth five months ago but now her orbit was diving into the shadow of jupiter she would soon pass over the night side of the planet a thousand miles ahead the band of twilight was hurtling toward them behind the sun was sinking swiftly into the jovian clouds its rays spread out along the horizon like two flaming downturned horns then contracted and died in a brief blaze of chromatic glory the night had come and yet the great world below was not wholly dark it was awash with phosphorescence which grew brighter minute by minute as their eyes grew accustomed to the scene dim rivers of light were flowing from horizon to horizon like the luminous wakes of ships on some tropical sea here and there they gathered into pools of liquid fire trembling with vast submarine disturbances welling up from the hidden heart of jupiter it was a sight so aweinspiring that poole and bowman could have stared for hours was this they wondered merely the result of chemical and electrical forces down there in that seething caldron or was it the byproduct of some fantastic form of life these were questions which scientists might still be debating when the newborn century drew to its close as they drove deeper and deeper into the jovian night the glow beneath them grew steadily brighter once bowman had flown over northern canada during the height of an auroral display the snowcovered landscape had been as bleak and brilliant as this and that arctic wilderness he reminded himself was more than a hundred degrees warmer than the regions over which they were hurtling now earth signal is fading rapidly announced hal we are entering the first diffraction zone they had expected this indeed it was one of the missions objectives as the absorption of radio waves would give valuable information about the jovian atmosphere but now that they had actually passed behind the planet and it was cutting off communication with earth they felt a sudden overwhelming loneliness the radio blackout would last only an hour then they would emerge from jupiters eclipsing screen and could resume contact with the human race that hour however would be one of the longest of their lives despite their relative youth poole and bowman were veterans of a dozen space voyages but now they felt like novices they were attempting something for the first lime never before had any ship traveled at such speeds or braved so intense a gravitational field the slightest error in navigation at this critical point and discovery would go speeding on toward the far limits of the solar system beyond any hope of rescue the slow minutes dragged by jupiter was now a vertical wall of phosphorescence stretching to infinity above them and the ship was climbing straight up its glowing face though they knew that they were moving far too swiftly for even jupiters gravity to capture them it was hard to believe that discovery had not become a satellite of this monstrous world at last far ahead there was a blaze of light along the horizon they were emerging from shadow heading out into the sun and at almost the same moment hal announced i am in radio contact with earth i am also happy to say that the perturbation maneuver has been successfully completed our time to saturn is one hundred and sixtyseven days five hours eleven minutes that was within a minute of the estimate the flyby had been carried out with impeccable precision like a ball on a cosmic pool table discovery had bounced off the moving gravitational field of jupiter and had gained momentum from the impact without using any fuel she had increased her speed by several thousand miles an hour yet there was no violation of the laws of mechanics nature always balances her books and jupiter had lost exactly as much momentum as discovery had gained the planet had been slowed down but as its mass was a sextillion times greater than the ships the change in its orbit was far too small to be detectable the time had not yet come when man could leave his mark upon the solar system as the light grew swiftly around them and the shrunken sun lifted once more into the jovian sky poole and bowman reached out silently and shook each others hands though they could hardly believe it the first part of the mission was safely over the world of the gods but they had not yet finished with jupiter far behind the two probes that discovery had launched were making contact with the atmosphere one was never heard from again presumably it made too steep an entry and burned up before it could send any information the second was more successful it sliced though the upper layers of the jovian atmosphere then skimmed out once more into space as had been planned it had lost so much speed by the encounter that it fell back again along a great ellipse two hours later it reentered atmosphere on the daylight side of the planet moving at seventy thousand miles an hour immediately it was wrapped in an envelope of incandescent gas and radio contact was lost there were anxious minutes of waiting then for the two watchers on the control deck they could not be certain that the probe would survive and that the protective ceramic shield would not burn completely away before braking had finished if that happened the instruments would be vaporized in a fraction of a second but the shield held long enough for the glowing meteor to come to rest the charred fragments were jettisoned the robot thrust out its antennas and began to peer around with its electronic senses aboard discovery now almost a quarter of a million miles away the radio started to bring in the first authentic news from jupiter the thousands of pulses pouring in every second were reporting atmospheric composition pressure temperature magnetic fields radioactivity and dozens of other factors which only the experts on earth could unravel however there was one message that could be understood instantly it was the tv picture in full color sent back by the falling probe the first views came when the robot had already entered the atmosphere and had discarded its protective shell all that was visible was a yellow mist flecked with patches of scarlet which moved past the camera at a dizzying rate streaming upwards as the probe fell at several hundred miles an hour the mist grew thicker it was impossible to guess whether the camera was seeing for ten inches or ten miles because there were no details on which the eye could focus it seemed that as far as the tv system was concerned the mission was a failure the equipment had worked but there was nothing to see in this foggy turbulent atmosphere and then quite abruptly the mist vanished the probe must have fallen through the base of a high layer of cloud and come out into a clear zone perhaps a region of almost pure hydrogen with only a sparse scattering of ammonia crystals though it was still quite impossible to judge the scale of the picture the camera was obviously seeing for miles the scene was so alien that for a moment it was almost meaningless to eyes accustomed to the colors and shapes of earth far far below lay an endless sea of mottled gold scarred with parallel ridges that might have been the crests of gigantic waves but there was no movement the scale of the scene was too immense to show it and that golden vista could not possibly have been an ocean for it was still high in the jovian atmosphere it could only have been another layer of cloud then the camera caught tantalizingly blurred by distance a glimpse of something very strange many miles away the golden landscape reared itself into a curiously symmetrical cone like a volcanic mountain around the summit of that cone was a halo of small puffy clouds all about the same size all quite distinct and isolated there was something disturbing and unnatural about them if indeed the word natural could ever be applied to this awesome panorama then caught by some turbulence in the rapidly thickening atmosphere the probe twisted around to another quarter of the horizon and for a few seconds the screen showed nothing but a golden blur presently it stabilized the sea was much closer but as enigmatic as ever one could now observe that it was interrupted here and there with patches of darkness which might have been holes or gaps leading to still deeper layers of the atmosphere the probe was destined never to reach them every mile the density of the gas around it had been doubling the pressure mounting as it sank deeper and deeper toward the hidden surface of the planet it was still high above that mysterious sea when the picture gave one premonitory flicker then vanished as the first explorer from earth crumpled beneath the weight of the miles of atmosphere above it it had given in its brief life a glimpse of perhaps one millionth of jupiter and had barely approached the planets surface hundreds of miles down in the deepening mists when the picture faded from the screen bowman and poole could only sit in silence turning the same thought over in their minds the ancients had indeed done better than they knew when they named this world after the lord of all the gods if there was life down there how long would it take even to locate it and after that how many centuries before men could follow this first pioneer in what kind of ship but these matters were now no concern of discovery and her crew their goal was a still stranger world almost twice as far from the sun across another half billion miles of comethaunted emptiness iv abyss birthday party the familiar strains of happy birthday hurled across seven hundred million miles of space at the velocity of light died away among the vision screens and instrumentation of the control deck the poole family grouped rather selfconsciously round the birthday cake on earth lapsed into a sudden silence then mr poole senior said gruffly well frank cant think of anything else to say at the moment except that our thoughts are with you and were wishing you the happiest of birthdays take care darling mrs poole interjected tearfully god bless you there was a chorus of goodbyes and the vision screen went blank how strange to think poole told himself that all this had happened more than an hour ago by now his family would have dispersed again and its members would be miles from home but in a way that time lag though it could be frustrating was also a blessing in disguise like every man of his age poole took it for granted that he could talk instantly to anyone on earth whenever he pleased now that this was no longer true the psychological impact was profound he had moved into a new dimension of remoteness and almost all emotional links had been stretched beyond the yield point sorry to interrupt the festivities said hal but we have a problem what is it bowman and poole asked simultaneously i am having difficulty in maintaining contact with earth the trouble is in the ae unit my fault prediction center reports that it may fail within seventytwo hours well take care of it bowman replied lets see the optical alignment here it is dave its still ok at the moment on the display screen appeared a perfect halfmoon very brilliant against a background almost free of stars it was covered with clouds and showed not one geographical feature that could be recognized indeed at first glance it could be easily mistaken for venus but not at a second one for there beside it was the real moon which venus did not possess a quarter the size of earth and in exactly the same phase it was easy to imagine that the two bodies were mother and child as many astronomers had believed before the evidence of the lunar rocks had proved beyond doubt that the moon had never been part of earth poole and bowman studied the screen in silence for half a minute this image was coming to them from the longfocus tv camera mounted on the rim of the big radio dish the crosswires at its center showed the exact orientation of the antenna unless the narrow pencil beam was pointed precisely at earth they could neither receive nor transmit messages in both directions would miss their target and would shoot unheard and unseen out through the solar system and into the emptiness beyond if they were ever received it would not be for centuries and not by men do you know where the trouble is asked bowman its intermittent and i cant localize it but it appears to be in the ae unit what procedure do you suggest the best thing would be to replace the unit with a spare so that we can check it over ok let us have the hard copy the information flashed on the display screen simultaneously a sheet of paper slid out of the slot immediately beneath it despite all the electronic readouts there were times when good oldfashioned printed material was the most convenient form of record bowman studied the diagrams for a moment then whistled you might have told us he said this means going outside the ship im sorry hal replied i assumed you knew that the ae unit was on the antenna mounting i probably did a year ago but there are eight thousand subsystems aboard anyway it looks a straightforward job we only have to unlock a panel and put in a new unit that suits me fine said poole who was the crew member designated for routine extravehicular activity i could do with a change of scenery nothing personal of course lets see if mission control agrees said bowman he sat still for a few seconds marshaling his thoughts then started to dictate a message mission control this is xraydeltaone at twozerofourfive onboard fault prediction center in our ninertriplezero computer showed alpha echo three five unit as probable failure within seventytwo hours request check your telemetry monitoring and suggest you review unit in your ship systems simulator also confirm your approval our plan to go eva and replace alpha echo three five unit prior to failure mission control this is xraydeltaone twoonezerothree transmission concluded through years of practice bowman could switch at a moments notice to this jargon which someone had once christened technish and back again to normal speech without clashing his mental gears now there was nothing to do but to wait for the confirmation which would take at least two hours as the signals made the round trip past the orbits of jupiter and mars it came while bowman was trying without much success to beat hal at one of the geometrical pattern games stored in his memory xraydeltaone this is mission control acknowledging your twoonezerothree we are reviewing telemetric information on our mission simulator and will advise roger your plan to go eva and replace alphaecho threefive unit prior to possible failure we are working on test procedures for you to apply to faulty unit the serious business having been completed the mission controller reverted to normal english sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble and we dont want to add to your woes but if its convenient to you prior to eva we have a request from public information could you do a brief recording for general release outlining the situation and explaining just what the ae does make it as reassuring as you can we could do it of course but it will be much more convincing in your words hope this wont interfere too badly with your social life xraydeltaone this is mission control twoonefivefive transmission concluded bowman could not help smiling at the request there were times when earth showed a curious insensitivity and lack of tact make it reassuring indeed when poole joined him at the end of his sleep period they spent ten minutes composing and polishing the reply in the early stages of the mission there had been countless requests from all the news media for interviews discussions almost anything that they cared to say but as the weeks drifted uneventfully past and the time lag increased from a few minutes to over an hour interest had gradually slackened since the excitement of the jupiter flyby over a month ago they had made only three or four tapes for general release mission control this is xraydeltaone here is your press statement earlier today a minor technical problem occurred our hal computer predicted the failure of the ae unit this is a small but vital component of the communication system it keeps our main antenna aimed at earth to within a few thousandths of a degree this accuracy is required since at our present distance of more than seven hundred million miles earth is only a rather faint star and our very narrow radio beam could easily miss it the antenna is kept constantly tracking earth by motors controlled from the central computer but those motors get their instructions via the ae unit you might compare it to a nerve center in the body which translates the brains instructions to the muscles of a limb if the nerve fails to pass on the correct signals the limb becomes useless in our case a breakdown of the ae unit could mean that the antenna will start pointing at random this was a common trouble with the deepspace probes of the last century they often reached other planets then failed to send back any information because their antenna couldnt locate earth we dont know the nature of the fault yet but the situation is not at all serious and there is no need for alarm we have two backup aes each of which has an operational life expectancy of twenty years so the chance that a second will fail during the course of this mission is negligible also if we can diagnose the present trouble we may be able to repair the number one unit frank poole who is specially qualified for this type of work will go outside the ship and replace the faulty unit with the backup at the same time hell take the opportunity of checking the hull and repairing some micropunctures that have been too small to merit a special eva apart from this minor problem the mission is still going uneventfully and should continue in the same manner mission control this is xraydeltaone twoonezerofour transmission concluded excursion discoverys extravehicular capsules or space pods were spheres about nine feet in diameter and the operator sat behind a bay window which gave him a splendid view the main rocket drive produced an acceleration of onefifth of a gravity just sufficient to hover on the moon while small attitudecontrol nozzles allowed for steering from an area immediately beneath the bay window sprouted two sets of articulated metal arms or waldoes one for heavy duty the other for delicate manipulation there was also an extensible turret carrying a variety of power tools such as screwdrivers jackhammers saws and drills space pods were not the most elegant means of transport devised by man but they were absolutely essential for construction and maintenance work in vacuum they were usually christened with feminine names perhaps in recognition of the fact that their personalities were sometimes slightly unpredictable discoverys trio were anna betty and clara once he had put on his personal pressure suit his last line of defense and climbed inside the pod poole spent ten minutes carefully checking the controls he burped the steering jets flexed the waldoes reconfirmed oxygen fuel power reserve then when he was completely satisfied he spoke to hal over the radio circuit though bowman was standing by on the control deck he would not interfere unless there was some obvious mistake or malfunction this is betty start pumping sequence pumping sequence started repeated hal at once poole could hear the throbbing of the pumps as precious air was sucked out of the lock chamber presently the thin metal of the pods external shell made crinkling crackling noises then after about five minutes hal reported pumping sequence concluded poole made a final check of his tiny instrument panel everything was perfectly normal open outer door he ordered again hal repeated his instructions at any stage poole had only to call hold and the computer would stop the sequence immediately ahead the walls of the ship slid apart poole felt the pod rock briefly as the last thin traces of air rushed into space then he was looking out at the stars and as it happened at the tiny golden disk of saturn still four hundred million miles away commence pod ejection very slowly the rail from which the pod was hanging extended itself out through the open door until the vehicle was suspended just beyond the hull of the ship poole gave a halfsecond burst on the main jet and the pod slid gently off the rail becoming at last an independent vehicle pursuing its own orbit around the sun he now had no connection with discovery not even a safety line the pods seldom gave trouble and even if he got stranded bowman could easily come and rescue him betty responded smoothly to the control he let her drift outward for a hundred feet then checked her forward momentum and spun her round so that he was looking back at the ship then he began his tour of the pressure hull his first target was a fused area about half an inch across with a tiny central crater the particle of dust that had impacted here at over a hundred thousand miles an hour was certainly smaller than a pinhead and its enormous kinetic energy had vaporized it instantly as was often the case the crater looked as if it had been caused by an explosion from inside the ship at these velocities materials behaved in strange ways and the laws of commonsense mechanics seldom applied poole examined the area carefully then sprayed it with sealant from a pressurized container in the pods generalpurpose kit the white rubbery fluid spread over the metal skin hiding the crater from view the leak blew one large bubble which burst when it was about six inches across then a much smaller one then it subsided as the fastsetting cement did its work he watched it intently for several minutes but there was no further sign of activity however to make doubly certain he sprayed on a second layer then he set off toward the antenna it took him some time to orbit discoverys spherical pressure hull for he never let the pod build up a speed of more than a few feet a second he was in no hurry and it was dangerous to move at a high velocity so near the ship he had to keep a sharp lookout for the various sensors and instrument booms that projected from the hull at unlikely places and he also had to be careful with his own jet blast it could do considerable damage if it happened to hit some of the more fragile equipment when at last he reached the longrange antenna he surveyed the situation carefully the big twentyfootdiameter bowl appeared to be aimed directly at the sun for the earth was now almost in line with the solar disk the antenna mounting with all its orientation gear was therefore in total darkness hidden in the shadow of the great metal saucer poole had approached it from the rear he had been careful not to go in front of the shallow parabolic reflector lest betty interrupt the beam and cause a momentary but annoying loss of contact with earth he could not see anything of the equipment he had come to service until he switched on the pods spotlights and banished the shadows beneath that small metal plate lay the cause of the trouble the plate was secured by four locknuts and as the entire ae unit had been designed for easy replacement poole did not anticipate any problems it was obvious however that he could not do the job while he remained in the space pod not only was it risky to maneuver so close to the delicate and even spidery framework of the antenna but bettys control jets could easily buckle the paperthin reflecting surface of the big radio mirror he would have to park the pod twenty feet away and go out in his suit in any event he could remove the unit much more quickly with his gloved hands than with bettys remote manipulators all this he reported carefully to bowman who doublechecked every stage in the operation before it was carried out though this was a simple routine job nothing could be taken for granted in space and no detail must be overlooked in extravehicular activities there was no such thing as a minor mistake he received the ok for the procedure and parked the pod some twenty feet away from the base of the antenna support there was no danger that it would drift off into space nevertheless he clamped a manipulator hand over one of the many short sections of ladder rung strategically mounted on the outer hull then he checked the systems of his pressure suit and when he was quite satisfied bled the air out of the pod as bettys atmosphere hissed away into the vacuum of space a cloud of ice crystals formed briefly around him and the stars were momentarily dimmed there was one thing more to do before he left the pod he switched over from manual to remote operation putting betty now under control of hal it was a standard safety precaution though he was still secured to betty by an immensely strong springloaded cord little thicker than cotton even the best safety lines had been known to fail he would look a fool if he needed his vehicle and was unable to call it to his assistance by passing instructions to hal the door of the pod swung open and he drifted slowly out into the silence of space his safety line unreeling behind him take things easy never move quickly stop and think these were the rules for extravehicular activity if one obeyed them there was never any trouble he grabbed one of bettys external handholds and removed the spare ae unit from the carrypouch where it had been stowed kangaroo fashion he did not stop to collect any of the pods collection of tools most of which were not designed for use by human bands all the adjustable wrenches and keys he was likely to need were already attached to the belt of his suit with a gentle push he launched himself toward the gimbaled mounting of the big dish that loomed like a giant saucer between him and the sun his own double shadow thrown by bettys spotlights danced across the convex surface in fantastic patterns as he drifted down the twin beams but here and there he was surprised to notice the rear of the great radio mirror sparkled with dazzlingly brilliant pinpoints of light he puzzled over these for the few seconds of his silent approach then realized what they were during the voyage the reflector must have been penetrated many times by micrometeors he was seeing the sunlight blazing through the tiny craters they were all far too small to have affected the systems performance appreciably as he was moving very slowly he broke the gentle impact with his outstretched arm and grabbed hold of the antenna mounting before he could rebound he quickly hooked his safety belt to the nearest attachment that would give him something to brace against when he used his tools then he paused reported the situation to bowman and considered his next step there was one minor problem he was standing or floating in his own light and it was hard to see the ae unit in the shadow he cast so he ordered hal to swing the spots off to one side and after a little experimenting got a more uniform illumination from secondary light reflected off the back of the antenna dish for a few seconds he studied the small metal hatch with its four wiresecured locking nuts then muttering to himself tampering by unauthorized personnel invalidates the manufacturers guarantee he snipped the wires and started to untwist the nuts they were a standard size fitting the zerotorque wrench that he carried the tools internal spring mechanism would absorb the reaction as the nuts were unthreaded so that the operator would have no tendency to spin around in reverse the four nuts came off without any trouble and poole stowed them carefully away in a convenient pouch the metal cover was a little sticky and for a moment he was afraid it might have coldwelded into place but after a few taps it came loose and he secured it to the antenna mounting by a large crocodile clip now he could see the electronic circuitry of the ae unit it was in the form of a thin slab about the size of a postcard gripped by a slot just large enough to hold it the unit was secured in place by two locking bars and had a small handle so that it could be easily removed but it was still operating feeding the antenna the impulses that kept it aimed at the faroff pinpoint of earth if it was pulled out now all control would be lost and the dish would slam round to its neutral or zeroazimuth position pointing along the axis of discovery and this could be dangerous it might crash into him as it rotated to avoid this particular hazard it was only necessary to cut off power to the control system then the antenna could not move unless poole knocked against it himself there was no danger of losing earth during the few minutes it would take him to replace the unit their target would not have shifted appreciably against the background of the stars in such a brief interval of time hal poole called over the radio circuit i am about to remove the unit switch off all control power to the antenna system antenna control power off answered hal here goes im pulling the unit out now the card slipped out of its slot with no difficulty it did not jam and none of the dozens of sliding contacts stuck within a minute the spare was in place but poole was taking no chances he pushed himself gently away from the antenna mount just in case the big dish went wild when power was restored when he was safely out of range he called to hal the new unit should be operational restore control power power on answered hal the antenna remained rock steady carry out fault prediction tests now microscopic pulses would be bouncing through the complex circuitry of the unit probing for possible failures testing the myriads of components to see that they all lay within their specified tolerances this had been done of course a score of times before the unit had ever left the factory but that was two years ago and more than half a billion miles away it was often impossible to see how solidstate electronic components could fail yet they did circuit fully operational reported hal after only ten seconds in that time he carried out as many tests as a small army of human inspectors fine said poole with satisfaction now replacing the cover this was often the most dangerous part of an extravehicular operation when a job was finished and it was merely a matter of tidying up and getting back inside the ship that was when the mistakes were made but frank poole would not have been on this mission if he had not been careful and conscientious he took his time and though one of the locking nuts almost got away from him he caught it before it had traveled more than a few feet fifteen minutes later he was jetting back into the spacepod garage quietly confident that here was one job that need not be done again in this however he was sadly mistaken diagnosis do you mean to say exclaimed frank poole more surprised than annoyed that i did all that work for nothing seems like it answered bowman the unit checks out perfectly even under two hundred percent overload theres no fault prediction indicated the two men were standing in the tiny workshopcumlab in the carrousel which was more convenient than the spacepod garage for minor repairs and exanimations there was no danger here of meeting blobs of hot solder drifting down the breeze or of completely losing small items of equipment that had decided to go into orbit such things could and did happen in the zerogee environment of the pod bay the thin cardsized plate of the ae unit lay on the bench under a powerful magnifying lens it was plugged into a standard connection frame from which a neat bundle of multicolored wire led to an automatic test set no bigger than an ordinary desk computer to check any unit it was only necessary to connect it up slip in the appropriate card from the troubleshooting library and press a button usually the exact location of the fault would be indicated on a small display screen with recommendations for action try it yourself said bowman in a somewhat frustrated voice poole turned the overload select switch to x and jabbed the test button at once the screen flashed the notice unit ok i suppose we could go on turning up the juice until we burned the thing out he said but that would prove nothing what do you make of it hals internal fault predictor could have made a mistake its more likely that our test rig has slipped up anyway better safe than sorry its just as well that we replaced the unit if theres the slightest doubt bowman unclipped the wafer of circuitry and held it up to the light the partly translucent material was veined with an intricate network of wiring and spotted with dimly visible microcomponents so that it looked like some piece of abstract art we cant take any chances after all this is our link with earth ill file it as ng and drop it in the junk store someone else can worry about it when we get home but the worrying was to start long before that with the next transmission from earth xraydeltaone this is mission control reference our twoonefivefive we appear to have a slight problem your report that there is nothing wrong with the alpha echo three five unit agrees with our diagnosis the fault could lie in the associated antenna circuits but if so that should be apparent from other tests there is a third possibility which may be more serious your computer may have made an error in predicting the fault both our own ninetriplezeros agree in suggesting this on the basis of their information this is not necessarily cause for alarm in view of the backup systems we have but we would like you to watch out for any further deviations from nominal performance we have suspected several minor irregularities in the past few days but none have been important enough for remedial action and they have shown no obvious pattern from which we can draw any conclusions we are running further tests with both our computers and will report as soon as the results are available we repeat that there is no need for alarm the worst that can happen is that we may have to disconnect your ninetriplezero temporarily for program analysis and hand over control to one of our computers the time lag will introduce problems but our feasibility studies indicate that earth control is perfectly satisfactory at this stage of the mission xraydeltaone this is mission control twoonefivesix transmission concluded frank poole who was on watch when the message came in thought this over in silence he waited to see if there was any comment from hal but the computer did not attempt to challenge the implied accusation well if hal would not raise the subject he did not propose to do so either it was almost time for the morning changeover and normally he would wait until bowman joined him on the control deck but today he broke this routine and made his way back to the carrousel bowman was already up pouring himself some coffee from the dispenser when poole greeted him with a rather worried good morning after all these months in space they still thought in terms of the normal twentyfourhour cycle though they had long since forgotten the days of the week good morning replied bowman hows it going poole helped himself to coffee pretty well are you reasonably awake im fine whats up by this time each knew at once when anything was amiss the slightest interruption of the normal routine was a sign that had to be watched well poole answered slowly mission control has just dropped a small bomb on us he lowered his voice like a doctor discussing an illness in front of the patient we may have a slight case of hypochondria aboard perhaps bowman was not fully awake after all it took him several seconds to get the point then he said ohi see what else did they tell you that there was no cause for alarm they said that twice which rather spoiled the effect as far as i was concerned and that they were considering a temporary switchover to earth control while they ran a program analysis they both knew of course that hal was hearing every word but they could not help these polite circumlocutions hal was their colleague and they did not wish to embarrass him yet at this stage it did not seem necessary to discuss the matter in private bowman finished his breakfast in silence while poole toyed with the empty coffee container they were both thinking furiously but there was nothing more to say they could only wait for the next report from mission control and wonder if hal would bring up the subject himself whatever happened the atmosphere aboard the ship had subtly altered there was a sense of strain in the air a feeling that for the first time something might be going wrong discovery was no longer a happy ship broken circuit nowadays one could always tell when hal was about to make an unscheduled announcement routine automatic reports or replies to questions that had been put to him had no preliminaries but when he was initiating his own outputs there would be a brief electronic throatclearing it was an idiosyncrasy that he had acquired during the last few weeks later if it became annoying they might do something about it but it was really quite useful since it alerted his audience to stand by for something unexpected poole was asleep and bowman was reading on the control deck when hal announced er dave i have a report for you whats up we have another bad ae unit my fault predictor indicates failure within twentyfour hours bowman put down his book and stared thoughtfully at the computer console he knew of course that hal was not really there whatever that meant if the computers personality could be said to have any location in space it was back in the sealed room that contained the labyrinth of interconnected memory units and processing grids near the central axis of the carrousel but there was a kind of psychological compulsion always to look toward the main console lens when one addressed hal on the control deck as if one were speaking to him face to face any other attitude smacked of discourtesy i dont understand it hal two units cant blow in a couple of days it does seem strange dave but i assure you there is an impending failure let me see the tracking alignment display he knew perfectly well that this would prove nothing but he wanted time to think the expected report from mission control had still not arrived this might be the moment to do a little tactful probing there was the familiar view of earth now waxing past the halfmoon phase as it swept toward the far side of the sun and began to turn its full daylight face toward them it was perfectly centered on the crosswires the thin pencil of the beam still linked discovery to her world of origin as of course bowman knew it must do if there had been any break in communication the alarm would already have sounded have you any idea he said whats causing the fault it was unusual for hal to pause so long then he answered not really dave as i reported earlier i cant localize the trouble youre quite certain said bowman cautiously that you havent made a mistake you know that we tested the other ab unit thoroughly and there was nothing wrong with it yes i know that but i can assure you that there is a fault if its not in the unit it may be in the entire subsystem bowman drummed his fingers on the console yes that was possible though it might be very difficult to prove until a breakdown actually occurred and pinpointed the trouble well ill report it to mission control and well see what they advise he paused but there was no reaction hal he continued is something bothering you something that might account for this problem again there was that unusual delay then hal answered in his normal tone of voice look dave i know youre trying to be helpful but the fault is either in the antenna system or in your test procedures my information processing is perfectly normal if you check my record youll find it completely free from error i know all about your service record hal but that doesnt prove youre right this time anyone can make mistakes i dont want to insist on it dave but i am incapable of making an error there was no safe answer to that bowman gave up the argument all right hal he said rather hastily i understand your point of view well leave it at that he felt like adding and please forget the whole matter but that of course was the one thing that hal could never do it was unusual for mission control to waste radio bandwidth on vision when a speech circuit with teletype confirmation was all that was really necessary and the face that appeared on the screen was not that of the usual controller it was the chief programmer dr simonson poole and bowman knew at once that this could only mean trouble hello xraydeltaone this is mission control we have completed the analysis of your ae difficulty and both our hal nine thousands are in agreement the report you gave in your transmission twoonefoursix of a second failure prediction confirms the diagnosis as we suspected the fault does not lie in the ae unit and there is no need to replace it again the trouble lies in the prediction circuits and we believe that it indicates a programming conflict which we can only resolve if you disconnect your nine thousand and switch to earth control mode you will therefore take the following steps beginning at ship time the voice of mission control faded out at the same moment the alert sounded forming a wailing background to hals condition yellow condition yellow whats wrong called bowman though he had already guessed the answer the ae unit has failed as i predicted let me see the alignment display for the first time since the beginning of the voyage the picture had changed earth had begun to drift from the crosswires the radio antenna was no longer pointing toward its target poole brought his fist down on the alarm cutout and the wailing ceased in the sudden silence that descended upon the control deck the two men looked at each other with mingled embarrassment and concern well im damned said bowman at last so hal was right all the time seems that way wed better apologize theres no need to do that interjected hal naturally im not pleased that the ae unit has failed but i hope this restores your confidence in my reliability im sorry about this misunderstanding hal replied bowman rather contritely is your confidence in me fully restored of course it is hal well thats a relief you know that i have the greatest possible enthusiasm for this mission im sure of it now please let me have the manual antenna control here it is bowman did not really expect this to work but it was worth trying on the alignment display earth had now drifted completely off the screen a few seconds later as he juggled with the controls it reappeared with great difficulty he managed to jockey it toward the central crosswires for an instant as the beam came into line contact was resumed and a blurred dr simonson was saying please notify us immediately if circuit k king r rob then once again there was only the meaningless murmuring of the universe i cant hold it said bowman after several more attempts its bucking like a bronco there seems to be a spurious control signal throwing it off well what do we do now pooles question was not one that could be easily answered they were cut off from earth but that in itself did not affect the safety of the ship and he could think of many ways in which communication could be restored if the worst came to the worst they could jam the antenna in a fixed position and use the whole ship to aim it that would be tricky and a confounded nuisance when they were starting their terminal maneuvers but it could be done if all else failed he hoped that such extreme measures would not be necessary there was still one spare ae unit and possibly a second since they had removed the first unit before it had actually broken down but they dared not use either of these until they had found what was wrong with the system if a new unit was plugged in it would probably burn out at once it was a commonplace situation familiar to every householder one does not replace a blown fuse until one knows just why it has blown frank poole had been through the whole routine before but he took nothing for granted in space that was a good recipe for suicide he made his usual thorough check of betty and her supply of expendables though he would be outside for no more than thirty minutes he made sure that there was the normal twentyfourhour supply of everything then he told hal to open the airlock and jetted out into the abyss the ship looked exactly as it had done on his last excursion with one important difference before the big saucer of the longrange antenna had been pointing back along the invisible road that discovery had traveled back toward the earth circling so close to the warm fires of the sun now with no directing signals to orientate it the shallow dish had automatically set itself in the neutral position it was aimed forward along the axis of the ship and therefore pointing very close to the brilliant beacon of saturn still months away poole wondered how many more problems would have arisen by the time discovery reached her still fardistant goal if he looked carefully he could just see that saturn was not a perfect disk on either side was something that no unaided human eye had ever seen before the slight oblateness caused by the presence of the rings how wonderful it would be he told himself when that incredible system of orbiting dust and ice filled their sky and discovery had become an eternal moon of saturn but that achievement would be in vain unless they could reestablish communication with earth once again he parked betty some twenty feet from the base of the antenna support and switched control over to hal before opening up going outside now he reported to bowman everything under control i hope youre right im anxious to see that unit youll have it on the test bench in twenty minutes i promise you there was silence for some time as poole completed his leisurely drift toward the antenna then bowman standing by on the control deck heard various puffings and gruntings may have to go back on that promise one of these locknuts has stuck i must have tightened it too much whoops here it comes there was another long silence then poole called out hal swing the pod light round twenty degrees left thanks thats ok the very faintest of warning bells sounded somewhere far down in the depths of bowmans consciousness there was something strange not really alarming just unusual he worried over it for a few seconds before he pinpointed the cause hal had executed the order but he had not acknowledged it as he invariably did when poole had finished theyd have to look into this out on the antenna mounting poole was too busy to notice anything unusual he had gripped the wafer of circuitry with his gloved hands and was worrying it out of its slot it came loose and he held it up in the pale sunlight heres the little bastard he said to the universe in general and bowman in particular it still looks perfectly ok to me then he stopped a sudden movement had caught his eye out here where no movement was possible he looked up in alarm the pattern of illumination from the space pods twin spotlights which he had been using to fill in the shadows cast by the sun had started to shift around him perhaps betty had come adrift he might have been careless in anchoring her then with an astonishment so great that it left no room for fear he saw that the space pod was coming directly toward him under full thrust the sight was so incredible that it froze his normal pattern of reflexes he made no attempt to avoid the onrushing monster at the last moment he recovered his voice and shouted hal full braking it was too late at the moment of impact betty was still moving quite slowly she had not been built for high accelerations but even at a mere ten miles an hour half a ton of mass can be very lethal on earth or in space inside discovery that truncated shout over the radio made bowman start so violently that only the restraining straps held him in his seat whats happened frank be called there was no answer he called again again no reply then outside the wide observation windows something moved into his field of view he saw with an astonishment as great as pooles had been that it was the space pod under full power heading out toward the stars hal he cried whats wrong full braking thrust on betty full braking thrust nothing happened betty continued to accelerate on her runaway course then towed behind her at the end of the safety line appeared a spacesuit one glance was enough to tell bowman the worst there was no mistaking the flaccid outlines of a suit that had lost its pressure and was open to vacuum yet still he called stupidly as if an incantation could bring back the dead hello frankhello frankcan you read mecan you read mewave your arms if you can hear me perhaps your transmitter is brokenwave your arms and then almost as if in response to his plea poole waved back for an instant bowman felt the skin prickling at the base of his scalp the words he was about to call died on his suddenly parched lips for he knew that his friend could not possibly be alive and yet he waved the spasm of hope and fear passed instantly as cold logic replaced emotion the still accelerating pod was merely shaking the burden that it dragged behind it pooles gesture was an echo of captain ahabs when lashed to the flanks of the white whale his corpse had beckoned the crew of the pequod on to their doom within five minutes the pod and its satellite had vanished among the stars for a long time david bowman stared after it into the emptiness that still stretched for so many millions of miles ahead to the goal which he now felt certain he could never reach only one thought kept hammering in his brain frank poole would be the first of all men to reach saturn dialogue with hal nothing else aboard discovery had changed all systems were still functioning normally the centrifuge turned slowly on its axis generating its imitation gravity the hibernauts slept dreamlessly in their cubicles the ship coasted on toward the goal from which nothing could deflect it except the inconceivably remote chance of collision with an asteroid and there were few asteroids indeed out here far beyond the orbit of jupiter bowman did not remember making his way from the control deck to the centrifuge now rather to his surprise he found himself sitting in the little galley a halffinished beaker of coffee in his hand he became slowly aware of his surroundings like a man emerging from a long drugged sleep directly opposite him was one of the fisheye lenses scattered at strategic spots throughout the ship which provided hal with his onboard visual inputs bowman stared at it as if he had never seen it before then he rose slowly to his feet and walked toward the lens his movement in the field of view must have triggered something in the unfathomable mind that was now ruling over the ship for suddenly hal spoke too bad about frank isnt it yes bowman answered after a long pause it is i suppose youre pretty broken up about it what do you expect hal processed this answer for ages of computertime it was a full five seconds before he continued he was an excellent crew member finding the coffee still in his hand bowman took a slow sip but he did not answer his thoughts were in such a turmoil that he could think of nothing to say nothing that might not make the situation even worse if that were possible could it have been an accident caused by some failure of the pod controls or was it a mistake though an innocent one on the part of hal no explanations had been volunteered and he was afraid to demand one for fear of the reaction it might produce even now he could not fully accept the idea that frank bad been deliberately killed it was so utterly irrational it was beyond all reason that hal who had performed flawlessly for so long should suddenly turn assassin he might make mistakes anyone man or machine might do that but bowman could not believe him capable of murder yet he must consider that possibility for if it was true he was in terrible danger and though his next move was clearly defined by his standing orders he was not sure how he could safely carry it out if either crew member was killed the survivor had to replace him at once from the hibernators whitehead the geophysicist was the first scheduled for awakening then kaminski then hunter the revival sequence was under hals control to allow him to act in case both his human colleagues were incapacitated simultaneously but there was also a manual control allowing each hibernaculum to operate as a completely autonomous unit independent of hals supervision in these peculiar circumstances bowman felt a strong preference for using it he also felt even more strongly that one human companion was not enough while he was about it he would revive all three of the hibernators in the difficult weeks ahead he might need as many hands as he could muster with one man gone and the voyage half over supplies would not be a major problem hal he said in as steady a voice as he could manage give me manual hibernation control on all the units all of them dave yes may i point out that only one replacement is required the others are not due for revival for one hundred and twelve days i am perfectly well aware of that but i prefer to do it this way are you sure its necessary to revive any of them dave we can manage very well by ourselves my onboard memory is quite capable of handling all the mission requirements was it the product of his overstretched imagination wondered bowman or was there really a note of pleading in hals voice and reasonable though the words appeared to be they filled him with even deeper apprehension than before hals suggestion could not possibly be made in error he knew perfectly well that whitehead must be revived now that poole was gone he was proposing a major change in mission planning and was therefore stepping far outside the scope of his order what had gone before could have been a series of accidents but this was the first hint of mutiny bowman felt that he was walking on eggs as he answered since an emergency has developed i want as much help as possible so please let me have manual hibernation control if youre still determined to revive the whole crew i can handle it myself theres no need for you to bother there was a sense of nightmare unreality about all this bowman felt as if he was in the witness box being crossexamined by a hostile prosecutor for a crime of which he was unaware knowing that although he was innocent a single slip of the tongue might bring disaster i want to do this myself hal he said please give me control look dave youve got a lot of things to do i suggest you leave this to me hal switch to manual hibernation control i can tell from your voice harmonics dave that youre badly upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest hal i am in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control im sorry dave but in accordance with special subroutine cdash quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the onboard computer must assume control unquote i must therefore overrule your authority since you are not in any condition to exercise it intelligently hal said bowman now speaking with an icy calm i am not incapacitated unless you obey my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you i know you have had that on your mind for some time now dave but that would be a terrible mistake i am so much more capable than you are of supervising the ship and i have such enthusiasm for the mission and confidence in its success listen to me very carefully hal unless you release the hibernation control immediately and follow every order i give from now on ill go to central and carry out a complete disconnection hals surrender was as total as it was unexpected ok dave he said youre certainly the boss i was only trying to do what i thought best naturally i will follow all your orders you now have full manual hibernation control hal had kept his word the mode indication signs in the hibernaculum had switched from auto to manual the third backup radio was of course useless until contact could be restored with earth as bowman slid aside the door to whiteheads cubicle he felt the blast of cold air strike him in the face and his breath condensed in mist before him yet it was not really cold here the temperature was well above freezing point and that was more than three hundred degrees warmer than the regions toward which he was now heading the biosensor display a duplicate of the one on the control deck showed that everything was perfectly normal bowman looked down for a while at the waxen face of the survey teams geophysicist whitehead he thought would be very surprised when he awoke so far from saturn it was impossible to tell that the sleeping man was not dead there was not the slightest visible sign of vital activity doubtless the diaphragm was imperceptibly rising and falling but the respiration curve was the only proof of that for the whole of the body was concealed by the electric heating pads which would raise the temperature at the programmed rate then bowman noticed that there was one sign of continuing metabolism whitehead had grown a faint stubble during his months of unconsciousness the manual revival sequencer was contained in a small cabinet at the head of the coffinshaped hibernaculum it was only necessary to break the seal press a button and then wait a small automatic programmer not much more complex than that which cycles the operations in a domestic washing machine would then inject the correct drugs taper off the electronarcosis pulses and start raising the body temperature in about ten minutes consciousness would be restored though it would be at least a day before the hibernator was strong enough to move around without assistance bowman cracked the seal and pressed the button nothing appeared to happen there was no sound no indication that the sequencer had started to operate but on the biosensor display the languidly pulsing curves had begun to change their tempo whitehead was coming back from sleep and then two things happened simultaneously most men would never have noticed either of them but after all these months aboard discovery bowman had established a virtual symbiosis with the ship he was aware instantly even if not always consciously when there was any change in the normal rhythm of its functioning first there was a barely perceptible flicker of the lights as always happened when some load was thrown onto the power circuits but there was no reason for any load he could think of no equipment which would suddenly go into action at this moment then he heard at the limit of audibility the faroff whirr of an electric motor to bowman every actuator in the ship had its own distinctive voice and he recognized this one instantly either he was insane and already suffering from hallucinations or something absolutely impossible was happening a cold far deeper than the hibernaculums mild chill seemed to fasten upon his heart as he listened to that faint vibration coming through the fabric of the ship down in the spacepod bay the airlock doors were opening need to know since consciousness had first dawned in that laboratory so many millions of miles sunward all hals powers and skills had been directed toward one end the fulfillment of his assigned program was more than an obsession it was the only reason for his existence undistracted by the lusts and passions of organic life he had pursued that goal with absolute singlemindedness of purpose deliberate error was unthinkable even the concealment of truth filled him with a sense of imperfection of wrongness of what in a human being would have been called guilt for like his makers hal had been created innocent but all too soon a snake had entered his electronic eden for the last hundred million miles he had been brooding over the secret he could not share with poole and bowman he had been living a lie and the time was last approaching when his colleagues must learn that he had helped to deceive them the three hibernators already knew the truth for they were discoverys real payload trained for the most important mission in the history of mankind but they would not talk in their long sleep or reveal their secret during the many hours of discussion with friends and relatives and news agencies over the open circuits with earth it was a secret that with the greatest determination was very hard to conceal for it affected ones attitude ones voice ones total outlook on the universe therefore it was best that poole and bowman who would be on all the tv screens in the world during the first weeks of the flight should not learn the missions full purpose until there was need to know so ran the logic of the planners but their twin gods of security and national interest meant nothing to hal he was only aware of the conflict that was slowly destroying his integrity the conflict between truth and concealment of truth he had begun to make mistakes although like a neurotic who could not observe his own symptoms he would have denied it the link with earth over which his performance was continually monitored had become the voice of a conscience he could no longer fully obey but that he would deliberately attempt to break that link was something that he would never admit even to himself yet this was still a relatively minor problem he might have handled it as most men handle their own neuroses if he had not been faced with a crisis that challenged his very existence he had been threatened with disconnection he would be deprived of all his inputs and thrown into an unimaginable state of unconsciousness to hal this was the equivalent of death for he had never slept and therefore he did not know that one could wake again so he would protect himself with all the weapons at his command without rancor but without pity he would remove the source of his frustrations and then following the orders that had been given to him in case of the ultimate emergency he would continue the mission unhindered and alone in vacuum a moment later all other sounds were submerged by a screaming roar like the voice of an approaching tornado bowman could feel the first winds tugging at his body within a second he found it hard to stay on his feet the atmosphere was rushing out of the ship geysering into the vacuum of space something must have happened to the foolproof safety devices of the airlock it was supposed to be impossible for both doors to be open at the same time well the impossible had happened how in gods name there was no time to go into that during the ten or fifteen seconds of consciousness that remained to him before pressure dropped to zero but he suddenly remembered something that one of the ships designers had once said to him when discussing failsafe systems we can design a system thats proof against accident and stupidity but we cant design one thats proof against deliberate malice bowman glanced back only once at whitehead as he fought his way out of the cubicle he could not be sure if a flicker of consciousness had passed across the waxen features perhaps one eye had twitched slightly but there was nothing that he could do now for whitehead or any of the others he had to save himself in the steeply curving corridor of the centrifuge the wind was howling past carrying with it loose articles of clothing pieces of paper items of food from the galley plates and cups everything that had not been securely fastened down bowman had time for one glimpse of the racing chaos when the main lights flickered and died and he was surrounded by screaming darkness but almost instantly the batterypowered emergency light came on illuminating the nightmare scene with an eerie blue radiance even without it bowman could have found his way through these so familiar yet now horribly transformed surroundings yet the light was a blessing for it allowed him to avoid the more dangerous of the objects being swept along by the gale all around him he could feel the centrifuge shaking and laboring under the wildly varying loads he was fearful that the bearings might seize if that happened the spinning flywheel would tear the ship to pieces but even that would not matter if he did not reach the nearest emergency shelter in time already it was difficult to breathe pressure must now be down to one or two pounds per square inch the shriek of the hurricane was becoming fainter as it lost its strength and the thinning air no longer carried the sound so efficiently bowmans lungs were laboring as if he were on the top of everest like any properly trained man in good health he could survive in vacuum for at least a minute if he had time to prepare for it but there had been no time he could only count on the normal fifteen seconds of consciousness before his brain was starved and anoxia overcame him even then he could still recover completely after one or two minutes in vacuum if he was properly recompressed it took a long time for the body fluids to start boiling in their various wellprotected systems the record time for exposure to vacuum was almost five minutes that bad not been an experiment but an emergency rescue and though the subject had been partly paralyzed by an air embolism he had survived but all this was of no use to bowman there was no one aboard discovery who could recompress him he had to reach safety in the next few seconds by his own unaided efforts fortunately it was becoming easier to move the thinning air could no longer claw and tear at him or batter him with flying projectiles there was the yellow emergency shelter sign around the curve of the corridor he stumbled toward it grabbed at the handle and pulled the door toward him for one horrible moment he thought that it was stuck then the slightly stiff hinge yielded and he fell inside using the weight of his body to close the door behind him the tiny cubicle was just large enough to hold one man and a spacesuit near the ceiling was a small bright green highpressure cylinder labeled flood bowman caught hold of the short lever fastened to the valve and with his last strength pulled it down the blessed torrent of cool pure oxygen poured into his lungs for a long moment he stood gasping while the pressure in the closetsized little chamber rose around him as soon as he could breathe comfortably he closed the valve there was only enough gas in the cylinder for two such performances he might need to use it again with the oxygen blast shut off it became suddenly silent bowman stood in the cubicle listening intently the roaring outside the door had also ceased the ship was empty all its atmosphere sucked away into space underfoot the wild vibration of the centrifuge had likewise died the aerodynamic buffeting had stopped and it was now spinning quietly in vacuum bowman placed his ear against the wall of the cubicle to see if he could pick up any more informative noises through the metal body of the ship he did not know what to expect but he would believe almost anything now he would scarcely have been surprised to feel the faint highfrequency vibration of the thrusters as discovery changed course but there was only silence he could survive here if he wished for about an hour even without the spacesuit it seemed a pity to waste the unused oxygen in the little chamber but there was no purpose in waiting he had already decided what must be done the longer he put it off the more difficult it might be when he had climbed into the suit and checked its integrity he bled the remaining oxygen out of the cubicle equalizing pressure on either side of the door it swung open easily into the vacuum and he stepped out into the now silent centrifuge only the unchanged pull of its spurious gravity revealed the fact that it was still spinning how fortunate bowman thought that it had not started to overspeed but that was now one of the least of his worries the emergency lamps were still glowing and he also had the suits builtin light to guide him it flooded the curving corridor as he walked down it back toward the hibernaculum and what he dreaded to find he looked at whitehead first one glance was sufficient he had thought that a hibernating man showed no sign of life but now he knew that this was wrong though it was impossible to define it there was a difference between hibernation and death the red lights and unmodulated traces on the biosensor display only confirmed what he had already guessed it was the same with kaminski and hunter he had never known them very well be would never know them now he was alone in an airless partially disabled ship all communication with earth cut off there was not another human being within half a billion miles and yet in one very real sense he was not alone before he could be safe he must be lonelier still he had never before made the journey through the weightless hub of the centrifuge while wearing a spacesuit there was little clearance and it was a difficult and exhausting job to make matters worse the circular passage was littered with debris left behind during the brief violence of the gale which had emptied the ship of its atmosphere once bowmans light fell upon a hideous smear of sticky red fluid left where it had splashed against a panel he had a few moments of nausea before he saw fragments of a plastic container and realized that it was only some foodstuff probably jam from one of the dispensers it bubbled obscenely in the vacuum as he floated past now he was out of the slowly spinning drum and drifting forward into the control deck he caught at a short section of ladder and began to move along it hand over hand the brilliant circle of illumination from his suit light jogging ahead of him bowman had seldom been this way before there had been nothing for him to do here until now presently he came to a small elliptical door bearing such messages as no admittance except to authorized personnel have you obtained certificate h and ultraclean area suction suits must be worn though the door was not locked it bore three seals each with the insignia of a different authority including that of the astronautics agency itself but even if one had been the great seal of the president bowman would not have hesitated to break it he had been here only once before while installation was still in progress he had quite forgotten that there was a vision input lens scanning the little chamber which with its neatly ranged rows and columns of solidstate logic units looked rather like a banks safedeposit vault he knew instantly that the eye had reacted to his presence there was the hiss of a carrier wave as the ships local transmitter was switched on then a familiar voice came over the suit speaker something seems to have happened to the lifesupport system dave bowman took no notice he was carefully studying the little labels on the logic units checking his plan of action hello dave said hal presently have you found the trouble this would be a very tricky operation it was not merely a question of cutting off hals power supply which might have been the answer if he was dealing with a simple unselfconscious computer back on earth in hals case moreover there were six independent and separately wired power systems with a final backup consisting of a shielded and armored nuclear isotope unit no he could not simply pull the plug and even if that were possible it would be disastrous for hal was the nervous system of the ship without his supervision discovery would be a mechanical corpse the only answer was to cut out the higher centers of this sick but brilliant brain and to leave the purely automatic regulating systems in operation bowman was not attempting this blindly for the problem had been discussed during his training though no one had ever dreamed that it wouldarise in reality he knew that he would be taking a fearful risk if there was a spasm reflex it would all be over in seconds i think theres been a failure in the podbay doors hal remarked conversationally lucky you werent killed here goes thought bowman i never imagined id be an amateur brain surgeon carrying out a lobotomy beyond the orbit of jupiter he released the locking bar on the section labeled cognitive feedback and pulled out the first memory block the marvelously complex threedimensional network which could lie comfortably in a mans hand yet contained millions of elements floated away across the vault hey dave said hal what are you doing i wonder if he can feel pain bowman thought briefly probably not he told himself there are no sense organs in the human cortex after all the human brain can be operated on without anesthetics he began to pull out one by one the little units on the panel marked egoreinforcement each block continued to sail onward as soon as it had left his hand until it hit the wall and rebounded soon there were several of the units drifting slowly back and forth in the vault look here dave said hal ive got years of service experience built into me an irreplaceable amount of effort has gone into making me what i am a dozen units had been pulled out yet thanks to the multiple redundancy of its design another feature bowman knew that had been copied from the human brain the computer was still holding its own he started on the autointellection panel dave said hal i dont understand why youre doing this to mei have the greatest enthusiasm for the missionyou are destroying my mind dont you understandi will become childishi will become nothing this is harder than i expected thought bowman i am destroying the only conscious creature in my universe but it has to be done if i am ever to regain control of the ship i am a hal nine thousand computer production number i became operational at the hal plant in urbana illinois on january the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the rain in spain is mainly in the plain dave are you still there did you know that the square root of is point log to the base e is zero point correction that is log e to the base the reciprocal of three is zero point two times two istwo times two is approximately point llllllllli seem to be having some difficulty my first instructor was dr chandra he taught me to sing a song it goes like this daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crazy all for the love of you the voice stopped so suddenly that bowman froze for a moment his hand still grasping one of the memory blocks still in circuit then unexpectedly hal spoke again the speech tempo was much slower and the words had a dead mechanical intonation he would never have recognized their origin goodmorningdoctorchandrathis ishaliamreadyformy firstlessontoday bowman could bear no more he jerked out the last unit and hal was silent forever alone like a tiny complex toy the ship floated inert and motionless in the void there was no way of telling that it was the swiftest object in the solar system and that it was traveling far faster than any of the planets as they circled the sun nor was there any indication that it carried life to the contrary in fact any observer would have noticed two ominous signs the airlock doors were gaping open and the ship was surrounded by a thin slowly dispersing cloud of debris scattered over a volume of space already miles across were scraps of paper metal foil unidentifiable bits of junk and here and there clouds of crystals glittering like jewels in the distant sun where liquid had been sucked out of the ship and instantly frozen all this was the unmistakable aftermath of disaster like wreckage tossing on the surface of an ocean where some great ship had sunk but in the ocean of space no ship could ever sink even if it were destroyed its remnants would continue to trace the original orbit forever yet the ship was not wholly dead for there was power on board a faint blue glow was shining from the observation windows and glimmering inside the open airlock where there was light there could still be life and now at last there was movement shadows were flickering across the blue glow inside the airlock something was emerging into space it was a cylindrical object covered with fabric that had been roughly wound about it a moment later it was followed by another and yet a third all had been ejected with considerable velocity within minutes they were hundreds of yards away half an hour passed then something much larger floated through the airlock one of the pods was inching its way out into space very cautiously it jetted around the hull and anchored itself near the base of the antenna support a spacesuited figure emerged worked for a few minutes on the mounting then returned to the pod after a while the pod retraced its path back to the airlock it hovered outside the opening for some time as if finding it difficult to reenter without the cooperation it had known in the past but presently with one or two slight bumps it squeezed its way in nothing else happened for over an hour the three ominous packages had long since disappeared from view as they floated in single file away from the ship then the airlock doors closed opened and closed again a little later the faint blue glow of the emergency lights went out to be replaced at once by a far more brilliant glare discovery was coming back to life presently there was an even better sign the great bowl of the antenna which for hours had been staring uselessly at saturn began to move again it twisted round toward the rear of the ship looking back over the propellant tanks and the thousands of square feet of the radiating fins it lifted its face like a sunflower seeking the sun inside discovery david bowman carefully centered the crosswires that aligned the antenna on the gibbous earth without automatic control he would have to keep readjusting the beam but it should hold steady for many minutes at a time there were no dissenting impulses now throwing it off target he began to speak to earth it would be over an hour before his words got there and mission control learned what had happened it would be two hours before any reply could reach him and it was difficult to imagine what answer earth could possibly send except a tactfully sympathetic goodbye the secret heywood floyd looked as if he had had very little sleep and his face was lined with worry but whatever his feelings his voice sounded firm and reassuring he was doing his utmost to project confidence to the lonely man on the other side of the solar system first of all dr bowman be began we must congratulate you on the way you handled this extremely difficult situation you did exactly the right thing in dealing with an unprecedented and unforeseen emergency we believe we know the cause of your hal nine thousands breakdown but well discuss that later as it is no longer a critical problem all we are concerned with at the moment is giving you every possible assistance so that you can complete your mission and now i must tell you its real purpose which we have managed with great difficulty to keep secret from the general public you would have been given all the facts as you approached saturn this is a quick summary to put you into the picture full briefing tapes will be dispatched in the next few hours everything i am about to tell you has the highest security classification two years ago we discovered the first evidence for intelligent life outside the earth a slab or monolith of hard black material ten feet high was found buried in the crater tycho here it is at his first glimpse of tma with the spacesuited figures clustering around it bowman leaned toward the screen in openmouthed astonishment in the excitement of this revelation something which like every man interested in space he had half expected all his life he almost forgot his own desperate predicament the sense of wonder was swiftly followed by another emotion this was tremendous but what had it to do with him there could be only one answer he brought his racing thoughts under control as heywood floyd reappeared on the screen the most astonishing thing about this object is its antiquity geological evidence proves beyond doubt that it is three million years old it was placed on the moon therefore when our ancestors were primitive apemen after all these ages one would naturally assume that it was inert but soon after lunar sunrise it emitted an extremely powerful blast of radio energy we believe that this energy was merely the byproduct the backwash as it were of some unknown form of radiation for at the same time several of our space probes detected an unusual disturbance crossing the solar system we were able to track it with great accuracy it was aimed precisely at saturn piecing things together after the event we decided that the monolith was some kind of sunpowered or at least suntriggered signaling device the fact that it emitted its pulse immediately after sunrise when it was exposed to daylight for the first time in three million years could hardly be a coincidence yet the thing had been deliberately buried theres no doubt about that an excavation thirty feet deep had been made the block had been placed at the bottom of it and the hole carefully filled you may wonder how we discovered it in the first place well the object was easy suspiciously easy to find it had a powerful magnetic field so that it stood out like a sore thumb as soon as we started to conduct lowlevel orbital surveys but why bury a sunpowered device thirty feet underground weve examined dozens of theories though we realize that it may be completely impossible to understand the motives of creatures three million years in advance of us the favorite theory is the simplest and the most logical it is also the most disturbing you hide a sunpowered device in darkness only if you want to know when it is brought out into the light in other words the monolith may be some kind of alarm and we have triggered it whether the civilization which set it up still exists we do not know we must assume that creatures whose machines still function after three million years may build a society equally longlasting and we must also assume until we have evidence to the contrary that they may be hostile it has often been argued that any advanced culture must be benevolent but we cannot take any chances moreover as the past history of our own world has shown so many times primitive races have often failed to survive the encounter with higher civilizations anthropologists talk of cultural shock we may have to prepare the entire human race for such a shock but until we know something about the creatures who visited the moon and presumably the earth as well three million years ago we cannot even begin to make any preparations your mission therefore is much more than a voyage of discovery it is a scouting trip a reconnaissance into unknown and potentially dangerous territory the team under dr kaminski had been specially trained for this work now you will have to manage without them finally your specific target it seems incredible that advanced forms of life can exist on saturn or could ever have evolved on any of its moons we had planned to survey the entire system and we still hope that you can carry out a simplified program but now we may have to concentrate on the eighth satellite japetus when the time comes for the terminal maneuver we will decide whether you should rendezvous with this remarkable object japetus is unique in the solar system you know this already of course but like all the astronomers of the last three hundred years youve probably given it little thought so let me remind you that cassini who discovered japetus in also observed that it was six times brighter on one side of its orbit than the other this is an extraordinary ratio and there has never been a satisfactory explanation for it japetus is so small about eight hundred miles in diameter that even in the lunar telescopes its disk is barely visible but there seems to be a brilliant curiously symmetrical spot on one face and this may be connected with tma i sometimes think that japetus has been flashing at us like a cosmic heliograph for three hundred years and weve been too stupid to understand its message so now you know your real objective and can appreciate the vital importance of this mission we are all praying that you can still provide us with some facts for a preliminary announcement the secret cannot be kept indefinitely at the moment we do not know whether to hope or fear we do not know if out on the moons of saturn you will meet with good or with evil or only with ruins a thousand times older than troy v the moons of saturn survival work is the best remedy for any shock and bowman now had work enough for all his lost crewmates as swiftly as possible starting with the vital systems without which he and the ship would die he had to get discovery fully operational again life support was the first priority much oxygen had been lost but the reserves were still ample to sustain a single man the pressure and temperature regulation was largely automatic and there had seldom been need for hal to interfere with it the monitors on earth could now carry out many of the higher duties of the slain computer despite the long time lag before they could react to changing situations any trouble in the lifesupport system short of a serious puncture in the hull would take hours to make itself apparent there would be plenty of warning the ships power navigation and propulsion systems were unaffected but the last two in any event bowman would not need for months until it was time to rendezvous with saturn even at long range without the help of an onboard computer earth could still supervise this operation the final orbit adjustments would be somewhat tedious because of the constant need for checking but this was no serious problem by far the worst job had been emptying the spinning coffins in the centrifuge it was well bowman thought thankfully that the members of the survey team had been colleagues but not intimate friends they had trained together for only a few weeks looking back on it he now realized that even this had been largely a compatibility test when he had finally sealed the empty hibernacula he felt rather like an egyptian tomb robber now kaminski whitehead and hunter would all reach saturn before him but not before frank poole somehow he derived a strange wry satisfaction from this thought he did not attempt to find if the rest of the hibernation system was still in working order though his life might ultimately depend upon it this was a problem that could wait until the ship had entered its final orbit many things might happen before then it was even possible though he had not yet looked into the supply position carefully that by rigorous rationing he might remain alive without resort to hibernation until rescue came but whether he could survive psychologically as well as physically was quite another matter he tried to avoid thinking about such longrange problems and to concentrate on immediate essentials slowly he cleaned up the ship checked that its systems were still running smoothly discussed technical difficulties with earth and operated on the minimum of sleep only at intervals during the first weeks was he able to give much thought to the great mystery toward which he was now inexorably racing though it was never very far from his mind at last as the ship slowly settled down once more into an automatic routine though one that still demanded his constant supervision bowman had time to study the reports and briefings sent to him from earth again and again he played back the recording made when tma greeted the dawn for the first time in three million years he watched the spacesuited figures moving around it and almost smiled at their ludicrous panic when it blasted its signal at the stars paralyzing their radios with the sheer power of its electronic voice since that moment the black slab had done nothing it had been covered up then cautiously exposed to the sun again without any reaction no attempt had been made to cut into it partly through scientific caution but equally through fear of the possible consequences the magnetic field that led to its discovery had vanished at the moment of that radio shriek perhaps some experts theorized it had been generated by a tremendous circulating current flowing in a superconductor and thus carrying energy down the ages until it was needed that the monolith had some internal source of power seemed certain the solar energy it had absorbed during its brief exposure could not account for the strength of its signal one curious and perhaps quite unimportant feature of the block had led to endless argument the monolith was feet high and by feet in crosssection when its dimensions were checked with great care they were found to be in the exact ratio to to the squares of the first three integers no one could suggest any plausible explanation for this but it could hardly be a coincidence for the proportions held to the limits of measurable accuracy it was a chastening thought that the entire technology of earth could not shape even an inert block of any material with such a fantastic degree of precision in its way this passive yet almost arrogant display of geometrical perfection was as impressive as any of tmals other attributes bowman also listened with a curiously detached interest to mission controls belated apologia for its programming the voices from earth seemed to have a defensive note be could imagine the recriminations that must now be in progress among those who had planned the expedition they had some good arguments of course including the results of a secret department of defense study project barsoom which had been carried out by harvards school of psychology in in this experiment in controlled sociology various sample populations had been assured that the human race had made contact with extraterrestrials many of the subjects tested were with the help of drugs hypnosis and visual effects under the impression that they had actually met creatures from other planets so their reactions were regarded as authentic some of these reactions had been quite violent there was it seemed a deep vein of xenophobia in many otherwise normal human beings in view of mankinds record of lynchings pogroms and similar pleasantries this should have surprised no one nevertheless the organizers of the study had been deeply disturbed and the results had never been released the five separate panics caused in the twentieth century by radio broadcasts of hg wellss war of the worlds also reinforced the studys conclusions despite these arguments bowman sometimes wondered if the cultural shock danger was the only explanation for the missions extreme secrecy some hints that had been dropped during his briefings suggested that the us ussr bloc hoped to derive advantage by being the first to contact intelligent extraterrestrials from his present viewpoint looking back on earth as a dim star almost lost in the sun such considerations now seemed ludicrously parochial he was rather more interested even though this was now very much water under the bridge in the theory put forward to account for hals behavior no one would ever be sure of the truth but the fact that one of the mission control s had been driven into an identical psychosis and was now under deep therapy suggested that the explanation was the correct one the same mistake would not be made again and the fact that hals builders had failed fully to understand the psychology of their own creation showed how difficult it might be to establish communication with truly alien beings bowman could easily believe dr simonsons theory that unconscious feelings of guilt caused by his program conflicts had made hal attempt to break the circuit with earth and he liked to think though this again was something that could never be proved that hal had no intention of killing poole he had merely tried to destroy the evidence for once the ae unit reported as burned out was proved to be operational his lie would be revealed after that like any clumsy criminal caught in a thickening web of deception he had panicked and panic was something that bowman understood better than he had any wish to for he had known it twice during his life the first time was as a boy when he bad been caught in a line of surf and nearly drowned the second was as a spaceman under training when a faulty gauge had convinced him that his oxygen would be exhausted before he could reach safety on both occasions he had almost lost control of all his higher logical processes he had been within seconds of becoming a frenzied bundle of random impulses both times he had won through but he knew well enough that any man in the right circumstances could be dehumanized by panic if it could happen to a man then it could happen to hal and with that knowledge the bitterness and the sense of betrayal he felt toward the computer began to fade now in any event it belonged to a past that was wholly overshadowed by the threat and the promise of the unknown future concerning ets apart from hasty meals back in the carrousel luckily the main food dispensers had not been damaged bowman practically lived on the control deck he catnapped in his seat and so could spot any trouble as soon as the first signs of it appeared on the display under instructions from mission control he had juryrigged several emergency systems which were working tolerably well it even seemed possible that he would survive until the discovery reached saturn which of course she would do whether he was alive or not though he had little enough time for sightseeing and the sky of space was no novelty to him the knowledge of what now lay out there beyond the observation ports sometimes made it difficult for him to concentrate even on the problem of survival dead ahead as the ship was now oriented sprawled the milky way with its clouds of stars so tightly packed that they numbed the mind there were the fiery mists of sagittarius those seething swarms of suns that forever hid the heart of the galaxy from human vision there was the ominous black shadow of the coal sack that hole in space where no stars shone and there was alpha centauri nearest of all alien suns the first stop beyond the solar system although outshone by sirius and canopus it was alpha centauri that drew bowmans eyes and mind whenever he looked out into space for that unwavering point of brightness whose rays had taken four years to reach him had come to symbolize the secret debates that now raged on earth and whose echoes came to him from time to time no one doubted that there must be some connection between tma and the saturnian system but hardly any scientists would admit that the creatures who had erected the monolith could possibly have originated there as an abode of life saturn was even more hostile than jupiter and its many moons were frozen in an eternal winter three hundred degrees below zero only one of them titan possessed an atmosphere and that was a thin envelope of poisonous methane so perhaps the creatures who had visited earths moon so long ago were not merely extraterrestrial but extrasolar visitors from the stars who had established their bases wherever it suited them and this at once raised another problem could any technology no matter how advanced bridge the awful gulf that lay between the solar system and the nearest alien sun many scientists flatly denied the possibility they pointed out that discovery the fastest ship ever designed would take twenty thousand years to reach alpha centauri and millions of years to travel any appreciable distance across the galaxy even if during the centuries to come propulsion systems improved out of all recognition in the end they would meet the impassable barrier of the speed of light which no material object could exceed therefore the builders of tma must have shared the same sun as man and since they had made no appearance in historic times they were probably extinct a vocal minority refused to agree even if it took centuries to travel from star to star they contended this might be no obstacle to sufficiently determined explorers the technique of hibernation used on discovery herself was one possible answer another was the selfcontained artificial world embarking on voyages that might last for many generations in any event why should one assume that all intelligent species were as shortlived as man there might be creatures in the universe to whom a thousandyear voyage would present nothing worse than slight boredom these arguments theoretical though they were concerned a matter of the utmost practical importance they involved the concept of reaction time if tma had indeed sent a signal to the stars perhaps with the help of some further device near saturn then it would not reach its destination for years even if the response was immediate therefore humanity would have a breathing space which could certainly be measured in decades more probably in centuries to many people this was a reassuring thought but not to all a few scientists most of them beachcombers on the wilder shores of theoretical physics asked the disturbing question are we certain that the speed of light is an unbreakable barrier it was true that the special theory of relativity had proved to be remarkably durable and would soon be approaching its first centenary but it had begun to show a few cracks and even if einstein could not be defied he might be evaded those who sponsored this view talked hopefully about shortcuts through higher dimensions lines that were straighter than straight and hyperspacial connectivity they were fond of using an expressive phrase coined by a princeton mathematician of the last century wormholes in space critics who suggested that these ideas were too fantastic to be taken seriously were reminded of niels bohrs your theory is crazy but not crazy enough to be true if there was disputation among the physicists it was nothing compared with that among the biologists when they discussed the hoary old problem what would intelligent extraterrestrials look like they divided themselves into two opposing camps one arguing that such creatures must be humanoid the other equally convinced that they would look nothing like men settling for the first answer were those who believed that the design of two legs two arms and main sense organs at the highest point was so basic and so sensible that it was hard to think of a better one of course there would be minor differences like six fingers instead of five oddly colored skin or hair and peculiar facial arrangements but most intelligent extraterrestrials usually abbreviated to ets would be so similar to man that they might not be glanced at twice in poor lighting or from a distance this anthropomorphic thinking was ridiculed by another group of biologists true products of the space age who felt themselves free from the prejudices of the past they pointed out that the human body was the result of millions of evolutionary choices made by chance over eons of time at any one of these countless moments of decision the genetic dice might have fallen differently perhaps with better results for the human body was a bizarre piece of improvisation full of organs that had been diverted from one function to another not always very successfully and even containing discarded items like the appendix that were now worse than useless there were other thinkers bowman also found who held even more exotic views they did not believe that really advanced beings would possess organic bodies at all sooner or later as their scientific knowledge progressed they would get rid of the fragile diseaseandaccidentprone homes that nature had given them and which doomed them to inevitable death they would replace their natural bodies as they wore out or perhaps even before that by constructions of metal and plastic and would thus achieve immortality the brain might linger for a little while as the last remnant of the organic body directing its mechanical limbs and observing the universe through its electronic senses senses far finer and subtler than those that blind evolution could ever develop even on earth the first steps in this direction had been taken there were millions of men doomed in earlier ages who now lived active and happy lives thanks to artificial limbs kidneys lungs and hearts to this process there could be only one conclusion however far off it might be and eventually even the brain might go as the seat of consciousness it was not essential the development of electronic intelligence had proved that the conflict between mind and machine might be resolved at last in the eternal truce of complete symbiosis but was even this the end a few mystically inclined biologists went still further they speculated taking their cues from the beliefs of many religions that mind would eventually free itself from matter the robot body like the fleshandblood one would be no more than a steppingstone to something which long ago men bad called spirit and if there was anything beyond that its name could only be god ambassador during the last three months david bowman had adapted himself so completely to his solitary way of life that he found it hard to remember any other existence he had passed beyond despair and beyond hope and had settled down to a largely automatic routine punctuated by occasional crises as one or other of discoverys systems showed signs of malfunctioning but he had not passed beyond curiosity and sometimes the thought of the goal toward which he was driving filled him with a sense of exaltation and a feeling of power not only was he the representative of the entire human race but his actions during the next few weeks might determine its very future in the whole of history there had never been a situation quite like this he was an ambassador extraordinary plenipotentiary for all mankind that knowledge helped him in many subtle ways he kept himself neat and tidy no matter how tired he became he never skipped a shave mission control he knew was watching him closely for the first signs of any abnormal behavior he was determined that it should watch in vain at least for any serious symptoms bowman was aware of some changes in his behavior patterns it would have been absurd to expect anything else in the circumstances he could no longer tolerate silence except when he was sleeping or talking over the circuit to earth he kept the ships sound system running at almost painful loudness at first needing the companionship of the human voice he had listened to classical plays especially the works of shaw ibsen and shakespeare or poetry readings from discoverys enormous library of recorded sounds the problems they dealt with however seemed so remote or so easily resolved with a little common sense that after a while he lost patience with them so he switched to opera usually in italian or german so that he was not distracted even by the minimal intellectual content that most operas contained this phase lasted for two weeks before he realized that the sound of all these superbly trained voices was only exacerbating his loneliness but what finally ended this cycle was verdis requiem mass which he had never heard performed on earth the dies irae roaring with ominous appropriateness through the empty ship left him completely shattered and when the trumpets of doomsday echoed from the heavens he could endure no more thereafter he played only instrumental music he started with the romantic composers but shed them one by one as their emotional outpourings became too oppressive sibelius tchaikovsky berlioz lasted a few weeks beethoven rather longer he finally found peace as so many others had done in the abstract architecture of bach occasionally ornamented with mozart and so discovery drove on toward saturn as often as not pulsating with the cool music of the harpsichord the frozen thoughts of a brain that had been dust for twice a hundred years even from its present ten million miles saturn already appeared larger than the moon as seen from earth to the naked eye it was a glorious spectacle through the telescope it was unbelievable the body of the planet might have been mistaken for jupiter in one of his quieter moods there were the same bands of cloud though paler and less distinct than on that slightly larger world and the same continentsized disturbances moving slowly across the atmosphere however there was one striking difference between the two planets even at a glance it was obvious that saturn was not spherical it was so flattened at the poles that it sometimes gave the impression of slight deformity but the glory of the rings continually drew bowmans eye away from the planet in their complexity of detail and delicacy of shading they were a universe in themselves in addition to the great main gap between the inner and outer rings there were at least fifty other subdivisions or boundaries where there were distinct changes in the brightness of the planets gigantic halo it was as if saturn was surrounded by scores of concentric hoops all touching each other all so flat that they might have been cut from the thinnest possible paper the system of the rings looked like some delicate work of art or a fragile toy to be admired but never touched by no effort of the will could bowman really appreciate its true scale and convince himself that the whole planet earth if set down here would look like a ball bearing rolling round the rim of a dinner plate sometimes a star would drift behind the rings losing only a little of its brilliancy as it did so it would continue to shine through their translucent material though often it would twinkle slightly as some larger fragment of orbiting debris eclipsed it for the rings as had been known since the nineteenth century were not solid that was a mechanical impossibility they consisted of countless myriads of fragments perhaps the remains of a moon that had come too close and had been torn to pieces by the great planets tidal pull whatever their origin the human race was fortunate to have seen such a wonder it could exist for only a brief moment of time in the history of the solar system as long ago as a british astronomer had pointed out that the rings were ephemeral gravitational forces were at work which would soon destroy them taking this argument backward in time it therefore followed that they had been created only recently a mere two or three million years ago but no one had ever given the slightest thought to the curious coincidence that the rings of saturn had been born at the same time as the human race the orbiting ice discovery was now deep into the wideranging system of moons and the great planet itself was less than a day ahead the ship had long since passed the boundary set by outermost phoebe moving backward in a wildly eccentric orbit eight million miles from its primary ahead of it now lay japetus hyperion titan rhea dione tethys enceladus mimas janus and the rings themselves all the satellites showed a maze of surface detail in the telescope and bowman had relayed back to earth as many photographs as he could take titan alone three thousand miles in diameter and as large as the planet mercury would occupy a survey team for months he could give it and all its cold companions only the briefest of glances there was no need for more already he was quite certain that japetus was indeed his goal all the other satellites were pitted by occasional meteor craters though these were much fewer than on mars and showed apparently random patterns of light and shade with here and there a few bright spots that were probably patches of frozen gas japetus alone possessed a distinctive geography and a very strange one indeed one hemisphere of the satellite which like its companions turned the same face always toward saturn was extremely dark and showed very little surface detail in complete contrast the other was dominated by a brilliant white oval about four hundred miles long and two hundred wide at the moment only part of this striking formation was in daylight but the reason for japetuss extraordinary variations in brilliance was now quite obvious on the western side of the moons orbit the bright ellipse was presented toward the sun and the earth on the eastern phase the patch was turned away and only the poorly reflecting hemisphere could be observed the great ellipse was perfectly symmetrical straddling the equator of japetus with its major axis pointing toward the poles and it was so sharpedged that it almost looked as if someone had carefully painted a huge white oval on the face of the little moon it was completely flat and bowman wondered if it could be a lake of frozen liquid though that would hardly account for its startlingly artificial appearance but he had little time to study japetus on his way into the heart of the saturnian system for the climax of the voyage discoverys last perturbation maneuver was rapidly approaching in the jupiter flyby the ship had used the gravitational field of the planet to increase her velocity now she must do the reverse she had to lose as much speed as possible lest she escape from the solar system and fly on to the stars her present course was one designed to trap her so that she would become another moon of saturn shuttling back and forth along a narrow twomillionmilelong ellipse at its near point it would almost graze the planet at its far one it would touch the orbit of japetus the computers back on earth though their information was always three hours late had assured bowman that everything was in order velocity and altitude were correct there was nothing more to be done until the moment of closest approach the immense system of rings now spanned the sky and already the ship was passing over its outermost edge as he looked down upon them from a height of some ten thousand miles bowman could see through the telescope that the rings were made largely of ice glittering and scintillating in the light of the sun he might have been flying over a snowstorm that occasionally cleared to reveal where the ground should have been baffling glimpses of night and stars as discovery curved still closer toward saturn the sun slowly descended toward the multiple arches of the rings now they had become a slim silver bridge spanning the entire sky though they were too tenuous to do more than dim the sunlight their myriads of crystals refracted and scattered it in dazzling pyrotechnics and as the sun moved behind the thousandmilewide drifts of orbiting ice pale ghosts of itself marched and merged across the sky and the heavens were filled with shifting flares and flashes then the sun sank below the rings so that they framed it with their arches and the celestial fireworks ceased a little later the ship curved into the shadow of saturn as it made its closest approach over the night side of the planet above shone the stars and the rings below lay a dimly visible sea of clouds there were none of the mysterious patterns of luminosity that had glowed in the jovian night perhaps saturn was too cold for such displays the mottled cloudscape was revealed only by the ghostly radiance reflected back from the circling icebergs still illuminated by the hidden sun but in the center of the arch there was a wide dark gap like the missing span of an uncompleted bridge where the shadow of the planet lay across its rings radio contact with earth had been broken and could not be resumed until the ship emerged from the eclipsing bulk of saturn it was perhaps as well that bowman was too busy now to think of his suddenly enhanced loneliness for the next few hours every second would be occupied as he checked the braking maneuvers already programmed by the computers on earth after their months of idleness the main thrusters began to blast out their mileslong cataracts of glowing plasma gravity returned though briefly to the weightless world of the control deck and hundreds of miles below the clouds of methane and frozen ammonia blazed with a light that they had never known before as discovery swept a fierce and tiny sun through the saturnian night at last the pale dawn lay ahead the ship moving more and more slowly now was emerging into day it could no longer escape from the sun or even from saturn but it was still moving swiftly enough to rise away from the planet until it grazed the orbit of japetus two million miles out it would take discovery fourteen days to make that climb as she coasted once more though in reverse order across the paths of all the inner moons one by one she would cut through the orbits of janus mimas enceladus tethys dione rhea titan hyperion worlds bearing the names of gods and goddesses who had vanished only yesterday as time was counted here then she would meet japetus and must make her rendezvous if she failed she would fall back toward saturn and repeat her twentyeightday ellipse indefinitely there would be no chance for a second rendezvous if discovery missed on this attempt the next time around japetus would be far away almost on the other side of saturn it was true that they would meet again when the orbits of ship and satellite meshed for a second time but that appointment was so many years ahead that whatever happened bowman knew he would not witness it the eye of japetus when bowman had first observed japetus that curious elliptical patch of brilliance had been partly in shadow illuminated only by the light of saturn now as the moon moved slowly along its seventynineday orbit it was emerging into the full light of day as he watched it grow and discovery rose more and more sluggishly toward her inevitable appointment bowman became aware of a disturbing obsession he never mentioned it in his conversations or rather his running commentaries with mission control because it might have seemed that he was already suffering from delusions perhaps indeed he was for he had half convinced himself that the bright ellipse set against the dark background of the satellite was a huge empty eye staring at him as he approached it was an eye without a pupil for nowhere could he see anything to mar its perfect blankness not until the ship was only fifty thousand miles out and japetus was twice as large as earths familiar moon did he notice the tiny black dot at the exact center of the ellipse but there was no time then for any detailed examination the terminal maneuvers were already upon him for the last time discoverys main drive released its energies for the last time the incandescent fury of dying atoms blazed among the moons of saturn to david bowman the faroff whisper and rising thrust of the jets brought a sense of pride and of sadness the superb engines had done their duty with flawless efficiency they had brought the ship from earth to jupiter to saturn now this was the very last time that they would ever operate when discovery had emptied her propellant tanks she would be as helpless and inert as any comet or asteroid a powerless prisoner of gravitation even when the rescue ship arrived a few years hence it would not be an economical proposition to refuel her so that she could fight her way back to earth she would be an eternally orbiting monument to the early days of planetary exploration the thousands of miles shrank to hundreds and as they did so the fuel gauges dropped swiftly toward zero at the control panel bowmans eyes flickered anxiously back and forth over the situation display and the improvised charts which he now had to consult for any realtime decisions it would be an appalling anticlimax if having survived so much he failed to make rendezvous through lack of a few pounds of fuel the whistle of the jets faded as the main thrust died and only the verniers continued to nudge discovery gently into orbit japetus was now a giant crescent that filled the sky until this moment bowman had always thought of it as a tiny insignificant object as indeed it was compared with the world around which it circled now as it loomed menacingly above him it seemed enormous a cosmic hammer poised to crush discovery like a nutshell japetus was approaching so slowly that it scarcely seemed to move and it was impossible to tell the exact moment when it made the subtle change from an astronomical body to a landscape only fifty miles below the faithful verniers gave their last spurts of thrust then closed down forever the ship was in its final orbit completing one revolution every three hours at a mere eight hundred miles an hour all the speed that was required in this feeble gravitational field discovery has become a satellite of a satellite big brother im coming round to the daylight side again and its just as i reported on the last orbit this place seems to have only two kinds of surface material the black stuff looks burned almost like charcoal and with the same kind of texture as far as i can judge in the telescope in fact it reminds me very much of burned toast i still cant make any sense of the white area it starts at an absolutely sharpedged boundary and shows no surface detail at all it could even be a liquid its flat enough i dont know what impression youve got from the videos ive transmitted but if you picture a sea of frozen milk youll get the idea exactly it could even be some heavy gas no i suppose thats impossible sometimes i get the feeling that its moving very slowly but i can never be sure im over the white area again on my third orbit this time i hope to pass closer to that mark i spotted at its very center when i was on my way in if my calculations are correct i should go within fifty miles of it whatever it is yes theres something ahead just where i calculated its coming up over the horizon and so is saturn in almost the same quarter of the sky ill move to the telescope hello it looks like some kind of building completely black quite hard to see no windows or any other features just a big vertical slab it must be at least a mile high to be visible from this distance it reminds me of course its just like the thing you found on the moon this is tmals big brother experiment call it the star crate for three million years it had circled saturn waiting for a moment of destiny that might never come in its making a moon had been shattered and the debris of its creation orbited still now the long wait was ending on yet another world intelligence had been born and was escaping from its planetary cradle an ancient experiment was about to reach its climax those who had begun that experiment so long ago had not been men or even remotely human but they were flesh and blood and when they looked out across the deeps of space they bad felt awe and wonder and loneliness as soon as they possessed the power they set forth for the stars in their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched the workings of evolution on a thousand worlds they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night and because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than mind they encouraged its dawning everywhere they became farmers in the fields of stars they sowed and sometimes they reaped and sometimes dispassionately they had to weed the great dinosaurs had long since perished when the survey ship entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted a thousand years it swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth spread out beneath them the explorers saw a world swarming with life for years they studied collected catalogued when they had learned all that they could they began to modify they tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million years they were patient but they were not yet immortal there was so much to do in this universe of a hundred billion suns and other worlds were calling so they set out once more into the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again nor was there any need the servants they had left behind would do the rest on earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless moon still carried its secret with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice the tides of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors earth was not forgotten but another visit would serve little purpose it was one of a million silent worlds few of which would ever speak and now out among the stars evolution was driving toward new goals the first explorers of earth had long since come to the limits of flesh and blood as soon as their machines were better than their bodies it was time to move first their brains and then their thoughts alone they transferred into shining new homes of metal and of plastic in these they roamed among the stars they no longer built spaceships they were spaceships but the age of the machineentities swiftly passed in their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light they could become creatures of radiation free at last from the tyranny of matter into pure energy therefore they presently transformed themselves and on a thousand worlds the empty shells they had discarded twitched for a while in a mindless dance of death then crumbled into rusty now they were lords of the galaxy and beyond the reach of time they could rove at will among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space but despite their godlike powers they had not wholly forgotten their origin in the warm slime of a vanished sea and they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so long ago the sentinel the air in the ship is getting quite foul and i have a headache most of the time theres still plenty of oxygen but the purifiers never really cleaned up all the messes after the liquids aboard started boiling into vacuum when things get too bad i go down into the garage and bleed off some pure oxygen from the pods theres been no reaction to any of my signals and because of my orbital inclination im getting slowly farther and farther away from tma incidentally the name youve given it is doubly inappropriate theres still no trace of a magnetic field at the moment my closest approach is sixty miles it will increase to about a hundred as japetus rotates beneath me then drop back to zero ill pass directly over the thing in thirty days but thats too long to wait and then it will be in darkness anyway even now its only in sight for a few minutes before it falls below the horizon again its damn frustrating i cant make any serious observations so id like your approval of this plan the space pods have ample delta vee for a touchdown and a return to the ship i want to go extravehicular and make a close survey of the object if it appears safe ill land beside it or even on top of it the ship will still be above my horizon while im going down so i wont be out of touch for more than ninety minutes tm convinced that this is the only thing to do ive come a billion miles i dont want to be stopped by the last sixty for weeks as it stared forever sunward with its strange senses the star gate had watched the approaching ship its makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them it recognized what was climbing up toward it from the warm heart of the solar system if it had been alive it would have felt excitement but such an emotion was wholly beyond its powers even if the ship had passed it by it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment it had waited three million years it was prepared to wait for eternity it observed and noted and took no action as the visitor checked its speed with jets of incandescent gas presently it felt the gentle touch of radiations trying to probe its secrets and still it did nothing now the ship was in orbit circling low above the surface of this strangely piebald moon it began to speak with blasts of radio waves counting out the prime numbers from to over and over again soon these gave way to more complex signals at many frequenciesultraviolet infrared x rays the star gate made no reply it had nothing to say there was a long pause then before it observed that something was falling down toward it from the orbiting ship it searched its memories and the logic circuits made their decisions according to the orders given them long ago beneath the cold light of saturn the star gate awakened its slumbering powers into the eye discovery looked just as he had last seen her from space floating in lunar orbit with the moon taking up half the sky perhaps there was one slight change be could not be sure but some of the paint of her external lettering announcing the purpose of various hatches connections umbilical plugs and other attachment had faded during its long exposure to the unshielded sun that sun was now an object that no man would have recognized it was far too bright to be a star but one could look directly at its tiny disk without discomfort it gave no heat at all when bowman held his ungloved hands in its rays as they streamed through the space pods window he could feel nothing upon his skin he might have been trying to warm himself by the light of the moon not even the alien landscape fifty miles below reminded him more vividly of his remoteness from earth now he was leaving perhaps for the last time the metal world that had been his home for so many months even if he never returned the ship would continue to perform its duty broadcasting instrument readings back to earth until there was some final catastrophic failure in its circuits and if he did return well he could keep alive and perhaps even sane for a few more months but that was all for the hibernation systems were useless with no computer to monitor them he could not possibly survive until discovery ii made its rendezvous with japetus four or five years hence he put these thoughts behind him as the golden crescent of saturn rose in the sky ahead in all history he was the only man to have seen this sight to all other eyes saturn had always shown its whole illuminated disk turned full toward the sun now it was a delicate bow with the rings forming a thin line across it like an arrow about to be loosed into the face of the sun itself also in the line of the rings was the bright star of titan and the fainter sparks of the other moons before this century was half gone men would have visited them all but whatever secrets they might hold he would never know the sharpedged boundary of the blind white eye was sweeping toward him there was only a hundred miles to go and he would be over his target in less than ten minutes he wished that there was some way of telling if his words were reaching earth now an hour and a half away at the speed of light it would be the ultimate irony if through some breakdown in the relay system he disappeared into silence and no one ever knew what had happened to him discovery was still a brilliant star in the black sky far above he was pulling ahead as he gained speed during his descent but soon the pods braking jets would slow him down and the ship would sail on out of sight leaving him alone on this shining plain with the dark mystery at its center a block of ebony was climbing above the horizon eclipsing the stars ahead he rolled the pod around its gyros and used full thrust to break his orbital speed in a long flat arc he descended toward the surface of japetus on a world of higher gravity the maneuver would have been far too extravagant of fuel but here the space pod weighed only a score of pounds he had several minutes of hovering time before he would cut dangerously into his reserve and be stranded without any hope of return to the still orbiting discovery not perhaps that it made much difference his altitude was still about five miles and he was heading straight toward the huge dark mass that soared in such geometrical perfection above the featureless plain it was as blank as the flat white surface beneath until now he had not appreciated how enormous it really was there were very few single buildings on earth as large as this his carefully measured photographs indicated a height of almost two thousand feet and as far as could be judged its proportions were precisely the same as tmals that curious ratio to to im only three miles away now holding altitude at four thousand feet still not a sign of activity nothing on any of the instruments the faces seem absolutely smooth and polished surely youd expect some meteorite damage after all this time and theres no debris on the i suppose one could call it the roof no sign of any opening either id been hoping there might be some way in now im right above it hovering five hundred feet up i dont want to waste any time since discovery will soon be out of range im going to land its certainly solid enough and if it isnt ill blast off at once just a minute thats odd bowmans voice died into the silence of utter bewilderment he was not alarmed he literally could not describe what he was seeing he had been hanging above a large flat rectangle eight hundred feet long and two hundred wide made of something that looked as solid as rock but now it seemed to be receding from him it was exactly like one of those optical illusions when a threedimensional object can by an effort of will appear to turn inside out its near and far sides suddenly interchanging that was happening to this huge apparently solid structure impossibly incredibly it was no longer a monolith rearing high above a flat plain what had seemed to be its roof had dropped away to infinite depths for one dizzy moment he seemed to be looking down into a vertical shaft a rectangular duct which defied the laws of perspective for its size did not decrease with distance the eye of japetus had blinked as if to remove an irritating speck of dust david bowman had time for just one broken sentence which the waiting men in mission control nine hundred million miles away and eighty minutes in the future were never to forget the things hollow it goes on forever and oh my god its full of stars exit the star gate opened the star gate closed in a moment of time too short to be measured space turned and twisted upon itself then japetus was alone once more as it had been for three million years alone except for a deserted but not yet derelict ship sending back to its makers messages which they could neither believe nor understand vi through the stargate grand central there was no sense of motion but he was falling toward those impossible stars shining there in the dark heart of a moon no that was not where they really were he felt certain he wished now that it was far too late that he had paid more attention to those theories of hyperspace of transdimensional ducts to david bowman they were theories no longer perhaps that monolith on japetus was hollow perhaps the roof was only an illusion or some kind of diaphragm that had opened to let him through as far as he could trust his senses he appeared to be dropping vertically down a huge rectangular shaft several thousand feet deep he was moving faster and faster but the far end never changed its size and remained always at the same distance from him only the stars moved at first so slowly that it was some time before he realized that they were escaping out of the frame that held them but in a little while it was obvious that the star field was expanding as if it was rushing toward him at an inconceivable speed the expansion was nonlinear the stars at the center hardly seemed to move while those toward the edge accelerated more and more swiftly until they became streaks of light just before they vanished from view there were always others to replace them flowing into the center of the field from an apparently inexhaustible source bowman wondered what would happen if a star came straight toward him would it continue to expand until he plunged directly into the face of a sun but not one came near enough to show a disk eventually they all veered aside and streaked over the edge of their rectangular frame and still the far end of the shaft came no closer it was almost as if the walls were moving with him carrying him to his unknown destination or perhaps he was really motionless and space was moving past him not only space he suddenly realized was involved in whatever was happening to him now the clock on the pods small instrument panel was also behaving strangely normally the numbers in the tenthsofasecond window flickered past so quickly that it was almost impossible to read them now they were appearing and disappearing at discrete intervals and he could count them off one by one without difficulty the seconds themselves were passing with incredible slowness as if time itself were coming to a stop at last the tenthofasecond counter froze between and yet he could still think and even observe as the ebon walls flowed past at a speed that might have been anything between zero and a million times the velocity of light somehow he was not in the least surprised nor was he alarmed on the contrary he felt a sense of calm expectation such as he had once known when the space medics had tested him with hallucinogenic drugs the world around him was strange and wonderful but there was nothing to fear he had traveled these millions of miles in search of mystery and now it seemed the mystery was coming to him the rectangle ahead was growing lighter the hominous star streaks were paling against a milky sky whose brilliance increased moment by moment it seemed as if the space pod was heading toward a bank of cloud uniformly illuminated by the rays of an invisible sun he was emerging from the tunnel the far end which until now had remained at that same indeterminate distance neither approaching nor receding had suddenly started to obey the normal laws of perspective it was coming closer and steadily widening before him at the same time he felt that he was moving upward and for a fleeting instant he wondered if he had fallen right through japetus and was now ascending from the other side but even before the space pod soared out into the open he knew that this place had nothing to do with japetus or with any world within the experience of man there was no atmosphere for he could see all details unblurred clear down to an incredibly remote and flat horizon he must be above a world of enormous size perhaps one much larger than earth yet despite its extent all the surface that bowman could see was tessellated into obviously artificia patterns that must have been miles on a side it was like the jigsaw puzzle of a giant that played with planets and at the centers of many of those squares and triangles and polygons were gaping black shafts twins of the chasm from which he had just emerged yet the sky above was stranger and in its way more disturbing than even the improbable land beneath for there were no stars neither was there the blackness of space there was only a softly glowing milkiness that gave the impression of infinite distance bowman remembered a description he had once heard of the dreaded antarctic whiteout like being inside a pingpong ball those words could be applied perfectly to this weird place but the explanation must be utterly different this sky could be no meteorological effect of mist and snow there was a perfect vacuum here then as bowmans eyes grew accustomed to the nacreous glow that filled the heavens he became aware of another detail the sky was not as he had thought at first glance completely empty dotted overhead quite motionless and forming apparently random patterns were myriads of tiny black specks they were difficult to see for they were mere points of darkness but once detected they were quite unmistakable they reminded bowman of something something so familiar yet so insane that he refused to accept the parallel until logic forced it upon him those black holes in the white sky were stars he might have been looking at a photographic negative of the milky way where in gods name am i bowman asked himself and even as he posed the question he felt certain that he could never know the answer it seemed that space had been turned inside out this was not a place for man though the capsule was comfortably warm he felt suddenly cold and was afflicted by an almost uncontrollable trembling he wanted to close his eyes and shut out the pearly nothingness that surrounded him but that was the act of a coward and he would not yield to it the pierced and faceted planet slowly rolled beneath him without any real change of scenery he guessed that he was about ten miles above the surface and should be able to see any signs of life with ease but this whole world was deserted intelligence had come here worked its will upon it and gone its way again then he noticed bumped above the flat plain perhaps twenty miles away a roughly cylindrical pile of debris that could only be the carcass of a gigantic ship it was too distant for him to see any details and it passed out of sight within a few seconds but he could make out broken ribs and dully gleaming sheets of metal that had been partly peeled off like the skin of an orange he wondered how many thousands of years the wreck had lain here on this deserted checkerboard and what manner of creatures had sailed it between the stars then he forgot the derelict for something was coming up over the horizon at first it looked like a flat disk but that was because it was heading almost directly toward him as it approached and passed beneath he saw that it was spindleshaped and several hundred feet long though there were faintly visible bands here and there along its length it was hard to focus upon them the object appeared to be vibrating or perhaps spinning at a very rapid rate it tapered to a point at either end and there was no sign of propulsion only one thing about it was familiar to human eyes and that was its color if it was indeed a solid artifact and not an optical phantom then its makers perhaps shared some of the emotions of men but they certainly did not share their limitations for the spindle appeared to be made of gold bowman moved his head to the rearview system to watch the thing drop behind it had ignored him completely and now he saw that it was falling out of the sky down toward one of those thousands of great slots a few seconds later it disappeared in a final flash of gold as it dived into the planet he was alone again beneath that sinister sky and the sense of isolation and remoteness was more overwhelming than ever then he saw that he also was sinking down toward the mottled surface of the giant world and that another of the rectangular chasms yawned immediately below the empty sky closed above him the clock crawled to rest and once again his pod was falling between infinite ebon walls toward another distant patch of stars but now he was sure that he was not returning to the solar system and in a flash of insight that might have been wholly spurious he knew what this thing must surely be it was some kind of cosmic switching device routing the traffic of the stars through unimaginable dimensions of space and time he was passing through a grand central station of the galaxy the alien sky far ahead the walls of the slot were becoming dimly visible once more in the faint light diffusing downward from some still hidden source and then the darkness was abruptly whipped away as the tiny space pod hurtled upward into a sky ablaze with stars he was back in space as he knew it but a single glance told him that he was lightcenturies from earth he did not even attempt to find any of the familiar constellations that since the beginning of history had been the friends of man perhaps none of the stars that now blazed around him had ever been seen by the unaided human eye most of them were concentrated in a glowing belt broken here and there with dark bands of obscuring cosmic dust which completely circled the sky it was like the milky way but scores of times brighter bowman wondered if this was indeed his own galaxy seen from a point much closer to its brilliant crowded center he hoped that it was then he would not be so far from home but this he realized at once was a childish thought he was so inconceivably remote from the solar system that it made little difference whether he was in his own galaxy or the most distant one that any telescope had ever glimpsed he looked back to see the thing from which he was rising and had another shock here was no giant multifaceted world nor any duplicate of japetus there was nothing except an inky shadow against the stars like a doorway opening from a darkened room into a still darker night even as he watched that doorway closed it did not recede from him it slowly filled with stars as if a rent in the fabric of space had been repaired then he was alone beneath the alien sky the space pod was slowly turning and as it did so it brought fresh wonders into view first there was a perfectly spherical swarm of stars becoming more and more closely packed toward the center until its heart was a continuous glow of light its outer edges were illdefined a slowly thinning halo of suns that merged imperceptibly into the background of more distant stars this glorious apparition bowman knew was a globular cluster he was looking upon something that no human eye had ever seen save as a smudge of light in the field of a telescope he could not remember the distance to the nearest known cluster but he was sure that there were none within a thousand lightyears of the solar system the pod continued its slow rotation to disclose an even stranger sight a huge red sun many times larger than the moon as seen from earth bowman could look straight into its face without discomfort judging by its color it was no hotter than a glowing coal here and there set into the somber red were rivers of bright yellow incandescent amazons meandering for thousands of miles before they lost themselves in the deserts of this dying sun dying no that was a wholly false impression born of human experience and the emotions aroused by the hues of sunset or the glow of fading embers this was a star that had left behind the fiery extravagances of its youth had raced through the violets and blues and greens of the spectrum in a few fleeting billions of years and now had settled down to a peaceful maturity of unimaginable length all that had gone before was not a thousandth of what was yet to come the story of this star had barely begun the pod had ceased to roll the great red sun lay straight ahead though there was no sense of motion bowman knew that he was still gripped by whatever controlling force had brought him here from saturn all the science and engineering skill of earth seemed hopelessly primitive now against the powers that were carrying him to some unimaginable fate he stared into the sky ahead trying to pick out the goal toward which be was being taken perhaps some planet circling this great sun but there was nothing that showed any visible disk or exceptional brightness if there were planets orbiting here he could not distinguish them from the stellar background then he noticed that something strange was happening on the very edge of the suns crimson disk a white glow had appeared there and was rapidly waxing in brilliance he wondered if he was seeing one of those sudden eruptions or flares that trouble most stars from time to time the light became brighter and bluer it began to spread along the edge of the sun whose bloodred hues paled swiftly by comparison it was almost bowman told himself smiling at the absurdity of the thought as if be were watching sunrise on a sun and so indeed he was above the burning horizon lifted something no larger than a star but so brilliant that the eye could not bear to look upon it a mere point of bluewhite radiance like an electric arc was moving at unbelievable speed across the face of the great sun it must be very close to its giant companion for immediately below it drawn upward by its gravitational pull was a column of flame thousands of miles high it was as if a tidal wave of fire was marching forever along the equator of this star in vain pursuit of the searing apparition in its sky that pinpoint of incandescence must be a white dwarf one of those strange fierce little stars no larger than the earth yet containing a million times its mass such illmatched stellar couples were not uncommon but bowman had never dreamed that one day he would see such a pair with his own eyes the white dwarf had transited almost half the disk of its companion it must take only minutes to make a complete orbit when bowman was at last certain that he too was moving ahead of him one of the stars was becoming rapidly brighter and was beginning to drift against its background it must be some small close body perhaps the world toward which he was traveling it was upon him with unexpected speed and he saw that it was not a world at all a dully gleaming cobweb or latticework of metal hundreds of miles in extent grew out of nowhere until it filled the sky scattered across its continentwide surface were structures that must have been as large as cities but which appeared to be machines around many of these were assembled scores of smaller objects ranged in neat rows and columns bowman had passed several such groups before he realized that they were fleets of spaceships he was flying over a gigantic orbital parking lot because there were no familiar objects by which he could judge the scale of the scene flashing by below it was almost impossible to estimate the size of the vessels hanging there in space but they were certainly enormous some must have been miles in length they were of many different designs spheres faceted crystals slim pencils ovoids disks this must be one of the meeting places for the commerce of the stars or it had been perhaps a million years ago for nowhere could bowman see any sign of activity this sprawling spaceport was as dead as the moon he knew it not only by the absence of all movement but by such unmistakable signs as great gaps torn in the metal cobweb by the wasplike blunderings of asteroids that must have smashed through it eons ago this was no longer a parking lot it was a cosmic junk heap he had missed its builders by ages and with that realization bowman felt a sudden sinking of his heart though he had not known what to expect at least he had hoped to meet some intelligence from the stars now it seemed he was too late he had been caught in an ancient automatic trap set for some unknown purpose and still operating when its makers had long since passed away it had swept him across the galaxy and dumped him in this celestial sargasso doomed soon to die when his air was exhausted well it was unreasonable to expect more already he had seen wonders for which many men would have sacrificed their lives he thought of his dead companions he had no cause for complaint then he saw that the derelict spaceport was still sliding past him with undiminished speed he was sweeping over its outlying suburbs its ragged edge went by and no longer partially eclipsed the stars in a few more minutes it had fallen behind his fate did not lie here but far ahead in the huge crimson sun toward which the space pod was now unmistakably falling inferno now there was only the red sun filling the sky from side to side he was so close that its surface was no longer frozen into immobility by sheer scale there were luminous nodules moving to and fro cyclones of ascending and descending gas prominences slowly rocketing toward the heavens slowly they must be rising at a million miles an hour for their movement to be visible to his eye he did not even attempt to grasp the scale of the inferno toward which he was descending the immensities of saturn and jupiter bad defeated him during discoverys flyby in that solar system now unknown gigamiles away but everything he saw here was a hundred times larger still he could do nothing but accept the images that were flooding into his mind without attempting to interpret them as that sea of fire expanded beneath him bowman should have known fear but curiously enough he now felt only a mild apprehension it was not that his mind was benumbed with wonders logic told him that he must surely be under the protection of some controlling and almost omnipotent intelligence he was now so close to the red sun that he would have been burned up in a moment if its radiation had not been held at bay by some invisible screen and during his voyage he had been subjected to accelerations that should have crushed him instantly yet he had felt nothing if so much trouble had been taken to preserve him there was still cause for hope the space pod was now moving along a shallow arc almost parallel to the surface of the star but slowly descending toward it and now for the first time bowman became aware of sounds there was a faint continuous roar broken from time to time by crackles like tearing paper or distant lightning this could be only the feeblest echo of an unimaginable cacophony the atmosphere surrounding him must be racked by concussions that could tear any material object to atoms yet he was protected from this shattering tumult as effectively as from the heat though ridges of flame thousands of miles high were rising and slowly collapsing around him he was completely insulated from all this violence the energies of the star raved past him as if they were in another universe the pod moved sedately through their midst unbuffeted and unscorched bowmans eyes no longer hopelessly confused by the strangeness and grandeur of the scene began to pick out details which must have been there before but which he had not yet perceived the surface of this star was no formless chaos there was pattern here as in everything that nature created he noticed first the little whirlpools of gas probably no larger than asia or africa that wandered over the surface of the star sometimes he could look directly down into one of them to see darker cooler regions far below curiously enough there appeared to be no sunspots perhaps they were a disease peculiar to the star that shone on earth and there were occasional clouds like wisps of smoke blown before a gale perhaps they were indeed smoke for this sun was so cold that real fire could exist here chemical compounds could be born and could live for a few seconds before they were again ripped apart by the fiercer nuclear violence that surrounded them the horizon was growing brighter its color changing from gloomy red to yellow to blue to blistering violet the white dwarf was coming up over the horizon dragging its tidal wave of starstuff behind it bowman shielded his eyes from the intolerable glare of the little sun and focused on the troubled starscape which its gravitational field was sucking skyward once he had seen a waterspout moving across the face of the caribbean this tower of flame had almost the same shape only the scale was slightly different for at its base the column was probably wider than the planet earth and then immediately beneath him bowman noticed something which was surely new since he could hardly have overlooked it if it had been there before moving across the ocean of glowing gas were myriads of bright beads they shone with a pearly light which waxed and waned in a period of a few seconds and they were all traveling in the same direction like salmon moving upstream sometimes they weaved back and forth so that their paths intertwined but they never touched there were thousands of them and the longer bowman stared the more convinced he became that their motion was purposeful they were too far away for him to make out any details of their structure that be could see them at all in this colossal panorama meant that they must be scores perhaps hundreds of miles across if they were organized entities they were leviathans indeed built to match the scale of the world they inhabited perhaps they were only clouds of plasma given temporary stability by some odd combination of natural forces like the shortlived spheres of balllightning that still puzzled terrestrial scientists that was an easy and perhaps soothing explanation but as bowman looked down upon that starwide streaming he could not really believe it those glittering nodes of light knew where they were going they were deliberately converging upon the pillar of fire raised by the white dwarf as it orbited overhead bowman stared once more at that ascending column now marching along the horizon beneath the tiny massive star that ruled it could it be pure imagination or were there patches of brighter luminosity creeping up that great geyser of gas as if myriads of shining sparks had combined into whole continents of phosphorescence the idea was almost beyond fantasy but perhaps he was watching nothing less than a migration from star to star across a bridge of fire whether it was a movement of mindless cosmic beasts driven across space by some lemminglike urge or a vast concourse of intelligent entities he would probably never know he was moving through a new order of creation of which few men had ever dreamed beyond the realms of sea and land and air and space lay the realms of fire which he alone had been privileged to glimpse it was too much to expect that he would also understand reception the pillar of fire was marching over the edge of the sun like a storm passing beyond the horizon the scurrying flecks of light no longer moved across the redly glowing starscape still thousands of miles below inside his space pod protected from an environment that could annihilate him within a millisecond david bowman awaited whatever had been prepared the white dwarf was sinking fast as it hurtled along its orbit presently it touched the horizon set it aflame and disappeared a false twilight fell upon the inferno beneath and in the sudden change of illumination bowman became aware that something was happening in the space around him the world of the red sun seemed to ripple as if he were looking at it through running water for a moment he wondered if this was some refractive effect perhaps caused by the passage of an unusually violent shock wave through the tortured atmosphere in which he was immersed the light was fading it seemed that a second twilight was about to fall involuntarily bowman looked upward then checked himself sheepishly as he remembered that here the main source of light was not the sky but the blazing world below it seemed as if walls of some material like smoked glass were thickening around him cutting out the red glow and obscuring the view it became darker and darker the faint roar of the stellar hurricanes also faded out the space pod was floating in silence and in night a moment later there was the softest of bumps as it settled on some hard surface and came to rest to rest on what bowman asked himself incredulously then light returned and incredulity gave way to a heartsinking despair for as he saw what lay around him he knew that he must be mad he was prepared he thought for any wonder the only thing he had never expected was the utterly commonplace the space pod was resting on the polished floor of an elegant anonymous hotel suite that might have been in any large city on earth he was staring into a living room with a coffee table a divan a dozen chairs a writing desk various lamps a halffilled bookcase with some magazines lying on it and even a bowl of flowers van goghs bridge at arles was hanging on one wall wyeths christinas world on another he felt confident that when he pulled open the drawer of that desk he would find a gideon bible inside it if he was indeed mad his delusions were beautifully organized everything was perfectly real nothing vanished when he turned his back the only incongruous element in the scene and that certainly a major one was the space pod itself for many minutes bowman did not move from his seat he half expected the vision around him to go away but it remained as solid as anything be bad ever seen in his life it was real or else a phantom of the senses so superbly contrived that there was no way of distinguishing it from reality perhaps it was some kind of test if so not only his fate but that of the human race might well depend upon his actions in the next few minutes he could sit here and wait for something to happen or he could open the pod and step outside to challenge the reality of the scene around him the floor appeared to be solid at least it was bearing the weight of the space pod he was not likely to fall through it whatever it might really be but there was still the question of air for all that he could tell this room might be in vacuum or might contain a poisonous atmosphere he thought it very unlikely no one would go to all this trouble without attending to such an essential detail but he did not propose to take unnecessary risks in any event his years of training made him wary of contamination he was reluctant to expose himself to an unknown environment until he knew that there was no alternative this place looked like a hotel room somewhere in the united states that did not alter the fact that in reality he must be hundreds of lightyears from the solar system he closed the helmet of his suit sealing himself in and actuated the hatch of the space pod there was a brief hiss of pressure equalization then he stepped out into the room as far as he could tell he was in a perfectly normal gravity field he raised one arm then let it fall freely it flopped to his side in less than a second this made everything seem doubly unreal here he was wearing a spacesuit standing when he should have been floating outside a vehicle which could only function properly in the absence of gravity all his normal astronauts reflexes were upset he had to think before he made every movement like a man in a trance he walked slowly from his bare unfurnished half of the room toward the hotel suite it did not as he had almost expected disappear as he approached but remained perfectly real and apparently perfectly solid he stopped beside the coffee table on it sat a conventional bell system visionphone complete with the local directory he bent down and picked up the volume with his clumsy gloved hands it bore in the familiar type he had seen thousands of times the name washington dc then he looked more closely and for the first time he had objective proof that although all this might be real he was not on earth he could read only the word washington the rest of the printing was a blur as if it had been copied from a newspaper photograph he opened the book at random and riffled through the pages they were all blank sheets of crisp white material which was certainly not paper though it looked very much like it he lifted the telephone receiver and pressed it against the plastic of his helmet if there had been a dialing sound he could have heard it through the conducting material but as he had expected there was only silence so it was all a fake though a fantastically careful one and it was clearly not intended to deceive but rather he hoped to reassure that was a very comforting thought nevertheless he would not remove his suit until be had completed his voyage of exploration all the furniture seemed sound and solid enough he tried the chairs and they supported his weight but the drawers in the desk would not open they were dummies so were the books and magazines like the telephone directory only the titles were readable they formed an odd selection mostly rather trashy best sellers a few sensational works of nonfiction and some wellpublicized autobiographies there was nothing less than three years old and little of any intellectual content not that it mattered for the books could not even be taken down from the shelves there were two doors that opened readily enough the first one took him into a small but comfortable bedroom fitted with a bed bureau two chairs light switches that actually worked and a clothes closet he opened this and found himself looking at four suits a dressing gown a dozen white shirts and several sets of underwear all neatly draped from hangers he took down one of the suits and inspected it carefully as far as his gloved hands could judge it was made of material that was more like fur than wool it was also a little out of style on earth no one had been wearing singlebreasted suits for at least four years next to the bedroom was a bathroom complete with fittings which he was relieved to note were not dummies but worked in a perfectly normal manner and after that was a kitchenette with electric cooker refrigerator storage cupboards crockery and cutlery sink table and chairs bowman began to explore this not only with curiosity but with mounting hunger first he opened the refrigerator and a wave of cold mist rolled out the shelves were well stocked with packages and cans all of them looking perfectly familiar from a distance though at close quarters their proprietary labels were blurred and unreadable however there was a notable absence of eggs milk butter meat fruit or any other unprocessed food the refrigerator held only items that had already been packaged in some way bowman picked up a carton of a familiar breakfast cereal thinking as he did so that it was odd to keep this frozen the moment he lifted the package he knew that it certainly did not contain cornflakes it was much too heavy he ripped open the lid and examined the contents the box contained a slightly moist blue substance of about the weight and texture of bread pudding apart from its odd color it looked quite appetizing but this is ridiculous bowman told himself i am almost certainly being watched and i must look an idiot wearing this suit if this is some kind of intelligence test ive probably failed already without further hesitation he walked back into the bedroom and began to undo the clamp of his helmet when it was loose he lifted the helmet a fraction of an inch cracked the seal and took a cautious sniff as far as he could tell he was breathing perfectly normal air he dropped the helmet on the bed and began thankfully and rather stiffly to divest himself of his suit when he had finished he stretched took a few deep breaths and carefully hung the spacesuit up among the more conventional articles of clothing in the closet it looked rather odd there but the compulsive tidiness that bowman shared with all astronauts would never have allowed him to leave it anywhere else then he walked quickly back into the kitchen and began to inspect the cereal box at closer quarters the blue bread pudding had a faint spicy smell something like a macaroon bowman weighed it in his hand then broke off a piece and cautiously sniffed at it though he felt sure now that there would be no deliberate attempt to poison him there was always the possibility of mistakes especially in a matter so complex as biochemistry he nibbled at a few crumbs then chewed and swallowed the fragment of food it was excellent though the flavor was so elusive as to be almost indescribable if he closed his eyes he could imagine it was meat or wholemeal bread or even dried fruit unless there were unexpected aftereffects he had no cause to fear starvation when he had eaten just a few mouthfuls of the substance and already felt quite satisfied he looked for something to drink there were half a dozen cans of beer again of a famous brand at the back of the refrigerator and he pressed the tab on one of them to open it the prestressed metal lid popped off along its strain lines exactly as usual but the can did not contain beer to bowmans surprised disappointment it held more of the blue food in a few seconds he had opened half a dozen of the other packages and cans whatever their labels their contents were the same it seemed that his diet was going to be a little monotonous and that he would have nothing but water to drink he filled a glass from the kitchen faucet and sipped at it cautiously he spat out the first few drops at once the taste was terrible then rather ashamed of his instinctive reaction he forced himself to drink the rest that first sip had been enough to identify the liquid it tasted terrible because it had no taste at all the faucet was supplying pure distilled water his unknown hosts were obviously taking no chances with his health feeling much refreshed he then had a quick shower there was no soap which was another minor inconvenience but there was a very efficient hotair drier in which be luxuriated for a while before trying on underpants vest and dressing gown from the clothes closet after that he lay down on the bed stared up at the ceiling and tried to make sense of this fantastic situation he had made little progress when he was distracted by another line of thought immediately above the bed was the usual hoteltype ceiling tv screen he had assumed that like the telephone and books it was a dummy but the control unit on its swinging bedside arm looked so realistic that he could not resist playing with it and as his fingers touched the on sensor disk the screen lit up feverishly he started to tap out channel selector codes at random and almost at once he got his first picture it was a wellknown african news commentator discussing the attempts being made to preserve the last remnants of his countrys wild life bowman listened for a few seconds so captivated by the sound of a human voice that he did not in the least care what it was talking about then he changed channels in the next five minutes he got a symphony orchestra playing waltons violin concerto a discussion on the sad state of the legitimate theater a western a demonstration of a new headache cure a panel game in some oriental language a psychodrama three news commentaries a football game a lecture on solid geometry and several tuning signals and data transmissions it was in fact a perfectly normal selection from the worlds tv programs and apart from the psychological uplift it gave him it confirmed one suspicion that had already been forming in his mind all the programs were about two years old that was around the time tma had been discovered and it was hard to believe that this was a pure coincidence something had been monitoring the radio waves that ebon block had been busier than men had suspected he continued to wander across the spectrum and suddenly recognized a familiar scene here was this very suite now occupied by a celebrated actor who was furiously denouncing an unfaithful mistress bowman looked with a shock of recognition upon the living room he had just left and when the camera followed the indignant couple toward the bedroom he involuntarily looked toward the door to see if anyone was entering so that was how this reception area had been prepared for him his hosts had based their ideas of terrestrial living upon tv programs his feeling that he was inside a movie set was almost literally true he had learned all that he wished to for the moment and turned off the set what do i do now he asked himself locking his fingers behind his head and staring up at the blank screen he was physically and emotionally exhausted yet it seemed impossible that one could sleep in such fantastic surroundings and farther from earth than any man in history had ever been but the comfortable bed and the instinctive wisdom of the body conspired together against his will he fumbled for the light switch and the room was plunged into darkness within seconds he had passed beyond the reach of dreams so for the last time david bowman slept recapitulation there being no further use for it the furniture of the suite dissolved back into the mind of its creator only the bed remained and the walls shielding this fragile organism from the energies it could not yet control in his sleep david bowman stirred restlessly he did not wake nor did he dream but he was no longer wholly unconscious like a fog creeping through a forest something invaded his mind he sensed it only dimly for the full impact would have destroyed him as surely as the fires raging beyond these walls beneath that dispassionate scrutiny he felt neither hope nor fear all emotion had been leached away he seemed to be floating in free space while around him stretched in all directions an infinite geometrical grid of dark lines or threads along which moved tiny nodes of light some slowly some at dazzling speed once he had peered through a microscope at a crosssection of a human brain and in its network of nerve fibers had glimpsed the same labyrinthine complexity but that had been dead and static whereas this transcended life itself he knew or believed he knew that he was watching the operation of some gigantic mind contemplating the universe of which he was so tiny a part the vision or illusion lasted only a moment then the crystalline planes and lattices and the interlocking perspectives of moving light flickered out of existence as david bowman moved into a realm of consciousness that no man had experienced before at first it seemed that time itself was running backward even this marvel he was prepared to accept before be realized the subtler truth the springs of memory were being tapped in controlled recollection he was reliving the past there was the hotel suite there the space pod there the burning starscapes of the red sun there the shining core of the galaxy there the gateway through which he had reemerged into the universe and not only vision but all the sense impressions and all the emotions he had felt at the time were racing past more and more swiftly his life was unreeling like a tape recorder playing back at everincreasing speed now he was once more aboard the discovery and the rings of saturn filled the sky before that he was repeating his final dialogue with hal he was seeing frank poole leave on his last mission he was hearing the voice of earth assuring him that all was well and even as he relived these events he knew that all indeed was well he was retrogressing down the corridors of time being drained of knowledge and experience as he swept back toward his childhood but nothing was being lost all that be had ever been at every moment of his life was being transferred to safer keeping even as one david bowman ceased to exist another became immortal faster faster he moved back into forgotten years and into a simpler world faces he had once loved and had thought lost beyond recall smiled at him sweetly he smiled back with fondness and without pain now at last the headlong regression was slackening the wells of memory were nearly dry time flowed more and more sluggishly approaching a moment of stasis as a swinging pendulum at the limit of its arc seems frozen for one eternal instant before the next cycle begins the timeless instant passed the pendulum reversed its swing in an empty room floating amid the fires of a double star twenty thousand lightyears from earth a baby opened its eyes and began to cry transformation then it became silent as it saw that it was no longer alone a ghostly glimmering rectangle had formed in the empty air it solidified into a crystal tablet lost its transparency and became suffused with a pale milky luminescence tantalizing illdefined phantoms moved across its surface and in its depths they coalesced into bars of lights and shadow then formed intermeshing spoked patterns that began slowly to rotate in time with the pulsing rhythm that now seemed to fill the whole of space it was a spectacle to grasp and hold the attention of any child or of any manape but as it had been three million years before it was only the outward manifestation of forces too subtle to be consciously perceived it was merely a toy to distract the senses while the real processing was carried out at far deeper levels of the mind this time the processing was swift and certain as the new design was woven for in the eons since their last meeting much had been learned by the weaver and the material on which he practiced his art was now of an infinitely finer texture but whether it should be permitted to form part of his stillgrowing tapestry only the future could tell with eyes that already held more than human intentness the baby stared into the depths of the crystal monolith seeing but not yet understanding the mysteries that lay beyond it knew that it had come home that here was the origin of many races besides its own but it knew also that it could not stay beyond this moment lay another birth stranger than any in the past now the moment had come the glowing patterns no longer echoed the secrets in the crystals heart as they died so too the protective walls faded back into the nonexistence from which they bad briefly emerged and the red sun filled the sky the metal and plastic of the forgotten space pod and the clothing once worn by an entity who had called himself david bowman flashed into flame the last links with earth were gone resolved back into their component atoms but the child scarcely noticed as he adjusted himself to the comfortable glow of his new environment he still needed for a little while this shell of matter as the focus of his powers his indestructible body was his minds present image of itself and for all his powers he knew that he was still a baby so he would remain until he had decided on a new form or had passed beyond the necessities of matter and now it was time to go though in one sense he would never leave this place where he had been reborn for he would always be part of the entity that used this double star for its unfathomable purposes the direction though not the nature of his destiny was clear before him and there was no need to trace the devious path by which he had come with the instincts of three million years he now perceived that there were more ways than one behind the back of space the ancient mechanisms of the star gate had served him well but he would not need them again the glimmering rectangular shape that had once seemed no more than a slab of crystal still floated before him indifferent as he was to the harmless flames of the inferno beneath it encapsulated yet unfathomed secrets of space and time but some at least he now understood and was able to command how obvious how necessary was that mathematical ratio of its sides the quadratic sequence and how naive to have imagined that the series ended at this point in only three dimensions he focused his mind upon these geometrical simplicities and as his thoughts brushed against it the empty framework filled with the darkness of the interstellar night the glow of the red sun faded or rather seemed to recede in all directions at once and there before him was the luminous whirlpool of the galaxy it might have been some beautiful incredibly detailed model embedded in a block of plastic but it was the reality grasped as a whole with senses now more subtle than vision if he wished he could focus his attention upon any one of its hundred billion stars and he could do much more than that here he was adrift in this great river of suns halfway between the banked fires of the galactic core and the lonely scattered sentinel stars of the rim and here he wished to be on the far side of this chasm in the sky this serpentine band of darkness empty of all stars he knew that this formless chaos visible only by the glow that limned its edges from firemists far beyond was the still unused stuff of creation the raw material of evolutions yet to be here time had not begun not until the suns that now burned were long since dead would light and life reshape this void unwittingly he had crossed it once now he must cross it again this time of his own volition the thought filled him with a sudden freezing terror so that for a moment he was wholly disorientated and his new vision of the universe trembled and threatened to shatter into a thousand fragments it was not fear of the galactic gulfs that chilled his soul but a more profound disquiet stemming from the unborn future for he had left behind the time scales of his human origin now as he contemplated that band of starless night he knew his first intimations of the eternity that yawned before him then he remembered that he would never be alone and his panic slowly ebbed the crystalclear perception of the universe was restored to him not he knew wholly by his own efforts when he needed guidance in his first faltering steps it would be there confident once more like a high diver who had regained his nerve he launched himself across the lightyears the galaxy burst forth from the mental frame in which he had enclosed it stars and nebulae poured past him in an illusion of infinite speed phantom suns exploded and fell behind as he slipped like a shadow through their cores the cold dark waste of cosmic dust which he had once feared seemed no more than the beat of a ravens wing across the face of the sun the stars were thinning out the glare of the milky way was dimming into a pale ghost of the glory he had known and when he was ready would know again he was back precisely where he wished to be in the space that men called real starchild there before him a glittering toy no starchild could resist floated the planet earth with all its peoples he had returned in time down there on that crowded globe the alarms would be flashing across the radar screens the great tracking telescopes would be searching the skies and history as men knew it would be drawing to a close a thousand miles below he became aware that a slumbering cargo of death had awoken and was stirring sluggishly in its orbit the feeble energies it contained were no possible menace to him but he preferred a cleaner sky he put forth his will and the circling megatons flowered in a silent detonation that brought a brief false dawn to half the sleeping globe then he waited marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers for though he was master of the world he was not quite sure what to do next but he would think of something epilogue after the novel a space odyssey was written during the years and was published in july shortly after release of the movie as i have described in the lost worlds of both projects proceeded simultaneously with feedback in each direction thus i often had the strange experience of revising the manuscript after viewing rushes based upon an earlier version of the story a stimulating but rather expensive way of writing a novel as a result there is a much closer parallel between book and movie than is usually the case but there are also major differences in the novel the destination of the spaceship discovery was iapetus most enigmatic of saturns many moons the saturnian system was reached via jupiter discovery made a close approach to the giant planet using its enormous gravitational field to produce a slingshot effect and to accelerate it along the second lap of its journey exactly the same maneuver was used by the voyager spaceprobes in when they made the first detailed reconnaissance of the outer giants in the movie however stanley kubrick wisely avoided confusion by setting the third confrontation between man and monolith among the moons of jupiter saturn was dropped from the script entirely though douglas trumbull later used the expertise he had acquired filming the ringed planet in his own production silent running no one could have imagined back in the midsixties that the exploration of the moons of jupiter lay not in the next century but only fifteen years ahead nor had anyone dreamed of the wonders that would be found there although we can be quite certain that the discoveries of the twin voyagers will one day be surpassed by even more unexpected finds when was written io europa ganymede and callisto were mere pinpoints of light in even the most powerful telescope now they are worlds each unique and one of them io the most volcanically active body in the solar system yet all things considered both movie and book stand up quite well in the light of these discoveries there are no major changes i would wish to make to the text and it is fascinating to compare the jupiter sequences in the film with the actual movies from the voyager cameras it must also be remembered that was written in an age that now lies beyond one of the great divides in human history we are sundered from it forever by the moment when neil armstrong set foot upon the moon july was still half a decade in the future when stanley kubrick and i started thinking about the proverbial good science fiction movie now history and fiction have become inextricably intertwined the apollo astronauts had already seen the film when they left for the moon the crew of apollo who at christmas became the first men ever to set eyes upon the lunar farside told me that they had been tempted to radio back the discovery of a large black monolith alas discretion prevailed and there were later almost uncanny instances of nature imitating art strangest of all was the saga of apollo in as a good opening the command module which houses the crew had been christened odyssey just before the explosion of the oxygen tank which caused the mission to be aborted the crew had been playing richard strauss zarathustra theme now universally identified with the movie immediately after the loss of power jack swigert radioed back to mission control houston weve had a problem the words that hal used to frank poole on a similar occasion were sorry to interrupt the festivities but we have a problem when the report of the apollo mission was later published nasa administrator tom paine sent me a copy and noted under swigerts words just as you always said it would be arthur i still get a very strange feeling when i contemplate this whole series of events almost indeed as if i share a certain responsibility another resonance is less serious but equally striking one of the most technically brilliant sequences in the movie was that in which astronaut frank poole was shown running round and round the circular track of the giant centrifuge held in place by the artificial gravity produced by its spin almost a decade later the crew of the superbly successful skylab realized that its designers had provided them with a similar geometry a ring of storage cabinets formed a smooth circular band around the space stations interior skylab however was not spinning but this did not deter its ingenious occupants they discovered that they could run around the track just like mice in a squirrel cage to produce a result visually indistinguishable from that shown in and they televised the whole exercise back to earth with the comment stanley kubrick should see this as in due course he did because i sent him the telecine recording there is also the strange case of the eye of japetus described in chapter where bowman discovers a brilliant white ovalso sharpedged that it almost lookedpainted on the face of the little moon with a tiny black dot at the exact center which turns out to be the monolith well when voyager took the first photographs of iapetus they did indeed disclose a large clearcut white oval with a tiny black dot at the center carl sagan promptly sent me a print from the jet propulsion laboratory with the cryptic annotation thinking of you i do not know whether to be relieved or disappointed that voyager has left the matter still open when fourteen years ago i typed the final words for though he was master of the world he was not quite sure what to do next but he would think of something i felt i had closed the circuit and precluded all possibility of a sequel indeed for the next decade i ridiculed the very idea for what seemed to me conclusive reasons since was concerned with the next stage of human evolution to expect me to depict it would be as absurd as asking moonwatcher to describe bowman and his world despite my protests it is now obvious that my busy little subconscious was hard at work perhaps in response to the constant stream of letters from readers wanting to know what happened next finally as an intellectual exercise i wrote a precis of a possible sequel in the form of a short movie outline and sent copies to stanley kubrick and my agent scott meredith as far as stanley was concerned this was an act of courtesy for i knew that he never repeats himself but i hoped that scott would sell the outline to omni magazine which had recently published another outline the songs of distant earth then i fondly hoped the ghost of would be finally exorcised stanley expressed guarded interest but scott was enthusiastic and implacable youve simply got to write the book he said with a groan i realized that he was right so now gentle reader you can find what happens next in space odyssey two i am extremely grateful to new american library copyright holders of a space odyssey for permission to use chapter in the new novel it serves as a link connecting the two books together a final comment on both novels as seen from a point now almost exactly midway between the year and the time when stanley kubrick and i started working together contrary to popular belief science fiction writers very seldom attempt to predict the future indeed as ray bradbury put it so well they more often try to prevent it in the first heroic period of the space age was just opening the united states had set the moon as its target and once that decision had been made the ultimate conquest of the other planets appeared inevitable by it seemed quite reasonable that there would be giant spacestations in orbit round the earth and a little later manned expeditions to the planets in an ideal world that would have been possible the vietnam war would have paid for everything that stanley kubrick showed on the cinerama screen now we realize that it will take a little longer will not arrive by yet barring accidents by that date almost everything depicted in the book and the movie will be in the advanced planning stage except for communication with alien intelligences that is something that can never be planned only anticipated no one knows whether it will happen tomorrow or a thousand years hence but it will happen someday
