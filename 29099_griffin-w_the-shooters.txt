the shooters w e b griffin i one airport highway asuncion paraguay august when byron j timmons jr saw what was causing the airportbound traffic to be stopped and backed up for at least a kilometer he muttered an obscenity that was absolutely not appropriate for an assistant legal attache of the embassy of the united states of america the twentynineyearoldwho was six feet one and weighed two hundred five poundshad a reservation on the aerolineas argentinas fivethirty flight to buenos aires and it looked to him to be entirely likely that these bastards were going to make him miss it timmons looked at the driver of his embassy vehicle a lightly armored chevrolet trailblazer franco julio cesara quiet thirtynineyearold paraguayan national who was employed as a chauffeur by the us embassywas silently shaking his head in frustration he too knew what was going on these bastards were officers of the paraguayan highway police and they were running a roadblock there was a highway police car and a peugeot van on the shoulder the van had a sliding side doornow openso that it could serve as sort of a mobile booking station inside was a small desk behind which sat a booking sergeant he would decide whether the miscreant caught by the roadblock would be simply given a summons or hauled away in handcuffs there were three police forces in paraguay in addition to the highway police which was run by the minister of public works amp communication the minister of the interior had a capital police force which patrolled asuncion and a national police force which patrolled the rest of the country the opinion timmons held of all three was as pejoratively vulgar as the obscenity he uttered when he saw the highway police roadblock his opinion was based on his experiences with the various police forces since arriving in paraguay and his criterion for judgment was that he thought of himself as a cop he actually had been a police officer briefly but the real reason he thought of himself as a cop was that that was what the timmons family didbe cops his paternal grandfather francis used to say that he was one of the only two really honest cops on the job in chicago he refused to identify the other one francis and marymargaret timmons had five children three boys and two girls two of the boysaloysius and byronwent on the force francis junior became a priest dorothy became sister alexandria elizabeth married a cop patrick donnehy father francis who was assigned to saint rose of limas spent most of his time as a police chaplain aloysius and joanne timmons had four children all boys three went on the force and one went in the army byron and helen timmons had five children three girls and two boys two of the girls married cops and matthew went on the force byron junior skipped the third grade at saint roses primarily because he was much larger than the other kids but also because the sisters understood that he already knew what they were going to teach him in the third gradehe never seemed to have his nose out of a book the sisters also got him a scholarship to cristo rey jesuit high school his uncle francis and his mother were delighted his grandfather and father were not they quite irreverently agreed that the goddamn jesuits wanted him for the priesthood at age sixteen junior as he was known in the family graduated from cristo rey with honors and without having felt the call to holy orders he immediately became a police cadet although you were supposed to be eighteen before the summer was over the society of jesus reentered the picture loyola university chicago was prepared to offer junior based on his academic record at cristo rey a full scholarship this time his father and grandfather disagreed his father offered another quite irreverent opinion that you had to admire those tenacious bastards they never give up when theyre trying to grab some smart kid for their priesthood his grandfather disagreed and suggested that junior had two options one was to spend the next nearly four years in a gray cadet uniform riding in the backseat of a patrol car or filing crap in a precinct basement someplacehe couldnt even get into the academy until he was twenty years and six months oldor he could spend that time getting a college education on the jesuits dime for the next three years junior studied during the school year and returned to the police cadet program in the summers on his graduation cum laude he immediately entered the police academy three months later he was graduated from there andwith most of the family watchingbecame a sworn officer of the chicago police department he had been on the job doing what rookies do for six months when grandfather francis reentered the picture go federal grandpa advised the pay is better maybe the us marshals or even the secret service to which byronno longer universally known as junior after he made good on a promise to knock his sister ellens husband charley mullroney on his ass the next time he called him thatreplied that hed already looked into it was thinking of the federal bureau of investigation and going down that road was really thinking of getting a law degree he told his grandfather hed talked to people at loyola and they not only were going to let him in the law school but had arranged for him a job as a rentacop on campus christ knew he couldnt go to college if he had to change shifts on the job every three months byron graduated again with honors and passed the bar examination on his first try by then he had just turned twentyeight and had seen enough of the fbi to decide that wasnt for him the border patrol looked interesting but then he met a guy from the drug enforcement administration whom his brotherinlaw charley mullroney had been working with in narcotics stanley wyskowski said byron was just the kind of guy the dea was looking for hed been a cop and he had a law degree and he spoke passable spanish actually he spoke better than passable spanish he had the grammar down pat because hed had latin his last two years at saint roses and his first two at cristo rey and then hed had two years of spanish at cristo reysomebody had tipped him that if you had latin spanish was the easiest languageand four more years of it at loyola and he had polished his colloquial spanish with a young lady named maria gonzalez with whom hed had an onandoff carnal relationship for several years when he was at loyola wyskowski said if byron wanted hed ask his boss byron j timmons jr entered the federal service two weeks later as a gs on his graduation from the federal law enforcement training center at glynco georgia he received both his credentials as a special agent of the drug enforcement administration and a promotion to gs because of his law degree he was initially assigned to washington dcthe dea is part of the department of homeland securitywhere he understood they wanted to have a look at him two months later they offered him his choice of the legal section which carried an almost automatic promotion to gs after two years or the field he had seen what was going on in the legal departmentpushing papers held absolutely no appealso he chose the field that wasnt the answer they wanted they reminded him of the automatic promotion that came with the legal section and told him that the only vacancies in the field were in el paso los angeles miami mexico city and asuncion paraguay timmons didnt like the sound of el paso mexico city or los angeles and had only the vaguest idea of where in hell asuncion paraguay even was so when he said miami he was not very surprised that they sent him to asuncion paraguay they were really pissed that he had turned down the legal sectiontwice no regrets though he wanted to be a cop not a lawyer preparing cases for prosecution by the justice department specifically he wanted to be a drug cop in byrons mind there wasnt much difference between a guy who did murder oneroughly defined as with premeditation or during the course of a class one felony like armed robberyand some guy who got a kid started on hard drugs in both cases a life was over if there was a difference in byrons mind it was that the drug bastards were the worse of the two a murder victim or some convenience store clerk died right there tough but it was over quick it usually took a long time for a drug addict to die and he almost always hooked a lot of other people before he did if that wasnt multiple murder what was not to mention the pain a drug addict caused his family another difference was that dealing in prohibited substanceseven for the clowns standing on a street corner peddling nickel bags of crackpaid a lot better than sticking up a bank did and that was the problemmoney it was bad in the states where entirely too many cops went bad because they really couldnt see the harm in looking the other way for fifteen minutes in exchange for a years pay and it was even worse here byron knew too much about the job to think that when he came to paraguay he personally was going to be able to shut off the flow of drugs or even to slow it down very much but he thought that he could probably cost the people moving the stuff a lot of money and maybe even send a few of them to the slam hed had some successnothing that was going to see him named dea agent of the year or anything like thatbut enough to know that he was earning his paycheck and making the bad guys hurt a little making them hurt a little was better than not making them hurt at all and that was why he was pissed now that it looked like the goddamn highway police were going to make him miss his plane he was going to buenos aires to see an argentine cop hed met truth being stranger than fiction an irish argentine cop by the name of liam duffy duffys family had gone to argentina at about the same time as grandfather franciss parents had gone to the states duffy was a comandante major in the gendarmeria nacional argentina they wore brown uniforms not blue and looked more like soldiers than cops most of the time they went around carrying mm submachine guns but cops they were and from what timmons had seen far more honest cops than the policia federal that was part of the good thing he had going with liam duffy the other part was that duffy didnt like drug people any more than he did even before he had met duffy timmons had pretty well figured out for himself how the drugs were moved and why there had been briefings in washington of course before they sent him to asuncion but that had been pretty much secondor thirdhand information and he had been briefed when he got to the embassy in asuncion although hed come away from those briefings with the idea that rule one in the suppression of the drug trade was were guests in paraguay so dont piss off the locals it hadnt taken timmons long to understand what was going on paraguay was bordered by brazil bolivia and argentina the drugs came from bolivia where the cultivation of the coca plant was as common as the cultivation of corn in kansas it was refined into cocaine in bolivia some of the refined product went to brazil where some was consumed and some exported most of it went toactually throughparaguay to argentina although there was a substantial and growing market for cocaine in argentinathis explained liam duffys interestmost of the cocaine simply changed hands in argentina the coke then was exported by its new owners through the port of buenos aires near downtown and the international airport ezeiza some twenty kilometers to the southwest the bulk of it going to the united states but a good deal to europe and some even to australia there were some imaginative ways of moving the cocaine a crystalline powder across borders these ranged from packing it in casketsor body cavitiesof the deceased being returned home for burial to putting an ounce or more in a latex condom which was then tied swallowed by a human smuggleror muleand either regurgitated or defecated once across the border unless of course one or more of the condoms were to rupture en routewhich they often didcausing the mule severe toxicitythen death most of the drug however was commonly packed in plastic bags one kilogramtwo point two poundsof cocaine to a package these sometimes were not concealed or disguised at all if the shippers were confident the customs officials at the border had been adequately bribed or the kilo bags were hidden in myriad waysin the tires of cars or trucks for example or packed in a crate with something legitimateoperative word myriad the only way to interdict a worthwhile shipment was to know when it was to be made andor the method of shipment for example that one hundred kilos of cocaine were to be concealed in the spare tires of a scandia eighteenwheeler of the jorge manso e hijos truck line carrying bagged soybeans which would cross the border at a certain crossing on a certain date this information could be obtained most commonly in one of two ways it could be bought the trouble here was that the us government was reluctant to come up with enough money for this purpose and did so only rarely the paraguayan government came up with no money for such a purpose sometimes however there was money as the result of a successful interdictionany money over a reasonable expectation of a truck drivers expenses was considered to be as much contraband as any cocaine foundand this was used the most common source of information however was to take someone who had been apprehended moving drugs and turn him into a snitch the wheels of justice in paraguay set a world standard for slow grinding getting arraigned might take upward of a year the wait for a trial was usually a period longer than that but when the sentence finally came down it was pretty stiff paraguay wanted the world to know it was doing its part in the war on the trafficking of illegal drugs the people who owned the cocainewho arranged its transport through paraguay into argentina and who profited the most from the businessas a rule never rode in the trucks or in the light aircraft that moved it over the border thus they didnt get arrested the most they ever lost was the shipment itself and maybe the transport vehicle so basically not much considering that the cocaineworth a fortune in miami or buenos aires or london or brisbanewas a cheap commodity until it actually got across the argentine border what really burned the bad guysfar better than grabbing a hundred kilos of cocaine every weekwas grabbing the cash after the argentine dealers paid for it in argentina even better grabbing the cocaine and the money that really stung the bastards timmons and duffy were working on this step one was to find out how and when a shipment would be made snitches gave timmons this information step two was to pass it to duffy the gendarmeria nacional had authority all over argentina they could show up at a policia federal roadblock and make sure the federals did their job or they could set up their own roadblocks to grab the cocaine andor turn the couriers into snitches with a little bit of luck timmons and duffy believed they could track the cocaine until it changed hands then grab both the merchandise and the money the dealers in argentina were using to pay for it the problem timmons had with this was getting the information from the snitches to duffy without anyone hearing about it it wasnt much of a secret that the bad guys had taps on both timmonss and duffys telephones the only way for timmons to get the information to duffy without its being compromised and in time for duffy to be able to use it was to personally take it to him which again explained why timmons was heartsick when he saw the highway police roadblock on the road to the airport the information he had gathered with so much effort would be useless unless he could get it to duffy in buenos aires tonight if he missed his flight the next wasnt until tomorrow morning before that plane left the scandia eighteenwheeler of the jorge manso e hijos truck line argentine license plate number dsd which had two hundred onekilo bags of cocaine concealed in bags of soybeans on the second pallet from the top center row rear would be lined up to get on the ferry that would carry it across the rio paraguaythe borderto formosa and all timmonss work over the last seventeen days would be down the toilet what was particularly grating to timmons was that he knew the moment a highway policeman saw the diplomatic plates on his embassy chevrolet trailblazer the vehicle would be waved through the roadblock the highway police had no authority to stop a car with cd plates and no authority of any kind over an accredited diplomat the problem was to actually get up to the highway policemen that had taken a long time almost twenty precious minutes but the line of vehicles moved so that finally the trailblazer had worked its way to where the peugeot van sat with its door open the embassy vehicle with cd plates however didnt get waved through instead two highway policemen approached shit timmons said cesar remained silent behind the wheel timmons angrily took both his diplomatic passport and his diplomatic carneta drivers licensesize plastic sealed card issued by the paraguayan foreign ministry identifying him as an accredited diplomatand hurriedly held them out the window diplomat diplomat he said impatiently please step out of the car senor one of the highway policemen said didnt you hear what i said timmons demanded waving his diplomatic credentials he added dont you know what these are step out of the car please senor one of the highway policemen now pointed the muzzle of his submachine gun at timmons timmons told himself not to lose his temper he got out of the trailblazer please take me to your officer he said politely the muzzle of the submachine gun now directed him to the open door of the panel van he went to it he ducked his head to get inside and as he entered the van he suddenly had the sensation of what felt like a bee sting in his buttocks then everything went black one of the highway policemen pushed his body all the way into the van and the door closed the other highway policeman ordered timmonss driver out from behind the wheel handcuffed him then forced him into the backseat then he got behind the wheel and drove off toward the airport the peugeot panel van followed two nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina august sergeant kensington lieutenant colonel c g castillo said if you say unfuckingbelievable one more time im going to have the sergeant major wash your mouth out with soap sergeant robert kensingtona smallish trim twentyoneyearoldturned from a huge flatscreen television screen mounted on the wall of the sitting room and looked uneasily at lieutenant colonel castillo who was thirtysix blueeyed had a nice thick head of hair and stood a shade over six feet tall and one hundred ninety pounds sergeant major john k davidson who was thirtytwo and a little larger than lieutenant colonel castillo looked at him smiled and said with all possible respect colonel sir the sergeant is right it is unfuckingbelievable hes got you there ace a nondescript man in his late fifties wearing a blue denim shirt and brown corduroy trousers said chuckling unfuckingbelievable fits like a glove his name was edgar delchamps and though technically subordinate to the lieutenant colonel he was not particularly awed by castillo men who have spent more than thirty years in the clandestine service of the central intelligence agency tend not to be awed by thirtysixyearold recently promoted light birds lesters around here someplace castillo said i dont want kensington corrupting him any more than he already has delchamps davidson colonel alfredo munz and sandor tor chuckled munz a blondheaded stocky man in his forties until recently had been the head of side which combines the functions of the argentine versions of the fbi and the cia he was of german heritage and fluent in that language and several others tor a hungarian was director of security for the newspaper budapester tages zeitung before that he had been an inspector of police in budapest and in his youth had done a hitch in the french foreign legion i cannot hear what that woman is saying over all this brilliant repartee eric billy kocian announced indignantly in faintly accented english the managing director and editorinchief of the budapester tages zeitung was a tall man with a full head of silver hair who looked to be in his sixties he was in fact eightytwo years of age delchamps made a megaphone with his hands and called loudly clearly implying that kocian was deaf or senile or both billy it looks like theyve got a little storm in new orleans everybody laughed kocian threw his hands up in disgust and said something obscene and unflattering in hungarian but then the chuckles subsided and they all returned their attention to the television in deference to kocian munz and tor they were watching deutsche welle the german version more or less of fox news it was covering hurricane katrina in the gulf coast of the united states and had just reported with some stunning accompanying video that eighty percent of new orleans was flooded some parts of the port city under twenty feet of water its entire population forced to flee castillo stared at the images of one of americas major cities in complete chaos and at the collection onscreen of talking heads representing local state and federal government officialsall unequivocally with their thumbs up their collective asses while blaming one another for failure after failureand heard himself mutter unfuckingbelievable not much in nuestra pequena casa was what it appeared to be starting with the fact that our little house was in fact a very large house bordering on a mansion it was in the upscale mayerling country club in the buenos aires suburb of pilar it had been rented furnished except for lightbulbs and linen just over three weeks before to a senor paul sieno and his wife susanna the owner believed them to be a nice and affluent young couple from mendoza they had signed a years lease for four thousand us dollars a month with the first and last month due on signing plus another two months up front for a security deposit the sienos had paid the sixteen thousand in cash cash payments of that size are not at all uncommon in argentina where the government taxes every transaction paid by check and where almost no one trusts the banks both el senor y la senora sieno were in fact agents of the central intelligence agency and what they had really been after was a safe house which is usually defined within the intelligence community as a place nobody else knows about where one may hide things and people nuestra pequena casathe owner had named itwas ideal for this purpose the mayerling country club which is several kilometers off the panamericana highway about fifty kilometers north of the center of buenos aires held about one hundred houses very similar to nuestra pequena casa each sat upon about a hectare or about two and a half acres it also held a jack nicklaus golf course five polo fields stables tennis courts and a clubhouse with a dining room that featured a thirtyfoothigh ceiling and half a dozen czechoslovakian crystal chandeliers suspended over a highly polished marble floor the entire country club was surrounded by a ninefoottall fence topped with razor wire and equipped with motionsensing devices when triggered an alarm went off in the edificio de seguridad and floodlights came on where the intrusion had been detected then members of the mayerling security force armed with everything from semiautomatic pistols and shotguns to fully automatic uzis rushed to the scene on foot by auto and in golf carts none of this had anything to do with intelligence espionage or even the trade in illegal drugs but rather with kidnapping the kidnapping of welltodo men their wives offspring parentssometimes even their horses and dogswas argentinas secondlargest cottage industry so the wags said larger than all others except the teaching of the english language just about all of the houses within the mayerling country club were individually fenced on three sides most often by fences concealed in closely packed pine trees they too had motionsensing devices motionsensing devices also prevented anyone from approaching the unfenced front of the houses without being detected nuestra pequena casa was for mayerling not an unusually large house it had six bedrooms all with bath three other toilets with bidets a library a sitting room a dining room a kitchen servants quarters for the housing of four a swimming pool and in the backyard near the pool a quincho a quincho paul sieno explained was much like an american pool house except that it was equipped with a parrillaa woodfired grilland was primarily intended as a place to eat more or less outdoors it was an extremely sturdy structure built solidly of masonry and had a rugged roof of mottled red spanish tiles the front of the quincho had a deep verandah which also was covered by the tile roof and a wall of sliding glass doors that overlooked the pool and backyard and which served as the entrance from the verandah into the main room of the building the group had moved from the big house out to the quincho paul sieno was kneeled down before the parrilla which was built into one wall of the cocina or kitchen he worked with great effortand as yet not much successto get the wood that he had carefully arranged under the heavy black iron grill to catch fire susanna sieno stood behind him leaning against the polished marble countertop to the left of the parrilla handing her husband sheets of newspaper for use as tinder on the countertop beside the stainless steel sink was an impressively large wooden platter piled high with an even more impressively large stack of a dozen lomos each filet mignon hand cut from tenderloins of beef to a thickness of two inches nearby were the makings for side dishes of seasoned potatoes and tossed salad in the adjoining main room of the quincho there was a brandnew flatscreen television mounted on a wall that was identical to the one in nuestra pequena casa the directv dish antenna on the quinchos red tile roof was identical to the one mounted on the big house the television set in the quincho however was hooked to a repeater connected to the directv antenna on the big house this allowed for the antenna on the quincho roof to be aimed at an intelsat satellite in permanent orbit some miles above the earths surfaceand thus to be part of a system that provided the safe house with instant encrypted voice visual and data communication it communicated with similar proprietary devices at the office of homeland security in the nebraska avenue complex in washington dc and ones in what had at one time been the post stockade at fort bragg north carolina and was now the headquarters of delta force and even more clandestine special operations forces most of the group was sitting in teak deck chairs that they had pulled inside from the verandah the tv was now tuned to the englishlanguage cnn not because its nonstop coverage of the disaster that was hurricane katrina was any better than that of deutsche welleit arguably was worsebut because dw was repeating ad nauseam the same footage and interviews the onair talentboth on location and in the various news bureaushad long ago stopped offering any real reporting and had instead resorted to the basic equivalent of a live camera simply airing the obvious and while it was only a matter of time before cnns socalled indepth coverage would begin to loop at least for now the group was seeing and hearing something somewhat different this same dynamic happened during the desert wars lieutenant c g castillo thought with more than a little disgust sticking a camera crew out in the middle of a hot zonewith a clueless commentator someone with no real understanding of whats going on around themis worse than there being no quote reporting unquote at all watching rpg rounds and tracers in a firefightor people looting a flooded food storewithout an educated source on screen to put what youre seeing in context of the big picture only serves to drive the hysteria it damn sure doesnt help someone sitting in the comfort of their living room better understand what the hell is really going on castillo turned from the tv and glanced around the quincho of the people watching cnn three couldand in fact often didpass as argentines they were the sienos who now had the parrilla wood burning and a twentythreeyearold from san antonio texas named ricardo solez who had come to argentina as an agent of the drug enforcement administration all had mastered the porteno accent of a buenos aires native anthony j tony santini a special agent of the us secret service a stocky and somewhat swarthy fortytwoyearold could pass for a porteno until he had to say something whereupon his accent usually gave him away none of the others watching the tv in the quincho even tried to pass themselves off as argentines special agent david w yung of the fbi a thirtytwoyearold of chinese ancestrywho spoke spanish and three other languages none of them orientalfelt that his race made trying to fob himself off as an argentine almost a silly exercise the language skills of various others were rudimentary as colonel jacob d jake torine united states air force put it its as if the moment i get out of the states a neon sign starts flashing over my headamerican throw rocks inspector john j doherty of the fbi understood what torine meant lieutenant colonel castillo had once remarked torine and doherty look like somebody called central casting and said send us an airline pilot and an irish cop neither had taken offense one viewer of what katrina was doing to new orleans and the gulf coast was in a category of his own corporal lester bradley united states marine corps was not quite twenty he appeared to be about seventeen he stood five feet five inches tall and weighed a little under one hundred forty pounds looking at him nowattired in a knit polo shirt khaki trousers and red and gold striped nike sport shoesvery few people would think of associating him with the military at all much less with the elite special operations the truth here was that bradley fresh from parris island boot camp had earned his corporals stripes as a designated marksman with the marines on the march to baghdad on his return to the united states he had been assigned to the usmc guard detachment at the american embassy in buenos aires where he mostly functioned as a clerk typist until the day he had been detailedas the man the gunny felt he could most easily spareto drive a gmc yukon xl to uruguay three days after that bradley found himself part of a hastily organized special operations mission during which he saved the life of thenmajor c g castillo by using a borrowed snipers rifle to take out two of the bad guys with head shots bradley thus had learned too much about a very secret operationand the reasons for said operationfor him to be returned to the care of the gunny who could be counted on to demand a full account of where his young corporal had been and what he had done so bradley next had been aboard the aircraft on which castillo and the body of sergeant first class seymour kranzwho had been killed during the operationreturned to the united states not knowing what to do with bradley back in the states castillo had put him on ice at camp mackall north carolina the special forces training base until he could find a solution camp mackalls sergeant major jack davidson had taken one look at the boyish marine concluded that his assignment to mackall was a practical joke being played on davidson by a marine master gunnery sergeant acquaintance and put him to work pushing the keys on a computer the first that davidson learned of who bradley really wasand that he had saved the life of castillo with whom davidson had been around the block many times most recently in afghanistancame when lieutenant general bruce j mcnab showed up at mackall to arrange for bradley to attend sergeant kranzs funeral at arlington national cemetery davidson had also been around the block several times with general mcnab and several times with mcnab and castillo together he had not been at all bashful to tell the general a that castillos idea that bradley could be hidden at mackall made about as much sense as suggesting a giraffe could be hidden on the white house lawn and b that if charley was doing something interesting it only made sense that sergeant major davidson be assigned to do it with him as the general well knew how prone charley absent the wise counsel of sergeant major davidson was to do things that made large waves and got everybody in trouble and that this was not very likely to be changed just because theyd just made charley a light bird shortly after the final rites of sergeant kranz at arlington national cemetery sergeant major davidson and corporal bradley were en route to buenos aires and shortly after going to nuestra pequena casa while serving as the driver of a renault trafic van corporal bradley found himself participating in an unpleasant firefight in the basement garage of the pilar sheraton hotel and convention center during which he took down one of the bad guys with a model a colt semiautomatic pistol and contributed to the demise of another with the samecaliber weapon following that it was castillos judgment that corporal bradley really deserved to be formally assigned to the office of organizational analysis he called the director of national intelligence who called the secretary of defense who called the secretary of the navy who directed the commandant of the marine corpsjust do it dont ask questionsto issue the appropriate orders top secretpresidential the white house washington dc duplication forbidden copy of secretary cohen july presidential finding it has been found that the assassination of j winslow masterson deputy chief of mission of the united states embassy in buenos aires argentina the abduction of mr mastersons wife mrs elizabeth lorimer masterson the assassination of sergeant roger markham usmc and the attempted assassination of secret service special agent elizabeth t schneider indicate beyond any reasonable doubt the existence of a continuing plot or plots by terrorists or terrorist organizations to cause serious damage to the interests of the united states its diplomatic officers and its citizens and that this situation cannot be tolerated it is further found that the efforts and actions taken and to be taken by the several branches of the united states government to detect and apprehend those individuals who committed the terrorist acts previously described and to prevent similar such acts in the future are being and will be hampered and rendered less effective by strict adherence to applicable laws and regulations it is therefore found that clandestine and covert action under the sole supervision of the president is necessary it is directed and ordered that there immediately be established a clandestine and covert organization with the mission of determining the identity of the terrorists involved in the assassinations abduction and attempted assassination previously described and to render them harmless and to perform such other covert and clandestine activities as the president may elect to assign for purposes of concealment the aforementioned clandestine and covert organization will be known as the office of organizational analysis within the department of homeland security funding will initially be from discretionary funds of the office of the president the manning of the organization will be decided by the president acting on the advice of the chief office of organizational analysis major carlos g castillo special forces us army is herewith appointed chief office of organizational analysis with immediate effect signed president of the united states of america witness natalie g cohen secretary of state top secretpresidential the identification of the bodies in the sheraton garageand of two others shortly thereafter in the conrad resort amp casino in punta del este uruguaypretty well determined the identity of the terrorists and obviously they had been rendered harmless as called for by the finding this accomplishment however did not mean that the office of organizational analysis now could be shut down or that the finding could be filed in the presidential documents not to be declassified for fifty years or that the ooa personnel could be returned whence they had come just about the opposite was true the investigation had been going on in nuestra pequena casa for nearly three weeks to say that no end was in sight was a gross understatement the turning over of the rocks had revealed an astonishing number of ugly worms of interest to the director of national intelligence the department of justice the internal revenue service the department of state and other governmental agencies what we have here isnt an investigation inspector doherty who was on the staff of the director of the fbi and who had given the subject a good deal of thought said very seriously the night before at dinner its an investigation to determine what has to be investigated doherty had reluctantlyanother gross understatementbecome part of the investigation only after the president had personally ordered the fbi director to loan the best man he had to ooa not the senior fbi man who could be most easily spared edgar delchamps of the cia had replied you got it sherlock delchamps too had come to the ooa reluctantly so reluctantly that when transferred from his posting as the cia station chief in paris he had reported to castillo only after he had stopped by cia headquarters in langley virginia to put in for retirement when castillo found out about that it had taken a personal call from the director of national intelligence ambassador charles w montvale to the director of the central intelligence agency to get delchamps to put off his retirement for the time being montvale told the dci that the president had personally ordered that the ooameaning delchampsbe given absolute access to any intelligence the agency had gathered on any subject doherty and delchamps had not at first gotten along both were middleaged and set in their ways dohertys waywhich had seen him rise high in the fbi hierarchywas to scrupulously follow the book never bending much less breaking the law delchamps had spent most of his career operating clandestinely often using a fictitious name there was no book for what he did of course because the clandestine service does notcannotoperate that way so far as delchamps was concerned the end really justified the means yet surprisingly they had become closeeven friendsin recent weeks largely because castillo had decided they were older than everybody but eric kocian they regarded everyone elseincluding castilloas inexperienced youngsters and were agreed that the president had erred in giving castillo the authority he had given him castillo thought they were probably right what doherty the night before had called the investigation to determine what has to be investigated now was just about over castillo and colonel torine had flown the ooas private jeta gulfstream iii registered to the lorimer charitable amp benevolent funddown to argentina to quietly ferry delchamps doherty and some of the othersnot to mention the results of the investigation which now filled one small filing cabinet and a dozen computer external hard drivesback to washington eric kocian and his two dogs would go with them too his notes about the iraqi oil for food scandal had provided keys to much of the information now on the hard drives so far as castillo delchamps and doherty were concerned kocian was going to washington to serve as a sort of living reference library as their investigation moved into the data banks of the fbi the cia and other elements of the intelligence community so far as kocian was concerned however he was going to washington because there was a direct delta airlines flight from washington dulles international airport to budapest it would allow him to take his dogs there was no such flight from buenos aires kocian owned two bouvier des flandres dogs a male named max and a bitch named madchen at one hundredplus pounds max was timeandahalf the size of a large boxer madchen was just a little smaller there always had been a max in kocians life since right after world war ii all of them named max madchen was a recent addition a gift from the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund not necessarily as a pet for kocian but as a companion for max maxs alertness in budapest had warned castillo in time for him to be able to use a suppressed ruger mkiicaliber semiautomatic pistol to render harmless two men who had broken into his hotel room bent on his assassination as castillo later had put itperhaps indelicatelyto edgar delchamps i dont know how things are done in the spook world but in the army when someone saves your ass the least you can do for him is get him laid it had been love at first sight between max and madchen but the playful frolicking of two canines weighing more than two hundred pounds between them had caused some serious damage to the furnishings of nuestra pequena casa although they slept on the floor in kocians bedroom they mostly had been banished to the backyard and to the quincho where they had sort of adopted corporal lester bradley sensing that not only did he like to kick a soccer ball for them but while manning the secure satellite communication device had the time to do so everyone was so used to seeing max madchen and lester together that hardly anyone noticed when lester went to ricardo solez touched his shoulder and pointed to the secure radio solez nodded his understanding that if the radio went off he was to answer the call solez thought that lester and max and madchen were leaving the quincho so that the dogs could meet the call of nature and lester would then kick the soccer ball for them to retrieve both dogs could get a soccer ball in their mouths with no more effort than lesser breeds had with a tennis ball the first person to sense that that had not been corporal bradleys intention was edgar delchamps who happened to glance out of the quincho into the backyard hey ace he called to lieutenant colonel castillo as much as i would like to think the kids playing cops and robbers i dont think so castillo looked at him in confusion then followed delchampss nod toward the backyard corporal bradley holding a model a acp pistol in both hands was marching across the grass by the swimming pool ahead of bradley was a young man in a suit and tie who held his hands locked in the small of his neck max walked on one side of them showing his teeth and madchen on the other showing hers what the hell castillo exclaimed sandor tor with almost amazing grace for his bulk got out of his chair and walked toward the door brushing aside his suit jacket enough to uncover a black sigsauer mm p semiautomatic pistol in a skeleton holster on his belt castillo moved quickly to the drapes gathered at one side of the plateglass window and snatched a mm micro uzi submachine gun from behind them he opened the door as they approached the verandah of the quincho whats up lester he asked corporal bradley did not reply directly on the porch he ordered the man drop to your knees and then get on your stomach on the tiles permission to speak sir the young man in the suit asked i told you to get on your stomach bradley ordered as sternly as he could he did not have much of what is known as a command voice id do what he says pal edgar delchamps suggested conversationally lesters been known to use that and max likes to bite people the young man dropped to his knees then went flat to the tile of the shaded verandah max leaned over him showing his teeth madchen sat on her haunches across from him i apprehended the intruder behind the pine trees sir bradley announced as he was making his way toward the house he was inside the fence castillo asked what happened to the motion detectors he was inside the fence sir bradley said perhaps there is a malfunction of the motiondetecting system tony santini carrying a mini uzi and ricardo solez holding a car came out of the quincho jesus christ pegleg solez exclaimed what the fuck are you doing here right now im laying on my goddamn stomach the young man said you know this guy ricardo castillo asked yes sir solez said castillo waited a moment then asked well hes an assistant military attache at the embassy in asuncion permission to speak sir the man on the tile said see what hes got in his pockets sandor castillo ordered sandor tor bent over the man on the tile took a wallet from his hip pocket and tossed it to castillo then he rolled the man onto his back and went into the pockets of his jacket he came up with an american diplomatic passport and tossed that to castillo castillo examined it sit max he ordered max looked at him head cocked hes probably not a bad guy castillo added after a moment as if he had considered then accepted what castillo had said max sat back on his haunches permission to speak sir the man on the tile said why not castillo said sir i request to see lieutenant colonel costello nobody here by that name castillo said why dont we talk about what the hell youre doing here sir i came to see colonel costello and if this colonel costello was here what were you going to say to him castillo asked i was going to ask him for his help help about what castillo asked but before the man had a chance to open his mouth castillo asked another question you sneaked in here to ask somebody for help sir i didnt know what name you were using for the safe house and even if i did i didnt think you would pass me through the gate to this place so i had to come in surreptitiously son edgar delchamps asked howd you get past the motion sensors on the fence fences plural dry ice sir i froze the mercury switches whered you get the dry ice i bought it from a kid who delivers ice cream on a motorbike from the freddos ice cream store in the shopping mall and whered you learn to use dry ice on mercury switches fort huachuca sir he pronounced that correctly castillo thought wahchookuh what were you doing at huachuca delchamps challenged going through the intelligence school youre an army intelligence officer yes sir first lieutenant edmund lorimer sir lorimer castillo said your name is lorimer yes sir same as that un guy who got himself whacked in uruguay your witness colonel delchamps said gesturing grandly youre colonel costello lorimer asked for the time being ill ask the questions castillo snapped and was immediately sorry you may get up lieutenant lorimer thank you sir you can put the away bradley castillo said he added but good job lester thank you sir the credit is due max he either detected unusual movement in the pines or perhaps smelled him take them inside the quincho tell them good dog and give them each a bone yes sir sir when max has too many bonesand hes already had several todayhe suffers flatulence use your good judgment lester yes sir thank you sir castillo had been watching lorimer out of the corner of his eye idly wondering why he was getting to his feet slowly and carefully he saw that lorimer was smiling at bradley probably at the word flatulence lorimers eyes met castillos for a moment and when lorimer was halfsitting on the table there castillo saw what had caused him to get to his feet so slowly and carefully and why ricardo had called him pegleg lorimers right trouser leg had been pulled up rising from his stockinged ankle was a dully shining metal tube titanium castillo thought they now make those things out of titanium how do i know that what happened to your leg castillo asked gently rpg lorimer said where afghanistan we got bushwhacked on the way to mazar on highway a castillo knew well the mazar airfieldand for that matter highway a the road to it from kabul the next to last time he had been there he had borrowed a black hawk helicopter to make an extraction of the crew of another black hawk that had been shot down far senior officers had reluctantly concluded that the weather was so bad that making such an attempt would have been suicidal the last time hed been at mazar was to board a usaf c galaxy for the states which carried him home with a vaguely phrased letter of reprimand for knowingly and flagrantly violating flight safety rules the letter of reprimand was the compromise reached between several very senior officers who wished to recommend him for the distinguished service crossor perhaps even the medaland other very senior officers who wished to bring the crazy special forces sonofabitch before a general courtmartial for willful disobedience of orders how far up does that thing go castillo asked to the knee actually the knees part of it all titanium what were you doing in afghanistan i thought i was winning their hearts and minds until this happened you were special forces lorimer nodded was now im intelligence dia how did that happen well for a while i thought i could do a freddy franks but that didnt work general frederick m franks jr then an army major lost a leg to wounds suffered in the cambodian incursion during the vietnam war he managed to stay in the army by proving he could pass any physical test required of any officer he became both the first onelegged general since the civil war and as a fourstar general the commander of ground forces in the first desert war franks served as an inspiration to allparticularly to amputees why not it hurt too much okay who told you about this place castillo asked i asked around sir i asked who lieutenant castillo looked at ricardo solez who proclaimed his innocence by shaking his head and wagging both hands palms outward lorimer said a lot people sir i just put it together among them solez he was one of them but he wouldnt tell me anything but hes how i found out where you were castillo glanced at solez who motioned to maintain his innocence then looked back at lorimer he told you where we were castillo said lorimer shook his head i followed him and that kid with the out here from the embassy solez and bradley who had been posted to the embassy before they had been drafted by castillo had been assigned to make dailysometimes twicedailyerrand runs from nuestra pequena casa to the embassy specifically and to buenos aires generally the theory was they were familiar faces and would attract the least attention castillo looked at solez whose face now showed pain castillo was tempted to let it go but changed his mind getting followed was inexcusable no rearview mirrors on the trafic right ricardo castillo asked jesus christ carlos im sorry his embarrassmentshamewas clear in his voice hes pretty good colonel lorimer said he led me up and down every back street between here and palermo but youre better right yes sir i guess i am okay so youre here why a friend of mine a dea agent got kidnapped about a week ago i need some help to get him back i figured you were the guy who could help maybe the only one lorimer said why would you think that because you got the bad guys who kidnapped jack the stacks wife and whacked him what if i told you i have no idea what youre talking about sir i would expect you to say just that lorimer said but sir with respect you better get used to the idea that the cats out of the bag i even heard of what went down and im pretty low down on the pay scale and in paraguay castillo looked at delchamps write this down ace delchamps said theres no such thing as a secret oh shit castillo said and shook his head then he turned to lorimer lieutenant lorimer i am lieutenant colonel c g castillo special forces us army yes sir i inform you herewith that i am here operating on the authority of a presidential finding yes sir close your mouth until im finished lieutenant you are advised herewith that each and every aspect of this operation is classified top secret presidential from this moment on you will not discuss with anyone what you think you may have learned or what you think you may have surmised about anything connected with this operation that includes the names of personnel and the location of personnel or facilities and what i or anyone connected with this operation may or may not have done any breach of these instructions will result in your trial by general courtmartialat which trust me you will be found guiltyand being placed in solitary confinement at probably leavenworth until the details of this operation are no longer of interest to anyone you run off at the mouth and youll wish the rpg had got all of you got it yes sir hes got it his face is white and i feel like a shit you heard what he said ace about the cat being out of the bag delchamps asked but it sounded to castillo like a statement edgar butt out castillo said i was thinking about collateral damage delchamps said whos he been talking to which of them has been running at the mouth what are you going to do about shutting them up there i go again underestimating delchamps lets go to the house castillo said gesturing you ed and tony andsomebody go inside and get sieno which one colonel davidson asked both of them castillo ordered and jack sit on lieutenant lorimer here if he even looks like hes thinking of taking off shoot him in his good leg there were two suites of rooms on the second floor of nuestra pequena casa each containing a large bedroom a walkincloset and a bathroom the sienos occupied the larger of the two castillo had taken the slightly smaller one for himself castillos bedroom had one chairat a dressing tableand a chaise lounge susanna sienoa trim palefreckledskin redhead who did not look like what came to mind when an officer of the clandestine service of the cia was saidtook the dressing table chair delchamps and paul sieno sat side by side on the chaise lounge solez wordlessly asked permission to sit on the edge of the bed when castillo nodded and he had tony santini sat beside solez castillo leaned against the wall by the door and after a moment said the word that comes to mind is compromisedgoddammit it happens ace delchamps said okay we shut down we were going to the states anyway in a couple of days now we go now there were nods of agreement id love to know how this happened castillo said id say uruguay susanna sieno said castillo looked at her then made a come on gesture the ok corral shootout took place there she explained and you jerked dave yung and julio artigas out of the embassy which was sure to cause gossip in the embassy and then they found howard kennedys body in the conrad in punta del este whats that got to with this lieutenant lorimer in paraguay castillo interrupted the spooks and the cops in asuncion find a lot of reasons to quote confer close quote with the spooks and the cops in montevideo she said like the dentists who go to hawaii for two weeks all taxdeductible to confer for two hours on how to drill a molar with caries delchamps chuckled im not sure i understand castillo said i think susanna is onto it ace delchamps said ill put it in soldier terms for you you know what r ampr is right castillo nodded rest and recuperation sometimes known as i amp i for intercourse and intoxication delchamps went on and we know how every second lieutenant is required to memorize if indiscretions you must have have them a hundred miles from the flagpole castillo smiled okay i dont know anything about this of course susanna sieno said but my husband who as far as i know never lies to me says that healthy young men not lucky enough to be accompanied by their wives on an assignment to someplace like asuncion have unsatisfied physical desires when you were in short pants ace and i was in moscow delchamps said i used to confer with my professional associates in vienna every couple of months it wasnt smart to accept the female companionship offered to horny young spooks by the kgb in moscow getting the picture or do i have to be more graphic and make you blush im getting the picture castillo said so try this scenario on for size susanna sieno said agent x of the firm or the dia or the dea or the fbi checks in with his peers at the embassy in montevideo this satisfies the requirements of his temporaryduty orders he spends an hour in the embassy and then its off to the sandy beaches and the bikiniclad maidens of punta del este so agent x asks well whats new willy and willy says nothing much here but you heard about jack the stack masterson getting whacked in front of his wife in buenos aires and agent x says yeah what was that all about and willy says god only knows but whats interesting is that a washington hotshoti dont know this but i heard that hes an army officer sent by the presidenthas taken over the investigation so agent x goes back to asuncion and tells this interesting story to the boys and then agent y goes on r ampr to montevideo willy tell me about jack the stacks murder and the hotshot to which willy replies i dont know much but its getting interesting first dave yung one the fbi guys gets jerked out of here and onto a plane for washington no explanation and then two days ago right after yung mysteriously disappeared they find an american who worked for the un and six guys all dressed like ninjas all dead at an estancia namedwould you believe itshangrila nobody has a clue what that was all about so agent y his physical desires satisfied goes back to asuncion and tells his pal agent z what he heard in montevideo agent z then takes his r ampr in montevideo where he asks willyor tom dick and harrytell me more about the six dead ninjas and the un guy curiouser and curiouser hes told turns out the dead american was a drug dealer and jack the stacks brotherinlaw theres a very interesting rumor that a special operations team probably run by the hotshothes an army officer by the name of costello we found that outwhacked the ninjas and maybe also the drug guyhis name was lorimerand then they jerked another fbi guy artigas out of here no explanation susanna paused end of scenario she said after a moment good scenario castillo said these are all bright clever guys charley she said trained investigators with diarrhea of the mouth castillo said nobody told them all this was top secret presidential sieno said call it shop talk no excuse castillo said it wasnt as if they were running off at the mouth in a bar delchamps said these guys were swapping gossip with people they knew had the same security clearances they did arguably their sharing of such information could hold a kernel that would prove to be a missing piece of a puzzle they were working one they otherwise would not have had thats not an excuse ed and you know it castillo said i didnt say it was right ace i said i think it explains what happened i think susannas right on the money and it explains the young man with the titanium leg coming here his pal got snatched and now hes desperate i didnt hear about that susanna said what he said was his pal a dea agent was snatched a week ago delchamps explained and though he didnt say this ill bet nobody in paraguay is doing anything at all to get him back that might annoy the host government in any way so he came looking for john wayne here so the question then becomes what do we do about it about getting the dea guy back delchamps asked the dea guy is not my problem castillo said no hes not delchamps said write that down castillo flashed him a cold look meaning what meaning for a moment there ace i thought you were starting to think you really are john wayne flitting around the world righting wrongs delchamps said my primary concern is making sure this operation isnt compromised any more than it already is castillo said how are you going to do that well first were going to get out of here theres no reason we cant move it to the nebraska avenue complex or is there delchamps shook his head the sienos tony and alex darby will be here plus bob howell in montevideo delchamps said they can handle anything that comes up with regard to this he gestured in the direction of the quincho castillo nodded darby was the cia station chief in buenos aires and howell his counterpart in montevideo but what are you going to do about the guy downstairs tony santini asked you cant trust him to keep his mouth shut particularly since charleys not going to rescue his pal from the bad guys susanna said he goes with us castillo said unless somebodys got a better idea tony who do you know in the embassy in asuncion delchamps asked ive been up there of course santini said but i dont have any pals there if thats what youre asking youre not alone susanna said castillo and delchamps looked at her when she didnt respond delchamps asked whos the station chief his name is white paul sieno said robert j white delchamps looked thoughtful a moment then shook his head susanna said he cant understand why someone like himself who has kissed all the appropriate buttocks in langley for years gets assigned to asuncion when troublemakers like paul and alex and me got to go to buenos aires what about the military attache castillo asked he and the station chief are great pals santini said i dont think talking to them would work charley and i dont want to go to the ambassador there or involve silvio any more than i already have castillo said almost thoughtfully if this thing blows up in our faces the less he knows the better juan manuel silvio was the united states ambassador to argentina he had put his career at risk to help castillo to carry out the presidential finding so delchamps asked so i guess i have to go to the other ambassador the other ambassador was the honorable charles w montvale the former deputy secretary of state former secretary of the treasury and former ambassador to the european union and now the director of national intelligence castillo shook his head and said i now know how lee felt at appomattox court house when he said i would rather face a thousand deaths but now i must go and treat with general grant is he really that bad charley susanna asked right now susie i feel like a small white mouse about to be put into the cobras cage castillo said he pushed himself away from the wall walked to the bed and gestured to solez to give up his seat you want some privacy ace delchamps said no i want everybody to hear this castillo said sat down on the bed and punched the speaker phone button on what looked like an ordinary telephone corporal bradley speaking sir lesters voice came over the speaker is the local secure led lit lester yes sir get major miller on here secure aye aye sir ten seconds later a male voice came very clearly over the speaker and how are things down in buenos aires on this miserable blistering humid afternoon in our beloved nations capital verify secure bradleys voice piped ah the pride of the marine corps the little green light is glowing brightly lester colonel the line is secure i believe major miller is the party answering thank you bradley castillo said hey dick a sus ordenes mi coronel miller said get agnes on an extension and then patch me through secure to the white house i dont like the tone of your voice miller said seriously hold one charley twenty seconds later a female voice announced white house you on agnes castillo asked uhhuh mrs agnes forbison the deputy chief for administration of the office of organizational analysis said you and dick stay on the line castillo said dont record or take notes but pay attention why do i think i know what youre going to say next agnes forbison asked white house the female operator repeated youre prescient agnes castillo said and then operator this is colonel castillo will you get me ambassador montvale on a secure line please hold one colonel it may take a moment hes in the mountains with the boss oh shit ten seconds later a male voice came on ambassador montvales line colonel castillo for ambassador montvale the white house operator said the line is secure the ambassador is with the president im not sure he can be disturbed is that mr ellsworth castillo asked truman c ellsworth had risen high in government service as ambassador montvales trusted deputy he was not an admirer of lieutenant colonel castillo whom he viewed as a threat to montvale good afternoon colonel ellsworth said in his somewhat nasal voice i have to speak to the ambassador your call mr ellsworth as to if he can be interrupted when hes with the president there was no reply but in five seconds another male voice one somewhat impatient came over the speakers yes ellsworth you sonofabitch this is castillo mr president sorry to bother you sir i was trying to get the ambassador my line rang the president said and then corrected himself flashed how are you charley very well thank you sir youre in argentina right yes sir what kind of television do you get down there weve been watching fox and deutsche welle mr president so you know whats going on in new orleans and along the gulf coast yes sir were watching hard to believe isnt it unfuckingbelievable sir yes mr president it is i want to see you as soon as you get back up here charley when is that going to be probably late tomorrow sir okay ill see you then unless im down there overseeing this disaster you find me either way yes sir charles castillo heard the president say its charley for you ambassador montvale came on the line a moment later good to hear from you colonel he said what can i do for you buy mr ellsworth a new pair of glasses excuse me i can think of no reason but fuzzy eyesight for his pushing the presidents button when he knew i wanted to talk to you can you im sure that it was inadvertent oh me too castillo said sarcastically i cant imagine him doing it on purpose hoping it would cause the president to be annoyed with me it just has to be his glasses what can i do for you charley montvale asked his annoyance clear in his voice theres a risk of compromise down here that i want to stop before it goes any further at this late date yes sir what needs to be done two things first please call the station chief in paraguay and tell him that alex darby is coming to see him and will speak with your authority my authority about what to tell his people to stop guessing between them what happened in uruguay and here and stop talking about it period should i call the ambassador there lets leave him out of it if we can your call but forewarned is forearmed as you know and then call fort meade and have the dia immediately transfer first lieutenant edmund lorimer an assistant military attache at the embassy in asuncion to ooa whats that about he was clever enough to learn my name and find the safe house i dont want to leave him here a troublemaker in other words mr ambassador hes done nothing but what i would have done in his shoes why dont i find that comforting do you suppose castillo ignored the response were shutting down here castillo went on just to be safe were just about finished here anyway we ought to be in washington sometime late tomorrow im going to bring lorimer with us come see me when you get here yes sir of course ill get right on this thank you sir castillo waited until the white house operator detecting that the telephone in camp david had been hung up asked are you through colonel break it down please thank you castillo said and then after a moment you heard that agnes dick why do i think mr ellsworth doesnt like you agnes asked with a little bit of luck i can stop this before it gets any worse castillo said but i wanted you to have a headsup if it goes wrong ill give you a call when were a couple hours out of baltimore were going to need three yukons theyll be there agnes said where do we live now dick i was about to call you about that miller said you know west boulevard drive in alexandria maybe i think so agnes knows a real estate guy and he put her onto a place at west boulevard drive an old couple lived there she died and then a month later three months ago he did their kids didnt want it and they want the money quick they went through it and took out the valuable stuff but whats left is nice and the house youll like everything about it but the price boss agnes said which is how much and why will i like it right now you are renting it furnished for ten thousand a month with an option to buy at with the furniture and i dont really know how much without done deal you told dick to get you out of the monica lewinsky motel right now and yesterday would be better yeah its a done deal i gave them a check two hours ago agnes said on my account i hope i dont want the lorimer benevolent amp charitable trust involved in this youre paying for it agnes said but on that subject we just got confirmation of that substantial deposit to the trust weve been expecting well presuming we can keep that a secret thats good news can i go to this place straight from the airport and can i stash lieutenant lorimer there until i figure out what to do with him you can go there from the airport agnes said but theres no sheets or towels food etcetera and yes you can take somebody there six bedrooms six baths and its off the road nobody can look into the windows from the street i told them to get a radio in there tomorrow but it will probably be a couple of days before you have a secure white house telephone dick can you get our stuff out of the mayflower and over there before i get there and stop by sams club or someplace and buy sheets etcetera and food charge that to the trust yes sir colonel sir dare i to presume that was an invitation to share your new quarters yeah but no guests of the opposite sex above the first floor castillo said we are going to be paragons of virtue in our new home agnes laughed that ill have to see she said castillo had a new thought whos going to take care of this place thats another problem im working on agnes said youre going to need a housekeeper and a yardman at least dick said maybe we could put an ad in the army times and see if we could find a retired sergeant and his wife maybe theyd have security clearances what would i do without you agnes i shudder to consider the possibility she said unless youve got something else well see you tomorrow castillo said cant think of anything that wont wait she said when it became evident that miller wasnt going to say anything castillo ordered break it down lester aye aye sir castillo hung up the phone okay he said in the immortal words of general george s patton lets saddle up and get this show on the road i dont think patton said that ace edgar delchamps said if he didnt he should have castillo said what about the steaks susanna sieno said fire should be ready about now paul sieno added castillo considered that a moment then said good idea susanna an army marches on its stomach i dont know if patton said that or not and i dont careim hungry lets eat ii one degrees north latitude degrees west longitude over the gulf of mexico september they had gone wheelsup at jorge newbery airport in buenos aires a few minutes after six that morning theyd flown diagonally across south america to quito ecuador where they had taken on fuel and had lunch from quito theyd flown north passing over panama into the gulf of mexico skirted around the western tip of cuba and then flown almost straight north to the panhandle of florida the flight plan they filed gave hurlburt field near destin florida as their destination hurlburt was headquarters of the air force special operations command far fewer questions jake torine had suggested would be asked there than anywhere else and even if questions were asked hurlburt had instant communication with the special operations command at macdill air force base in tampa florida where they could be quicklyand as important quietlyanswered it now looked as if that logical plan wasnt going to work aircraft calling hurlburt approach control this is eglin approach uhoh castillo said and then triggering his mike replied eglin approach control gulfstream three seven nine gulfstream three seven nine be advised that hurlburt field is closed to all traffic acknowledge jake torine made an impatient gesture for castillo to take control of the airplane eglin three seven nine this aircraft is in the service of the united states government colonel jacob torine usaf is pilot in command we wish to land at hurlburt sir katrina knocked hurlburt out castillo and torine exchanged what the hell glances okay torine replied turning on transponder at this time we are approximately a hundred miles south of your station let me know when you have us fifteen seconds later eglin approach control reported three seven nine i have you at flight level knots approximately nine five miles south okay eglin approach give me approach and landing please three seven nine be advised that eglin is closed to all but emergency traffic son did you hear what i said about this aircraft being in government service yes sir do you wish to declare an emergency at this time castillo triggered his microphone eglin he said is cairns army airfield open three seven nine i believe cairns is open but be advised it is closed to civilian traffic thank you eglin castillo said three seven nine is not repeat not declaring an emergency at this time he turned to torine jake if youll take it and steer about thirtyfive degrees ill see if i can find the approach charts to cairns i gather first officer that you have been to this place before once or twice pilot in command sir castillo said as he began rummaging through his jeppesen case thirteen years earlier i base operations cairns army airfield the army aviation center fort rucker alabama february lieutenant colonel f mason edmonds aviationa startingtogetalittlechubby thirtynineyearold who sported a bushy mustachestood behind one of the double plateglass doors of base operations looking out at the airfield on the wall behind him was an oil portrait of major general bogardus s cairns for whom the airfield was named general cairns a west pointer and at the time the commanding general of fort rucker had crashed to his death in an h sioux helicopter on december there was an unpleasant story that the crash had been due to general cairnss failure to turn on his aircrafts pitot heat true or not colonel edmonds did not like the story it tended to detract from the positive image of army aviation and colonel edmonds considered himself to be probably the most important guardian of that image he was the information officer of the army aviation center and fort rucker alabama a year before the fact that colonel edmonds had been granted a bachelor of fine arts degree in journalism by temple university had come to light when personnel officers in the pentagon were reviewing his records to see what could be done with him now that some sort of unpronounceable innerear malady had caused him to fail his annual flight physical examination and he could no longer be assigned to flight duty finding a round peg for the round hole had pleased both the personnel officers and colonel edmonds he had been afraid now that he was grounded that he would be assigned to some maintenance billet or some supply billet or wind up in some other nothing assignment like dependent housing officer being the information officer for the army aviation center and fort rucker was a horse of an entirely different hue he had always believed he had a flair for journalism and the written word and had often wondered if he had made the right decision in staying in the army after his compulsoryafterrotc fiveyear initial tour he could have gotten out and tried his hand as a journalist or perhaps even as a novelist his experience since hed become the io had confirmed his opinion of his ability as a journalist surprising most his staffmade up of half civilian half militaryinstead of just sitting behind his desk supervising things and reviewing press releases to make sure they reflected well on army aviation he had gotten right down to his new profession and gotten his hands dirty that was to say he took it upon himself to write some of the stories that would be published in the army flier the base newspaper or sent out as press releases only the important stories of course not the runofthemill pieces he was on such a yarn today one that he intended to run on page one of the army flier and one he was reasonably sure would be printed in newspapers across the land in his judgment it had just the right mixture of human interest military history and a little good oldfashioned emotion and of course it could not help but burnish the image of army aviation and indeed the army itself a sergeant walked up to him sir edmonds turned to look at him and nodded colonel that mohawk youve been looking for just turned on final and it will park on the tarmac here yes sir its a blue flight aircraft colonel they always park here thank you sergeant yes sir blue flight was the name assigned to a special function of the aviation schools flight training program if for example it was determined for some reason that a nonflying fieldgrade officersometimes a major most often a lieutenant colonelneeded to learn how to fly he was sent to rucker and assigned to blue flight heor she as the case might bewas then subjected to what amounted to a cram course in flying this was not to suggest that the course of instruction was less thorough in any way than the regular flight training programs of the aviation school if anything blue flight instructionthe best instructors were assigned temporarily to blue flight as neededmight just be a little better than that offered by the school as colonel edmonds thought of it there were several factors driving the philosophy of blue flight instruction high among them was the realization that it was in the armys interest to send a senior officer student back as a fully qualified pilot to whatever assignment had necessitated that he or she become a pilot as quickly as possible further if the army felt an officer in midcareer needed to be a pilot it made little sense to send them to rucker only to have them fail the course of instruction with this in mind blue flight students were tutored rather than simply taught it was in the armys interest that they earn their wings while most blue flight students were majors or lieutenant colonels there were exceptions at both ends of the rank hierarchy most of these officers were colonels but there wasfar less commonlythe occasional captain or even lieutenant in the case of the junior officers they were most often aidesdecamp to general officers who were already qualified rotarywing aviators they were assigned to blue flight for transition into fixedwing aircraft it made sense to have an aidedecamp who could fly his general in both a helicopter and in the c huron a twin turboprop used to fly senior officers around huron was the armys name for the beechcraft super king air it annoyed colonel edmonds that army aviators almost invariably called the aircraft the king air rather than the huron but he couldnt do much about it except ensure that the term king air never appeared in news stories emanating from his office such a junior officerthis one a lieutenant a general officers aidedecamp sent to blue flight for transition training into the c huronwas to be the subject of the story colonel edmonds planned to write today colonel edmonds was more than a little annoyed that he had had to dig up the story himself he should have been told not have had to hear a rumor and then run down the rumor he had happened to mention this to the post commander when he suggested to the general that if he were to release a photograph of the general standing together with the lieutenant before a building named for the lieutenants father it would more than likely be printed widely and reflect well upon army aviation and the army itself two months before colonel edmonds had thought he was onto another story one just as good perhaps as the one he was onto today that one however hadnt worked out what had happened was that colonel edmonds had seen a familiar name on the bronze dedicatory plaque of the building he had inquired of brigadier general harold f wilson deputy commander of the army aviation center and fort rucker if there was any connection between himself and second lieutenant h f wilson whose name was on the dedicatory plaque it had been too much to hope for and asking general wilson had been a mistake colonel i have been asked that question many times before the general had said i will tell you what i have told everyone else whos asked it dont ask it again and whenever you hear that rumor someplace else repeat this conversation of ours obviously general wilson himself a highly decorated army aviator was anxious not to bask in the reflected glory of another hero who happened to have a similar name with that encounter with general wilson in mindand knowing the odds were that general wilson would not be enthusiastic about what he had in mindcolonel edmonds had taken his idea directly to major general charles m augustus jr the commanding general of the army aviation center and fort rucker general augustus not very enthusiastically agreed that it was a good idea and told edmonds to set it up but he didnt respond to edmondss complaint that he had not been advised as he should have been that the lieutenant was a member of blue flight edmonds further suspected that the blue flight people were either unaware of what the lieutenant was doing or didnt care when he called blue flight to ask that the lieutenant be directed to report to him at his office in class a uniform at they said that might be a little difficult as the lieutenant was involved in a crosscountry training flight in the mohawk under simulated instrument conditions and that he might be back at cairns a little before noon and then again he might not no telling like the c huron the grumman mohawk also was a twinturboprop aircraft but not a light transport designed to move senior officers in comfort from one place to another it was instead designed as an electronic surveillance aircraft normally assigned to military intelligence units the only people it carried were its two pilots the military intelligence connection gave it a certain elan with army aviators as did the fact that it was the fastest airplane in the inventory the pilots assigned to fly it were most often the more experienced ones so edmonds concluded there was something extraordinary in a lieutenant being trained by blue flight to fly the mohawk the only thing colonel edmonds could think of to explain the situation was that they might be using the mohawk as an instrument flight training aircraft yet when he really thought some more about that it didnt make sense he looked up at the sky and saw a tripletailed mohawk approaching and he followed it through touchdown until he lost sight of it and then suddenly there it was taxiing up to the tarmac in front of base ops he remembered only then that it was said of the mohawk that it could land on a dime this was accomplished by reversing the propellers pitch at the instant of touchdownor a split second before ground handlers laid ladders against the mohawks bulbous cockpit the two men in the aircraft unbuckled their harnesses and climbed down and then started walking toward base operations one of them was an older man and the otherlogically the lieutenant whom edmonds was looking forwas much younger as they came closer colonel edmonds had doubts that this was the officer he was looking for he was a tall fairskinned blueeyed young man who didnt look as if his name was carlos guillermo castillo one would expect someone with a name like that to have a darker skin and more than likely dark eyes edmonds now saw the older man was chief warrant officer pete kowalski who was not only a master army aviator but vice president of the instrument examiner board edmonds was surprised that kowalski was teaching a lowly lieutenant both saluted colonel edmonds as they got close to where he stood by the base ops door lieutenant castillo colonel edmonds asked castillo stopped and said yes sir maybe this isnt the right castillo its not that unusual a name carlos guillermo castillo edmonds challenged yes sir lieutenant im colonel edmonds the information officer between now and we have to get you into a class a uniform and out to the castillo classroom building on the post sir where you will be photographed with the commanding general standing by the building named after your father edmonds explained sir with respect whats this all about im reasonably confident that the photograph will shortly appear in several hundred newspapers across the country colonel im special forces castillo said we try to keep our pictures out of the newspapers edmonds thought what does he mean hes special forces hes a pilot hes aviation he may be assigned to support special forces but hes aviation be that as it may lieutenant edmonds said you will be photographed with the commanding general at the castillo building at yes sir do you have a car here yes sir well in that case i will follow you to your boq but in case we become separated which boq is it sir im in the daleville inn the daleville inn was a motel in a village crammed with gasoline stations fastfood emporiums hock shops trailer parks and usedcar lots it lay between cairns army airfield and fort rucker youre not in a boq why not sir i thought i would have a quieter place to study if i were in the daleville inn than i would in a boq when i went through chopper school here the boqs were a little noisy but isnt that a little expensive yes sir it is edmonds shook his head in amazement then said well lets get going mr kowalski what do i do lieutenant castillo asked im between two masters lieutenant cwo kowalski said smiling you being a west pointer im surprised nobody told you that you always obey the last order you got from a senior officer you go get your picture taken with the general thank you castillo said call me when youve had your picture taken and well go flying again kowalski said ill take care of the paperwork here and did i pass the check ride well im reasonably sure that after another couple of hoursif you dont do something really stupidi will feel confident in certifying you as competent to fly the mohawk on instruments colonel edmonds was a pilot he knew what the translation of that was castillo had passedwithout questionhis check ride otherwise instructor pilot kowalski would not have said what he did what the two of them were going to do later was take the mohawk for a ride play with it maybe fly down to panama city florida and fly over the beach practicing visual observation or maybe do some aerobatics would you like to come in sir while i shower and change lieutenant castillo asked when they had reached the daleville inn thank you edmonds said hes a west pointer he will have an immaculate class a uniform hanging in his closet and he will probably shave again when he showers but there is no sense taking a chance lieutenant castillo did not have a motel room he had a threeroom suite a living room with a bar a bedroom and a smaller second bedroom that had been turned into an office by shoving the bed in there against a wall and moving in a desk i dont know what this is costing him but whatever it is its a hell of a lot more than his per diem allowance if he somehow managed to get permission to live off post and is getting per diem and why dont i believe him when he said he moved in here to have a quiet place to study probably because there are half a dozen assorted halfempty liquor bottles on the bar and a beer case on the floor behind it hes spending all this money to have a place to entertain members of the opposite sex theyve been cracking down on that sort of thing in the boqs well why not hes young and the hormones are raging when castillo went into the bedroom to shower and change colonel edmonds looked around the living room on a shelf under the coffee table he saw a newspaper and pulled it out it was a german newspaper what the hell is that doing here maybe hes studying german i read somewhere that special forces officers are supposed to have or acquire a second language that would explain the german newspaper but it doesnt explain what he said about his branch being special forces not aviation what in the hell was that all about when lieutenant castillo appeared ten minutes later freshly shaven and in a class a uniform colonel edmonds was glad that he had accompanied him to his room while technically there was nothing wrong with the uniformit was crisply pressed and well fittingit left a good deal to be desired the only insignia on it were the lieutenants silver bars on the epaulets the us and aviation insignias on the lapels and the aviators wings on the breast there were no ribbons indicating awards for valor or campaigns and there was no unit insignia sewn to the shoulder two questions lieutenant colonel edmonds said first didnt you tell me you were special forces and not aviation i ask because you are wearing aviation branch insignia yes sir excuse me yes sir im special forces but wearing aviation insignia sir with all respect if im wearing aviation insignia no one will connect me with special forces colonel edmonds considered that then said question two where is the rest of your insignia i was informed you are assigned to the special warfare center at fort bragg arent you supposed to be wearing the third army shoulder insignia sir at bragg i wear the special forces shoulder insignia and the special warfare center insignia on my blaze on your what the embroidered patch worn on the green beret sir were under dcsops not third army sir lieutenant i dont know what youre up to here but i dont have time to play games do you have a tunic to which is affixed all the insignia and decorations to which you are entitled yes sir then go put it on sir permission to speak granted colonel edmonds snapped sir as i tried to tell the colonel before were supposed to maintain a low profile that is what im trying to do sir go put on your tunic and every last item of uniform to which you are entitled lieutenant yes sir in five minutes lieutenant castillo returned he now was wearing both aviators and parachutists wings and a combat infantrymans badge was pinned above both he had three rows of ribbons on his breast among which colonel edmonds recognized the distinguished flying cross the bronze star medal with v device signifying it had been awarded for valor in combat and the purple heart medal with one oakleaf cluster the silver aiguillette of an aidedecamp hung from his epaulet and on his lapels were the onestarred shields reflecting that he was an aidedecamp to a brigadier general he had a green beret on his head and his trousers were bloused around highly polished parachutists jump boots colonel edmonds had a sudden unpleasant thought which he quickly suppressed jesus christ is he entitled to all that stuff of course he is hes a west pointer he wouldnt wear anything to which he was not entitled much better lieutenant colonel edmonds said and now wed better get going we dont want to keep the general waiting do we the story appeared on the front page of the army flier two days later which was a friday it included a photograph of lieutenant castillo and the fort rucker commander standing as if reading what was cast into a bronze plaque mounted on the wall beside the main door to the wojg jorge a castillo classroom building of

shrapnel wounds the hud in which he died was the fourth helicopter he flew during this period the others having been rendered unairworthy by enemy fire his sadly prophetic last words were to his

room the daleville inn daleville alabama february the door to room was opened by a sixfoottwo twohundredtwentypound very black young man in a gray tattered west point sweatshirt he was holding a bottle of coors beer and looking visibly surprised to see two crisply uniformed officersone of them a brigadier generalstanding outside the door may i help the general sir he asked after a moments hesitation dick were looking for lieutenant castillo the other officer a captain wearing aidedecamps insignia said he could have been the generals son both were tall slim and erect the generals hair was starting to gray but that was really the only significant physical difference between them hes in the shower the huge young black man said you know each other the general asked yes sir we were at the point together the captain said id really like to see lieutenant castillo the general said to the huge young black man yes sir he replied and opening the door all the way added would the general like to come in sir im sure he wont be long thank you the general said and entered the motel suite general wilson the captain said this is lieutenant h richard miller jr how do you do lieutenant general wilson said youre dick millers son yes sir tom general miller and i toured scenic panama together a couple of years ago wilson said then asked miller how is your dad happy sir he just got his second star i saw that please pass on my regards yes sir ill do that youre assigned here are you yes sir i just started apache school meaning you were one of the top three in your basic flight course congratulations your father must be proud of you actually sir as the general probably already knows my father is not at all sure army aviation is here to stay yes i know wilson said smiling hes mentioned that once or twice miller held up his bottle of beer sir would it be appropriate for me to offer the general a beer or something stronger he immediately saw on the captains face that it was not appropriate after a moments hesitation however the general said i would really like a drink if thats possible miller then saw genuine surprise on the captains face very possible sir miller said he gestured at a wet bar would the general prefer bourbon or scotch or gin scotch would do nicely wilson said neat yes sir you can have one too tom wilson added and i would feel better if you did yes sir thank you sir the same dick please lieutenant c g castillo wearing only a towel came into the living room as general wilson was about to take a sip of his scotch wilson looked at him for a long moment then took a healthy swallow sir miller said this is lieutenant c g castillo im harry wilson the general said yes sir castillo said it was obvious the name meant nothing to him is there something i can do for the general sir im here to straighten something out lieutenant general wilson said sir i was your fathers copilot general wilson said jesus christ castillo blurted until i saw the story in the army flier right after lunch general wilson said i didnt even know you existed it took us this long to find you the housing office had never heard of you and blue flight had shut down for the weekend castillo looked at him but didnt speak what your father said general wilson said just before he took offthat daywas get the fuck out harry the way youre shaking youre going to get both of us killed castillo still didnt reply not what it says on that plaque general wilson added softly so i got out and he lifted off he paused then went on ive been waitingwhat is it twentytwo years twentythreeto tell somebody besides my wife what jorgeyour fatherreally said that day sonofabitch miller said softly i think under the circumstances castillo finally said obviously making an effort to control his voice that a small libation is in order he walked to the bar splashed scotch into a glass and took a healthy swallow sir castillo then said i presume lieutenant miller has introduced himself general wilson nodded and you remember captain prentiss dont you charley miller asked yeah sure nice to see you again sir with the generals permission i will withdraw miller said no you wont castillo said sharply you sure charley miller asked goddamn sure castillo said charley general wilson said i thought i read your name was carlos yes sir it is but people call me charley yourdadmade me call him horhay wilson said not george he said he was a wetback and proud of it and wanted to be called horhay sir i think he was pulling your chain castillo said from what ive learned of my father he was proud of being a texican not a wetback a texican castillo nodded yes sir a texan with longago mexican roots a wetback is somebody who came across the border yesterday no offense intended lieutenant none taken sir castillo said sir how long did you fly with my father wilson looked around the room then took a seat on the couch and sipped at his drink about three months wilson said we arrived incountry the same day i was fresh out of west point and here he was an oldtimer hed done a sixmonths tour in germany before they shipped him to vietnam they put us together with him in the right seat because he had more time he took me under his winghe was a really good pilotand taught me the things the aviation school didnt teach we shared a hootch he paused a moment in thought then finished became close friends although he warned me that that wasnt smart an oldtimer castillo said he was nineteen when he was killed christ im twentytwo i was twentytwo too wilson said softly a friend of mine told me there were a lot of teenaged huey pilots in vietnam castillo said there were wilson said then added i cant understand why he never mentioned you as i said i had no idea you existed until today he didnt know about me castillo said he was killed before i was born i dont think he even knew my mother was pregnant i realize this may sound selfish lieutenanti realize doing so would probably open old woundsbut id like to go see your mother may i ask why you would want to do that sir castillo asked well first id like to apologize for not looking her up when i came home and id like her to know that i know im alive because of your father if he hadnt told me toget the fuck out harryboth of us would have died when that chopper blew up my mother died ten years ago sir castillo said im sorry wilson said i should have picked that up from the story in the army flier it mentioned only your grandparents yes sir they raised me i know theyd like to talk to you sir would you be willing to do that of course i would id be honored well let me set that up castillo said then ill put my pants on he walked to the telephone on the wet bar and punched in a number from memory there followed a brief exchange in spanish then castillo held out the telephone to general wilson sir my grandfatherjuan fernando castillo generally referred to as don fernandowould like to speak with you wilson got quickly off the couch and walked to the wet bar he speaks english right he asked softly it might be better if you spoke slowly sir castillo said and handed him the phone oh jesus charley miller said you have a dangerous sense of humor i remember captain prentiss said good afternoon mr castillo general wilson said carefully pronouncing each syllable my name is harold wilson and i had the privilege of serving with your son horhay there was a reply which caused general wilson to shake his head and flash lieutenant castillo a dirty look castillo smiled and poured more scotch into his glass after a minute or so wilson handed castillo the telephone and there followed another conversation in spanish finally castillo put the handset back in the base like father like son right castillo general wilson said smiling you like pulling peoples chains your grandfather speaks english like a harvard lawyer i guess i shouldnt have done that sir castillo said i have an awful problem resisting temptation that sir miller said is what is known as a monumental understatement your grandfather and grandmother are coming here tomorrow i guess he told you wilson said im presuming hell call you back with the details when hes made his reservations he has a plane sir he said theyll leave right after breakfast that should put them in here about noon what ive got to do now is arrange permission for them to land at cairns and get them some place to stay i think i can probably get them in here they will stay in the vip quarters general wilson said and ill arrange for permission for his plane to land at cairns or tom will right tom yes sir prentiss said then looked at castillo as he took a notebook from his shirt pocket what kind of a plane is it a learjet got the tail number prentiss asked castillo gave it to him your grandfather has a learjet general wilson asked yes sir and until a year ago when my grandmother made him stop he used to fly it himself my cousin fernando will be flying it tomorrow your father painted a very colorful picture of his life as a wetback wilson said the benefits of a serape and sandals how to make tortillas and refry beans he said he played the trumpet in a mariachi band and until just now i believed every word sir according to my grandfather what my father did before he joined the armyhe was booted out of texas a ampm and was one step ahead of his draft boardwas fly sikorskys the civilian version of the h ferrying people and supplies to oil rigs in the gulf of mexico can i get you another one of those sir miller asked nodding at the generals empty glass yes please general wilson said this time put a little water and some ice in it please yes sir miller said general may i ask a favor castillo asked absolutely sir i stood still for that picture because i was ordered to my general is not a great believer in publicity i dont know how hell react when he sees that storybut i do know that he will my grandfather is much the same way sir he doesnt like his name in the newspapers is there some way you can turn the io off wilson nodded okay hes off i understand how you feel he paused and then smiled i guess you really cant cast in bronze get the fuck out harry can you that might raise some eyebrows sir castillo said anything else i can do for you no sir thats about it thank you who is your general charley you dont mind if i call you charley do you not at all sir general mcnab sir hes deputy commander of the special warfare center at bragg he was three years ahead of me at the point wilson said interesting man yes sir he is that may i use your telephone yes sir of course castillo said as he walked to the wet bar general wilson said when there is more than one call to make you should make the one to the most important person first you may wish to write that down general wilson appeared clearly pleased with his humor causing castillo to wonder is he a little plastered on two drinks yes sir castillo and miller both sounding confused said almost in unison the explanation came almost immediately sweetheart general wilson said into the phone tom found him were with him right now in the daleville inn he doesnt look like his father darling but he has horhays sense of humor so that means two things baby first there will be two more for supper tonight and horhays parents are coming in tomorrow yes really young castillo called them just now can you do a really nice lunch for them and dinner too no i thought theyd be more comfortable in the vip house well be there shortly is randy there general wilson looked at miller and asked whats your class ninety sir miller said general wilson said into the receiver tell randy hell have another classmate there tonight lieutenant h richard miller jr yeah his son thats about it sweetheart well be over there shortly he put the receiver in its base and pointed to the telephone your turn tom he ordered first call protocol and reserve one of the vip houses for a mr and mrs castillo for tomorrow night and the next night if theres someone already in there have them moved and then call cairns and clear mr castillos airplane to land there tomorrow yes sir captain prentiss said while hes doing that general wilson said may i help myself to another little taste yes sir of course miller said castillo thought hes getting plastered does he have a problem with the sauce tonight general wilson said my daughters broiling steaks for her fiance randyrandolphrichardson and some other of hisyourclassmates i presume you know him yes sir i know lieutenant richardson miller said righteous randolph castillo said and shook his head i somehow suspect that my announcement that youre about to get together with some of your classmates is not being met with the smiles of pleasure i anticipated sir with all respect castillo said carefully i dont think our having supper with lieutenant richardson is a very good idea could we pass with thanks sir ive already told my wife youre coming yes sir i understand castillo said nevertheless sir i think it would be best if we did that some other time general wilson stared at castillo for a long moment there was no longer a question in castillos mind that the general was feeling the drinks okay wilson said what happened between you neither castillo nor miller replied that question is in the nature of an order gentlemen general wilson said and now there was a cold tone in his voice a book fell off a shelf sir miller said striking cadet first sergeant richardson on the face he alleged that his broken nose had actually been caused by cadet private castillo having punched him an inquiry was held i was called as a witness and confirmed cadet private castillos version richardson then brought us before a court of honor for violating the honor code a cadet will not lie cheat or steal nor tolerate those who do yes sir and we were acquitted sir as a purely hypothetical question wilson said why would a cadet private take a punch at a cadet first sergeant neither replied your turn castillo general wilson said sir in the hypothetical situation the general describes i could imagine that a cadet private might lose his temper upon learning that a cadet first sergeant had gone to his tactical officer and reported his suspicions that a cadet lieutenant had arranged for a car to pick him up at the hotel thayer with the intention of going to new york for the weekend had the cadet lieutenant done so yes sir who was he a friend me sir when my tac officer called me on it i admitted it and he had no choice but to bust me sir for just sneaking into the city on a weekend i did that routinely i was on academic restriction at the time sir castillo said oh god you are your fathers son general wilson said sir we had a captain who had the unpleasant habit of grabbing the nearest soldier and having him clean his bird im not talking about shining it up for an ig inspection im talking about getting rid of the vomit and blood and excreta with which they were too often fouled your father told the captain that the next time he grabbed our crew chief to do his dirty work he was going to shove him headfirst into a honey bucket you know what a honey bucket is presumably yes sir the captain did and your father did and the captain had him brought up on charges of assault upon a senior officer the company commandera wise senior majorjust about told your father that if he would take an article he could expect no worse punishment than being restricted to the company area for two weeks that was meaningless actually as we were in the boonies and there was nowhere to go your father demanded trial by courtmartial and he exercised his right to defense counsel of his choice me he could not be dissuaded from that either he told me when they put his accuser on the stand i was to get into great detail about his shoving the captains head in the honey bucket i was convinced your father was going to go to the long bihn stockade butyour dad was one of those natural leaders who are able to get people to do whatever they are asked to do even if it sounds insanei did what he asked he stopped when miller handed him his fresh drink im not at all sure i need this general wilson said but thank you and then he laughed well as i said he went on smiling i did my best to carry out my clients instructions i asked the captain over and over about the details of the assault upon him finally the president of the court had enough wind it up lieutenant youve been over and over this one more question so i said yes sir and i tried to think of a good final question i came up with a doozy not on purpose it just came out of my mouth captain i said please tell the court what you found in the honey bucket when you allege mr castillo shoved your head in it jesus christ miller said and laughed delightedly that caused some coughing on the part of the members of the court general wilson went on then the captain replied very angrily shit is what i found in the honey bucket i damned near drowned in it well the court broke up literally became hysterical the president banged his gavel and fled the room the other members followed him the trial was held in a quonset hut and we could hear them laughing in the other end of the building for a long time finally they came back in i announced that the defense rested the lieutenant prosecuting gave his closing argument which was of course devastating and i gave mine which was ludicrous then the court retired they were out thirty minutes and then they came back and found your father not guilty of all charges and specifications thats a great story castillo said smiling unfortunately he didnt have much time to savor his victory two weeks later he was dead general wilson took a sip of his scotch then went on i had a purpose in telling that story for one thing it has been my experience that there is more justice in the army than people are usually willing to recognize we are supposed to be judged by our peers in the army we really are soldiers who understand soldiering judge their fellow soldiers they almost always return verdicts that are just even if they sort of stray from legal niceties i would suggest that court of honor which found you two not guilty and the court which found charleys father not guilty based their decision on the circumstances rather than on the cold facts i suspect your fellow cadets liked cadet lieutenant castillo and thought randy had gotten what he deserved from him and i suspect that the officers on the court liked your father admired his sticking up for our crew chief and that the captain got what he deserved too and that it would serve neither justice nor good order and discipline to make things any worse than they were furthermore thats all water long under the dam vietnam and west point are both long ago tonight when you see randy im sure that what passed between you will seemas indeed it isno longer important you might even be glad you had a chance to get together with him he really cant be all bad beth is absolutely crazy about him castillo and miller did not respond beth is of course offlimits but there will be other young women there tonight andpresuming they are neither engaged nor marriedthe hunting may interest you and i promised my wife you would be there my quartersnumber twoare on red cloud road can you find that yes sir miller said i know where it is well having talked too much drunk too much and pontificated too much tom and i will now leave we will see you in about thirty minutes right yes sir miller and castillo said in chorus thank you for your hospitality gentlemen general wilson said our pleasure sir miller and castillo said almost in chorus general wilson was almost at the door when he stopped and turned two things he said yes sir they said one the dress is informalhe pointed at millers sweatshirtbut two not that informal yes sir miller said wilson looked at castillo did i pick up that youre class of too charley you and miller and your good friend randy are all classmates yes sir castillo said then how in hell did you manage to get to the desert war flying an apache thats a long story sir it cant be that long sir i had just reported to fort knox to begin the basic officer course when i was told i had been selected to fill an unexpected slot in rotary wing primary class i suspect it was because of my father when i got here they found out i had twohundredodd hours of huey time so they gave me my wings transferred me to rw advanced class and the next thing i knew there i was flying over the iraqi desert with mr kowalski at oh dark hundred in an apache with people shooting at us the distinction i really have sir was in having been the least qualified apache pilot in the army warrant officer kowalski the blue flight instructor pilot yes sir there we were probably the best apache pilot in the army and the worst one i will want to hear that story more in detail charley but youre wrong the distinction you have is the distinguished flying cross you earned flying a shotup apache a hundred miles or so across the iraqi sand at oh dark hundred he paused thirty minutes gentlemen thank you again for your hospitality captain prentiss opened the door for general wilson they went through it and prentiss pulled it shut behind him after a moment miller moved aside the venetian blind of the front window to make sure general wilson was really gone he turned to castillo and said i think thats what they call a memorable experience yeah i suspect the general had more to drink than he usually does i got the feeling from prentiss that he doesnt drink at all this upset him and why not get the fuck out harry youre shaking so much youll get us both killed as opposed to the heroic bullshit on the whatever you call it on that building castillo nodded when i got that apache back across the berm and they started pulling kowalski out of the apachehe wasnt hurt as bad as it looked but all i could see was blood where his face was supposed to be and there was blood all over the cockpiti started to shake so bad they had to hold me up then i started throwing up stuff i had eaten two years before castillo paused then went on i understand that i think he thinks he did the wrong thing by getting out he didnt you never told me about that before miller said softly you dont want to think about it you put it out of your mind jesus dick think about what they went through theyd been picking up bloody bodies for hours whats amazing is they were still doing it better men than thee and me richard all it took was one shotup helicopter and kowalski and i were out of it miller looked at him for a long moment without responding then he forced a laugh to change the subject and said and your father shoved some chickenshit captain down a honey bucket he must have been quite a guy and got away with it castillo added grinning youre not going to tell your folks about that not abuela grandpa sure if i dont fernando will and i definitely have to share that story with fernando miller nodded then said we are to be reunited with righteous randolph ive bumped into him a half dozen times here im invisible to him as far as hes concerned i am a disgrace to the long gray line just you id hoped never to see the miserable sonofabitch again i think he was born a prick i just had a very unpleasant thought miller said i didnt know you had any other kind charley youre not thinking of nailing wilsons daughter are you where did that come from answer the question for one thing shes a generals daughter i learned painfully the dangers of nailing a generals daughter with jennifer that didnt slow you down with the next one casanova what was her name delores daphne castillo furnished hey general wilson is not only a nice guy but he was my fathers buddy im not going to try to nail his daughter what kind of a prick do you think i am i know damned well what kind the kind who will forget all those noble sentiments the instant you start thinking with your dick andor that it might be fun to nail righteous randolphs girlfriend just for old times sake dont do it charley put your evil imagination at rest in case i didnt say this before dont do it charley im serious iii red cloud road fort rucker alabama february the quarters assigned to the deputy commanding general of the army aviation center and fort rucker alabama were larger but not by much than the quarters assigned to officers of lesser rank castillo thought the dependent housing area of fort ruckermore than a thousand onestory frame buildings ninety percent of them duplexes spread over several hundred acres of pinecovered gently rolling landlooked like an absolutely no money down move right in housing development outside say houston or philadelphia his boss brigadier general bruce j mcnab lived in a spacious twostory brick colonial house on an elmshaded street at fort bragg the reason for the difference was that the senior officer housing at bragg had been built before world war ii while all the housing at rucker had gone up immediately before and during the vietnam war the driveway to general wilsons quarters was lined with automobiles half of them ordinary fords and chevrolets the other half sports cars miller said that was how you told which lieutenants were married and which were not it was impossible to support both a wife and a porsche on a lieutenants pay even a lieutenant on flight pay miller himself drove a ford castillo a chevrolet coupe there was a handmade sign on the front door of quarters two it had an arrow and the words around in back in bold type around in back of the house was the patio this consisted of a concrete pad enclosed by an eightfoot slat fence painted an odd shade of blue on the patio were two gasfired barbecue stoves two picnic tables two round tables with folded umbrellas four large icefilled containers and about twenty young men and women all the young menincluding miller and castillowere dressed very much alike sports jackets slacks opencollared shirts and wellshined shoes it was not hard to imagine them in uniform the young women were similarly dressed in their own same style skirts and either sweaters or blouses castillos eye fell on one of the latter a blonde standing by one of the smoking stoves even across the patio castillo could see her brassiere through the sheer blouse he had always found this fascinating and was so taken with this one that he didnt notice a couple walking across the patio until miller whispered headsup here comes righteous randolph the female with righteous randolph also a blonde was every bit as goodlooking as the one cooking steaks she wore a skirt topped with a tight sweater and good evening to you righteous miller said youre miller and castillo right the blonde asked guilty miller said i couldnt believe randy when he said you would have the gall to show up here the blonde said charles my boy miller said i suspect that our invitation to mingle with these charming people has been withdrawn odd im getting the same feeling castillo said i suspect we withdraw with righteouss permission of course youre right sweetheart the blonde said they think its funny and theyre oh so clever and hers too of course castillo said you two are really disgusting lieutenant randolph richardson said castillo was already behind the wheel of his chevrolet and miller was having his usual trouble fastening the seat belt around his bulk when captain prentiss came running down the drive where the hell are you going prentiss demanded we tried to tell the generalyou were therethat our coming here was probably going to be a mistake castillo said a stunning blonde who i strongly suspect is the generals daughter just confirmed that prognosis my feelings are crushed beyond measure miller said righteous randolph just told us we are really disgusting im about to break into tears and i didnt want to do that for fear of bringing discredit upon the long gray line gentlemen prentiss said general wilsons compliments the general requests that you attend him at your earliest convenience what the blonde said was she couldnt believe wed have the gall to show up here castillo said gentlemen prentiss repeated general wilsons compliments the general requests that you attend him at your earliest convenience that sounds pretty goddamn official tom miller said as goddamn official as i know how to make it lieutenant prentiss said he pulled open the passengerside door a trim blonde who was visibly the mother of the one on the patio was waiting at the open door of quarters two youre miller and castillo right dick and charley yes maam they said im bethany wilson she said with a smile where were you going prentiss answered for them beth apparently believes they are responsible for the generals condition he said and greeted them with something less than enthusiasm if anyone is responsible for the generals condition you are tom mrs wilson said what did beth say the one responsible for the generals condition is the general general wilson said coming to the door from inside the house good evening sir miller and castillo said the generals condition in case youre wondering he said is that he cannotnever has been able tohandle any more than one drink in a ninetyminute period as you may have noticed i had four drinks in about fortyfive minutes at your apartment and then i came home and fell out of the car before at least a dozen of my daughters guests then to prove to the world that all i had done was stumble a little i got onto my wifes bicycle and went merrily down the driveuntil i collided with the car of another arriving guest at that point tom finally caught up with me and got me into the house he looked between miller and castillo and said you may smile it certainly wasnt your fault but i would consider it a personal favor lieutenant miller if you did not tell your father about this amusing little episode i beg the generals pardon but i didnt hear a thing that was said miller said quickly changing the subject mrs wilson said what can i get you to drink or would you rather just go out to the patio and join the other young people theres one more thing dear general wilson said dick and charley dont get along well with randy oh im sorry to hear that she said do i get to hear why no general wilson said you were saying something about offering them drinks then i suggest we show them the scrapbooktheres a number of pictures of your dad charley and yours too dickand then throwing poor tom yet again into the breach tom can cook us some steaks to eat in here sir prentiss said im sorry that i didnt didnt what wilson interrupted and looked at castillo charley youre an aide would you dare to tell your general to go easy on the sauce no sir i would not castillo replied there you go tom nobodys fault but mine subject closed iv red cloud road fort rucker alabama february captain tom prentiss walked to the kitchen door of quarters two and lightly tapped one of the panes with his ring brigadier general harry wilson who was sitting at the kitchen table in his bathrobe gestured for him to come in he entered did you have to knock so loudly general wilson inquired prentiss exchanged smiles with mrs bethany wilson who stood at the stove good morning maam good morning tom she replied her tone teeming with an exaggerated cheeriness general wilson glared at her over his coffee mug miss beth wilson who was sitting across the table from her father rolled her eyes the general is not his chipper self this morning prentiss said to him we are not going to have our morning trot up and down red cloud for one thing its saturday for another in my condition i could not trot down the drive to red cloud much less up and down red cloud itself well harry mrs wilson said turning from the stove you know what they say about the wages of sin she looked at prentiss your timing is perfect you want fried or scrambled i was hoping youd make the offer prentiss said scrambled please you know where the coffee is she said bring the pot please tom general wilson said unless you have an oxygen flask in your pocket i can have one here in five minutes sir prentiss said he took the decanter from the coffee machine and carried it to the table and how are you this morning miss beth prentiss said beth wilson flashed him an icy look but didnt reply does oxygen really work tom mrs wilson asked yes maam it does you heard that or you know from personal experience i respectfully claim my privilege against selfincrimination under the fifth amendment to the constitution prentiss said seriously tom general wilson said how much trouble would it be to get your hands on an oxygen flask before we go to meet the castillos you want it right now sir you heard what she said about the wages of sin general wilson said im about to die let me make a call prentiss said and started to get up eat your breakfast first mrs wilson said let him suffer a little oh god general wilson said is there no pity in the world for a suffering man his wife and his aidedecamp chuckled his daughter said you all make me sick i beg your pardon general wilson said youre all acting as if its all very funny there are elements of humor mingled with the gloom general wilson said randy said he did it on purpose beth said randy did what on purpose her mother asked castillo did it on purpose castillo got daddy drunk on purpose hoping he would make an ass of himself general wilson said well daddy did in fact make sort of an ass of himself but charley castillo wasnt responsible daddy was actually i thought you careening down the drive on my bike was hilarious his wife said general wilson raised his eyebrows at that then said its not the sort of behavior general officers should display before a group of young officers and im well aware of that but the sky is not falling and i am being punished as your mother points out for my sins randy says he was always doing that trying to humiliate his betters beth said you knew him at the point tom general wilson said was he well he was one of the prime suspects the other being dick miller in the case of who put miracle glue on the regimental commanders saber really mrs wilson asked as she laid a plate of scrambled eggs before him prentiss nodded he couldnt get it out of the scabbard on the friday retreat parade talk about humiliation and then he lied about it beth said randy told me all about that what they did was claim their right against selfincrimination beth prentiss said thats not the same thing as lying randy said he lied she insisted i was there randy wasnt prentiss said i was the tactical officer supervising the court of honor the court knew they did it but they couldnt prove it nobody actually saw them so they let himthemgo beth said they had no choice nobody saw them do it was that the real reason she challenged it wasnt because his father won that medal you get that from randy too general wilson asked softly randy said that the only reason they werent thrown out of west point was because castillos father had that medalthat the only reason he was in west point to begin with was because his father had that medal sons of medal of honor recipients are granted entrance to west point general wilson said staying in the corps of cadets is not covered and he said that no one had the courage to expel the son of a black general beth went on no matter what hed done and what does randy have to say about lieutenant castillos distinguished flying cross general wilson asked softly he said its impossible to believe that someone could graduate in ninety and be through flight school and flying an apache in the desert war when castillo says he was unless a lot of strings were pulled i am in no condition to debate this with you now beth general wilson said but just as soon as the castillos leave you randy and i are going to have to talk while the castillos are here i dont think it would be a good idea if you were around them youre throwing me out beth said somewhat indignantly im suggesting that you spend the day and tonight with a friend patricia maybe ive got a date with randy tonight where am i supposed to get dressed doesnt patricia have a bedroom take what clothing you need with you i dont want you around here when the castillos are here yes sir she snapped and jumped up from the table tom would you take her to the gremmiers yes sir prentiss said then added a little hesitantly general i was sort of hoping i could get beth to help me at the vip house make sure everythings right and i know mrs wilson is get her to help you at the vip house then take her to the gremmiers mrs wilson ordered im perfectly capable of driving myself beth said were probably going to need both cars general wilson said end of discussion v magnolia cottage fort rucker alabama february camp rucker had been built on a vast area of sandy wornoutfromcottonfarming land in southern alabama in the opening months of world war ii it was intended for use first as a division training area and then for the confinement of prisoners of war an army of workmen had erected thousands of twostory frame barracks concreteblock mess halls theaters chapels headquarters warehouses officers clubs and all the other facilities needed to accomplish this purpose including a halfdozen small frame buildings intended to house general officers and colonels after the war and the repatriation of the pows the camp was closed only to be reopened briefly for the korean war where it again served as a division training base then it was closed for good several years after the korean war with camp rucker placed on the list of bases to be wiped from the books the decision was made to greatly expand army aviation united states senator john sparkman democrat alabamato whom a large number of fellow senators owed many favorssuggested that camp rucker would be a fine place to have an army aviation center his fellow senators voted in agreement with their esteemed colleague thus the facility was then reopened and declared a fort a permanent base another army of workmen swarmed over it building airfields and classrooms and whatever else was needed for a flying army they also tore down most of the old frame buildingsmost not all chapels and theaters remained and the warehouses and the officers clubs and the post headquarters building and four of the cottages originally built in the early s to last only five to ten years for the housing of general officers and senior colonels two of these fourincluding building t which had been renamed magnolia cottagewere near the main gate outside of which was daleville they were fixed up as nicely as possible airconditioned furnished with the most elegant furniture to be found in army warehouses provided with a kitchen and became vip quarters in which distinguished visitors to the post were housed when captain tom prentiss pushed open the door of magnolia house and waved beth wilson into the living room they found the place was immaculate there were even fresh flowers in a vase in the center of the dining table looks fine to me beth wilson said prentiss didnt reply directly instead he said ive got to make a telephone call have a seat that sounds like an order she snapped not at all if youd rather stand he used the telephone in the small kitchen and not really curious she nevertheless managed to hear prentisss side of the conversation tom prentiss im glad i caught you at home i need a big favor could you come to magnolia house right now it shouldnt take more than a few minutes no dont worry about that hes not here i stand in your debt sir beth wilson wondered what that was all about but was not going to ask when prentiss hung up the phone she said will you tell me what you want me to do so i can do it and get out of here there doesnt seem to be anything that needs doing prentiss said but were going to have to wait until somebody comes here she locked eyes with him he went on you upset your dad with that recitation of what your boyfriend had to think about just about everything i suppose you know that is that really any of your business let me explain where im coming from prentiss said coldly i admire your father more than i do anyone else ive ever met if you were to look in a dictionary there would be a picture of your dad in the definition of officer and gentleman maybe you should have thought of that when you let castillo get him drunk and make a fool of himself youre right i should have prentiss said but your question beth was is it any of my business that you upset your father by quoting your boyfriend to him and making him damned uncomfortable and the answer is yeah it is my business its my duty to do something to straighten you out straighten me out yeah and your boyfriend too hes next on my list i cant believe this conversation beth said and i dont think my parents are going to like it a bit when i tell them about it ill have to take my chances about that prentiss said im leaving she said i dont have to put up with this i cant stop you of course but if you leave youll walk and its a long way from here to colonel gremmiers quarters he walked out of the living room and went through the dining room into the kitchen beth started for the door then stopped that arrogant bastard is right about one thing i cant walk from here to the gremmiers so what do i do she was still staring at the door three minutes later when it opened and a middleaged man wearing a woolen shirt a zipper jacket and blue jeans came through it he looked at her and said im looking for tom prentiss im in the kitchen pete prentiss called be right there when he came into the living room prentiss said jesus that was quick well you said you needed a favor the man said do you know miss wilson prentiss asked i know who she is beth this is mr kowalski he was my instructor pilot when i went through blue flight he was with lieutenant castillo in the desert beth nodded coldly at kowalski kowalski looked at prentiss howd you hear about that kowalski said from him prentiss said what he told the general was something like there we were the best apache pilot in the army and the worst one flying an apache over the iraqi desert at oh dark hundred with people shooting at us kowalski chuckled well he said thats a pretty good description except as he shortly proved he was a much better apache pilot than he or i thought he was would you please tell miss wilson about that kowalski glanced at her then looked back at prentiss and said whats this all about tom did somebody tell the general what charleys really doing here i dont know what hes really doing here prentiss said but ill take my chances about learning that too start with the desert please pete it would help if i knew what this is all about tom okay a source in whom miss wilson places a good deal of faith has implied that the only reason castillo was in an apache in the desert was because his father had the medal of honor absolutely true kowalski said he shook his head jesus christ id pretty much forgotten that beth flashed prentiss a triumphant glance then kowalski went on what happened was a week maybe ten days before we went over the berm the old man colonel stevens he was then a light colonelprentiss noddedstevens called me in and said i wasnt going to believe what he was going to tell me which was prentiss said that i was about to have a new copilot that said new copilot had a little over three hundred hours total time forty of which were in the apache and had been in the army since last june when hed graduated from west point and the explanation for this insanity was that this kids father had won the medal of honor and they thought it would make a nice story for the newspapers that the son of a medal of honor guy had been involved in the first actionetcetera get the point now tom isnt that very much what randy said beth asked in an artificially sweet tone im not finished kowalski said tom said i was to tell you what happened oh please do beth said well i shortly afterward met second lieutenant charley castillo kowalski continued and he was your typical bushytailed west point second john he was going to win the war all by himself but i also picked up that he was so dumb that he had no idea what they were doing to him and i sort of liked him right off he was like a puppy wagging his tail and trying to please so because of that and because i was deeply interested in preserving my own skin i spent a lot of time in the next week or whatever it was giving him a cram course in the kowalski method of apache flying he wasnt a bad pilot he just didnt have the apache time the experience and then we went over the berm andwhat did castillo saythere we were flying over the iraqi desert at oh dark hundred with people shooting at us what we were doing was taking out iraqi air defense radar if the radar didnt work they not only couldnt shoot at the air force but they wouldnt even know where it was i was flying and charley was shooting he was good at that and like he said he wasnt the worlds best apache pilot and then some raghead got lucky i dont think they were shooting at us what i think happened was they were shooting in the air and we ran into it anyway i think it was probably an explosiveheaded mm that hit us it came through my windshield and all of a sudden i was blind and i figured oh fuckhe glanced at beth wilsonsorry i figured were going in the kidll be so shook up hell freeze and never even think of grabbing the controlsdid i mention we lost intercomand were going to fly into the sandpile about as fast as an apache will fly and then all of a sudden i sense that he is flying the sonofabitch that what hes trying to do is gain a little altitude so that he can set it down someplace where the ragheads arent and then i senselike i said i cant see a goddamned thingthat hes flying the bird that hes trying to go home when he really should have been trying to land beth asked yeah when he really should have been trying to land kowalski said when most pilots would have tried to land then why didnt he beth asked because when he had to wipe my blood from his helmet visor he figureddamned rightlythat if he set it down even if there no were ragheads waiting to shoot uswhich there wereit would be a long time before anybody found us and i would die from the way the bird was shaking from the noise it was making i thought that we were going to die anyway the bird was either going to come apart or blow up so he should have landed then beth asked either im not making myself clear young lady or you dont want to hear what im saying kowalski said not pleasantly if charley had set it down he would have lived and maybe i wouldnt have he knew that all those long miles back to across the berm and he had enough time in rotarywing aircraft to think what i was thinkingany second now this sonofabitch is going to come apart and well both die knowing that he kept flying in case there is any question in your mind i am the founding member of the charley castillo fan club thats a very interesting story beth said well you asked for it kowalski said i dont know where you got your story but you got it wrong what happened then pete prentiss asked well when i got out of the hospitali wasnt hurt as bad as it looked theres a lot of blood in the head and i lost a lot and thats what blinded mei went looking for him but he was already gone i asked around and found out that when the public relations guys learned that colonel stevens had put charley in for the impact award of the dfcwhich he damned sure deserved that and the purple heart because hed taken some shrapnel in his handstheyd arranged to have him flown to riyadh so that general schwarzkopf could personally pin the awards on him a picture of that would really have gotten in all the newspapers but at riyadh one of the brassi heard it was general naylor who was schwartzkopfs operations officer he just got put in for a third star theyre giving him v corps i saw that in the army times i know who he is prentiss said kowalski nodded anyway someone took a close look at this second lieutenant fresh from west point flying an apache and decided something wasnt kosher what i heard first was that charley had been reassigned to fly hueys for some civil affairs outfit to get him out of the line of fire so to speak i dont understand what you heard first beth interrupted then i heard kowalski went on ignoring her while looking at prentiss what charley was really doing was flying scotty mcnab around the desert in a huey the story i got was that was the only place naylor thought he could stash him safe from the public relations guys who couldnt wait to either put charley back in an apache or send him on a speechmaking tour you said something before pete about what castillo is really doing here prentiss asked you really dont know prentiss shook his head and the general doesnt know either or maybe heard something why the questions i dont know what youre talking about prentiss said i heard he was getting blue flight transition into the king air then i think we should leave it there kowalski said if you dont mind if i tell you and miss wilson agrees that anything you tell us wont go any farther than this room i really would like an explanation of that beth said okay with the understanding that ill deny everything if anybody asks me kowalski said understood prentiss said agreed beth said well the original idea as i understand it was to stash charley where he should have been all alongflying in the left seat of a huey in an aviation company christ hed just gotten out of flight school and he didnt even go through the huey training they just gave him a check ride in a company he could build up some hours but naylor figured if he sent him to a regular company the same people whod put him in an apache would put him back in one so he sent him to mcnab who had this civil affairs outfit as a cover for what he was really doing in the desert which was beth asked special forces honey kowalski said the guys with the green beanies oh she said but it didnt work out that way mcnab heard about the kid whod flown the shotup apache back across the berm went for a look liked what he saw and put him to work flying him around i understand they got involved in a lot of interesting stuff and then mcnab found out that charley speaks german and russian i mean really speaks it like a native and that was really useful to mcnab so the wars over mcnab gets his starthere were a lot people who didnt think that would ever happen how is it that he speaks german and russian like a native beth interrupted his mother was german he was raised there i dont know where he got the russian and some other languages too anyway mcnab is now a general hes entitled to an aide so he takes charley to bragg with him as his aide kowalski stopped and smiled and shook his head why are you smiling beth asked charley thought he was really hot stuff and why not he wasnt out of west point a year and here he was an aviator with the dfc two purple hearts a bronze star and the combat infantry badge and now a generals aide i didnt know about the cib and the bronze star prentiss said whered he get those i saw the bronze star citation kowalski said it says he distinguished himself while engaged in intensive combat action of a clandestine and covert nature i guess he got the cib and the second purple heart from the same place thats all it said prentiss asked god only knows what mcnab did over there all of it covert and clandestine he came out of that warand you know how long it lasted it took me longer to walk out of cambodiawith a distinguished service medal a purple heart a star for his cib and the star that most people never thought hed get anyway when charley got to bragg mcnab quickly took the wind out of his sails id like to know how he managed to do that beth said sweetly kowalski gave her a look that was half curiosity and half frown then went on when i heard charley was at bragg i went to see him the first time he wasnt in mcnabs office he was out in the boonies at camp mackall taking green beanie qualification training eating snakes and all that crap you know and before that mcnab had sent him to jump school thatll take the wind out of anybodys sails i thought he was general mcnabs aide beth said oh he was but first he had to go to benning and mackall then as an aide mcnab really ran his ass ragged what he was doing of course was training him but charley didnt know that he decided that god really didnt like him after all that the fickle finger of fate had got him that he was working for one mean sonofabitch he told me that when his tour as an aide was up it was sayonara special forces back to aviation for him mcnab was of course one two jumps ahead of him i was up there to see charley maybe two three months ago on a quote blue flight crosscountry exercise end quote mcnab sent for me told me the conversation was private and asked me what i thought of the th the special forces aviation regiment beth asked kowalski nodded special operations aviation regiment soar i told him what i thoughtwhich is that its pretty good and i would much rather be at campbell flying with the night stalkers than teaching fieldgrade officers to fly here he said he thought it would be just the place for charley to go when his aide tour was up i told him i didnt think that with as little time as charley hadeither total hours or in the armytheyd take him he said what he was thinking of doing was sending charley over here for blue flight transition into the king airwhich he already knew how to flyand what could be done while he was here to train him in something else something that would appeal to the th he said he knew two people who were going to have a quiet word in the ear of whoever selected people for the th saying that theyd flown with him in combat and thought he could make it in the th then he pointed to me and him and he said if i hear you told him or even if he finds out about this i will shoot you in both knees with a hollowpoint kowalski laughed mcnab really likes charley theyre two of a kind so what are you doing for him here prentiss asked if its got wings or rotary blades by the time i send him back to bragg he will be checked out in it as pilotincommand kowalski said ive even checked him out in stuff the aviation board has for testing that the army hasnt even bought yet how do you get away with that prentiss asked im the vice president of the instrument examiner board and the training scheduler for blue flight kowalski said very few people ask me why im doing something and a lot of people owe me favors like i figure i owe charley several big ones prentiss nodded thanks pete he said this is the favor you wanted telling you about charley yeah and now i need one more you going home from here yeah kowalski said how about dropping miss wilson at colonel gremmiers quarters i have the feeling shed rather be with anyone but me right now kowalski looked at the girl then back at prentiss you going to explain that kowalski said you dont want to know pete yeah sure gremmiers house is right on my way vi red cloud road fort rucker alabama february these are really wonderful photos juan fernando castillo said he glanced up from the thick photo album on the coffee table in the wilsons living room and met brigadier general harold f wilsons eyes they mean a lot to me don fernando the general said the last snapshot that don fernando was looking at was a fivebyseven color photograph of second lieutenant harold f wilson and wojg jorge a castillo standing by the nose of an hud helicopter of the nd attack helicopter company both were smiling broadly don fernandono one had ever dared call him don juan for the obvious reasonwas a tall heavyset man with a full head of dark hair he wore a welltailored nearly black doublebreasted pinstriped suit he looked very much like one of his grandsons fernando manuel lopez who sat on one side of him on the wilsons couch and not at all like his other grandson carlos guillermo castillo who sat on the other side of him let me tell you what ive decided to do with those photos don fernando wilson said and a good decision is a good decision even if it is made much longer after it should have been excuse me don fernando said i have decided that many of them should be hanging suitably framed in the jorge castillo classroom building the first thing monday morning i will take them to our stateoftheart photo lab i think thats a very good idea general don fernando said youre not going to stop that are you calling me general you have to understand harry don fernando said that i never got any higher than major and never very close to general officers when jorge and i were in nam we thought majors were god wilson said so did we majors in korea don fernando said they laughed i never thought majors were god did you gringo fernando lopez asked charley in a mock innocent tone fernando dona alicia castillo said the wife of don fernandoand grandmother of fernando lopez and charley castillowas a slight woman her black hair heavily streaked with gray and pulled tight around her head she wore a single strand of large pearls around her neck her only other jewelry consisted of two gold miniature branch insigniasarmor and aviation honoring fernando and charley respectivelypinned to the bosom of her simple black dress and her wedding and engagement rings she was an elegant dignified and formidable lady don fernando smiled my darling fernandos been calling him that from the moment carlos got off the plane what makes you think hell stop now actually fernando charley said now that i think about it no i never thought majors were godlike other comparisons however have occurred to me from time to time dona alicia shook her head may i finish gentlemen wilson asked as i was saying i will order that they be copied with great care enlarged and three copies made of each you should have your complete set in san antonio by friday oh my god you dont have to do that don fernando said oh yes i do wilson said im only sorry that i didnt what happened happened don fernando said you tried and our number is unlisted dona alicia said you couldnt be expected to find someone who isnt in the book my wife and i were deeply touched by your letter don fernando said yes we were harry dona alicia said it was heartfelt and then the maid threw it out before i could reply things happened that kept us from getting together before this im just so glad it finally happened general castillo said may i ask a question of course charley sir arent you a little concerned that somebody might recognize the second lieutenant standing next to my father yes i am but i dont see what i can do about that do you i dont understand dona alicia said for what its worth general i hope a lot of people do castillo said the general didnt reply thank you charley mrs bethany wilson said and so do i i have hanging in my office don fernando said jorges medal and a photograph a terrible one taken when he graduated from flight school i will replace the photograph with this one thats a great idea charley said dona alicia asked what aboutwould this be possiblegetting a photo of the plaque on that building to put beside it or perhaps having a replica made for the same purpose abuela charley said trust me thats a lousy idea why is it a lousy idea the gringos right abuela fernando said just the photo the photos a great idea dont call carlos that dona alicia said but then she let the matter drop vii room the daleville inn daleville alabama february dripping water charley castillo was wearing a thick terrycloth bathrobeand not a damn thing elsewhen he went to answer his door the somewhat sourtoned chime had been bonging steadilyamid the downpour drumming on the roofsince before he had stepped out from the shower theres no telling how long its been bonging like that either the motel is on fire or some sonofabitch has stuck a toothpick in the button or more likely its pete kowalski with the wonderful news that hes got his hands on an apache and we can get in a couple of hours airborne tonight and my ass is dragging it was instead miss beth wilson it was one of the rare occasions where he found himself momentarily speechless but then his mouth went on autopilot i cant believe that you have the gall to show up here he said paraphrasing her greeting to him when he and miller had first arrived at quarters two you are a sonofabitch arent you beth said actually im a bastard he said theres a difference my mother was a lady are you going to ask me in its raining out here in case you didnt notice since i seriously doubt you came here with designs on my body may i ask why you want to come in im here to apologize she said and to ask a big favor youre kidding right no i am not kidding you realize what will happen if you pass through this portal and righteous randolph hears about it im asking you as nicely as i know how please im getting soaked wont you come in miss wilson castillo asked and opened the door fully she entered the living room took off her head scarf and then her raincoat she was wearing a skirt and under a sweater vest a nearly transparent blouse where are you now dick miller selfappointed keeper of castillos morals you sonofabitch when i really need you do you think this will take long miss wilson itll take a little time in that caseyou may have noticed that youve interrupted my toiletteplease excuse me for a moment while i slip into something more comfortable when castillo came out of the bedroom three minutes laterwearing slacks and a sweater and shower thongsbeth wilson was sitting on the couch holding a copy of the tages zeitung whats this she said they call that a newspaper its german i noticed what do you do use this to keep your german up keep my german up where castillo asked innocently and then took pity on her my mothers family was in the newspaper business they send it to me and yeah i read it to practice my german she gave him a faint smile now that i am appropriately dressed castillo said and in a position to proclaim my innocence of even harboring any indecent thoughts of any kind whatsoever should randolph come bursting through the door his eyes blazing with righteousness you mentioned something about an apology randys on a crosscountry roundrobin ron she said he wont come bursting through the door a round robin was a flight that began and ended after one or more intermediate stops at the same place crosscountry meant what it sounded like ron stood for remain over night oh you speak aviation he said my father is an aviator you might

fledgling birdmen will even be bright enough to extrapolate from that that driving one such machine and getting flight pay to do so would seem to be a far smarter way to serve ones country than mucking about in the mud etcetera as they are doing they then apply for flight training this is called recruiting hence the term recruiting flights i almost believe that miss wilson there is no limit to what terrible things certain people will do to further army aviation she looked at him for a moment before smiling again well anyway she said you dont have to worry about randy bursting through your door he called me from fort stewart about an hour ago and suggested you come over here and say hi if you were bored god you just dont stop do you are we back to the apology or have i said something thats changed your mind youre making it hard but i havent changed my mind are you familiar with ed mcmahon the entertainer miss wilson can you call me beth obviously i can the questions would seem to be will i andor why should i because it would make things easier for me and yes i know who mcmahon is why because beth thank you youre welcome beth mr mcmahon said that drink is gods payment for hard work and as ive worked hard all day doing what i spent three hours in an apache and twothirty in a mohawk thank you for your interest as i was saying i worked hard all day and in the shower i was planning to accept my just pay the moment i was dry but then you started bonging at my door so what i am going to do now while you rehearse your apology is make myself a drink all right he went to the wet bar took out a silver set of martinimaking necessities from the freezer compartment of the refrigerator and very seriously set about constructing himself a martini in the manner practiced by and passed on to him by brigadier general bruce j mcnab this involved among other things rinsing out both the martini mixer and the martini glass with vermouth before adding a precisely measured hefty amount of gilbeys gin to the ice in the mixer he then stirred the mixture precisely one hundred times before pouring it into two large longstemmed martini glasses and adding two pickled onions on a toothpick to each he took one of the martinis very carefully placed it in the freezer and gently closed the freezer door then carefully carrying the other martini he walked to the couch and sat down as far away from beth wilson as the couch would permit he brought the glass to his lips looked at her over the rim and said you may begin the apology then he took his first sip wheres mine she said youre kidding right you are not going to offer me a drink after that long ed mcmahon speech what work did you do today is one question that pops to mind castillo said i told you im getting married on sunday i spent all daywith half a dozen giggling womengetting ready i can see where that would be tiring castillo said the next question is a little delicate your father my father has a problem with alcohol she said something about his metabolism my mother and i dont and you want a martini if it wouldnt be too much trouble i happened to notice you made two there is a reason for that you know what they say about martinis ill bet youre about to tell me martinis are like a womans breasts castillo said solemnly one is not enough and three is too many my god thats disgusting i cant believe you said that to me she could not however hard she tried completely restrain the smile that came to her face i made two because i planned to drink two castillo said the idea of making one for you never entered my mind well now that it has are you going to give me one im not sure that would be wise why not well if a couple of belts puts your father on a bicycle theres no telling what one martini would do to you castillo said and then his mouth went on autopilot you might for example tear off your clothes and throw yourself into my arms she looked at him incredulously for a moment then got off the couch and walked to the refrigerator commenting en route dont hold your breath my god youre an absolute lunatic she took the second martini out of the freezer and carried it back to the couch she extended it to him lets start over okay he shrugged why not they tapped glasses both took a sip i came here castillo i call you beth and you call me castillo is that the way to commence an apology i came here charley better he said to apologize for my behavior at my house on saturday and well you should you nearly reduced poor dick miller to tears hes very sensitive she shook her head took another sip of the martini and went doggedly on and to ask a favor well that certainly explains why you felt you needed a drink asking a favormuch less apologizingto the likes of me has to be very difficult for someone like you what is that supposed to mean you are a generals daughter you are not the first generals daughter ihave encountered randy told me about her beth said well im sure that was fascinating did he manage to suggest that my behavior was ungentlemanly as a matter of fact yes well my conscience is clear from day one i made it absolutely clear to daphne that i had no intention of marching up the aisle of the cadet chapel with her the day after i graduated daphne randy said her name was jennifer same story jennifer was before daphne but i made it perfectly clear to her too that if she was looking for a husband she was looking in the wrong place oh youre not only a sonofabitch but youre proud of being a sonofabitch no as i said before i am a bastard not a sonofabitch i know why you and randy dont get along i dont think so but what does it matter i accept your apology now whats the favor you want i cant believe you drank that already she said here is the proof he said holding the martini glass upside down and now i am going to have to make myself another having let chivalry get in the way of my common sense what the hell does that mean i gave you my second martini he said he got up and walked to the wet bar you may ask me the favor he said as he went to the freezer for another frozen glass there were two glasses in the freezer he looked at them a long moment and then took both out that would seem to prove that i am indeed the sonofabitch that she thinksand dick knowsi am but not to worry virtue will triumph if i so much as lightly touch her shoulder she will throw the martini in my face and then kick me with practiced skill in the scrotum he set about making a second duo of dry martini cocktails according to the famous recipe of brigadier general bruce j mcnab beth came across the room to where he stood he looked at her and then away you might as well go sit back down he said stirring the ginandice mixture you have had your ration of martinis my family likes really likes your family beth said that was all they talked about at breakfast and my family likes your family since both families are extraordinarily nice people why does that surprise you my mother and father are going to san antonio did you know that abuela told me abuela my grandmother dona alicia why do they call her that they dont call her abuela fernando and i do it means grandmother in spanish they call our abuela dona alicia as a mark of respect im going to marry randy she said i seem to recall having heard that somewhere that will make randy part of my family yeah i guess it will what i would like to do is patch things up between you and randy theres not much chance of that beth he said seriously and their eyes met again he averted his quickly and very carefully poured the two glasses full starting with you being part of our wedding she said not a chance theres going to be an arch of swords outside the chapel im sure randyyoure classmateswould love to have you be one of thewhatever theyre called beth for christs sake no i cant stand the sonofabitch i thought you didnt use that term you preferred bastard i didnt say i preferred it i said that i wasnt a sonofabitch because my mother was the antithesis of a bitch he met her eyes again averted them picked up his martini glass and took a healthy swallow but you dont mind being called a bastard i am a bastard he said meeting her eyes theres not much i can do about it a bastard being defined as someone who is hardheaded arrogant infuriating and revels in it a bastard is a child born out of wedlock castillo said i dont understand she said your parents werent married he shook his head he said the estimates vary that between fifty thousand and one hundred fifty thousand children were born outside the bonds of holy matrimony to german girls and their american boyfriendssome of whom were general officers i am one of those so born im a lot luckier than any of the others ive run into but im one of them because of your father you mean no because of my mother my father was only in at the beginning so to speak because of my mother my mother was something special why are you telling me this she asked i dont know possibly in the hope that it will send you fleeing before this situation gets any more out of hand than it is i want to hear this she said does my father know your father is a very intelligent man hes probably put it all together by now or your mother has or abuela told them he took another sip of his martini as beth watched she said thats your second youre gulping down you know i can count and as soon as you leave i will have the third im not leaving until you tell me what happened when my father finished flight school they sent him to germany rather than straight to vietnam they tried to do that send kids straight from flight school over there the idea was that they would build some hours be better pilots when they got into combat and while he was in germany he met a german girl and here i am the sonofabitch beth exploded no now youre talking about his madremy abuelaand she is indeed another who is the antithesis of bitch hemade your mother pregnant and then just left i dont care if you like it or not that makes him a sonofabitch in my book oh charley im so sorry hold the pity he said for one thing we dont know that he behaved dishonorably for one thing he didnt know she was pregnant he did promise her he would write and then never did it is entirely possible that had he written and had she been able to reply that she was in the family way he would have done something about it i like to think thats the case genes are strong and he was my grandparents son but he didnt write he didnt know and well never know whether or not he would have gone back to germany when he came home from vietnamhe drained his martini glassbecause he didnt come back from vietnam your poor mother beth said how awful for her and its not as if my mother had to go scrub floors or stand under lili marlenes streetlamp to feed her bastard son castillo said just a little thickly she was the eighteenyearold princess in the castle whod made a little mistake that no one dared talk about her father my grandfather was a tough old hessian he was a lieutenant colonel at stalingrad he was one of the quote lucky ones unquotethe really seriously wounded who were evacuated just before it fell he was also an aristocrat the family name is von und zu gossinger not just von and not just zu both that sort of thing is important in the almanac de gotha you sound as if you didnt like him she said actually i liked him very much he was kind to me what i think now is that he wasnt all that unhappy that an american a mexicanamerican with a name like jorge castillo had not come back to further pollute the von und zu gossinger bloodline he met her eyes again quickly averted them again and reached for the other full martini glass she snatched it away before his hand touched it youve had enough she said that decision is mine dont you think castillo asked not very pleasantly she glowered at him then she put the glass to her mouth and drained it not anymore its not she said youre out of your mind youll pass out finish the story she said how the hell am i going to get you home finish the story she repeated thats it how did you wind up in san antonio oh yeah oh he shrugged well my grandfather and my uncle willi went off a bridge on the autobahn and that left my mother and me alone in the castle why didnt your mother try to get in contact with your father when he didnt write or come back as he promised i guess she decided he didnt want to and i suspect that my grandfather managed to suggest two or three thousand times that it was probably better that he hadnt i just dont know how did you get to san antonio oh yeah well youve heard that good luck comes in threes of course a year or so after my grandfather and uncle willi went off the bridge my mother was diagnosed with a terminal case of pancreatic cancer oh god at that point my mother apparently decided that wetback mexican relatives in texas would be better than no family at all for the soontobe orphan son so she went to the army which had been running patrols along the eastwest german border fence on our land she knew a couple of officers one of them a major named allan naylor general naylor she asked when castillo nodded she added hes a friend of my fathers i am not surprised castillo said anyway naylor was shortly able to tell her the reason that my father had not come back as promised was because he was interred in the national cemetery in san antonio he paused thenhis voice breakingadded so at least she had that it wasnt much but she had that beth saw tears forming her own watered he turned his face from hers and coughed to get his voice under control he then asked if i take a beer from the cooler are you going to snatch it away from me and gulp it down no she said softly almost in a whisper he took a bottle of schlitz from the refrigerator and twisted off the cap as he went to take a swig raising it to his mouth he lost enough of his balance so that he had to quickly back up against the counter without missing a beat he went on soso one day major allan naylor shows up in san antonio nobly determined to protect as well as he can the considerable assets the german kid is about to inherit from the natural avarice of the wetback family into which the german bastard is about to be dumped oh charley my grandfather was in new york on business so naylor had to deliver the news to dona alicia that wojg jorge castillo had left a love child behind in germany what happened she called my grandfather in new york told him and his reaction to the news was that she was to do nothing until he could get back to texas he didnt want to be cruel but on the other hand he didnt want to open the family safe to some german woman just because she claimed her bastard was his sons oh charley you keep saying that castillo said he took another swig and went on couldnt blame him id have done the same thing asked for proof so how long did that take proving who you were not long thirty minutes after she hung up on grandpa the lear went wheelsup out of san antonio with abuela and naylor on it they caught the fivefifteen pan american flight out of new york to frankfurt that afternoon abuela was at the haus im wald at eleven oclock the next morning haus in wald whats that means house in the woods its not really a castle really ugly building oh and she went there and i didnt want to let her in castillo said now speaking very carefully my mother was pretty heavily into the sauce what she had was very painful i was twelve had never seen this woman before and i was karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger i was not about to display my drunken mother to some mexican from america so abuela grabbed my arm and marched me into the house and into mothers bedroom and my mother somewhat belligerently said who the hell are you and what are you doing in my bedroom abuela said she didnt speak german so my mother switched to english and asked exactly the same question and abuela saidcastillos voice broke and he started to soband abuela said im jorges mother my dear and im here to take care of you and the boy he turned his back to beth and she saw him shaking with sobs and she saw him raise the bottle of schlitz and she ran to him to take it away from him and he didnt want to give it up they wrestled for it then he fell backward onto the floor pulling the bottle and beth on top of him as he went down neither remembered much of what happened after that or the exact sequence in which it happened just that it had the next thing they both knew was beth asking charley are you awake im afraid so i was hoping it was a dream its half past ten she said time marches on my god she said what happened you dont remember you sonofabitch she said and swung at him he caught her wrist and she fell on him i told you not to call me that he said and then it happened again viii the daleville inn daleville alabama february the rain was coming down in buckets and first lieutenant c g castillo who had gotten drenched going from the apache to base ops and then drenched again going from base ops to his car got drenched a third time going from where he had parked his car to the motel building the daleville inn was full of parents and wives who had come to see their offspring and mates get their wings pinned on them and one of these had inconsiderately parked in the slot reserved for room as he walked past the car and started up the stairs to the second floor the car in his slot flashed its lights at him and then blew its horn he was tempted to go to the car and deliver a lecture on motel parking lot courtesy but decided that was likely to get out of hand and satisfied himself with giving the driver the finger as he continued up the stairs he was standing at his door patting the many pockets of his soakingwet flight suit in search of his key when he heard someone bonging their way up the steel stairs then he sensed someone standing behind him i was just about to give up beth wilson said ive been sitting out there since six i was afraid of this he said afraid that id be here or that you wouldnt he said we have to talk charley oh yeah just talk nothing else would you believe i expected you to say something like that he found the key he opened the door waved her through it followed her in closed the door and only then turned the lights on you could have turned them on before you pushed me in here beth said i almost fell over your wastebasket but no one saw the generals daughter and the affianced of righteous randolph in castillos room did they as they would have had i turned the lights on first youre soaking wet beth said where have you been where would you guess ive been dressed as i am in my gi rompers you havent been flying oh yes i have randy called and said they were weathered in that there was weather all over this area and nobody could fly except courageous seagulls and pete kowalski he holds that coveted green special instrument card which permits him to decide for himself whether its safe to take off he told me that it would be educational and it was where were you the last leg was fulton county to here can you amuse yourself while i take a shower were going flying again in the morning and id rather not have pneumonia when i do that go ahead she said beth was sitting on the couch with her legs curled up under her skirt when he came into the living room she was wearing another transparent blouse through which he could see her brassiere i know she didnt do that on purpose i am now going to have a drink castillo announced not i hasten to add a martini we have learned our lesson about martinis havent we i really wish you wouldnt ive told you about ed mcmahon and oh boy did i earn it today do whatever you want i dont think you really mean that he said i meant about taking a drink oh and you knew it she said goddamn you charley you never quit he made himself a stiff scotch on the rocks and carried it to the couch you will notice i didnt offer you one he said raising the glass i noticed thank you so what have you decided to do about righteous i wish you wouldnt call him that so what have you decided to do about he who is nameless what do you mean what am i going to do about him if i may dare to offer some advice when you tell him youve thought things over and the wedding is off dont mention what caused you to do some serious reconsidering the weddings not off she said surprised youre still going to marry him of course what did you think i was going to do elope with you to panama city or someplace aware of the risk of having you throw something at me i have to tell you that is not one of your options i never thought it was im glad we can agree on at least that castillo said so youre going ahead with the wedding why is that so hard for you to understand think about it beth what happened last night was a mistake yes it was it made me reconsider the merits of the roman catholic church now what is that supposed to mean if youre a catholicand all the castillos but this one are devout roman catholicswhen you have sinned all you have to do is go to confession forgive me father for i have sinned convince the priest that youre sorry and he grants you absolution and all is forgiven clean slate forget it well at least youre sorry about yesterday on a strictly philosophical moral level yeah but satan has his claws in me and on another level im not sorry and i dont think ill ever forget it does that mean youre sorry or not i dont like the prospect of having always to remember that i plied my fathers buddys abouttobemarried daughter with martinis and had my wicked way with her my god not that i seem to recall there was much resistance involved you bastard youre learning castillo said and sipped his scotch it happened what we have to do is decide what were going to do about it is one of my options doing it again the cow so to speak being already out of the barn i wont even respond to that what i came to ask you is what i came to ask you last night will you take a part in the wedding jesus christ im a bastard not a hypocrite my mother this morning said she was going to ask you my father said it probably wasnt that good an idea she told him to ask you at supper he said he couldnt because you were stuck someplace because of the weather but hell ask you tomorrow he wont find me tomorrow trust me she didnt reply he said i just cant believe youre going to marry righteous just cant understand it i love him can you understand that no its as simple as that charley we have a lot in common i understand him he understands me i dont think he would understand what happened last night hes never going to know what happened last nightis he as tempting as it is for me to consider having it whispered down the long gray line that castillo nailed righteous randolphs fiancee five days before they got hitched i couldnt do that to you or your parents our sordid little secret will remain our sordid little secret thank you youre welcome beth got off the couch and said ill say good night good night she walked to the door he went with her she looked up at him thank you again she said good luck youre welcome again he said she took the lock off the door beth he said very seriously theres something ive got to tell you whats that dont get your hopes up too high about the wedding night the honeymoon excuse me ive seen righteous in the shower ive seen bigger youknowwhats on a pekingese he held up his right hand with the thumb and index finger barely apart to give her some idea of scale she swung her purse at him he caught her wrist she spit in his facethen fell into his arms she didnt go home until it was almost midnight by then it had stopped raining thirteen years later two cairns army airfield fort rucker alabama september the glistening white gulfstream iii taxied up to the visitors tarmac in front of the base operations building waving wands ground handlers directed it into a parking space between two army king air turboprops colonel jake torine looked out the cockpit window our reception committee apparently includes a buck general charley he said you want me to do the talking the reception committee walking toward them included four military policemen and half a dozen other men in uniform three of them were armed and wearing brassards on their sleeves making castillo think they were probably the aod the fod and the od which translated to mean the air officer of the day the field grade officer of the day and the officer of the day one of the others was a general officer and another man was more than likely his aide castillo hoped that a public information officer was not among them but that was a very real possibility cairns had not wanted them to land and they had had to declare an emergency please jake castillo said and take doherty with you maybe theyll be impressed with the fbi he followed torine into the passenger compartment jack he said to inspector doherty would you come flash your badge at these people they didnt want us to land doherty nodded and stood up castillo opened the stair door max came charging up the aisle headed for the door with madchen behind him they pushed torine out of the way and jumped to the ground max ran to one of the king airs and raised his leg at the nose gear madchen met the call of nature under the wing torine went down the stairs and saluted the general torine sir he said colonel usaf attached to the department of homeland security this is inspector doherty of the fbi would you like to see our identification i think that would be a good idea colonel the general said torine handed his identity card to the general doherty took out his credentials and held them open the general examined both carefully welcome to fort rucker he said im brigadier general crenshaw the deputy post commander im sorry about causing the fuss sir torine said but we had planned to land at hurlburt they took a pretty bad hit from katrina general crenshaw said and we were getting pretty low on fuel whered you come from im sorry sir but thats classified torine said the reason i asked had to do with customs and immigration colonel well do that when we get to washington sir presuming we can get fuel from you thats a civilian airplane general crenshaw said sir if you will contact general mcnab at special operations command im sure hell authorize you to fuel us you work for scotty mcnab do you with him sir okay colonel you have an honest face and the fbi seems to be vouching for you well fuel you anything else we can do for you two things sir forget we were ever here anduhthe dogs arent the only ones who need a pit stop they did have the urge didnt they general crenshaw said not a problem we can even feed you very kind of you sir well pass on the food but some coffee would be really appreciated is there a problem with me having a look at your airplane none at all sir torine said and waved the general toward the door stairs castillo stepped away from the door as crenshaw mounted the steps hello crenshaw said to him as he stepped inside who are you im the copilot sir air force secret service crenshaw studied him a moment then nodded then he raised his voice to those in the cabin although i understand youre not here gentlemen welcome to cairns army airfield and the army aviation center if youd care to use our facilities while youre here well throw in coffee and doughnuts then he turned to castillo again whered you learn how to fly if you dont mind my asking in texas sir crenshaw looked at him again then nodded and went down the stairs did he remember my face from somewhere he didnt ask my name my replies to his questions werent the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but i really did learn to fly in texas rather than here which is what i think he was asking and i have bona fide credentials of a secret service supervisory agent in my pocket so why am i uncomfortable because while im wildly out of step with others in the long gray line im still in it and a cadet does not lie or cheat or tolerate those who do how the hell did a nice young west pointer like me wind up doing what im doing thirtyfive minutes later cairns departure control cleared gulfstream three seven nine for immediate takeoff iii one signature flight support inc baltimorewashington international airport baltimore maryland september a black chevrolet sedan with a united states customs and border protection service decal on the door and four identical dark blue gmc yukon xl denalis were waiting for the gulfstream iii when it taxied up to the signature tarmac two uniformed customs officers got out of the chevrolet sedan and walked across the tarmac toward the aircraft major h richard miller jr in civilian clothing slid gingerly out of the front seat of the first yukon in the line turned and retrieved a crutch stuck it under his arm and moved with surprising agility after them as soon as the stair door opened into place one of the customs officers a grayhaired man in his fifties bounded quickly up it then stopped exclaimed jesus christ and then backed up so quickly that he knocked the second customs officer by then right behind him off the stairs and then fell backward onto him max appeared in the door growling deeply and showing an impressive array of teeth madchen moved beside him and added her voice and teeth to the display castillo appeared in the door gentlemen he said solemnly you have just personally witnessed the office of organizational analysis aircraft antiintrusion team in action the grayhaired customs officer gained his feet glared for a moment at the stair door and then shaking his head smiled very impressive colonel he said finally theyre okay max castillo said in hungarian you may now go piss max looked at him stopped growling went down the stairs and headed for the nose gear madchen went modestly to the other side of the fuselage you all right castillo said what the hell kind of dogs are they the grayhaired customs officer asked bouvier des flandres castillo said the customs officer shook his head what do they weigh he asked max has been known to hit onethirtyfive madchen maybe oneten you understand colonel sir miller said that you may now expect these gentlemen to really search your person and luggage what im hoping youll say colonel the customs officer said is that youre going to show me evidence that you passed through customs someplace else no castillo said we were going to do that at hurlburt field but the hurricane got hurlburt we refueled at fort rucker but we have to do the customs and immigration here everybody aboard american no castillo replied and waved them onto the gulfstream no more surprises i promise welcome to the united states the large customs officer said when he had stepped into the cabin or welcome home whichever the case may be there would be a band but i have been led to believe that everybody would prefer to enter the united states as quietly as possible what were going to do is collect the american passports and run them through the computers in the main terminal thenpresuming the computer doesnt tell us there are outstanding warrants on anybodythey will be returned to you and you can be on your way he looked around the cabin and continued i just learned that some of you are not american citizens which means that well have to check your visas i think we can run them through the computers without any trouble but i think wed better have a look at them before we try to do that understood when there were nods he pulled a heavy plastic bag from his pocket and finished his speech and if any of you are carrying forbidden substances not only moodaltering chemicals of one kind or another but raw fruits and vegetables any meat product not in an unopened canthat sort of thingnow is the time to deposit them in this bag as my patriotic duty castillo said i have to mention that the cigarettes that irishman has been smoking dont smell like marlboros he pointed the customs officer looked and ive seen his picture hanging in the post office too the customs officer said and walked to the man with his hand extended how are you jack and what the hell are you doing with this crew hoping nobody sees me inspector doherty said and what are you doing in a uniform the director of national intelligence suggested it would be appropriate say hello to edgar delchamps doherty said ill vouch for him use your judgment about the others ed this is chief inspector bob mitchell the men shook hands youre with the bureau mitchell asked eds the exception to the rule about people who get paid from langley doherty said when he shakes your hand bob you get all five fingers back actually im with the fish and wildlife service delchamps said mitchell chuckled the other customs officer handed mitchell several passports take a look at these inspector he said when was the last time you saw a handwritten nonexpiring multivisit visa signed by an ambassador its been a while mitchell said he looked at the passports and added an argentine a german and two hungarians all issued the same day in buenos aires interesting id love to know whats going on here but you were told not to ask right doherty said sorry bob we also serve who look but do not see or ask questions mitchell said well i think i had better run these through the computer myself im sure all kinds of warning bells and whistles are going to go off thank you mr mitchell castillo said i always try to be nice to people i feel sorry for colonel mitchell said excuse me i bear a message from our boss colonel the ambassador said quote ask colonel castillo to please call me the minute he gets off the airplane unquote oh i see what you mean thats the first time i can remember the ambassador saying please thats probably because hes not my boss castillo replied he just thinks he is thats probably even worse isnt it yes it is castillo agreed mitchell smiled and nodded okay thisll take ten or fifteen minutes you can start unloading whatever you have to unload thank you castillo said consider it your hearty meal for the condemned man mitchell said shook his hand and went to the stair door castillo turned to miller so where do i find a secure phone theres one in your yukon i said a secure phone and i said colonel sir in your yukon miller said and made a grand gesture toward the stair door miller motioned for castillo to precede him into the backseat of one of the dark blue yukons then not without difficulty he stowed his crutch got in beside him and closed the door there was a telephone handset mounted on the rear of the drivers seat in the yukon except for an extraordinarily thick cord it looked like a perfectly normal handset thats secure castillo asked secure and brandnew miller replied a present from your pal aloysius really he called up three or four days ago asked of your general health and welfare then asked if there was anything he could do for us i told him i couldnt think of a thing he said he had a new toy he thought you might like to play with one in its developmental phase miller pointed at the telephone so yesterday i was not surprised when the secret service guy said there were some people from afc seeking access to your throne room in the complex i was surprised when they came up to see that one of them was aloysius in the flesh aloysius francis casey phd electrical engineering mit was a small palefaced man who customarily dressed in baggy black suits he also was the founder chairman of the board and principal stockholder of the afc corporation afc had a vast laboratory and three manufacturing facilities that provided a substantial portion of worldwide encrypted communications to industry in the form of leased technology during the vietnam war thensergeant casey had served with distinction as the commo man on several special forces ateams he had decided immediately after the first desert war that it was payback time preceded by a telephone call from the senior us senator from nevada he had arrived at fort bragg in one of afcs smaller jets and explained to thenmajor general bruce j mcnab that save for the confidence that being a green beanie had given him he would almost certainly have become either a boston copor maybe a postmanafter his vietnam service not that casey found either occupation wanting instead he said his green beanie service had given him the confidence to attempt the impossible in his case he explained that meant getting into mit without a high school diploma on the strength of his selftaught comprehension of both radio wave propagation and cryptographic algorithms a professor casey had said took a chance on a scrawny little irishman with the balls to ask for something like getting into mit and arranged for me to audit classes by the end of my freshman year i got my high school diploma by the end of my second year i had my bs the next year i got my masters and started afc by the time i got my doctorate two years later afc was up and running the professor who gave me my chanceheinz walleis now afcs vice president of research and development i now have more money than i can spend so its payback time general mcnab had asked him exactly what he had in mind dr casey replied that he knew the armys equipment was two three years obsolete before the first piece of it was delivered what im going to do is see that special forces has stateoftheart stuff general mcnab said that was a great idea but as sergeantdr casey must know procurement of signal equipment was handled by signal corps procurement officials over whom special forces had absolutely no control im not about to get involved trying to sell anything to those paperpushing bastards dr casey had said what im going to do is give you the stuff and charge it off to r ampd general mcnab was never one to pass up an opportunity and asked it sounds like a great idea how would you suggest we get started dr casey had then jerked his thumb at general mcnabs aidedecamp second lieutenant c g castillo who had met dr caseys lear at pope afb because general mcnab had better things to do with his time than entertain some expletive deleted civilian with friends in the expletive deleted us senate any further than buying the expletive deleted lunch lieutenant castillo had taken dr casey on a helicopter tour of fort bragg and fayetteville north carolina until lunchtime by the time they landed on the officers club lawn dr casey had learned the young officer had earned both the pilots wings and combat infantry badge sewn to his bdu jacket and decided he was one tough and smart little sonofabitch what about me taking the boy wonder here back to vegas with me after lunch he can see what we have and what you need and we can wing it from there charley general mcnab had ordered lieutenant castillo go pack a bag and try to stay out of trouble in las vegas aloysius had this put in castillo asked picking up the handset youre not listening colonel sir dick miller said aloysius put it in with his own freckled fingers white house the handset announced jesus castillo said im afraid hes not on the circuit the white house operator said anyone else youd like to speak to this line is secure castillo asked doubtfully this line is secure ill be damned if you keep up the profanity you probably will be colonel how do you know im a colonel castillo said because this link is listed as colonel castillos mobile one the operator said and because the voice identification circuit just identified you as colonel castillo himself i will be damned its amazing isnt it the operator said and aside from major miller youre the first call weve handled even my boss is amazed can i put you through to someone colonel or are you just seeing how it works ambassador montvale on a secure line please montvale good evening sir castillo didnt take you long to find a secure line did it charley youve been on the ground only twelve minutes well im using the one in my yukon then this is not a secure line the white house assures me its secure sir in your truck yes sir dont you have a secure line in your vehicle there was a pause which caused castillo to smirk at the mental image he had of the face that montvale was now making well talk about that when i see you montvale said how long is it going to take you to get to your alexandria house well i think we can leave here in fifteen minutes or so and then however long it takes to get to the house ive never been there whos with you charley montvale asked and then before castillo could answer went on bring everybody with you who might know something about the possible compromise i gather that you mean sir to the house in alexandria are there any problems with that none sir except you and i are meeting with the president at eight oclock tomorrow morning montvale interrupted i dont want to meet him unprepared any problems with that inspector doherty was just on the phone to his wife telling her hed be right home well i especially want to see him have him call her back and tell her hes being delayed i want everybody at your house excuse me mr ambassador but isnt there an agreement between us that you dont give me orders for the moment there is montvale said icily let me rephrase ill be grateful colonel for the opportunity to meet with you and everybody with knowledge of the possible compromise at your earliest convenience say in approximately one hour in alexandria ill do my best to have everyone there as soon as possible mr ambassador there was a click on the line as montvale hung up without saying anything else castillo put the handset in its cradle i didnt see doherty using his cellular miller said either did i castillo said you just like to pull the tigers tail right if i dont dick id find myself asking permission to take a leak yeah miller said thoughtfully after a moment then he asked what has to go to the complex not that much one filing cabinet just about full of paper and then a dozen external hard drives what do i do about the weapons id take them to the house miller said okay castillo said you heard all this stan miller asked the secret service driver uhhuh ill take care of it somebodyll have to sit on the filing cabinet and the hard drives castillo said unless we can get everything into the vault tonight i think ill have somebody sit on the vault colonel after we get everything inside thank you castillo said two west boulevard drive alexandria virginia september the first impression castillo had of the new property was that it was a typical alexandria redbrick twostory home the exception being perhaps the size of its lot the front lawn was at least one hundred yards from west boulevard drive but his first impression changed as the yukon rolled up the driveway castillo saw that the rise in the lawn concealed both a circular drive in front of the house and a large area in front of the basement garage on the right there was another yukon xl parked there and a buick sedan but there was still room enough for the three yukons in the convoy to park easily the yukons probably montvales hes too exalted to drive a lowly buick particularly since a yukon with a secret service driver from the white house pool is the status symbol in washington and if it is his hes waiting for me in the living room in the largest chair finally having succeeded in summoning me to the throne room as the first yukon reached the house the triple garage doors opened one by one the secret service driver of castillos yukon drove inside the garage and the other two followed suit the doors began to close the garage ran all the way under the house there was room for three more yukons and some other vehicles the walls were lined with shelves and on them were old cans of paint coils of water hose and other things that people stored in garages well miller told me that the kids of the people who owned this place had removed the valuable stuff paint cans and water hoses dont count as valuable stuff there were two familiar faces standing at the foot of an extraordinarily wide basementtohouse stairway one of them a large redhaired irishman was secret service supervisory special agent thomas mcguire who had joined the office of organizational analysis at its beginning the other was mrs agnes forbison a grayhaired gettingjustalittlechubby lady in her late forties who had been one of thensecretary of homeland security matt halls executive assistants and who also had joined ooa at its beginning her title now was ooas deputy chief for administration well the buick is probably agness and the yukon toms so where is the ambassador castillo got out of the yukon and walked to them he and mcguire shook hands agnes kissed his cheek montvale castillo asked i expect hell be here shortly agnes said and then jesus mary and joseph max and madchen had been freed from one of the other yukons and made right for them this is max and his lady friend madchen castillo explained agnes squatted and rubbed maxs ears pretty puppy she said madchen shouldered max out of the way and you too sweetheart agnes added now rubbing madchens ears tom mcguire eyed both animals warily montvales meeting us here castillo said you didnt think he would be waiting for you did you chief agnes said looking up at him and then added we bought everything we could think of except of course dog food if you bought a rib roast thatd do castillo said agnes stood up you want a look around before the ambassador gets here she asked please castillo said how many beds do we have how many do you need that many castillo said pointing to the others who were now standing around the yukons less doherty wholl probably go home agnes used her index finger to count colonel jake torine usaf first lieutenant edmund lorimer usa corporal lester bradley usmc sergeant major john k davidson usa colonel alfredo munz edgar delchamps special agent david w yung of the fbi sandor tor and eric kocian not counting inspector doherty she computed aloud thats nine plus you and dick thats a total of eleven no problem theres six bedrooms all with double beds one of you will actually be alone that would be me madam eric kocian announced advancing on her the sacrifices i am willing to make to contribute to this enterprise do not include sharing a bedroom mrs forbison eric kocian castillo said i am charmed madam kocian said taking the hand agnes extended and raising it to his lips from the look on her facethe pleased looki think its been some time since she has had her hand kissed i hope you will not take offense madam kocian went on if i say i have urgent need of a restroom preferably one inside well put you in my room billy castillo said ill bunk with miller splendid kocian said has this place got a fenced backyard castillo asked uhhuh agnes said if youll show me that ill put max and madchen out and tom can show the old gentleman to his quarters old gentleman kocian snorted and then we can get everybody settled in before we have to face the dragon agness tour of the house ended in a small study bookcases lined three of its walls a stuffed mallard and two stuffed fisha trout and a king mackerelwere mounted on the remaining wall there were a few books scattered on the shelves mostly tenyearold and older novels windows opened to the left and rear through it castillo saw that floodlights around a decentsized swimming pool had been turned on max was happily paddling about in the pool while madchen stood on the side and barked at him the study was furnished with a small desk a wellworn blue leather judges chair and a soiled wellworn chaise lounge none of which had obviously struck the heirs as worth taking there was a telephone on the desk but castillo didnt pay much attention to it until it buzzed and a red light began to flash on its base then he saw the thick cord that identified it as a secure telephone agnes picked it up c g castillos line she said then yes the colonel is available for ambassador montvale and handed him the phone castillo charles montvale colonel we will be at your door in approximately five minutes im looking forward to it sir castillo replied and then when a click told him that montvale had hung up added about as much as i would visiting an afghan dentist with a footpowered drill agnes looked at him i gather youre speaking from experience painful experience castillo said with both how do you want to handle this i will receive the ambassador in here where he will find me carefully studying my computer which i will close when he enters have everybody but kocian tor bradley and of course lieutenant lorimer in the living room well have to bring chairs from the kitchen or someplace else for them i guess the living room had a beamed ceiling a brick fireplace and hardwood floors there were two small and rather battered carpets that the children of the former owner also had apparently decided were not of value to them marks on the floor showed where the valuable carpets had lain and marks on the wall showed where picture frames had hung there were four red leather armchairs and a matching couch that also had apparently missed the cut although they looked fine to castillo another stuffed trout was mounted above the fireplace and there was some kind of animal hoofmaybe an elks castillo guessedconverted into an ashtray that sat on a heavy and battered coffee table scarred with whiskey glass rings and cigarette burns castillo had decided he probably would have liked the former owners he was already feeling comfortable in their house ambassador montvale colonel agnes announced from the study door five minutes later castillo closed the lid of his laptop and stood up please come in mr ambassador he said montvale wordlessly shook his hand i havent had a chance to make this place homey castillo said the chaise lounge all right or would you rather sit in that he pointed to the judges chair thisll be fine thank you montvale said and sat at the foot of the chaise lounge it was a very low chaise lounge montvales knees were now higher than his buttocks getting right to it charley montvale said how bad is the compromise situation i think its under control id be happier if you said youre confident its under control think is the best i can do for now sorry tell me whats happened and then ill tell you why its so dangerous we were all watching hurricane katrina on the television when corporal bradley marched in with a guy at gunpoint a guy max had caught coming through the fence max montvale interrupted who the hell is max castillo walked to the window and pointed less than gracefully montvale got to his feet joined him at the window and looked out max had tired of his swim climbed out of the pool and in the moment montvale looked out was shaking himself dry you could have said our watchdog charley montvale said disapprovingly then curiosity overwhelmed him god hes enormous what is he they are bouvier des flandres theres a pretty credible story that hitler lost one of his testicles to one of them when he was corporal schickelgruber in flanders it is a fact that when he went back to flanders as der fuhrer he ordered the breed eliminated fascinating montvale said as he walked to the judges leather chair and sat down it is also a fact that when hitler was a corporal he was corporal hitler that schickelgruber business was something the oss came up with during world war two its known as ridiculing your enemy really castillo said then thought you sonofabitch you grabbed my chair well ill be goddamned if im going to sit on that chaise lounge and look up at you castillo leaned on the wall beside the window and folded his arms over his chest trust me montvale said its a fact now getting back to what happened after that outsized dog caught the guy he turned out to be an assistant military attache in our embassy in asuncion paraguay first lieutenant edmund lorimer formerly of special forces now of intelligence one of his pals a dea agent name i can get it from lorimer if its important to you lorimer any connection with our lorimers just a coincidence where is this chap upstairs go on well lorimer is clever he put together all the gossip and when the drug guys kidnapped his dea agent pal he decided that colonel costellogetting my name wrong was about the only mistake he madewas just the man who could play james bond and get back his pal and he came looking for me and found me charley how would you go about getting this dea agent back i dont know howor ifthat could be done and i havent given it any thought because its none of my business you have no idea how pleased i am that you realize that montvale said it is none of your business and i strongly recommend you dont forget that castillo didnt reply but his face clearly showed that montvales comment interested him montvale nodded in reply indicating that he was about to explain himself senator homer johns came to see me several days ago montvale said the junior senator from new hampshire of the senate intelligence committee castillo nodded to show that he knew of johns he told me that the day before he had spoken with his brotherinlaw montvale paused for dramatic effect then went on who is the presidents envoy plenipotentiary and extraordinary to the republic of uruguay ambassador michael a mcgrory he paused again i think i now have your full attention charley dont i castillo chuckled and nodded this is not a laughing matter montvale said waited for that to register and then went on there are those who think mcgrory owes his present job to the senator his career in the state department had been kindly mediocre before he was named ambassador to uruguay the senator said he was calling to send his sister best wishes on her birthday in the course of their conversation however the ambassador just happened to mentionpossibly to make the point that there he was on the front line of international diplomacy proving he indeed was worthy of the influence the senator had exercised on his behalfthe trouble he was having with the uruguayan foreign ministry specifically he said that shortly after a drug dealer one dr jeanpaul lorimer an american employed by the un had been assassinated on his estancia the deputy foreign minister had made an unofficial call on him during which he as much as accused the ambassador of concealing from him that the assassins were american special forces troops ouch castillo said indeed montvale replied according to senator johns the ambassador proudly related how he had dealt with the situation mcgrory apparently threw the deputy foreign minister out of his office but then johnsthe senator said his curiosity was piquedhad a chat with the uruguayan ambassador here in dc who assured him lorimers murder had been thoroughly investigated by the uruguayan authorities who were convinced that it was drug related as was the death of another american one howard kennedy who was found beaten to death in the conrad hotel in punta del este the ambassador told the senator off the record that there was reason to believe kennedy was associated with your good friend aleksandr pevsner who he had heard is in that part of the world and that pevsner was probably behind everything and what do you think senator johns believes castillo asked i dont know what he believes i think he suspects that something took place down there that his brilliant brotherinlaw doesnt know something that the government of uruguay would just as soon sweep under the rug and i suspect that the senator would love to find out that the president sent special forces down there he didnt he sent me thats splitting a hair charley and you know it the question then is is your operation going to be blown i dont think so theres that word think again montvale interrupted i dont think there will be any trouble starting in uruguay castillo said the head of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional chief inspector jose ordonezi thought i told you this tell me again montvale said ordonez was at the conrad when we got there he actually took us to see the bodies bodies plural plural the other one was lieutenant colonel viktor zhdankov of the fsbs service for the protection of the constitutional system and the fight against terrorism delchamps told ordonez who it was and ordonez made the point that delchamps was wrong that zhdankov was a czech businessman quietly ordonez said it would provide problems for him and the uruguayan government if he had to start investigating the murders of a senior russian intelligence officer and a man known to have close ties to aleksandr pevsner now it was castillos turn to let what he had said sink in after a moment montvale nodded thoughtfully castillo went on ordonez then said his investigation of the bodies at lorimers estancia had made him believe that it was another drug deal gone wrong that he doubted that any arrests would be made and that for all practical purposes the case was closed he added that he thought it would be a good idea for us to leave uruguay right then and stay away until all the quote bad memories unquote had a chance to fade and you think he knows the truth the first time i told you about thisand now i remember when i didi told you that hes a very smart cop and has a very good idea of exactly what happened thats why ihere comes that word again sorrythink that were safe as far as uruguay is concerned and in argentina you left bodies lying around there too munz says he thinks the argentine government would like the whole businessmastersons murder in particular but what happened in the sheraton garage tooforgotten munzand i remember telling you this toosays he thinks the argentine government is perfectly happy to chalk up the sheraton shooting to drug dealers their alternative being investigating what lieutenant colonel yevgeny komogorov of the fsb was doing with a uzi in his hand when he got blown away in the garage they couldnt keep that out of the newspapers montvale considered that grunted and asked where is munz in the living room with the others delchamps too you said everybody ambassador lets go talk to them montvale said and then as if remembering castillo didnt like being ordered around added id like confirmation of what you told me charley no offense none taken or would you rather ask them to come in here castillo pushed himself away from the wall and gestured toward the door the battered coffee table in the living room now held a bottle of famous grouse a bottle of jack daniels and a cheap plastic water pitcher telling castillo the odds were that he now was entertaining everybody with his liquor stock from his vacated suite in the mayflower hotel keep your seats gentlemen montvale ordered somewhat grandly and entirely unnecessarily as nobody in the room showed the slightest indication of wanting to stand up for any reason they all looked at him however as he scanned the room and finally selected the fireplace as his podium he was tall enough so that he could rest his elbow on the mantel he was seeking to establish an informal friendly ambience he failed everyone knew what his relationship with castillo was the situation is this gentlemen montvale began senator johns has an inkling of what went on in uruguay and argentina colonel castillo tells me that he doesnt think the operation has been compromised im concerned about a possible serious embarrassment to the president and therefore id like to be sure that its not going to blow up in our faces no one responded mr delchamps would you care to comment delchamps took a healthy swallow of his drink i vote with charley he said simply thirty minutes after the kid marched lorimer into the living room charley ordered the shutdown and we were out of argentina within hours charley ordered what i thought were exactly the right actions to shut the mouths of anyone else who might be theorizing but shit happens this may get compromised i just dont think it will delchamps looked at the others in the room who nodded their agreement montvale chuckled did i say something funny delchamps challenged oh no not at all montvale said quickly what i was thinking was its really a rather amusing situation what we have in this room are very skilled highly experienced intelligence officers enjoying the confidence of the president who were nonetheless forced to shut down their operationwhat did you say you were out of argentina within hoursbecause of one unimportant little lieutenant who had no idea what he was sticking his nose into youll have to admit that is rather amusing no one else seemed to find it amusing delchamps took another swallow of his drink looked thoughtfulif not annoyedfor a moment then shrugged his shoulders let me tell you about that unimportant little lieutenant mr montvale he said an edge to his tone please do montvale said sarcastically jack doherty and i had a long talk with him on the trip from ba delchamps said its not that he was running at the moutheven willing to talk what it was mr montvale is that jack and i between us have more experience pulling things from reluctant people than you are old montvales face showed no response to that we started out to learn who hed been running his mouth to delchamps went on and what hed said the first impression we got was that he had been listening not running his mouth and that was the impression we had when we finished right jack thats it doherty agreed hes one hell of a young man mr ambassador who talks too much montvale said and has come close to compromising your operation listen to what im saying for christs sake delchamps said just who do you think youre talking to montvale demanded your name i understand is montvale do you know who youre talking to ill wager youre about to tell me montvale said icily something more i mean than that youre a midlevel officer of the cia i wondered how long it would take you to get around to that delchamps said christ youre all alike whos all alike montvale challenged what the good guys in the clandestine service call the washington assholes delchamps said matteroffactly i will not be talked to like that montvale flared washington asshole or not im the director of national intelligence delchamps smiled you wont be dni long if this presidential finding blows up in your face the president will feed you to senator johns the term for that is sacrificial lamb you montvale not charley charley is not fat enough to be fed as a sacrificial lamb to the senate committee on intelligence they like large wellknown sacrificial lambs for the headlines and sound bites with their names they locked eyes for a moment then delchamps went on calmly as i was saying it is my professional assessment and that of inspector doherty that lieutenant lorimer did not at any time share with anyone anything that he suspected might be classified what he did as i said before mr montvale was listen and with a skill belying his youth and experience put together a rather complete picture of what colonel castillo has done in compliance with the presidential finding and then he made a mistake which considering his youth and inexperience is perfectly understandable hes naive in other words he believed that there had to be someone in the system somewhere who would really care about his pal timmons and do the right thing the right thing montvale repeated drily do something but wring their hands such as delchamps ignored the question instead he said let me paint the picture for you mr montvale the paraguayan authorities notified our ambassador that an embassy vehicle had been found parked against the fence surrounding silvio pettirossi international airport directly across the field from the terminal building in the backseat of the suv on the floor was the body of one franco julio cesar thirtynine years old a paraguayan national employed as a chauffeur by the us embassy el senor cesar was dead of asphyxiation caused by a metallic garrote having been placed around his neck by party or parties unknown this guy had been garroted castillo interrupted a metal garrote yeah ace thats what the paraguayan cops reported delchamps said is that of some significance montvale asked delchamps ignored him again a check of embassy records revealed that senor cesar had been dispatched to drive special agent byron j timmons jr of the dea to the airport nothing was known of agent timmons at that time late the next morning however a motorcycle messenger delivered an envelope to the embassy which contained a color photograph of special agent timmons it showed him sitting in a chair holding a copy of that days ultima hora one of the local newspapers there were four men their faces concealed by balaclava masks standing with special agent timmons one of them held the tag end of a metallic garrote which was around timmonss neckone yank on that and hed wind up like el senor cesar sonofabitch castillo muttered there was no message of any kind delchamps went on at this point the senior dea agent in charge summoned lieutenant lorimer to his office when lorimer got there he found the consul general who lorimer suspected was in fact the cia station chief and the legal attache they asked lieutenant lorimer who was known to be timmonss friend and who occupied an apartment immediately next to timmonss if he had any idea who might have kidnapped special agent timmons to which lorimer replied gypsies you knowblasphemy omittedwell who kidnapped him or words to that effect and then asked so what are we going to do about getting him back to which the cia station chief replied the matter is of course being handled by the paraguayan capital police force which has promised to notify us promptly of any developments and there is every reason to believe that timmons will be ultimately freed or words to that effect to which lieutenant lorimer replied as ablasphemy deletedjunkie you mean providing we dont do ourblasphemy deletedjob at which point after being admonished to get his emotions under control and ordered not to discuss the kidnapping with anyone lorimer was dismissed and so he went looking for colonel costello in the belief that this costello was not your typical candyass ed whats that about as a junkie castillo asked well ace according to lorimerand doherty agrees with me that lorimer probably isnt making this upthe way things work down therethere have been four other kidnappings lorimer says he knows aboutwhat the bad guys do is snatch a dea guyor an fbi guy or a dia guythen let the embassy know hes alive if shortly thereafter some heavy movement of cocaine goes off all right they turn him loose payment for everybody looking the other way but whats with the junkie castillo pursued im getting to that to show their contempt for gringos generally and to keep their prisoner captive and quiet by the time they turn him loose his arm is riddled with needle tracks hes lucky to have a vein thats not collapsed theyve turned him into a cokesometimes a crackjunkie castillo shook his head in amazement and if their movement of drugs is interdicted he asked softly according to lorimer there have been four kidnappings of dea agents in paraguay since hes been therefive counting timmons three have been turned loose full of drugs one was found dead of an overdose shortly after about five hundred kilosmore than half a tonof refined coke was grabbed in argentina on a fruit boat floating down the paraguay river not garroted castillo asked delchamps shook his head full of cocaine he said what happens to the ones who are turned loose they are quietly given the best medical attention available for drug addiction delchamps said in anticipation of their return to full duty he paused want to guess how often that works probably not very often ambassador montvale said and that doesnt bother you castillo snapped of course it bothers me but we have to look at the big picture right delchamps said sarcastically dea agents know their duties are going to place them in danger montvale nodded he said how likely do you think it is that this dea agent his name is timmons delchamps said very well montvale replied how likely do you think it is that special agent timmonsand every other dea agent dia agentlieutenant lorimer for exampleand cia officer in the embassy in asuncion volunteered for the assignment delchamps looked at him for a moment then said and that means lorimer is an unimportant little lieutenant and timmons is an unimportant little dea agent right that was an unfortunate choice of words montvale said but isnt important a relative term which would you say is more important mr delchamps preserving the confidentiality of the presidential finding the compromise of which would embarrass the president and just about destroy the fruits of the investigation you and inspector doherty and the others are about to complete or sending an unimportant little lieutenant to a weather station in the aleutian islands for a year or two to make sure he keeps his mouth shut delchamps didnt reply montvale went on or which would be less wise to send colonel castillo and his merry band to paraguay to take on a drug cartel which could carry with it obviously the very real risk of compromising the finding and in addition render the ooa impotent or letting the people for whom special agent timmons works in paraguay deal with the matter no one is suggesting that charleys guys go rescue timmons delchamps said we all know that wouldnt work im glad you realize that montvale said lorimer is not going to be sent to the aleutian islands castillo said or anything like that both montvale and delchamps looked at him surprised that he had gone off on a tangent what are you going to do with him ace delchamps asked after a moment the first thing that comes to mind is to send him to bragg let him be an instructor or something thatll work delchamps asked i think so i dont think thats a satisfactory solution montvale said how can you guarantee he wont do something irrational at fort bragg i cant but since the decision about how to deal with him is mine to make thats where hes going he may in fact be an unimportant little lieutenant in your big picture but in mine hes a dedicated soldier who did exactly what i would have done in the circumstances you told me something like that before montvale said you remember my response castillo nodded something to the effect that his having done what i would have done made you uncomfortable the implication was that im also a loose cannon there is that matter of the black hawk helicopter you borrowed in afghanistan montvale said that might make some people think that way yeah id agree with that delchamps said but on the other hand the bottom line is the president doesnt think he is montvale glared at him delchamps went on i hate to be a party pooper mr montvale but unless you want to kick the can around some more its now about one in the morning and an old man like me needs his rest yes and i would agree that were through here montvale said eight oclock in the apartment colonel castillo based on what you and these gentlemen have told me i dont think we need concern the president that the southern cone operations may have been compromised do you i dont think it has or will be mr ambassador castillo said good evening gentlemen montvale said thank you for your time he nodded at all of them and walked out of the room three the breakfast room the presidential apartments the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc september the only person in the breakfast room when the secret service agent opened the door for ambassador montvale and lieutenant colonel castillo was secretary of state natalie cohen a small slight paleskinned woman who wore her black hair in a pageboy cut she was standing by the window holding a cup of coffee as she watched the presidential helicopter flutter down to the lawn when she saw montvale and castillo she smiled set her coffee cup on a small table and walked to them i was hoping id have a moment alone with you charles she said so that i could ask you where our wandering boy was natalie montvale said as the secretary of state walked to castillo and kissed his cheek welcome home wandering boy she said when did you get back last night madam secretary castillo said we have a little problem charley she said yes maam katrina has put fifteen feet of water over ambassador lorimers home in new orleans she said he and his wife are at the masterson plantationwhich is apparently just outside the area of mass destruction along the mississippi gulf coastand he called me to ask if i could give him the precise address of his late sons plantationestanciain uruguay at which he intends to live until he can move back into his house in new orleans jesus castillo said when i told him i didnt have the address he said that mr masterson had told him that you know where it is and asked how he could get in touch with you at the risk of repeating myself madame secretary castillo said jesus may i reasonably infer from your reaction that theres a problem with this yes maam theres a problem with that castillo said why cant he just stay with the mastersons that question occurred to me too but of course i couldnt ask it whats the nature of the problem what about the apartment in paris castillo said he inherited that too i suggested to the ambassador that he would probably be more comfortable in an apartment in paris than on a ranchan estanciain uruguay his response to that suggested hes about as much a francophobe as you are charley he wants to go to the estancia and theres not much we can do to stop him except of course you talking him out of going down there i asked you what the problem is castillo looked at montvale then raised his hands in a gesture of helplessness things happened down there natalie montvale said which suggested the possibility the presidential finding might be at risk of compromise castillo thinks operative word thinks that his shutting down his operation there has removed the threat but lorimer going down there would pose problems why charley the secretary asked simply more important what things happened down there a tooclever young dia officer assigned to our embassy in asuncion has pretty well figured out whats taken place down there montvale answered for him oh god castillo has brought this young officer back with him and intends to send him to fort bragg in what i think is the rather wishful belief that there he will keep what he has learned to himself ive also taken steps to shut mouths in montevideo buenos aires and asuncion castillo said and i think the threat of compromise is pretty well reduced again the operative word is thinks montvale said although i dont believe we should worry the president with the situation at this time but ambassador lorimer going down there might change that she replied and then before anyone could answer she asked why charley there is a very clever uruguayan cop chief inspector jose ordonez who has figured out just about everything that happened down there castillo said i talked with him in punta del este right after they found the bodies of howard kennedy and lieutenant colonel viktor zhdankov of the fsb beaten to death in the conradea plush hotel and casino he said he believed kennedy was a drug dealer and zhdankov the czech businessman that his passport said he was and that the bodies at shangrila lorimers estancia including lorimers were also the result of a drug deal gone wrong and that he doubted if anyone would ever be arrested and then he suggested that i leave uruguay as quickly as possible and not return until quote the bad memories had time to fade unquote which of course i did and ambassador lorimer going down there would possibly pull the scab off this she asked castillo nodded theres more natalie montvale said senator johns came to see me and implied that he thinks his brotherinlaw the ambassador was kept in the dark about a special forces team operating in uruguay god she said how bad is that at the moment under control but if lorimer goes down there if lorimer goes down where the president of the united states asked as he walked into the breakfast room heading for the coffee service good morning mr president the secretary of state the director of national intelligence and lieutenant colonel castillo said almost in unison good morning the president said as he poured himself a cup of coffee then he turned im especially glad to see you charley you have this wonderful ability to show up at the exact moment i need you when did you get back last night mr president if lorimer goes down there what the president asked natalie cohen said ambassador lorimers home in new orleans is under the water mr his and several hundred thousand other peoples the president interrupted my god what a disaster and he called me and asked for directions to his sons ranch in uruguay in which or at which he intends to live until he can get back in his home and that poses problems it may sir montvale said how bad problems the president asked not catastrophic mr president montvale said but potentially dangerous i cant imagine why the hellyeah now that i think about it i can imagine why hed want to go down there far from the mess in new orleans and its cheapright charleyto live down there yes sir it is if its not going to cause catastrophic problems for us i dont think its any of our business what he does the president said we have other problems to deal with aside from katrina i mean sir natalie cohen asked the president sipped his coffee then said two days ago the mayor of chicago called me now i know you two are above sordid politics but ill bet charley can guess how important cook county is to me right charley i think i have an idea mr president castillo said and knowing that youll all understand why i responded in the affirmative when the mayor asked me to do him a personal favor yes sir the three said chuckling almost in unison and when i heard what favor he was asking i was glad that i had replied in the affirmative because it pissed me off too if id known about this i would have taken action myself known about what mr president montvale said youre the director of national intelligence charles the president said so i am presuming you a know whats going on in paraguay and b have a good reason for not telling me about it im afraid i dont know what youre talking about mr president montvale said you have any idea what im talking about natalie im afraid not mr president well then let me tell you the president said what the drug cartel down there has been doing is kidnapping our agents and then either turning them into junkies or giving them fatal overdoses of what we euphemistically call controlled substances are you learning this for the first time charles no sir of course im aware of the situation natalie ive heard of the abductions mr president but not about theuhbusiness of making the agents drug addicts charley are you learning this for the first time now no sir why doesnt that surprise me the president said sometime when we have time charles we can have a long philosophical discussion of what the dni should or should not pass on to the commanderinchief but right now all we have time for is dealing with the problem i have come by my intelligence regarding this situation from his honor the mayor it seems that his father who was you recall his honor the mayor for a very long time had a lifelong pal one francis big frank timmons who the current mayor told me his father said was one of the only two really honest cops in chicago the mayor told me that big frank timmons called him and asked him for a favor the mayor who was bounced on big franks knees as an infant and calls him uncle frank said name it or something like that big frank told the mayor that his son byronwho is a captain on the chicago police forcejust had a visit from an official of the drug enforcement administration who told him that his son special agent byron j timmons jr of the dea was missing from his assignment at the us embassy inwhatever the hell the capital city isin paraguay asuncion castillo furnished without thinking the presidents face showed that he was not very grateful for the information and that the possibility he had been kidnapped had to be faced although they had no proof of that castillo exhaled audibly whats with the deep breathing charley the president asked pardon me mr president what does it mean colonel the president demanded coldly sir i dont know if the dea man in chicago knew this but the embassy in asuncion knew the day after timmons disappeared that he had been kidnapped they sent a photograph of him surrounded by men in balaclava masks and with a garrote around his neck how long have you known about this the president asked that timmons had been kidnapped abouthe paused and did the arithmeticthirtysix hours mr president i learned about the photograph being sent to the embassy about midnight last night sir and you charles the president asked i learned of this incident for the first time last night mr president when colonel castillo did and you natalie im hearing about this manspecial agent timmonsfor the first time now mr president im sure the embassy made a report i can simply presume it never made it to my desk i guess not the president said well it seems that special agent timmons wrote his grandfatherwho bounced the mayor on his knee you will recallabout what was happening down there he said there have been four such kidnappings his makes five so neither he nor captain timmons was very much impressed with what the dea representative had told them the word they used to describe it forgive me madam secretary was bullshit at that point big frank timmons called the mayor mr president montvale said just as soon as youre finished with us ill get on the telephone to our ambassador in paraguay no you wont charles the president said sir what i told the mayor was that i have an inhouse expert for dealing with matters like this and just as soon as i could lay my hands on him i was going to tell him that his first priority was to get special agent timmons back from these bastards sir you dont mean charley the secretary of state asked natalie who else could i possibly mean the president said but it clearly was more a statement than a question mr president she said i dont think thats a very good idea your objection noted the president said mr president with all possible respect castillo said i dont know anything about dealing with something like this how much did you know about finding a stolen airliner colonel or a missing un official sir with respect i know nothing about the drug trade i thought the way this works is the superior officer gives an order and the subordinate officer says yes sir and then does his goddamnedest to carry it out am i wrong yes sir castillo said im wrong no sir i meant to say i know what you meant to say charley the president said and smiled and to assist you in carrying out your orders the dni and secretary cohen will provide you with whatever you think may be useful as will the secretary of defense and the attorney general i will inform them of this just as soon as i can get to andrews where both are waiting for me were going to have a look at what katrina has done he paused any questions there was a chorus of no sir the president had another thought im going to call the mayor from air force one and tell him that i am sending you up there to talk to him and big frank and captain timmons and anyone else who needs reassurance that im doing everything in my power to right this wrong yes sir castillo said wear your uniform the president said i think theyll find that reassuring my wife says you look like a recruiting poster in your uniform he gave his hand to castillo then walked out of the breakfast room with only a nod of his head to montvale and cohen my god natalie cohen said when the door had closed after him montvale shook his head then walked to the window cohen followed him after a moment and then castillo did no one said a word until after the president had walked quickly across the lawn to the sikorsky vhd and gotten aboard and the helicopter had gone airborne colonel montvale said breaking the silence by the time you return from chicago the experts on the drug trade will be waiting for you in your office and i suggest you make the flight in my gulfstream you have just flown yours eight thousand miles itand youmust be tired thank you unnecessary montvale said while it might be a wonderful solution to this problem if you were to crash and burn flying your own airplane i fear the president would suspect i had something to do with it i cant believe you said that charles natalie cohen said appearing genuinely shocked she touched castillos arm maybe you can reason with ambassador lorimer i really dont think he should be going to uruguay especially now castillo nodded iv one the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc september madame secretary mr director the uniformed secret service man at the door to the north side drive apologized itll be just a moment for your vehicles they had come down from the presidential apartment before the secret service agent on duty there passed word to the uniformed secret service agent in charge of the motor pool downstairs that they were coming not a problem natalie cohen said thank you castillo had learned the cars would be brought to the door following protocol the secretary of state was senior to the director of national intelligence her armored cadillac limousine would arrive before montvales black yukon xl denali and since i am at the bottom of the protocol totem pole mine will arrive last if at all the secretary of state put her hand on castillos arm and led him outside out of hearing of the secret service uniformed officer and of course dni montvale who hurried to catch up charley she said im going to do my best to talk him out of this but im not sure ill be able to castillo nodded do i have to ask you to try hard not to make waves no maam let me know what i can do to help yes maam thank you her limousine rolled up a burly manobviously an agent of the bureau of diplomatic security which protects the secretary of stategot quickly out of the front seat and glanced around carefully as he opened the rear for cohen he saw castillo and eyed him suspiciously castillo winked at him which obviously displeased him oh for christs sake what are the odds that somebody wanting to do her harm is going to walk out of the white house with her and the director of national intelligence montvales denali rolled up castillo saw his coming up the drive ill call the eightyninth montvale said and tell them that youll be using my gulfstream the th airlift wing at andrews air force base provided the white house with its fleet of airplanes including the two vca boeings that had the call sign of air force one when flying the president i thought you were kidding castillo said not at all thanks just the same i think it would be smarter if i used my own my god arent you tired exhausted but not a problem ill just set the autopilot and the alarm on my wristwatch then i can sleep all the way to chicago it took a moment for montvale to realize his chain was being pulled when that showed on his face castillo said id rather not have people asking whos the guy in the presidential giv but thanks anyway my god castillo montvale said and got in the rear seat of his vehicle his yukon rolled off castillos rolled up and castillo got in the backseat where to sir the driver asked why dont you move this thing so its not blocking the door while i find out castillo said and reached for the telephone white house if you can guess who this is can you ring my office oh you heard about the voice recognition did you colonel god aint we clever there was a chuckle then agness voice colonel castillos line good morning castillo said howd it go with the president disastrously guess whos supposed to get that dea agent back from the bad guys oh no oh yes is tom there hes at your house or at the alexandria police department on the way to your house he wanted to keep them from getting curious about all the sudden activity at the house can you get him on the horn and ask him to meet me at the house done thank you ill bring you up to speed later agnes that would probably be a very good idea boss the connection was broken home james castillo regally ordered the driver who smiled and shook his head as he put the yukon into motion we have a secret service radio in here colonel he said i can probably get mcguire for you if you want thank you but no mcguires likely to cause me trouble but hes too smart to argue with agnes are you through colonel the white house operator asked can you get my house please a moment later a male voice announced colonel castillos line there was something about the less than vibrant timbre of the voice that gave castillo pause and then he understood jesus it didnt take them long to put lester to work did it colonel castillo lester yes sir i know theres a voice recognition system on this just as soon as you said colonel castillo your name popped up what do you think it would have done if i had said clint eastwood sir as efficient as this system seems to be i think it would have reported colonel castillo yeah it probably would have is major miller around there yes sir one moment sir ill get him for you sir a few seconds later miller came on the connection yes sir colonel sir dick two things first keep everybody there too late mrs doherty drove off with him right after you left damn he lives near here i have a number want me to get him back no if i need him we can call anybody else gone no but the troops are getting a little restless well keep everybody there im on my way done and and you said two things oh yeah see if lorimer has a uniform if he does put him in it and im presuming you brought mine from the hotel freshly run one last time through their very expensive drycleaning operation if i were to infer that the trumpets have sounded and that you and pegleg are about to rush to the sound of musketry would i be close a lot worse than that ill explain when i get there as the yukon turned onto west boulevard drive a red lightemitting diode led on the telephone began to flash castillo looked at it wondered what it was and had just decided it meant hed better pick up the phone when the driver said i think youd better pick up colonel thats the white house calling oh boy another friendly offer of help from montvale castillo i just talked to that man in chicago the president of the united states said timmonss family will be expecting you mr president im on my way to pack my bag reassure the family charley thats the important thing make them understand the situation is under control get the mayor off my back in other words lie through my teeth the situation is anything but under control ill do my best sir ive got a number for you to call got a pencil just a moment please sir he furiously patted his pockets until he felt a ballpoint pen dug it out and knocked the cap off ready sir charley wrote the number the president gave him on the heel of his left hand got it sir the president made him read it back right the president said let me know how it goes charley yes sir good man the line went dead i dont suppose youve got a piece of paper do you charley asked the driver theres a clipboard with a pad and a couple of ballpoints on a chain on the back of the other seat colonel castillo looked there was shit he muttered he took the clipboard wrote the number on the pad tore the sheet off and put it in his pocket he then tried to erase the number from the heel of his hand with his handkerchief he couldnt even smear it shit he said again two west boulevard drive alexandria virginia september youre dangerous charley colonel jake torine said after castillo had related what had happened in the presidential apartment if i could figure out how id get and stay as far away from you as possible castillo raised an eyebrow its damn sure not intentional and whatever you do dont call me magnet ass why not that ones been taken a long time by one of you air force types fred platt flew forward air controller covert ops over laos as a raven he earned the name magnet ass drawing fire in supposedly unarmed cessnas bird dogsand damn near anything else with wings platt didnt we just call him for yeah castillo interrupted before he could say anything more yeah we did i ask this because i dont know anything about the drug trade edgar delchamps said and also because i am much too old to play john wayne but wouldnt i be of more use here working on the oilforfood maggots no question about it castillo said it never entered my mind to bring you or doherty in on this next question delchamps said do i get to live here for as long as you want the only thing id like you to do is keep an eye on eric kocian and sandor delchamps gave him a thumbsup gesture a good spook always takes good care of his sources you might want to write that down ace he stood up and said its been fun fellas well have to do it again sometime lets keep in touch and then he walked out of the living room what about me karl alfredo munz asked i brought you along so you could be with your family and take them home castillo said but having heard all this how would you feel about coming to work for us we could really use you munz didnt reply and seemed uneasy what is it alfredo i need a job munz said as much as i would like to do whatever i can to help you i just cant support my family on my side pension i told you a long time ago wed take care of you castillo said so thats not a problem youve been on the payroll of the lorimer charitable amp benevolent trust as a senior consultant ever since we took that chopper ride to shangrila why do i suspect you are lying my friend because i am castillo said but the only reason you havent been on the payroll is because im stupid you may have noticed no munz said emotionally the one thing you are not is stupid well i have noticed colonel miller said ive known him a long time and with that in mind i brought the question up to mrs forbisonyou met her last night munz nodded and agnes decided that since you are or at least were a colonel we should bring you on board as a lorimer charitable amp benevolent trust lb which is the equivalent of a gs in the federal service and according to army regulation a gs is regarded as the equivalent of a colonel the pay is a year to start would that be satisfactory to you you are fooling with me right not at all that much my god thats two hundred and seventy thousand pesos castillo thought surprised miller isnt just making all that up he and agnes have given this thought done the research and come up with the answer the internal revenue service will take their cut of course miller said but thats the best we can do i dont know what to say munz said yes would work castillo said if i retire charley torine said will you hire me if youre serious jake sure castillo said let me give that some thought torine said seriously i myself go on the payroll the first of october miller said as an lb at per annum oh god that means theyre physically retiring him involuntarily sorry you took a hit so long and dont let the doorknob hit you on the ass on your way out whats that lb business castillo asked lorimer bureaucrat miller said an lb is equivalent to a major and a gs he looked at castillo after i gnashed my teeth in agony while rolling around on the floor at walter reed begging for compassion the medical review board gave me a seventypercent disability pension permanent you all right with that castillo asked softly id rather have my knee back miller said but with my pension and my salary as an lb ill be taking home more than you do yeah im all right with it and somebody has to cover your back colonel sir i hate to tell you this but i already have a fine young marine nco covering my back dont laugh charley torine said chuckling im not laughing at all i owe him castillo said he paused then said well before we went off on this tangent jake was saying something about me being dangerous and i wasnt joking either only you could get us into something like this you are dangerous i thank you for that heartfelt vote of confidence castillo replied and moving right along what shape is the airplane in if you had read the log first officer you would know that were pretty close to a hundredhour jesus not a major problem torine said we can get it done when were in vegas when were in vegas castillo parroted incredulously you want to tell me about vegas i guess i didnt get around to mentioning that miller said castillo looked at him miller explained aloysius is going to replace the avionics in the gthree the communications and global positioning portions thereof plus of course a secure phone and data link you told him about the gulfstream hey hes one of us hes right he just told casey we have the gulfstream not how we use it and casey really is one of us and knows were not using it to fly to the bahamas for a little time on the beach point taken castillo said signature flight supports got an operation at mccarran torine said i called themin baltimorethis morning and got them to agree to tell the people in vegas to do the hundredhour in the afc hangar somehow i suspected we were going to need the airplane sooner than anyone thought wrong move no just something else that comes as a surprise castillo said okay how about this we go to chicago and assure the family and then we go to midland and either leave alfredo there orwhy notpick up munzs wife and daughters and take everybody to las vegas we get the avionics installed and the hundredhour done how long is that service going to take twentyfour hours maybe fortyeight it depends on a what they turn up in the hundredhour and b how long it takes caseys people to install the avionics not long i would think miller said as i suspect we can count on aloysius either putting it in himself or standing over whoever else does if it takes more than fortyeight hours ill just go to new orleans commercial to try to talk the ambassador out of going to shangrila where the hell have you been charley torine asked louis armstrong is closed to all but emergency traffictheyre picking people off the roofs of their houses with choppers using louis armstrong as the base and lakefront is under fifteen feet of water keesler castillo asked wiped out okay moving right along if they cant do the airplane in fortyeight hours ill go to atlanta commercial and then fort rucker and borrow something with revolving wings and fly that to mastersons plantation that may not work either miller said hey im drunk with the power ive been given you were awake werent you when i said the president said he was going to tell the secretary of defense to give me whatever i think i need that presupposes rucker has a chopper to loan you miller said i suspect that their birds are among those picking people off rooftops in new orleans then ill rent one in atlanta same reply miller said i think theyd loan you a helicopter at rucker charley torine said even if they had to bring it back from picking people off roofs in new orleans he paused you sure you want to do that no of course i dont okay so scaling down my grandiose ambitions to conform with reality ill fly to atlanta take a taxi to fulton county and rent a twin cessna or something thats probably a better solution anyway it probably is torine agreed i just had another unpleasant thought even if mastersons airstrip is not under water and long enough for us to get the gulfstream in there its probably being used by a lot of other airplanes yeah castillo agreed okay correct me where im wrong the priority is to get to chicago and quote assure the mayor unquote i suppose i could do that commercial but we are going to need the gulfstream and with the hundredhour out of the way and better yet with the new avionics miller said right we have enough time left to go to chicago then with a stop in midland to las vegas right probably with a couple of hours left over torine said so thats what well do and wing it from there so to speak castillo said wheres lorimer does he have a uniform upstairs and yes miller said okay everybody but jake and miller go play with the dogs or something while we deal with lieutenant lorimer castillo said miller started to get up keep your seat dick special agent david w yung said ill get him this is where im supposed to say im perfectly able to climb a flight of stairs miller said but what i am going to say is you will be rewarded in heaven david for your charity to this poor cripple tom mcguire came into the living room first agnes told me he said jesus i only took the job because i knew how you hungered to see the natural beauty and other wonders of paraguay castillo said you okay to leave right away for three four days mcguire nodded and asked where we going paraguay first to chicago then to las vegas its kind of iffy after vegas i am always ready to go to las vegas on a moments notice but whats going on in chicago castillo told him of the presidents call and castillo finished i think a distinguished supervisory secret service agent such as yourself can help reassure this guys family who are all cops mcguire nodded his understanding but said i think i should fess up right away charley i have been successfully avoiding the drug business since i joined the service and the only thing i know about it is what i read in the papers i think then that this is what they call the blind leading the blind castillo said the door opened and a uniformed first lieutenant edmund lorimer intelligence us army stepped in the room came almost to attention and waited castillo thought he looked like a special forces recruiting poster and remembered what the president had said about the first lady saying that about him hes even wearing jump boots castillo thought which triggered a mental image of a highly polished lacedup corcoran boot from the top of which extended a titanium pole topped by a fully articulated titanium knee good morning lorimer castillo said come on in and sit down we dont do much standing at attention or saluting around here good morning sir thank you sir colonel torine you know and major miller this is supervisory special agent tom mcguire of the secret service mcguire wordlessly offered lorimer his hand before these witnesses lorimer castillo said formally i am going to tell youagainthat anything you see hear or surmise here or at any place at any time about what were doing or have done or plan to do is classified top secret presidential is that clear in your mind yes sir any questions about that no sir the president of the united states has tasked the office of organizational analysis under the authority of an existing presidential finding with freeing special agent timmons from his kidnappers castillo said jesus h christ lorimer exclaimed wonderful colonel i dont know how to thank you castillo looked at him coldly until lorimers face showed that he understood that his response had not been welcomed if you have your emotions under control lieutenant i will continue with the admonition that any further emotional outbreaks will not be tolerated yes sir sorry sir it wont happen again lorimer to clear the air have you ever been given an order that you were sure you were not equipped to carry out yes sir and what did you do when you were given an order you knew you were not equipped to carry out sir i told him i didnt know how to do what he was ordering me to do and then and then i tried to do it were you successful in carrying out the order no sir i wasnt but i tried thats the situation here lorimer we have been given an order that is in our judgment beyond our ability to carry out but we are going to try very hard to obey that order you have absolutely no reason therefore to thank me clear yes sir so long as you remain usefuland more important cause me and ooa no trouble of any kindi am going to permit you to participate in this operation yes sir thank you sir to say this is probationary would be an understatement there will be no second chances phrased another way lieutenant you fuck up once and youre dead meat clear yes sir we are going to chicago just as soon as i can change into uniform our mission at the personal order of the president is to assure timmonss family that everything possible is being done to get him back since i dont have a clue about how to get him back thats probably going to be difficult one thing we can do however is produce you sir with a little bit of luck theyll know who you are that you were timmonss buddy timmonss family knows who i am sir then theyll probably believe you when you tell them what happened down there i think they will sir on the other hand they may suspect were blowing smoke whats this guy doing up here when he should be in asuncion looking for byron sir lorimer furnished his name is byron timmons same as his father in any event while you are delivering the afteraction report you will look at me every two seconds if i shake my head slightly or if you think im shaking my head you will stop in midsentence and change subjects clear yes sir timmonss family will certainly have questions before you answer any question you will look at me to see if i shake my head or nod if i shake my head your answer to that question will be something intended to assure them it doesnt have to be true you understand yes sir if you cannot carry out this instruction satisfactorily lorimer i will conclude that you will not be of any value to this operation and well drop you off at fort bragg on our way back here clear yes sir are you packed no sir i sort of thought id be staying here go pack you may well not be coming back here when youre packed put your bag in my denali and wait there yes sir lorimer said he stood up and walkedwith a justnoticeable limpout of the living room closing the door after himself as soon as it had closed miller said id forgotten what a starchy prick you can be charley my sentiments exactly torine said what were you trying to do charley make that kid hate you couldnt you have cut him some slack i was actually paying him a compliment jake castillo said and thank you for that vote of confidence compliment pegleg is obviously as bright as they come at least as smart as i am before i called him in here i gave a lot of thought to how i should treat someone i admire and who is probably as dangerous as you say i am if that offended you two okay torine said youre right he reminds me of a lot of fighter pilots ive known i would agree with that jake except im pretty sure lorimer can read and write torine gave castillo the finger castillo took a small sheet of notebook paper from his pocket call that number please jake and tell them when were going to be in chicago and how we can get from which airport to where were going they used to have a nice little airport downtown right beside the lake torine said meigs field supposed to be one of the busiest private aviation fields in the world but the mayor wanted a park there so one night he sent in bulldozers and they cut big xs on the runways really miller asked yeah there were a dozen maybe more light planes stranded there they were finally allowed to take off from the taxiways and the mayor got his park hes formidable miller suggested in spades torine said three atlantic aviation services operations midway international airport chicago illinois september theres a guy walking toward us tom castillo said as he tripped the stairdoor lever in the gulfstream iii i saw him looks like an irish cop you want to deal with him mcguire gave castillo the finger then pushed himself off the couch on which hed riddensleptfrom baltimore and walked to the door the man a stocky sixfooter with a full head of red hair came up the stair as soon as it was in place im captain oday he announced as if supremely confident that no one could possibly mistake him for say an airline captain or anything but what he was a chicago cop im looking for a colonel costello castillo came back into the cabin from the cockpit and was putting on his green beret well you werent hard to find oday said god youve got more medals than patton castillo shook his hand its castillo captain sorry you dont look like a castillo im in disguise say hello to another texican tom mcguire of the secret service if yourewhatever he saidmcguire then im a irish cop castillo said innocently hes a real wiseass isnt he oday asked smiling and hes barely warmed up mcguire said people are waiting for you how many are going five mcguire said i knew that thats why i called for another car oday said he gestured for everyone to get off the gulfstream there were two cars both solid black and brandnew and looking like any other new ford crown victoria except for little badges on the trunk reading police interceptor and just visible behind the grille blue and red lights you can ride in front with me colonel oday said i guess youre senior actually captain the skinny guys a full colonel castillo said but only in the air force so that doesnt count go to hell costello torine said oday took a cellular telephone from his shirt pocket pushed an autodial key then after a moment said on the way theres five of them maybe twenty minutes he pressed the end key and put the phone back in his shirt pocket how far is police headquarters castillo asked several minutes later why isnt that where were going no it isnt oday said and changed the subject ill forget what you tell me in thirty seconds but whats the real chances of getting young byron timmons back from those bastards and not hooked on something you heard about that huh his father and i go back a long way oday said he showed me juniors letters a good kid i shouldnt have said that young byrons a good man all i can tell you is that were going to try like hell castillo said with a little luck yeah i get the picture oday said i was afraid of that thanks a few minutes later castillo realized they were not headed downtown instead they were moving through a residential area and he guessed from that that they were going to the timmons home proof seemed to come several minutes after that when they turned one more corner and then stopped before a simple brick house on a side street there was a police patrol car parked half up on the sidewalk and three more carsunmarked but rather obviously police carsparked in the driveway beside the house here we are he said i dont envy you colonel castillo got out of the car and waited for the second car which was carrying mcguire munz and lorimer he wordlessly indicated that he and lorimer would follow captain oday up to the door and the others were to follow before the door chimes finished playing home sweet home the door was opened by a grayhaired plump middleaged woman wearing a cotton dress and a pink sweater she looked at castillo and then at lorimer youre eddie she said ive seen your pictures yes maam lorimer said is it okay if i kiss you she asked yes maam she hugged and kissed him honey she called juniors buddy eddie is here a large man in the uniform of a police captain walked up to them and put out his hand im juniorsbyronsdad yes sir i know lorimer said ive seen your pictures too captain byron timmons sr looked at castillo sir lorimer said this is colonel castillo timmons crushed castillos hand in his massive hand colonel i cant tell you how happy i am to see you he said the president told the mayor that if anybody can get my son back from those bastards youre him im going to try very hard sir castillo said well just dont stand there in the door mrs timmons said come in and meet the others theres coffee and cake captain timmons took castillos arm in a firm grasp and led him through a short corridor to a living room there were two women there who looked like mrs timmons and half a dozen men two in police uniform and four in casual clothes who castillo decided might as well have had policeman painted on their foreheads this is colonel castillo captain timmons announced the man the president says can get junior back the lieutenant is eddie lorimer juniors pal down there in paraguay i dont know who the others are colonel what about identifying the others and then ill introduce everybody yes sir castillo said this is colonel jake torine us air force thats tom mcgui theyve got their own gulfstream airplane captain oday furnished i wondered how they got here so quick one of the cops said tom mcguire castillo went on whos a supervisory special agent of the secret service and this gentleman is colonel alfredo munz who before his retirement was chief of side in argentina side is sort of our cia and fbi rolled into one munz now works with us i thought junior was in paraguay one of the cops said paraguay and argentina share a border sir castillo said okay now its my turn captain timmons said motioning for castillo to follow him to the people sitting on a couch two matching armchairs and two chairs obviously borrowed from the dining room this is captain retired frank timmons juniors grandfather known as big frank and im the goddamned fool colonel god forgive me who told junior to go federal castillo shook big franks hand then lorimer and mcguire and munz followed suit and this is sergeant charley mullroney juniors sister ellens husbandthats her over there charley works narcotics on the job castillo shook mullroneys hand then smiled and nodded at mrs mullroney across the room and this is stan wyskowski of the dea charleys pal and im the guy who got junior in the dea colonel castillo shook wyskowskis hand wyskowski i admire your balls for being here that has to be tough and this is the mayor captain timmons said jesus h christ i thought he was another coprelative the president speaks very highly of you colonel the mayor said as he shook castillos hand im happy to meet you and that you are here an honor sir castillo said im sorry i have to be here under these circumstances well colonel ive always found the way to deal with a problem is get it out in the open and then start working on it yes sir castillo said and this captain timmons said moving to the third man on the couch is castillo shook that mans hand but his nameor those of the othersfailed to register in his memory his mind was busy thinking of something else the mayor who the president has made perfectly clear is to get whatever he wants from me is not just doing a friend of the family a favor hes part of this family and thats about it i guess lorimer said when he had finished telling everybody what he knew of the situation he did that about as well as it could be done castillo thought would it be all right if i called you eddie captain timmons asked yes sir of course that was a good job eddie captain timmons said i dont have any questions anybody else i got a couple big frank said sir lorimer asked politely that irish argentine cop duffy junior was on his way to see when these slimeballs grabbed him are there a lot of irish cops down there and is this one of the good ones and whats the gendarmeria nacional lorimer glanced at castillo who nodded just perceptibly i know byron trusted comandante duffy sir lorimer said but maybe colonel munz can speak to that i know comandante duffy munz said not well but well enough to know that hes a good man i havent spoken to him since this happened but hes about the first man im going to talk to when we get down there im sure hes almost as upset about agent timmons as you are big frank nodded munz went on so far as irish people in argentina the ethnic mix in argentinaand uruguay and chile but not paraguayis much like that in the states my family came from germany for example there are more people from italy than from spain and many irish there are many irish police especially in the gendarmeria nacional which is what big frank said a police force with authority all over argentina munz said they are a paramilitary force more heavily armed than the federal police they wear brown rather than blue uniforms and enjoy the trust of the argentine people what does that mean big frank asked the other cops arent trusted can we agree captain that dishonest police are an international problem munz asked reasonably and that the problem is made worse by all the cash available to drug people or for that matter the criminal community generally id have to agree with that the mayor said let me put it this way munz said when the jewish community center was blown up in buenos aires several years ago blown up captain timmons asked by who most of us believe the iranians had something to do with it munz said but the point i was trying to make was when it became obvious that protection of synagogues etcetera was going to be necessary the jewish communitythere are more jews in argentina than any place but new yorkdemanded and got the gendarmeria nacional as their protectors meaning they didnt trust the other cops captain timmons asked meaning they trusted the gendarmeria more munz said youre slick colonel big frank said take that as a compliment thank you what was it you said you did for colonel castillo whatever he asks me to do captain slick colonel big frank said smiling well these bastards were waiting for junior when he went to the airport which means somebody told them he was going to the airport captain oday said or they set up their roadblock in the reasonable belief that some american agent was probably going to be on the buenos aires flight munz said it may have had nothing to do with agent timmons going to see comandante duffy and your gut feeling big frank asked softly that agent timmons was specifically targeted big frank nodded in agreement special agent timmonss mother inhaled audibly well these bastards dont seem to mind whacking people wyskowski said they didnt have to kill juniors driver for christs sake this is going to drag on for a long time castillo thought and probably turn into a disaster they were sending a goddamn message stan one of the others whose name castillo had forgotten began but was interrupted by his honor the mayor who apparently was thinking the same thing castillo was well i think weve learned everything thats known the mayor said my question is what happens next colonel castillo youre going right down there there are some things we have to do here first castillo said ambassador montvale the dni the what sergeant mullroney asked the director of national intelligence castillo replied hes going to have all the experts in this areafrom the various intelligence agencieswaiting for us when we get back to washington well that should be helpful the mayor said and with help in mind colonel i thought sergeant mullroney with his experience in narcotics might be useful to you and i asked the commissioner to put him on temporary duty with you oh jesus whats he going to be useful doing is keeping the family aware of how were stumbling around in the dark his honor apparently saw something in castillos face i thought of that immediately after i last spoke with the president the mayor said do you have the authority to take him with you or would it be better for you if i suggested this to the president talk about slick no wonder hes the mayor for life welcome aboard sergeant mullroney castillo said glad to have you i sort of thought that youd have the authority the mayor said the president told me that he places his absolute trust in you so i told charley to pack a bagand his passportbefore coming over here so youre going right back to washington no sir weve got to make a couple of stops first the mayor stood up obviously to leave really he asked the translation of that is and where are you going to waste time instead of getting to work on this immediately as i expect you to oh what the hell when in doubt tell the truth las vegas mr mayor the airplane needs some maintenance and were having radios installed that will permit us to communicatesecurelywith the white house no matter where we are the mayor examined him carefully then smiled just like air force one huh almost mr mayor when my plane is in for work it takes them forever and a day the mayor said i suppose for you things go a little quicker dont they the translation of that is and how long is that going to take they expect us sir theyll work through the night to get us out as quickly as they can the mayor nodded then went through the room shaking all the mens hands and kissing the women on the cheek then he walked out of the living room with captain oday following closely mrs timmons kissed lorimer then grabbed castillo by both arms ill pray for you colonel to get my son back soon beforebefore anything happens to him thank you well do our best then everybody shook hands with everybody else the mayor was standing on the sidewalksurprising castillowhen he and the others came down the stairs castillo then thought he understood why when a black lincoln limousine turned the corner oh there it is the mayor said and turned to castillo if theres anything you need colonel give me a call sometimesim not without influencei can be helpful thank you very much sir captain oday opened the door of the limousine youll have to use the jump seats the mayor said and someone will have to ride up front but therell be room for all of you he nodded at the others its been a real pleasure to meet all of you then the mayor of chicago got in the front seat of one of the black crown victoria police interceptors and captain oday drove him away four pilots lounge atlantic aviation services operations midway international airport chicago illinois september castillo motioned to munz to come with him they walked out of earshot of the others ive just had more proof that im stupid alfredo castillo said munz looked curiously at him but didnt reply would you really rather be with your family at the doublebarc or with us standing around a hangar in las vegas wherever i would be most useful karl munz said in german thats not what i asked with my family and not in vegas munz nodded thats what i thought and i should have thought of it right away thats what i meant by proof of stupidity you have nothing else on your mind of course munz said so what well do is just drop you at the ranch and worry about getting together later i wish you had one of our cellulars munz reached into his jacket pocket and held up a cellular telephone miller gave me this he said and this he held up a thin sheaf of onehundreddollar bills held together with a riggs national bank band he said hes working on the credit cards make sure you get receipts for everything you spend castillo said agnes flips her lid if you dont he reached for the cellular let me put your number in mine after he had done that he started to push an autodial button on his cellular he stopped and looked at munz and now for proof that i am an unprincipled sonofabitch watch as i lie to my grandmother he pushed the autodial button this is carlos juanita he said in spanish a moment later is dona alicia available he turned to munz she is damn it abuela he said a moment later you remember that story you told me about george washington and the cherry tree well neither can i were in chicago alfredo munz is with us yesterday were going to drop him off at the doublebarc and i cant do anything more than just that i really cant thats the george washington so help me god boy scouts honor truth i have to be somewhere else as soon as i can get there i was afraid youd ask las vegas but its business believe me of course ill have time to give you a kiss we should be there in a little over two hours i love you abuela he said and turned to munz great lady castillo said she believed me didnt give me any static at all so my wife says munz said im looking forward to meeting her castillo pushed another autodial button then the loudspeaker key i want you to listen to this one you should know about aloysius francis casey what a thin somewhat belligerent voice demanded over the phones loudspeaker a moment later this is charley castillo dr casey ah the boy colonel how many goddamn times do i have to tell you to call me frank another couple hundred times might do it i hear youre headed out here when were leaving in a couple of minuteswere in chicagoand we have to make a stop in midland texas say two hours to midland and another hour and fortyfive minutes to get from midland to vegas we should be on the ground about twentythirty or thereabouts whos we jake of course and a young green beanie who took a pretty bad hit in afghanistan and tom mcguire he gets a pass because hes a boston irishman who else how about a pass for a chicago cop named mullroney hes irish too who the hell is he ill tell you when im there could you get us rooms near mccarren youll stay with me theres five of us theres room tell me about the green beanie who took the hit rocketpropelled grenade one of his legs is titanium from the knee down he need anything special no hes working with you yes ive been working on stuff to set off those goddamn ieds before they can cause anybody any harm but those goddamn rpgs yeah i know okay ill see you when you get here five doublebarc ranch near midland texas september as the gulfstream taxied back toward the hangar castillo saw four women standing by a silver jaguar xj fifty yards away near an enormous slowly bobbing horsehead oil pump several horses and maybe a dozen santa gertrudis steers stood watching there had been horses and santa gertrudis cattle grazing on the doublebarc long before the first automobile had bounced over the west texas prairie and long before the first well had tapped the permian oil basin beneath it the first time castillo had been shown the ranchhe was twelve at the timehis newly discovered grandfather don fernando castillo had told him we were comfortable carlos before they put the first hole down i often think we were happierlife was certainly simplerbefore they found the oil and seeing the pump now he had the same reaction to it hed had to the first pump hed ever seen every time that thing goes up and down its fifty cents in his pocket and therere a lot of those pumps the only difference between then and now is that today west texas sweet crude brings fifty bucks a barrel that and abuela left the doublebarc to me the women waiting for the gulfstream were castillos grandmotherhis abuelaand colonel alfredo munzs wife and two daughters the warmth of his memory of don fernando turned to cold anger with the sight of the munzesand the reason they were at the ranch goddamn the miserable bastards who go after a mans family munzs family had come to the doublebarc because of a very real threat to their lives in argentina wake up first officer jake torine said we are no thanks to you safely on the ground castillo unfastened his shoulder harness and went into the cabin alfredo munz was already out of his seat waiting for the stair door to be opened castillo worked it and then waved munz off the plane first castillo saw that munz had not taken his suitcase with him he picked it up and went down the stairs with it he saw the younger girl running toward her father followed by the older girl and then moving more slowly senora munz in a moment munz had his arms around all of them castillo looked at dona alicia and saw that she had a handkerchief to her eyes and mine arent exactly dry either he went to his grandmother she put her arms around him hey abuela hows my favorite girl very annoyed with you as usual she said and kissed him she looked at the munzes how long is he going to stay she asked until i need him and that will probably be soon a couple days and when will it be safe for his family to go back to argentina not for a while yet and when are you going to come and stay longer than ten minutes divulgence of any detail of any operation conducted under the authority of a presidential finding to persons not holding the specific top secret presidential security clearance is a felonious violation of the united states code punishable by fine and imprisonment a drug enforcement agent in paraguay has been kidnapped by drug dealers castillo said the president wants us to try to get him back and i have no idea how to do that she looked at him but did not reply i dont have to tell you to keep that to yourself do i she shook her head to show the admonition was entirely unnecessary i dont know whether im very proud of you my darling or very sad for you she said i guess both five minutes later the gulfstream iii broke ground six mccarren international airport las vegas nevada september a tug stood waiting outside the afc hangar and as a ground handler signaled for castillos gulfstream iii to shut down its engines the doors of the hangar began to slide open inside the hangar castillo saw that a glistening new gulfstream v three older lears a beechcraft king air and an old but nicely refurbished cessna had been moved to one side to make room for his giii and then he saw there was a cadillac escalade in the hangar dr aloysius francis casey chairman of the board and chief executive officer of afc inc was sitting sideward in the drivers seat the drivers door open he was wearing his usual baggy black suit the tug hooked up to the nose gear of the giii and dragged the aircraft into the hangar two men in white coveralls with the afc logotype on the chest hooked up an auxiliary power cable castillo opened the stair door and went down it with torine following casey pushed himself off the seat of the escalade and walked to them how are you charley he asked shaking his hand then torines always good to see you colonel casey said always good to see you too dr casey torine said and we really appreci goddamn it i keep telling you and the boy colonel here that its frank casey said im starting to get pissed off about that sorry frank torine said casey looked toward the men in coveralls and raised his voice get the luggage off of that and put it in my truck the men hurried to do his bidding tom mcguire ed lorimer and bringing up the rear charley mullroney came down the stairs and somewhat hesitantly walked to them casey put out his hand to lorimer and said any special forces guy is always welcome my name is frank casey call me frank i did some time as a commo sergeant on an ateam in nam mostly over the fence in laos and cambodia yes sir lorimer said you call me sir one more time and you can sleep on your airplane clear yes sfrank youre learning casey said then pointed his right index finger at castillo and torine which is more than i can say for these two he turned to mcguire and mullroney and said usually i have as little as possible to do with cops but since you two are irish and with these guys you get a pass he shook their hands then said come on and get in the truck well go out to the house and hoist a couple and burn some meat they had turned off u s highway a few minutes before and were driving down a macadam twolane road toward the mountains castillo sitting beside casey in the front seat of the escalade was wondering what electronics were behind the dashboard to power the two telephone handsets and a large liquid crystal display screennow displaying the afc logo and standbymounted on the dash casey suddenly said before we get to the house i think i should tell you the wife passed i hadnt heard that frank castillo said im very sorry yeah well we all have to go sometime and thank god mary alice went good she took a little nap by the pool and never woke up im sorry frank castillo repeated me too frank jake torine said anyway i got a couple taking care of me at the house good people but you probably want to be careful what you say when theyre around thanks castillo said and then as much to change the subject as anything else asked whats this stuff casey looked and saw where castillo was pointing oh that stuff he said as if he welcomed the chance to change the subject the left handset is an encrypted tie to my communications the right one and the display is pretty much what theyre putting in your airplane is it working castillo said it damned well better be i could get my office on that the white house switchboard you can get anybody on your net but the white house casey said i didnt think id better put a link in there when the new stuff is in the airplane youd be linked to the white house just like your truck but your office can patch you through to the white house i dont want to talk to the white house i want to talk to nuestra pequena casa i really have to start things moving down there but is the radio still up or did sergeant kensington shut down when we left theres only one way to find out can i try it help yourself how does it work pick it up say your name give it a couple of seconds for the voice identification to work and then say who you want to talk to theres an operator theres a little black box and its encrypted not even nsa will know what youre saying castillo picked up the handset the afc logo on the display screen disappeared and then standby went away activating appeared and then encryption active and then voice identification active and finally all functions operational no more little green and red leds casey said clever castillo said no recognition a metallic voice came over the handset speaker jesus no recognition the metallic voice repeated castillo go ahead colonel castillo nuestra pequena casa no recognition argentina no recognition safe house there was a moments delay then sergeant robert kensingtons voice came cheerfully over the speaker in the handset hows things in vegas dr casey colonel castillo bob hows things where you are and where are you in the quincho sir i was afraid that all might be shut down mr darby decided it would make more waves if everybody suddenly vanished so were still here whos we the sienos ricardo solez and me darbys at the embassy no sir he went to asuncion he said if you called to tell you he and tony santini were going to make sure the cork was back in the bottle we dont have a secure link to asuncion do we no sir and mr santini said not to send any messages unless we had to what about ricardo is he there he went grocery shopping in pilar i can get him on his cellular if you want no heres what i want you to do get through to darby or santini and tell them the situation has changed they are to stay there until solez can get there to explain and then to act accordingly and then get solez back from the supermarket tell him we have been tasked to get back that dea agent who got himself kidnapped and to get on the next plane to asuncion to tell darby and santini nobody in the embassy therenobodyis to be told about this yes sir well thats good news colonel that dea guy is a pretty good guy according to solez it is the opposite of good news bob i havent a clue about how to get him back youll think of something colonel kensington said you always do well theres a vote of confidence the trouble is its completely unjustified and tell solez to ask darby and santini both to get on a secure line to me as soon as they can youre with dr casey right can i ask what youre doing sir drinking gambling and chasing naked women castillo said what else does one do in las vegas get right on this please bob i already have solez on his cellular okay breaking down castillo said he covered the mouthpiece with his hand and turned to casey how do i do that say finished or break it down break it down castillo said disconnecting the metallic voice said in his ear v one valley view ranch north las vegas nevada september yeah i know its almost two in the morning back there sergeant charley mullroney said into his cellular phone i got a watch this is the first chance i had to call he was standing on a small patio carved out of the mountain about fifty feet below and fifty yards from his room in the house small dim lights lined the path leading to the house and were mounted on a low stone wall at the edge of the patio he had peered over the edge of the wall the lights didnt illuminate much but there was enough light to see it was almost a sheer drop from the patio wall for at least fifty feet and probably more not in vegas byron maybe twentyfive miles outside of vegas on the side of a mountain you want to keep interrupting me or do you want me to tell you what happened okay first we landed in the middle of nowhere where that german or argentine or whateverthefuck he is colonel got off no there was no sign anywhere this was a private field i think castillos got something to do with it he got off the airplane and kissed some old lady then we come to vegas they parked the airplane in a hangar and some little guy named casey drove us out here in a cadillac suburban or whateverthefuck they call them did i learn anything on the airplane no mcguire the secret service guy did a pretty good job of pumping me to find out what i do on the job but when i asked him like where are we going or when we landed in the middle of nowhere where was that what was that he turned into a clam and when i asked him what he did for castillo he said this and that okay so we got here and this casey character brings us out here in his white escaladethats what they call those cadillac suburbans escalades great big fucking house on the side of a mountain great big fucking swimming pool the room they gave me is about as big as my whole downstairs jacuzzi and a shower thats so big it dont even need a door but the cellular says no signal so i couldnt call so i figured id wait until later so this guy caseys got a barbecue set up with a cook and great big steaks and enough booze to take a bath in so castillo cooks the steaks and they start in on the booze and i figure maybe now ill learn something didnt happen all they did was talk about the army the special forces i dont know how much is bullshit but this casey guy to hear him tell it practically won the vietnam war by himself i dont know if they believed it or not byron i think so but nobodys going to call a guy a bullshitter in his own house especially since hes putting free radios in your airplane because castillo told him hes got a bunch of money in something called the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund and can pay for them casey said you know your moneys no good here charley i dont know what caseys angle is and if theres any connection with this lorimer charitable whatever and juniors buddy lorimer i dont know what it is okay so finally i said i had a long day and was going to turn in so i went to my room and then out onto a little patio whatever outside it you can see just about all there is to see in vegas from there and for the hell of it i tried the cellular again i got maybe a bar and a half so i see another patio down the mountain about fifty yards from the house walked to it and the fucker works here so i called you yeah byron i know it aint much but you just got all i have i have no fucking idea whats going to happen tomorrow they dont pass out a schedule for christs sake yeah ill call you whenever i have something mullroney took the cell phone from his ear and looked at it you sonofabitch he said you hung up me perhaps he didnt hang up on you sergeant mullroney castillo said mullroney jumped perhaps you just lost the connection castillo went on evenly cellulars are not very reliable out here you scared me colonel mullroney said after a moment i didnt hear you come up i didnt scare you i dont think but i think i embarrassed you was there something wrong with the telephone in your room sergeant mullroney couldnt get a dial tone mullroney didnt reply or was it because you didnt want us to know you were making your report to captain timmons is that why you sneaked out here to use your cellular mullroney looked at him almost defiantly not really fuck you defiant hes worried now lets see how far i can push him castillo held out his hand and wiggled the fingers in a give it to me gesture mullroney looked at castillos hand and then his face and back at the hand give me the phone castillo ordered mullroney looked again at castillos face as if trying to understand so what do i do now try to take it away from him give me the phone castillo repeated mullroney didnt move or respond give the colonel the fucking phone asshole or ill throw you and it off the mountain the voice in the dark startled castillo he hadnt heard anyone walking up on them he now saw that lorimer was standing beside him im not going to tell you again lorimer said mullroney put the cellular in castillos hand castillo threw it down the mountain what the fuck mullroney protested incredulously you are not permitted to have a cellular telephone castillo said calmly who the fuck do you think you are mullroney demanded there wasnt much conviction in that indignation the next time you say something like that to the colonel im going to break your arm before i throw you down the mountain fuck you soldier boy mullroney said five seconds later sergeant mullroney found himself on his stomach his arm was twisted painfully behind him his cheek was pressed into the rough ground and lieutenant lorimers kneethe titanium one castillo sawwas pressed painfully into the small of his back he howled in pain permission to dislocate his shoulder sir lorimer asked castillo waited five secondslong enough he judged for mullroney to have time to consider that he might actually be about to have his shoulder dislocatedbefore replying put him on his back lieutenant if he even looks like hes considering trying to get up kick some teeth out yes sir ten seconds later sergeant mullroney was lying absolutely motionless on his back lieutenant lorimer was squatting at his head pulling mullroneys chin back with one hand and holding the eightinch blade of a knife against his throat with the other permission to speak sir lieutenant lorimer said granted let me toss him down the mountain sir i dont want to kill him unless i have to castillo said just let him get busted up a little sir lorimer argued break an ankle a leg an arm how would we explain his accident castillo asked reasonably well everybody knows hes a boozer ill call captain timmons and tell him he got drunk was wandering around the mountain and fell off is that a credible scenario yes sir i think so who are they going believe the family drunk or you and me the problem with that is they would just send somebody else to snoop on us castillo said thats true sir lorimer acknowledged but we could deal with that situation as it came up and we could probably be long gone before they could send someone else true okay sergeant mullroney you have ten seconds to tell me why i should not permit lieutenant lorimer to throw you down the mountain you people are out of your fucking minds sergeant mullroney said possibly castillo said but i dont see that as a reason not to send you down the mountain five seconds im a cop for christ sake you cant get away with this times up castillo said carry on lieutenant what were going to do now lieutenant lorimer said touching the tip of the knife blade to the throat to discourage any sudden movement is very slowly get to our feet jesus what the fuck do you want from me you dont want me to call chicago all right i wont call chicago i swear to god i swear on my mothers grave ill never call chicago jesus christ please ive got a wifejuniors sisterand kids he doesnt get the picture does he lieutenant no sir it would appear he doesnt have a clue explain it to him please yes sir asshole we dont care if you call chicago every hour on the hour but what we cant have is you running at the mouth to somebody else wholl run at the mouth and blow this operation and get peopleincluding my pal byronkilled i wouldnt do that sergeant mullroney said more than a little righteously juniors my brotherinlaw for christs sake my wifes brother ive always wondered what a brotherinlaw was castillo said thank you for clearing that up for me what mullroney asked visibly confused have you anything else you want to say to us castillo asked what the fuck do i have to say to make you understand id never do anything to hurt junior byron told me he told you not to call him junior and you wouldnt stop until he knocked you on your ass lorimer said and we have a similar situation here wouldnt you say colonel im afraid it looks that way to me castillo said i dont know what the fuck youre talking about exactly as it was necessary for byron to knock you on your ass to get you not to say the wrong thing it looks to me that im going to have to put you down the mountain now to keep you from saying the wrong thing were talking about people getting killed because of your runaway mouth id never say sergeant mullroney began then he had a sudden inspiration what if i told you what i was going to say to junbyrons father before i said it i mean before i called and you could tell me if there was something i shouldnt say and i wouldnt and you could listen to me making the call when there was no reaction from either castillo or lorimer mullroney added somewhat plaintively jesus guys were on the same side here you dont call the colonel guy asshole lorimer said sorry colonel sir that might work sir lorimer said operative word might on the other hand i dont want to have to kill him unless its really necessary give me a chance and i promise youll never regret it mullroney said what do you want to do sir flip a coin lorimer asked his tone serious as he points out lieutenant he is special agent timmonss brotherinlaw if it could be avoided i would prefer not to get special agent timmons back only to tell him that we had to terminate his brotherinlaw in order to guarantee the security of the operation for your consideration sir special agent timmons is not all that fond of the asshole nevertheless i think that we should take the chance yes sir lieutenant lorimer said his voice showing his deep disappointment let him up lieutenant castillo ordered get him on his feet you heard the colonel asshole stand up sergeant castillo then said i want you to understand that i am authorizing your immediate termination should you ever get close to a telephone without lieutenant lorimer or myself being present understood yeah lorimer barked say yes sir when youre talking to the colonel yes sir you are dismissed sergeant please stay in your room until you are called for breakfast yes sir castillo made a motion as if brushing away a fly and sergeant mullroney started quickly walking up the path to the house fifteen seconds later colonel castillo whispered if you are about to have the giggles lorimer and asshole hears you ill throw you down the mountain lieutenant lorimer acknowledged the order by bobbing his head he didnt trust himself to open his mouth the bottom lip of which he was biting as hard as he could two lieutenant colonel castillo leaned over lieutenant lorimer who was sprawled on a chaise lounge by the side of the swimming pool and very carefully topped off lorimers glass of famous grouse with more of the same lieutenant lorimer castillo said i am a lieutenant colonel yes sir and you may have noticed i wear a green beret yes sir i did notice that and as i am sure you know while some lieutenant colonels sometimes make mistakes and some special forces officers sometimes make mistakes when a special forces lieutenant colonel makes a mistake it is truly a cold day in hell so i have been led to believe sir that being understood between us there is sometimes an exception to the rule just cited i find that difficult to accept sir nevertheless i think perhapsas difficult as this may be for you to accepti made a mistake about you yes sir frankly lieutenant when you approached mullroney and me with stealth worthy of the finest comanche i really had no idea how to deal with the sonofabitch with respect colonel sir i believe his name is asshole and i think the asshole is now under control sir the knife at his throat when you rolled him over lieutenantdont let this go to your headwas masterful i would not be surprised to learn that sergeant mullroney soiled his undies i would be disappointed to learn that he didnt colonel the problem of a police officer being embedded with us having been solvedi devoutly hopelet us now turn our attention to the big picture how do we get your friend back yeah lorimer said and exhaled audibly how the hell do we do that to get him back we have to know a lot of things starting with who has him and where your thoughts please may i infer from the colonels question that i am now regarded as part of the team so to speak from this moment on you may regard yourself as the psychological warfare officer of the team you seem to have some skill in that area i am humbled by that responsibility sir and will try very hard to justify your confidence in me where do these bastards have him eddie well he could be in asuncion but i dont think so if i had to bet theyve got him in the boonies somewhere either in paraguay or across the river in argentina bearing in mind that youre betting with a mans life why thats boonieland up there argentina and paraguay you can raid a house in a city a lot easier than you can in the boonies meaning that if youre holding somebody in a remote farmhouse you can see the good guys coming if theres only one road going someplace they know youre coming long before you get there youve got somebody in the bag you just march him off into the woods and look innocent when somebody shows up at the door so what we have to do is not only find where he isill get back to that in a minutebut come up with some way to get enough people in there with the element of surprise yeah lorimer said and that wont be easy im going off at a tangent here eddie yes sir something was said about timmonss driver being taken out by these people i want to make sure i heard it right tell me about that they found the embassy car parked against the fence of the airport its called the silvio pettirossi international airportyou want all the details like that castillo nodded anything that comes into your mind eddie my data bank is pretty empty typical third world airport lorimer went on it used to be called the presidente general stroessner airport and you can still see signs with his name on them he was the president read dictator for thirtyfive years apparently a worldclass sonofabitch presidente general alfredo stroessner castillo interrupted was exiled to brazil in after a coup by general andres rodriguez i dont know where the hell i got that but the data bank apparently isnt completely empty and i just remembered he was cozy with the nazis the ones who fled to south america after world war two interesting why is that important ill tell you in a minute and the next time we have a little chat like this ill have to remember to bring the laptop so i can write all this down i tend to forget things i hear when im drinking go on please eddie the embassy car was parked against the fence across the field from the terminal the driver was on the floor of the backseat choked to death strangled you mean i dont know if thats the word he had a gizmo around his neck like those plastic handcuffs the cops use but metal with a handle castillo asked quietly and mimed how the handle would be used lorimer nodded its called a garrote castillo said one of them was used to take out a friend of mine sergeant first class sy kranz who was a damned good special operator when the ninjas jumped us at estancia shangrila i never heard that you lost anybody we lost sy kranz castillo said and taking him out wasnt easy which told us right off that the ninjas we took out were pros how much about that operation are you going to tell me colonel we later found out that one of the people we took out was major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia we think the others were probably either exstasi or exavo or exavh probably being run by the fsb colonel except for the fsb i dont know what youre talking about who was the fsb running jesus what was going on at that farm estancia castillo corrected him without thinking estancia shangrila this much we know jeanpaul lorimer an american who worked for the un was aprobably thebagman in that iraqi oil for food cesspool we know he set himself up with a phony identification and name on the estancia we know he had sixteen million dollars whether he earned that as the bagman or stole it we dont know we know that a team of pros was sent to the estancia we think their basic mission was to whack him to shut his mouth they may have been after the money too and were pretty sure the others were exstasi he stopped when he remembered lorimer didnt know what he was talking about stasi eddie was the east german ministerium fur staatssicherheitministry for state security avoallamvedelmi osztalyand later avhallamvedelmi hatosagdid about the same thing when hungary was still under the communists and they were involved in that oilforfood business they were hired guns we think for people who were involved in it castillo said like who castillo ignored the question the one thing the stasi and the hungarians had in common eddieaside from being some very unpleasant people very good at what they didwas using the garrote as the silent whacking weapon of choice youre saying you think these people are involved with what happened to timmons im saying its very interesting that timmonss driver was garroted with the same kind of garrote they used on sergeant kranz and tried to use on eric kocian lorimer considered what hed heard then said i dont think anyone in asuncion thinks were dealing with anything but drug dealers and maybe were not castillo said but to finish filling you in on what happened at shangrila the official versionthe uruguayan government versionis that it was a drug deal gone wrong they know better but apparently have decided its best for them to sweep what really happened under the rug this is made somewhat easier for them by our ambassador who cant believe that a special operation could happen without his knowing about it he decided that lorimer was shipping cocaine in antique vases and a deal went wrong the uruguayans decided to let it go at that so you came out clean for a while i thought we had but we were at the safe house in pilar just about to wind up putting things togetherinspector doherty called it an investigation to determine what has to be investigatedwhen max caught you sneaking through the bushes oh opening the possibility that others may have put together what you did so we quickly folded the tent and came home and i again thought wed come out clean and then the president said go get special agent timmons so now were going to have to go back down there and the whole thing is back at risk of being compromised you dont have to go back to uruguay do you i wouldnt be surprised that as we try to do this well have to go to uruguay and theres something else what lorimers father is a retired ambassador apparently a very good guy he lost his house in new orleans to the hurricane and hes decided that until things settle down he wants to take his wife and go to estancia shangrila which he now owns uhoh yeah andsince he has a serious heart conditionthe secretary of state thought it would be best if he didnt learn what a miserable sonofabitch his son was he thinks the bastard was killed by roving bandits among the other impossible things i have to do one is talk him out of going to uruguay not only would it be dangerous for him and his wife why the money for one thing what money the sixteen million we have it but they dont know that you have it lorimer asked surprised castillo nodded its now the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund which also now has fortysix million of illegal oilforfood profits that philip j kenyon of midland texas thought he had safely hidden from the irs and the justice departmentand everybody elsein the caledonian bank and trust limited in the cayman islands i dont think lorimer has to know about that ive already given him enough to think about which means ive already told him too much thats how we pay for everything castillo went on i wondered about that lorimer said so what happens now now we go to bed castillo said not only is my tail dragging but ive learnedpainfullythat the brilliant thoughts i have at one oclock in the morning with half a bag on turn out to be stupid in the morning three valley view ranch north las vegas nevada september when castillo wearing a polo shirt and khaki slacks walked out of the house to the pool he found tom mcguire jake torine and lorimer all in sports shirts and slacks sitting at a table drinking coffee he saw caseys cook standing by an enormous stainless steel gas grill that apparently also functioned as an ordinary stove and decided they were politely waiting for their host to show up before eating jake nodded at castillo but didnt speak eddie castillo ordered why dont you ask sergeant mullroney to join us for breakfast lorimer wordlessly got out of his chair and went into the house is hethe copgoing to be a problem charley torine asked i think thats been taken care of ill tell you later here comes frank aloysius francis casey came out of the house jesus you didnt have to wait for me casey said just tell walter what you want he motioned for the cook to come to the table and poured himself a cup of coffee feed my friends walter he ordered you name it walter can make it pheasant under glass torine said with beluga caviar on toast corners on the side casey chuckled the fish eggs arent a problem but catching the bird and plucking it may take walter a little time bacon and eggs would satisfy this old mans hunger torine said walter makes his own corned beef hash casey said even better torine said me too please castillo said make it three please mcguire said wheres that nice kid and the cop casey asked the former went to get the latter castillo said you never told me about the cop casey said hes been embedded with us castillo said you dont seem to be very happy about that im not but lorimer has him under control sergeant mullroney wearing a coat and tie came out of the house followed by lorimer lorimer pointed to one of the chairs at the table mullroney followed the orders and sat down good morning sergeant mullroney castillo said were about to have corned beef hash and eggs sound all right to you mullroney smiled wanly and nodded i see what you mean mcguire said casey smiled at him then announced i just talked to the guys in the hangar the new gear is up and running in your airplane and signature flight support has finished doing whatever they had to do to the gthree great torine said thanks frank i suppose that means youre not going to hang around for a day a couple of days take in a couple of the shows well have to take a rain check frank castillo said yeah i figured is there anything else i can do for you now that you mention it casey made a give it to me gesture to get this guy back were going to need a team castillo said maybe more than one but at least one and choppers to move them around choppers equipped with both a good gps and one of your wonderful radios well now that theyve started giving the th what they need casey said theyve got pretty good gps equipment whats the th mullroney interrupted ill tell you when you can ask questions charley lorimer said the th is the th special operations aviation regiment mullroney castillo said and turned to casey but the problem there is i cant use their helicopters why not lorimer asked ill tell you when you can ask questions lieutenant castillo said seriously waited for that to register on lorimers face then smiled hold the questions eddie until your leader is finished yes sir the th has all the latest equipment castillo said which we would have trouble getting into paraguay andor argentinajust physically getting them down thereand even if we could do that they would stick out like sore thumbs were going to have to do this black castillo saw that mullroney had opened his mouth as if to ask a question and then after a quick glance at lorimer had changed his mind black means secretly covertly mullroney nobody knows about it castillo explained which means were going to have to use hueys where are you going to get hueys torine asked and how are you going to get them down there black moving right along castillo said while i am figuring out where to get hueys and how to get them down there black i thought i would send munz lorimer and mullroney down there right away i guess i dont get to go mcguire interrupted tom youll be more useful in washington castillo said i guess mcguire said sounding disappointed but keep your bag packed castillo said he went on and on the airplane if i can keep abusing franks generosity there will be twopreferably threeground versions of the radios theres twoold modelsdown there already and were going to need at least two more in paraguay plus i just thought operators for same youll probably have to stop by bragg to pick them up jake not a problem torine said the ones you have in south america still working casey asked you heard me talk to argentina yesterday castillo said casey nodded then offered i think theres a halfdozen new models waiting to be shipped to delta to general mcnab at bragg think about that frank castillo said stopping him maybe theres only three waiting to be shipped to general mcnab the other three have mysteriously disappeared if that was the case i wont have to get on my knees and beg him for any if he finds out hes not going to be happy i devoutly hope he never finds out castillo said but a bird in hand is worth two in the bush he looked at lorimer you may want to write that down lieutenant yes sir lorimer said and took a notebook from his pocket and started writing in it torine and mcguire shook their heads mullroney appeared to be confused casey chuckled and said itll take me a couple of days to come up withwhat did you say foursets of gps and that many aviation radios maybe a little longer for them all contributions gratefully yeah yeah casey interrupted impatiently he took a cellular from his pocket and pushed a speeddial key casey he announced into it theres a halfdozen model s waiting to be shipped to bragg put three of them in the gulfstream in the hangar then he hung up what are you going to do about the ambassador mcguire asked try to hide from the one in washington castillo replied and put the one in mississippi on hold what i have to do now is get to washington mullroneys face showed that he was trying hard to make sense of what had been said and not having much success four doublebarc ranch near midland texas september as torine lined up with the runway castillo saw there was a bombardierlearjet xr parked beside the horsehead oil pump look whos here castillo said put the wheels down first officer torine said we can chat later dona alicia castillo was again waiting for them this time beside a chevrolet suburban and this time a heavyset almost massive darkskinned man was with her castillo came down the stair door first he went to his grandmother and kissed her nice landing gringo the large man said jake must have been flying castillo gave him the finger fernando manuel lopez and carlos guillermo castillo thought of themselves as brothersthey had been raised together since pubertybut they were in fact first cousins are you on parole or are maria and the rug rats here too castillo asked dona alicia shook her head at both of them now stop it the both of you right now she ordered lopez answered the question anyway theyre in cancun he said taking a pregoingbacktoschool vacation you are going to have lunch dona alicia said thats in the nature of a statement not an invitation nevertheless i gratefully accept abuela castillo said eddie castillo ordered why dont you take sergeant mullroney for a walk lorimer made a get up lets go gesture to mullroney who stood up and followed lorimer off the verandah where lunch had been served presumably you think you have a good excuse for that discourtesy dona alicia said when they were out of earshot there are some things we have to discuss that are none of his business castillo said then why is he here with you she demanded before castillo could reply she said i just saw on colonel torines face that he thinks im wrong sorry carlos im the one who should beissorry for involving you in the first place castillo said if i could have thought of someplace else to take munzs family believe me i would have she looked at him for a moment thank you carlos for what for bringing them here and for not reminding me you tried very hard to keep me from coming here he didnt reply what do we have to discuss she asked after a moment were allcolonel munz tom mcguire and meagreed that theres no longer a threat here to senora munz and the girls well thats good news thank god for that so toms going to call off the secret service castillo said which then raises the question what to do with them for the next two three weeks however long it takes to be sure they can safely return to argentina why theyll stay here of course she said where else would they go i hate to ask you to stay with them castillo said dont be silly carlos she said i enjoy being with them she paused butmr mcguire maam could i get you to call me tom tom if they would be safe here would they be safe in san antonio mcguire considered the question before replying at your home there you mean she nodded no castillo said actually charley that might be a better solution than leaving them here mcguire said maam would having a driver for your car raise any eyebrows abuela usually has a driver when she goes out at night fernando lopez said what are you thinking tom that to err on the side of caution instead of just canceling the protection detail i have it cut from what we have here nowtwelve probably so mr alvarez told me dona alicia said if its been a twelveman detail mcguire said that means there were at any given moment three agents on the job which means that nine agents were lying around the swimming pool at the local motel or drinking coffee in the snack bar with people starting to wonder aloud who were all these guys in suits with guns and yukons mcguire looked at castillo and were agreed charley that the threat is almost certainly gone right castillo nodded reluctantly so we call off the detail here completely and we set up a threeman detail in san antonio which means one will be available at all times to do the job when necessarywhenever they leave the house in other words they have an agent with them if we call off the detail here that means no agents period and alvarez can have a word with the san antonio cops to keep their eyes open whats wrong with that charley dona alicia did not give him a chance to answer thats what well do she said and ill have a little party or two for the girls so they can meet people their own age theyre already bored being here and i cant say that i blame them i think we should leave it up to munz castillo said i think we should too chief mcguire said want to know why why alfredo has a lot of protection experience like i do who do you think hes going to agree with you or me i guess well have to see castillo said a little lamely carlos i suppose its important that colonel munz go to south america right away dona alicia asked im afraid so abuela and that means right now im sitting here wondering if i can work up the courage to tell him its time to go ill go get him dona alicia said and stood up and walked into the house castillo looked at lopez all right gringo fernando said ill ride the right seat down there and back but thats it and that presumes i can be back before maria comes back from cancun i didnt ask fernando castillo said you knew if you asked id tell you to go to hell fernando said i told you im getting too old to play james bond with you guys fernando going would solve the problem of having to find another pilot jake torine said all were going to do is drop off munz and the others with the radios and come right back so thanks fernando he should be thanking us for the privilege of flying our airplane castillo said fernando gave castillo the finger how do i get back here to pick up the lear fernando asked charley mcguire asked what if i stay here take your grandmother and the munzes to san antonio say tomorrow and get things set up there thatd probably reassure munz by the time i have things set up jake and fernando will be back from buenos aires so you send a plane to pick me up it brings fernando here and then picks me up in san antonio thatd work castillo considered the suggestion and nodded okay then thats what we do god i feel sorry for them castillo said nodding discreetly at the wife and young daughters of alfredo munz who had just watched munz get into the gulfstream iii i probably shouldnt tell you this dona alicia said but youre the one i feel sorry for why everybody has somebody but you hey abuela i have you im your grandmother you share me with fernando and his family youre all i need castillo said she would not give up colonel munz has his family mr mcguire has his family colonel torine has his family you dont even have a dog if it will make you happy ill get a dog now why the hell did i say that what the hell would i do with a dog the right engine of the gulfstream began to whine castillo placed his hands gently on dona alicias arms kissed her on both cheeks and went up the stair door five west boulevard drive alexandria virginia september were home colonel the secret service driver of the yukon said gently pushing castillos shoulder castillos head jerked up for a moment he was confused and then he knew where he was in the front seat of the yukon in the basement of the house how long was i out he asked you dozed off before we were out of the airport you ever hear that only people with nothing on their conscience can go to sleep with no difficulty the secret service agent chuckled so what happens now castillo asked theres my relief the secret service agent said pointing to a man walking up to the yukon i go off at midnight in twenty minutes max was walking to one side of the man and looking at the truck in that case can i offer you a nightcap castillo offered im about to have one which i richly deserve this has been one hell of a day he sensed reluctance on the part of the secret service agent if you have moral scruples against demon rum then okay otherwise consider that an order i always feel depraved when i drink alone i could use a little nip then come along castillos door opened as he reached for the handle good evening sir the secret service agent who had walked up to the denali said max effortlessly stood on his rear paws and put his forepaws on castillos legs how are you pal he asked and scratched maxs ears max sat down on his haunches i see youve made a pal of max castillo said to the secret service agent hes been meeting every car thats come in here the secret service agent said obviously waiting for you until now hes just taken a look and gone back upstairs i probably smell like hamburger castillo said and then asked youre going to be here all night what did you do wrong the secret service agent chuckled not to go any farther castillo nodded we bid for the duty this looked like a much better deal than spending all night sitting in the truck in the white house parking lot seniority counts and i won well the only person who can get me out of here tonight is the president and i heard on the radio that hes on the gulf coast looking at hurricane damage so why dont you find an empty bedroom and catch some sleep maybe later colonel thank you i have to be at the nebraska avenue complex at eight is that going to screw up your getting relieved no sir if youre sure about that ill have my relief meet me there why dont you do that he nodded the stairway from the garage led into the kitchen and there was a door from the kitchen to the living room when castillo got close to it max brushed past him and pushed it open castillo motioned for the denali driver to follow him when he got inside he was surprised to see edgar delchamps and a somewhat frumpy man delchampss age whom he didnt recognize they were sitting in the leather chairs and couch around the battered coffee table working on a bottle of famous grouse oh edgar im touched castillo said you waited up for me neither man seemed amused we need to talk ace delchamps said will it wait until we get a drink yeah but hell have to drink his someplace else delchamps said then looked at the secret service agent and added nothing personal not a problem sir and i can pass on the drink have the drink castillo ordered not another word was said until castillo had poured two drinks given one to the secret service agent who downed it then said ah thank you sir and good evening gentlemen he left the living room closing the door behind him say hello to milton weiss ace delchamps said he and i go back a long way when they shook hands weisss eyes were cold and penetrating castillo was reminded of the first time hed met aleksandr pevsner he wondered nowas he had thenwhether the look in the eyes was natural or whether it had been cultivated when you get that look you know damned well youre really being examined max walked up to castillo and rubbed his head against castillos leg castillo scratched maxs ears and looked at delchamps and where is the master of this beast in the monica lewinsky motel delchamps said what okay ace delchamps said tolerating him kocian consulted a canine gynecologist who confirmed that madchen is in the family way which came as no surprise to those of us who watched the happy couple couple happily in the garden of the safe house for hours at a time said canine gynecologist offered his professional opinion that the lovers should now be separated as max cannot seem to grasp that his role in the procreation of his species is no longer required and that madchen is very likely going to take large pieces out of him if he continues to try to force his now unwanted attentions on her how to do that kocianhaving been advised by miller that your suite in the monica lewinsky is empty but paid for through the end of the monthdecided that he had enough of bucolic suburban life and had miller take him and madchen to the mayflower leaving max here his fate to be decided later jesus christ castillo said to answer your unspoken question yes herr kocian is being sat upon miller will stay with him until we get the secret service in place have you any further questions colonel or can we get on with this get on with what please tell milton what steps you have taken visavis your little problem in paraguay i dont know who the hell milton is trust me ace delchamps said sarcastically milton weiss is not a member of the drug mafia castillo almost said so what but stopped instead he asked why before you begin to apply damage control ace it is convenient to know the extent of the damage castillo looked at delchamps but didnt say anything trust me charley delchamps said this time very seriously if i dont go along with him now hes entirely capable of telling me to go fuck myself get up and walk out of here and the ooa and i cant afford to lose him lorimer says castillo began and i think hes right that they have timmons in the stickson an estancia of some kindin either paraguay or across the river in argentina not far from asuncion in other words someplace we cant easilyif at allget to on the ground without being spotted so the problem is one to find out where he is and two to stage an operation to get him back one i hope isnt going to be much of a problem a very competent agency guy is already in asuncion you mean the station chief weiss interrupted no i mean a guy who works for me the station chief in asuncion is apparentlyintellectually challenged the guy im talking about knows his business weiss nodded castillo went on my guy is therethe phrase he used was to make sure the cork is back in the bottlebecause a very bright young dia guy in asuncion pretty much figured out another operation we ran down there and my guy went to asuncion on his own to make sure nobody else in the embassy talks too much my guy milton and alex darby are old pals charley delchamps said weiss nodded and there was the hint of a smile on his lips is he laughing at me darby will learn in about nine hours maybe ten about this new mission how weiss asked softly from a oh to hell with it from a man named munz who used to run side and who now works for me good man milt delchamps said softly and is now on his way to asuncion on our airplane the airplane is also carrying radiosours with some incredible capabilities the ones you get from afc weiss asked did this guy already know about the radios or did delchamps tell him castillo nodded which with a little bit of luck theyll be able to get into paraguay and with a little more luck munz and darby will be able to get up and running the fallback plan there is that if they cant smuggle the radios into paraguay munz will arrange to see that we can get them into argentina and from there into paraguay and one of my sergeantswho can get the radio radios up and runningwill be on the first plane to asuncion tomorrow morning thats if he couldnt get on the last plane today and two delta force communicators were supposed to be on the aerolineas flight from miami to buenos aires tonight theyre going as tourists with orders to report to a certain lady at our embassy susanna isnt what comes to mind when one hears the phrase clandestine service is she weiss said smiling i dont think delchamps told him about susanna sieno and if im right that means he knows a hell of a lot about whats going on down there who is this guy cutting this short if alex darby and munz are half as good as i think they are finding out where these bastards have timmons wont take nearly as long as setting up the operation to get him back will take tell milton how you plan to do that delchamps said the only way to do that is with helicopters castillo said and the problem there is that were going to have to use hueys nobody in argentina or paraguay has apaches or black hawks or little birds the problem there is where to get the hueys and crews for them i dont want to use activeduty army pilots if i dont have to same thing with the technical people there used to be a long list of unemployed huey drivers hanging around china post castillo stopped and looked at weiss to make sure he understood what he was talking about weiss nodded just perceptibly signaling he knew that china post no in exile of the american legion in addition to providing the camaraderie and other benefits of any legion post also served as sort of an employment agency for retired special operators of the various branches of service but when i called there a friend of mine said most of them are now either back in the service or working for blackwater or people like that or the agency hes trying to find me some chopper drivers etcetera but that may take some time if it works at all and then presuming i can pull that rabbit magically from the hat that leaves the problem of getting the aircraft and the people into argentina black taking first things first im going to fort rucker right after the briefing tomorrow what briefing weiss asked montvale is gathering all the experts in his empire to give me everything they have on whats going on down there weiss nodded and youre going to do what at fort rucker they have some hueys montvale is going to have somebody from the secretary of defenses office call down there and tell them to give me whatever i ask for and not to ask questions im going to see whats available and what shape its in and then im going to borrow an airplane and go see ambassador lorimer who lost his house to hurricane katrina and wants to move to estancia shangrila until he can get a new house in new orleans ive got to talk him out of that i hadnt heard about that delchamps said what are you going to do about shooters weiss asked castillo was surprised at first at weisss use of the term few people outside the special operations community used the politically incorrect term to describe special operators whose mission was likely to require the use of deadly force what the hell he seems to know about everything else my friend at china post told me i just about wiped out the list of available shooters when i hired them to protect the mastersons castillo said that assignments just about over but those guys are all getting a little long in the tooth so im probably going to have to get my shooters from delta at fort bragg i already gave general mcnab a headsup thats about it weiss said i probably could have gotten more done if i hadnt spent all that time playing the slots in vegas castillo said weiss smiled youre right ed he said he is a wiseass but hes also good very good am i supposed to blush at the compliment castillo challenged the station chief in asuncion is not intellectually challenged colonel weiss said thats not my information castillo said if hes a friend of yours im sorry jonathon crawfords a very good friend of mine actually weiss said and for that reason i was delighted to hear your unflattering opinion of him castillo looked at him in confusion then threw both hands up to signal he didnt understand weiss explained if youand more important alex darbydidnt see through the image jonathon has painted of himself as a mediocrity sent to an unimportant backwater post to keep him from causing trouble working beyond his limited ability somewhere important then perhaps that very important deception is working castillo looked at delchamps this is where you tell me whats going on here ed weve got your attention now do we ace he looked at weiss okay where do i start you want to do this you do it i dont think the colonel trusts me delchamps nodded looked thoughtful for a moment then said when i was bringing you up to speed on the cold war dinosaurs ace i may have led you to believe that we all came out of europe not so there is a subspecies latin american which is held with just about the same degree of suspicion and contempt by many people in langley as are those of us who worked berlin vienna budapest and points east milton here is one of these fair milton actually i think of myself more as a chasmatosaurus rather than a dinosaur but close enough as a what castillo asked the chasmatosaurus was a crocodilelike meateater from the triassic period weiss said generally acknowledged to be far more lethal than the dinosaur the proof being that their descendants are still eating dogs and the occasional child in florida australia and other places whereas the dinosaurs are no longer with us whatever the paleontological distinction delchamps said smiling at the look on castillos face these people recognize each other as noble persons facing extinction at the hands of the politically correct members of what is laughingly known as the intelligence community such was the case when milton saw me rooting about in the south american files in langley he suggested that we have a drink for auld lang syne and on the fourth drink he idly inquired what i was looking for knowing him as well as i do i asked him why he wanted to know he said it had come to his attention that i had been in the southern cone and he wanted to know what i could tell him to confirm or deny a credible rumor that major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligenciadressed up as a ninja at an estancia in uruguay called shangrilahad been whacked by a bunch of special operators operating under a presidential finding jesus christ castillo exclaimed softly i asked him where he had heard this rumor and he told me from his pal crawford and one thing led to another and he told me why he was interested and i told him what we have been up to in gaucho land jesus christ castillo said again i suppose you are aware colonel weiss said that you would not win any popularity contests held in langley castillo nodded so i have been led to believe if i were to tell you that you are a burr under the saddle blankets of two distinct groups of people over there would that come as a shock to you two distinct groups group one as i suspect you know is composed of those annoyed because you a found that stolen they couldnt thereby splattering a good deal of egg on the agencys face and b youthe office of organizational analysisis operating under the authority of that presidential finding which among other things has seen ambassador montvale give this dinosaurhe pointed at delchampsblanket access to anything he wants at langley group twowhich as hard as you may find this to believe i dont think you know aboutis a bunch of good guys who are running an important operation they feel you are about to fuck up by the numbers while trying to get this dea agent back what kind of an important operation and why hasnt montvale told me about it montvale doesnt know about it weiss said hes almost as unpopular over there as you are for a number of reasons the most obvious being that hes now over the agency the dci isnt even number two just one more subordinate chief of agency like the heads of dia and dea whats this important operation how much do you know about the drug trade weiss asked virtually nothing castillo admitted okay basic drugs the agency estimatesand this sort of thing is what the agency is really good atafghanistan will have half a million acres devoted to the growing of papaver somniferum l or the poppy opium is obtained from the unripe poppy seed pods and then converted to heroin afghanistan grows more than ninety percent of poppies used in the heroin drug trade most of the other eight or nine percent is grownand converted to heroinin colombia and bolivia this is sold primarily in the east coast cities here most of the stuff consumed in hollywood and other temples of culture on the west coast is grown and processed in mexico and is not nearly as pure as whats sold on the east coast quality as well as supply and demand determines price will you take my word for it colonel that theres a hell of a lot of money being spent on heroin on the east coast castillo nodded onei guess severalof the good guys i mentioned before took a close look at the business and came up with several questions some were pretty obvious why are the heroin people in bolivia sending their product south into paraguay and then argentina when the markets in new york city in the other direction the colombians send most of their product into mexico the mexicans dont seem to be able to stop muchif anyof that traffic it has been suggested that the authorities have been bought but whatever the reason getting their product into mexico and then across the border into the united states doesnt seem to pose much of a problem possibly because our overworked customs and border protection people working the bordercrossing points just cant inspect more than a tiny fraction of the thousands of eighteenwheelers coming into the country every day or an even smaller fraction of the cars of the tourists returning home from a happy holiday south of the border you have that picture colonel ed calls me charley mr weiss i thought he called you ace you dont like being called colonel colonel not the way you pronounce it thats probably because im having trouble thinking of you as a colonel you dont look old enough to be a colonel when ed and i were running around together the colonels we dealt with had gray hairif they had hair at alland paunches no offense was intended you wont mind right milton if i dont believe that you are a feisty youngster arent you arent you charley better milton better getting back to the subject at hand charley on the other hand argentina does have a working druginterdiction program they even have a remarkably honesthonest by south american standardspolice organization called the gendarmeria nacional so why run the greater risk looking into it further the good guys learned a little more about the flow of drugs through argentina and into the us and the manner of doing business normallyyouve seen the moviesits a cash business the farmers sell the raw materialthat stuff that oozes out of the poppy seed podsto the refiners they dont get much for it but they get paid in cash next step normally is for the refiners to either sell what is now heroin to someone who shows up at the refinery and carries it off that is also a cash transaction or they take it someplace away from the refinery and sell it there thats where you see those briefcases full of money in the movies every time the product changes hands in other words so does cash usually this didnt seem to be happening with the drugs coming out of paraguay into argentina either when it arrived from the refiners or when the movers got it into argentina or when it left argentina the first time money changed hands was when the movers had it in the states and turned it over to the wholesalers then we had the briefcases full of hundreddollar bills so what could be inferred from this that it was being operated in what the harvard school of business administration would call a vertically integrated manner the whole processfrom initial receipt of the product from the refiner through the movement to uruguay to argentina to the united states and the sale therewas under one roof the refiners the movers the smugglers and the transporters rather than being independent businessmen were all employees whats the purpose of that what difference does it make castillo asked weiss held up his hand signaling he didnt want to be interrupted another problem businessmen involved in this trade have is what to do with the money once they have sold the product it cannot be dropped into an atm machine for obvious reasons and to get it into one of those offshore banks we hear so much about it has to be transferred through a bank no cash deposits allowed unless of course the bank is also in the vertically integrated system you mean they own the bank weiss nodded and that raised the question among many others in the good guys minds where did all this come from drug dealers are smart ruthless and enterprising but very few of them have passed through cambridge and learned to sing on fair harvard that suggested something very interesting weiss went on that it was not a group of colombian thugs with gold chains around their necks who were running this operation but some very clever people who may indeed have gone to harvard and were employed by their government two governments came immediately to mind which the democratic peoples republic of cuba and the russian federation jesus h christ another thing needed to run this operation smoothly charley delchamps said is discipline the employeesespecially the local hireshad to completely understand that any hankypanky would get them and their families whacked lorimer told me that timmonss driver timmons weiss interrupted just as weiss had a moment before castillo held up his hand imperiously signaling he didnt want to be interrupted delchamps chuckled and weiss smiling shook his head was garroted castillo finished with a metal garrote interesting weiss said stasi and that might explain what major vincenzo and the others were doing at shangrila castillo said maybe he didnt come from cuba for that maybe heand the otherswere already in paraguay and delchamps added since lorimer wasnt involved with drugsthey wanted to shut his mouth about what he knew of the oilforfood scamand vincenzo was that suggests theres a connection somebody who wanted lorimer dead was able to order vincenzo and company to do it and we have the two dead fsb lieutenant colonels castillo said ed somehow neglected to mention two dead fsb officers weiss said i didnt think you needed to know delchamps said weiss rolled his eyes who were they one of the colonels crack pistol marksmen a chap named bradley delchamps said with a straight face took down yevgeny komogorov of the fsbs service for the protection of the constitutional system and the fight against terrorism weiss asked drily delchamps nodded as he went on in the sheraton hotel garage in pilar outside buenos aires colonel komogorov was at the time apparently bent on whacking a fellow russian by the name of aleksandr pevsner pevsner weiss asked incredulously with an even more imperious gesture than castillo had given delchamps held up his hand to signal he didnt want to be interrupted castillo laughed delchamps went on when bradley put a round in his cheekhe pointed to a spot immediately below his left eyeand then lieutenant colonel viktor zhdankov was found beaten to death in the conrad casino and resort in punta del este weisss face showed surprise and perhaps revulsion not by us milton delchamps said do i have to tell you that by who he was found in the company of a man named howard kennedy who also had been beaten to death theres a rumor going around that kennedy was foolish enough to have tried to arrange the whacking of his employer mr pevsner either one of them could have been running vincenzo castillo said thoughtfully weiss considered that then nodded all of this seems to fit very nicely together weiss said but the bottom line is that nothing is going to be done about it the cubansif they said anything at allwould say that vincenzo hasnt been in the direccion general de inteligencia for years the russians will say they never heard of either zhdankov or komogorov whats your point castillo asked the name of the game is to make the other guys hurt weiss said okay but so what castillo said let me return to basic drugs weiss said since bringing these bad guys before the bar of justice just isnt going to happen neither of you has any idea what happens to the heroin once it gets to argentina do you delchamps and castillo shook their heads the intellectually challenged station chief in asuncion has figured that out weiss said has either of you ever wondered how many filet mignon steaks are in the coolers of a cruise ship like for example the holiday spirit of the southern cruise line ill give you a little clue she carries passengers and a crew of some twelve hundred a lot milton delchamps asked innocently since she makes twelveday cruises out of miami about the sunny caribbean each of which features two steak nights and filet mignon is an everpresent option on her luncheon and dinner menus yeah edgar a lot and has either of you ever wondered where they get all this meator the grapefruits and oranges from which is squeezed the fresh juice for the breakfasts served each day etcetera etcetera argentina castillo asked innocently you win the cement bicycle charley weiss said and have either of you ever wondered how all those filet mignons make their way from the argentine pampas to the coolers of the holiday spirit and her many sister ships castillo and delchamps waited for him to go on i left out the succulent oysters lobsters and other fruits of the sea sent from the chilly chilean south pacific seas to the coolers of the holiday spirit and her sister ships weiss said youre forgiven delchamps said get on with it air freight weiss said large aircraftsome of them owned by aleksandr pevsner by the waymake frequent sometimes daily flights from buenos aires to jamaica loaded with chilled but not frozen meat and other victuals for the cruise ship trade jesus castillo said sensing where weiss was headed we all know how wonderful argentine beef is and how cheap and most cruise shipsjust about all of the southern cruise line ships and there are four of these the smallest capable of carrying eleven hundred passengerscall at montego bay or kingston or both on each and every voyage kingston is served by norman manley international airfield and montego bay by sangster international while the happy touristsis there a word for the people who ride these floating hotels cruisers maybeare wandering through the picturesque streets of kingston and montego bay soaking up culture and taking pictures for the folks back home the hardworking jamaican gnomes are moving loins of argentine beef from refrigerator plants and occasionallyif yesterdays flight from buenos aires was delayed for some reasondirectly from the airplane to the coolers on the cruise ships and under the ice is that days shipment of heroin delchamps said edgar youve always been just terrible about thinking such awful things are going on weiss said mock innocently and how do they get it off the ship in the states castillo asked there are several ways to do that weiss said one is with the ships garbage and sewage which now has to be brought ashore rather than as before when it was tossed overboard thereby polluting the pristine waters of the atlantic or in the wee hours of the morn as the vessel approaches miami it is dumped over the side to be retrieved later by sportfishermen global positioning system satellites are very helpful to the retrievers and where is the dea or the coast guard or whoever is supposed to be dealing with this sort of thing while all this is going on castillo asked so far they dont know about it weiss said and castillo sensed that suddenly weiss had become dead serious that his joking attitude had just been shut off as if a switch had been thrown and he made some remark before about montvalewho was supposed to be on top of everything going on in the intelligence communitynot knowing about an important operation what the hell is going on weiss met castillos eyes for a moment and castillo was again reminded of aleksandr pevsner and we dont want them to know about it weiss went on are you going to tell me about that castillo asked carefully thats why im here castillo i told you youre in a position to fuck up an important operation but before i get into that i want you to understand this conversation never took place i cant go along with that you dont have any choice weiss said ill deny it and so will delchamps that leaves out the secret service guy you ran off castillo said he saw you here he saw delchamps and me taking a walk down memory lane thats all paraguay and timmons never came up castillo looked at delchamps i gave him my word ace not for auld lang syne but because it was the only way i could get him to come im not giving you my word about anything castillo said and that specifically includes me not going to montvale and telling him youre withholding intelligence i should have before this gets unpleasant let me tell you about the important operation weiss said the bottom line castillo is that itll be your call tell me about the operation castillo said theres a hell of a lot of money involved here weiss said a goodly share of the proceeds go to support the direccion general de inteligencia which means the fsb doesnt have to support it as much as it has been and thats important because the fsbs ability to fund clandestine operations islamic extremists etcetera has been greatly reduced since we went into iraq and cut off their oilforfood income and the dgi is supporting its sister service in the republic of venezuela which i presume you know is about to become the peoples democratic republic of venezuela under colonel chavez whose heroes are fidel castro josef stalin and vladimir putin and the profits left over after the dgi gets what it needs go to the fsbs secret kitty which supports among other things all those exstasi and exavo people who are causing trouble all over another way to put this is that if it wasnt for all this drug income theyre getting the fsb would have its operations seriously curtailed then my question is why dont you confide in the coast guard the customs service whoever what you know about this operation and have them stop it castillo said then he saw delchamps shake his head and then the look on delchampss face it said not smart ace because weiss said his face and tone suggesting he was being very patient with a backward student even if they did find a cooler full of coke on the holiday spiritand their record of finding anything isnt very goodall that would happen is that we would add a dozen or so people to our prison population so whats the alternative international maritime law provides for the seizure of vesselsincluding aircraftinvolved in the international illicit drug trade you want to grab pevsners airplanes that too but what we want to grab is the holiday spirit and her sister ships do you have any idea how much one of those floating palaces costs castillo shook his head to admit he didnt then asked how are you going to do that prove their owners were aware of the purpose to which they had put their ships how are you going to that theyre not registered to vladimir putin theyre registered to a holding company in panama weiss said and proving that putin controlled that would be difficult but that doesnt matter all we have to prove is that the owners knew what was going on that it was illegal the owners lose the ship the holiday spirit cost a little over three hundred and fifty million and how are you going to prove the owners knew the operation could not be carried on without the captain being aware of what was going on but the captains dont own their ships do they no but they dont get command of a ship except from the owners okay the fsb was not about to entrust a threehundredandfiftymilliondollar ship to some stranger they wanted their own man running things and they didnt want him to come from the saint petersburg masters mates and pilots union because people might start wondering what the russians were doing running a cruise ship operation out of miami so they provided reliable qualified masters with phony documents saying they were latvians or estonians or poles that sounds pretty farfetched youre a pilot right you just flew a gulfstream three to argentina and back right castillo nodded anybody ask to see your pilots license castillo shook his head anybody ever ask to see your pilots license castillo shook his head again youre flying an eight tenmilliondollar airplane youre given the benefit of the doubt right okay you bring a threehundredandfiftymilliondollar ship into port everybodys going to say he must be an any tonnage any ocean master mariner right and proved this to the ownersotherwise they would not have given him their ship right castillo nodded once again we have proof that the master of the holiday spirit and four of his officers gained their nautical experience in the submarine service of the navy of the union of soviet socialist republics and are not latvians estonians or poles or using the names they were born with now all we have to do is prove that the owners knew this and that said officers were actively involved in the smuggling of controlled substances into the united states how are you going to do that by having people on the holiday spirit filipino seamen come cheap getting them onto the holiday spirit took some doing but theyre in place and they have been compiling intelincluding pictures of the ships officers checking the incoming drugs and putting them over the sidefor some time when were absolutely sure we have enough to go to the maritime court in the hague were going to blow the whistle unless of course you go down there and start making waves causing the system to go on hold which would mean we would have to start all over again from scratch and you dont want me to make waves is that it its a question of priority the president wants timmons freed so i understand the only person who can call off my operation is the president castillo said simply and i dont think he will and talking about waves if i go to him with this and he hears the company is withholding intel like this from montvale youll have a tsunami you were listening i trust when i told you we never had this conversation castillo nodded weiss went on montvale will be pissed on two accountsfirst that hes been kept in the dark and second that you let the president know he didnt know what was going on under his nose when the company denies any knowledge of this where does that leave you with montvale or the president youre suggesting i go down there and go through the motions but dont really try to get timmons back im not suggesting anything colonel weiss said but its pretty clear to me that if you go down there and pull a professional operation to get this dea guy back its going to tell these people that they have attracted attention they dont want theyll go in a caution mode and we dont want that he stood up and looked at castillo see you at the briefing tomorrow he said ive been selected to brief you what youre suggesting weiss is that i just leave timmons swinging in the breeze people get left swinging in the breeze all the time weiss said you know that as well as i do i told you before this is your call one guy sometimes gets fucked for the common good weiss looked at delchamps always good to see you ed well have to do lunch or something real soon and then he walked out of the room castillo looked at delchamps thanks a lot ed if you want me to ace ill go with you to montvale or the president or both castillo looked at him with a raised eyebrow but didnt say anything i said i went back a long way with weiss thats not the same thing as saying i liked him then or like him now and i dont like the smell of his operation he paused to let that sink in that being said i dont think that montvale will believe you or me and his first reaction will be to cover his ass what if there were three witnesses to that fascinating conversation dick miller asked coming into the living room from the den im a wounded hero would that give me credence how long have you been in there castillo asked i got back here just as the secret service guy got booted out miller said and curiosity overwhelmed me i still dont think that montvale would believe you me or the wounded hero delchamps said and that his first reaction would be to cover his ass so what do i do youre asking for my advice ace humbly seeking same delchamps nodded and said aside from calling off jake torine and munz nothing give yourself some time to think it over hear what weiss says at the briefing tomorrow you better call off munz and torine miller agreed i dont think darby and solez are a problem they dont know youve been ordered to get timmons back they went to asuncion to shut mouths thats to be expected lets hope aloysiuss radio works castillo said i told torine to go right to asuncion theyre probably already over the caribbean he pushed himself out of his chair picked up his mostly untouched drink and walked to the den max followed him vi one west boulevard drive alexandria virginia september castillos cell phone buzzed and on the second buzz he rolled over in bed grabbed it rolled back onto his back put the phone to his ear and said you sonofabitch good morning colonel castillo recognized the voice as that of his secret service driver it may be for you castillo said but i have just been lickedon the mouthby a halfton dog i tried to put my head in your door to wake you but max made it pretty clear he didnt think that was a good idea ill be right down castillo said and sat up max was sitting on the floor beside the double bed castillo put his hand on the bed to push himself out of the bed the blanket was warm he looked and saw that the pillow on the other side was depressed goddamn it max youre a nice doggie but you dont get to sleep with me max said arf castillo pulled open the door to the front passenger seat of the denali max brushed him aside and leapt effortlessly onto the seat tell him to get in the back dick castillo said major dick miller gave lieutenant colonel castillo the finger and bowed castillo into the second seat there was a muted buzz and the red led on the telephone base mounted on the back of the drivers seat began to flash castillo looked at it the legend dni montvale moved across the screen castillo picked up the handset good morning mr ambassador where are you charley we just pulled into a waffle house for our breakfast are you open to a suggestion yes sir of course visavis the briefing this morning if i sent truman ellsworth representing me and he announced that you were representing secretary hall i think fewer questions would be raised truman c ellsworth was executive assistant to montvale he had worked for montvale in a dozen different positions in government over the years montvale had tried to send him to work as liaison officer between the office of the director of national intelligence and the office of organizational analysis recognizing this as an attempt to plant a spy in his operation castillo had declined the offer and had to threaten that he would appeal it to the president to keep ellsworth out of ooa for this and other reasonsas ellsworth seemed to be personally offended that the ooa did not come under montvales authoritycastillo knew he was not one of ellsworths favorite people his first reaction was suspicionwhats the bastard up to herebut what montvale was suggesting made sense the less conspicuous he was the better that makes sense mr ambassador castillo said i think so montvale said and the connection was broken they all ordered country ham and eggs for breakfast when castillo was finished with his he collected the ham scraps and silverdollarsized bone and put them onto a napkin for the beast the secret service driver asked and when castillo nodded added his to the napkin and then miller added his the napkin now was full to the point of falling apart in the denali max sniffed the offering he then delicately picked up one of the pieces of bone there was a brief crunching sound and then he picked up another crunched that and then picked up the third i wonder the secret service man asked softly how many pounds of pressure per square inch that took try not to think what he would have done to your arm had you tried to disturb my sleep castillo said two office of the chief office of organizational analysis department of homeland security the nebraska avenue complex washington dc september good morning chief ooa deputy chief of administration agnes forbison greeted castillo and hello again max wheres your sweetheart thats right castillo said youve met max madchen is in the family way and resting at the motel monica lewinsky its a long story what are you going to do with him i dont really know castillo admitted he switched to hungarian say hello to the nice lady max max looked at him then walked to agnes sat down and looked up at her agnes scratched his ears what did you say to him she asked i told him you had a pound of raw hamburger in your purse i dont max agnes said to him but if youre going to be here for long ill pick some up at lunch she looked at castillo is he going to be here for long castillo told her how he had come into temporary possession of max agnes smiled and shook her head well maybe hes just what you need chief every boy should have a dog and it looks to me that hes not all that upset about getting the boot from his happy home max had returned to castillo and was now sitting beside him pressing his head against castillos leg hes an excellent judge of character castillo said the intelligence community is gathering in the conference room agnes said is there anything you need besides a cup of coffee before you go in there she put action to her words by going to a coffee service on a credenza behind her desk and getting him a cup of coffee thank you maam castillo said and then asked what do we hear from jake torine he called five minutes ago over one of those new radios you got in vegas what did he have to say they just took off from buenos aires that translates to mean that hell be in baltimore in about ten hours i cant wait that long castillo said thoughtfully and jakell be beat when he gets here wait that long for what i have to go to fort rucker you want to go commercialwhich may be difficult because of the hurricaneor are you in your usual rush whats the other option he asked as dick miller walked in ooa now has a contract with execujet she said who promise to provide service at the airport of your choice within an hour then transport you to any airport of your choice within the united states in unparalleled luxury and comfort two questions isnt that unparalleled luxury and comfort going to be painfully expensive and how do you thinkwhat did you say execujetfeels about dogs expensive yes but painfully no you did hear that there has been a substantial deposit to our account in the caymansright at fortysix million castillo nodded illgotten gains about to be spent on noble purposes he said mockingly solemn youre taking max with you until i figure out what to do with him maybe my grandmotherd take care of him for me i dont think thats a viable option chief she said drily and ill have to take one of the new radios and our sergeant neidermeyer with me dick can work the radio here until we can get some more communicators up here from bragg once more colonel sir dick miller said your faithful chief of staff is way ahead of you we now have four communicators five counting sergeant neidermeyer general mcnab said to be sure to tell you how much he now deeply regrets ever having made your acquaintance ill give execujet a headsup agnes said max wont be a problem when do you want to leave as soon as whatever happens in there is over he said nodding at the door to the conference room first i want to hit the commo room there were five young men in the small room off castillos office which had been taken over as the commo room there was something about them that suggested the military despite their civilian clothingsports jackets and slacksand their civilian haircuts no one called attention but the moment castillo pushed open the door all of them were on their feet and standing tall good morning jamie castillo said to the young man closest to him gesturing for the men to relax welcome home colonel sergeant james jamie neidermeyer said neidermeyer just imported from the stockade at bragg to run the ooa commo room was a little shorter than castillo with wide shoulders a strong youthful face and thoughtful eyes thank you jamie unfortunately i wont be staying got your bag packed yes sir you dont have to leave our nations capital of course jamie you could send one of these guys castillo put out his hand to the next closest of the young men my name is castillo yes sir sergeant first class pollman colonel as he repeated the process with the others max went to the near corner of the room and lay down his eyes on castillo and the room what do you guys think of our new radios castillo asked there was a chorus of outstanding sir and first class sir we just talked to colonel torine sir neidermeyer said he was five minutes out of buenos aires mrs forbison told me castillo said i guess jamie has brought you up to speed on the new radios and what were doing here another chorus of yes sir anyone got any family problemsgirlfriend problems dont countwith working with ushere and elsewherefor a while another chorus this time of no sir and everybody is on per diem right which doesnt look like its going to be enough for washington this time it was apparent that all of them were reluctant to complain mrs forbison will get you each an american express credit card castillo said they will be paid by the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund which understands the problems of a hardship assignment in washington use them for everythingmeals your rooms laundryeverything but whiskey and wild women save your per diem for the whiskey and wild women theres a threat to go along with that make any waves that call any attention whatever to whats going on here and you will shortly afterward find yourself teaching wouldbe rangers how to eat snakes rodents and insects in the semitropical jungle swamps at hurlburt everybody understand that that produced another chorus this time with smiles of yes sir okay im glad to have you i know that vic dalessando wouldnt have sent you if you werent the best he paused to let that sink in then asked questions sir what kind of a dog is that max is a bouvier des flandres castillo said it has been reliably reported that one of his ancestors bit off one of adolf hitlers testicles during the first world war that produced more smiles and you sergeant phillips are herewith appointed his temporary custodian ive got to go sit around a table with some washington bureaucrats and i dont think max would be welcome have we got anything we can use as a leash phillips opened a drawer in the table holding the radios and came out with a coil of wire from which he quickly fashioned a leash he handed it to castillo who looped it to the dring of maxs collar and then handed the end of it to sergeant phillips max you stay castillo said in hungarian and then switched back to english and while im gone jamie make up your mind whos going with me ever willing to make any sacrifice for the common good colonel neidermeyer said i will take that hardship upon myself your call jamie where we going sir neidermeyer said buenos aires you like buenos aires do you it is not what i would call a hardship assignment sir were going to rucker sergeant neidermeyer one more proof that a smart soldier never volunteers for anything castillo raised his arm in a gesture of so long and walked out of the radio room and into his office miller was sitting on the edge of his desk theyre waiting for you he said nodding toward the door to the conference room you want me to come along please castillo said and went to the door and opened it truman ellsworth a tall silverhaired rather elegant man in his fifties was standing at a lectern set up at the head of the conference table there were a dozen people sitting at the table which had places for twenty there were perhaps twice that number sitting on chairs against the walls obviously subordinates of the people at the table and not senior enough to be at the table the only person castillo recognized was milton weiss he was sitting near one end of the table between a man and a woman obviously the cia delegation castillo and miller took seats halfway down the table across from weiss who looked at castillo but gave no sign of recognition if i may have your attention ladies and gentlemen ellsworth said now that lieutenant colonel castillo who is the representative of the department of homeland security has joined us we can get this under way you pompous sonofabitch should i have brought a note from my mommy saying why im late my name is truman ellsworth ambassador montvale had other things on his plate this morning and sent me to represent him this is as i said an informal meeting but in view of the sensitive material which may come to light a top secret security classification is in place and it is not to be recorded as i understand it ellsworth went on the attorney general and the dni ambassador montvale are agreed that there may well be intelligence aspects to the kidnapping of a dea agent in paraguay and that it behooves us to share informally what information we have which might shed light on the situation may i suggest that the principals identify themselves why dont we work our way around the table he sat down and nodded to a swarthy man on his right john walsh dea the man said helena dumbrowsky state department a somewhat plump redhaired woman announced norman seacroft treasury he was a slight thin man in a baggy suit milton weiss cia colonel k l debois dia the representative of the defense intelligence agency was tall and wiry and wore his hair clipped almost to the skull c g castillo homeland security inspector bruce saffery fbi saffery was a welltailored man in his early fifties castillo thought i wonder if he knows inspector john j doherty excuse me colonel debois said looking at castillo and holding up his index finger but didnt mr ellsworth just refer to you as lieutenant colonel ellsworth you sonofabitch im not wearing a uniform you didnt have to refer to me as an officer and why do i think that wasnt an accident yes sir i believe he did youre a serving officer yes sir andpresuming im allowed to askwhat exactly is it you do for the department of homeland security colonel sir im an executive assistant to the secretary how much do you know about the office of organizational analysis aside from that were using their conference room sir not much the reason im asking colonel is that i was ordered to transfer one of my officers a young lieutenant who was stationed in asuncion to the office of organizational analysis oh shit lorimer castillo glanced at truman ellsworth and saw that he was looking at him ellsworths face was expressionless but he was looking his name is first lieutenant edmund j lorimer debois pursued i just cant help you colonel castillo said this meeting hasnt even started and im already lying through my teeth to a fellow officer who looks like a nice guy perhaps you could ask secretary hall colonel castillo ellsworth suggested helpfully oh you miserable sonofabitch yes i suppose i could do that castillo said ill get back to you colonel if im able to find out anything id appreciate it debois said hes a nice young officer who lost a leg from above the knee in afghanistan ive been sort of keeping an eye on him ill see what i can find out for you sir as soon as this meeting is over id really appreciate it colonel why dont we start with you mr walsh ellsworth said exactly what happened in asuncion walsh took ten minutes to report in minute detail less than castillo already knew he didnt mention the garrote with which timmonss driver had been murdered just that he had been killed means unspecified castillo decided he either hadnt been told how the driver had been killed or had and didnt understand the significance without saying so in so many words walsh made it clear that he thought the dea could get timmons back by themselves if certain restrictions on what they could do were relaxed mrs dumbrowsky of the state department took the same amount of time to explain the excellent relations enjoyed by the united states with the republic of paraguay expressed great admiration for the paraguayan lawenforcement authorities and made it clear without saying so in so many words that she strongly felt it would be a diplomatic disaster if a cretin like walsh was allowed to destroy the aforesaid splendid relationship by going down there guns blazing and taking the law into his own hands mr seacroft of the treasury department somewhat jocularly said that while he wasnt much of an admirer of anything french he did think it was hard to disagree with their criminal investigation philosophy of searching for the money and announced that he was going to run everything he had through the computers again and see what came out the other end castillo had glanced at ellsworth several times during mr seacrofts discourse castillo had seen from ellsworths look of utter contempt that he too knew that the french criminal investigation philosophy was cherchez la femmethough their seeking of femme meant women not money milton weiss of the cia said that he had to confess being a little surprised at the attention the kidnapping of special agent timmons was getting he had heardunofficially of coursethat it was a notuncommon occurrenceperhaps even commonand that in the end the drug thugs usually turned the kidnappee free he implied that the agency had far more important things to do than worry about one dea agent who it could be reasonably assumed had some idea of what he was getting himself into when he first became a dea agent and subsequently went to paraguay the cia would however weiss said keep its ear to the ground and promptly inform everybody if it came up with something it was castillos turn next im sorry he said i know nothing about this im just here to listen and learn and the truth here if im to believe what ive heard from these people is that i know more about this than anyone else except of course weiss and hes lying through his teeth making at least two of us here who are doing that colonel debois was next and he immediately began to prove that he had come to the meeting prepared to share whatever knowledge the dia had with the rest of the intelligence community i think ithe diahas more knowledge of the situation down there than maybe we should he began the background to that is that our people there the defense attache and his assistants are encouraged to report informally on matters that come to their attention that are not entirely defense related but which they feel may be of interest to the dia lieutenant lorimer to whom i referred earlier became friends with special agent timmons and from him learned a good deal about the dea operations there which lorimer passed on to us timmons may well have crossed the need to know line there telling lorimer what he did but i think that areas a little fuzzy if were here to share intelligence whats really wrong with our people in the field doing the same thing its against the law for one thing milton weiss said oh come on weiss john walsh of the dea said they all do it and we all know they do it and you know as well as i do that theres nothing really wrong with it good for you walsh i think i like you if im getting into something here that perhaps i shouldnt debois said whatever you heard from your people couldnt really be called reliable intelligence could it ellsworth said it would be in legal terms hearsay would it not id like to hear the hearsay castillo said ellsworth flashed castillo an icy look is that because he doesnt like me challenging him or because he doesnt want debois to report what lorimer told him please go on sir castillo said i thought you were chairing this meeting mr ellsworth weiss demanded were supposed to be sharing intel so lets share it castillo said careful charley you dont want to lose your temper after a moments hesitation ellsworth said i think if colonel castillo wants to hear what colonel debois has to say then we should with my caveat that it really is hearsay actually rather than hard intelligence debois said what lieutenant lorimer provided might be called backgroundhis informal assessment of the problems down there his own opinions plus what he heard from special agent timmons and others why dont you get on with it colonel weiss said impatiently so the rest of us can get out of here very well debois said lorimer reported that timmons said and he agreed that the drug operations in paraguay are more sophisticated than might be expected sophisticated weiss parroted incredulously the drug people in paraguay seemed to be taking unusual steps to keep from calling attention to themselves debois said i thought all drug dealers did that weiss said if you keep interrupting colonel debois mr weiss castillo said well all be here a long time why not let him finish and then offer your comments all at once colonel debois looked at castillo gratefully then went on according to lorimer timmons said they had sort of a system a sophisticated system of dealing with the paraguayan authorities a system of rewards and punishment id like to hear about that walsh said this is all news to me for one example people approach the children of paraguayan police on their way home from school they give them envelopes to give to their mothers the envelopes contain money i dont understand mrs dumbrowsky said well to special agent timmons it was pretty clear it was a message if you dont give us trouble we will give you money and if you do we know where to find your family mr walsh how experienced an agent was timmons weiss asked he hadnt been down there long if thats what youre asking walsh said and how long had he been with the dea he hasnt been in dea very long but if youre suggesting he wasthat he issort of a rookie i dont think thats right he was a cop in chicago he comes from a family of cops and hes a lawyer he was recruited for the dea by one of our guys in chicago who met him and liked what he saw hes fluent in spanish go on please colonel weiss said and tell us whatever else this very bright very new dea agent has theorized colonel debois nodded and said timmons also saw sophistication in how these people dealt with dea agents there were significant differences for one thing there were no envelopes with money which timmons felt was significant because it meant that the drug people knew the dea agents could neither be bought nor coerced by threats against their families or because the drug people knew that injuringor killingthe family of an american would bring a good deal of attention but they are willing to kidnap dea agents inspector saffery of the fbi asked thats the first time hes opened his mouth oh yes one would think that dea agents would protect themselves from being kidnapped weiss said wouldnt you inspector very few fbi agents are kidnapped saffery said chuckling thats what timmons found interesting debois said doesnt kidnapping imply a ransom norman seacroft of the treasury department asked thats interesting how much did they ask kidnapping is taking someone against his or her will saffery said somewhat intolerantly there doesnt have to be a ransom element these people dont ask for a ransom not so far walsh said then why do they kidnap them and how do we get them back seacroft asked according to what timmons told lorimer they kidnap them to suggest that working too hard to interdict the flow of drugs is not smart but they turn them loose right seacroft said as i understand it all the dea agents who have been kidnapped have been returned unharmed weiss said mr weiss are you suggesting that becoming addicted to heroin is not being harmed colonel debois asked coldly courteous addicted to heroin seacroft parroted debois explained i dont know the exact figuretimmons didnt knowbut at least two kidnapped dea agents who were turned free by their captors had become addicted to heroin four walsh said let me make sure i understand this inspector saffery said while these people held the dea agents they forced heroin on them turned them into addicts correct walsh said thats hard to believe mrs dumbrowsky said the ones who were addicted were released after there had been a successful delivery of a large drug shipment walsh said this is the first ive heard of this saffery said indignantly inspector walsh said think about it if you were a field agent who had become involuntarily addicted would you like that information to become widely known evenperhaps especiallywithin the fbi as mr ellsworth has pointed out this is nothing more than hearsay mrs dumbrowsky said the state department has heard nothing like this and unless the colonel has some more fascinating hearsay to relate weiss said i really do have other things to do he stood up as a matter of fact mr weiss i wasnt quite through debois said coldly weiss reluctantly sat down putting everything together timmons had been wondering if perhaps the paraguayan drugshipment operation was being run by someone other than the paraguayancolombianbolivian drug people castillo glanced at weiss you didnt expect to hear that did you milton but who is he talking about i cant believe that timmons got into the stasidgi involvement thats absurd weiss said why is it absurd mr weiss debois asked courteously on its face weiss said wait a minute saffery said why not the drug trade didnt start last week a lot of these people have lived in the states for yearssome of them even legally with green cards even citizenship your point inspector weiss interrupted what im saying is that theyve been in the states long enough to figure out what cousin jose back in colombia has been doing wrong and to tell him how to do it right define right for me please inspector weiss said dont kill our dea people saffery said that draws attention to you knock off that macho bullshitexcuse me mrs dumbrowskythat doesnt make us any money getting the stuff through is what makes us money with all respect inspector i still think thats absurd weiss said and stood up again mr ellsworth if i have to say this if the agency comes by some solid intelligence it will be immediately brought to your attention and that of ambassador montvale thank you ellsworth said the rest of the cia delegation was now on its feet they followed weiss to the door not that one weiss castillo blurted thats the door to my office by then weiss had cracked the door open he turned to look at castillo max towing sergeant phillips behind him shouldered the door open the edge caught weiss on the side of the face sonofabitch he exclaimed and backed away running into the rest of the cia delegation and causing further consternation no one actually fell down but almost and two briefcases hit the floor max went to castillo sat down and offered him his paw colonel im sorry phillips said i didnt realize how strong he is presumably castillo that animal is yours ellsworth said actually im just minding him for a friend castillo said you all right mr weiss weiss glared at him then marched to the other door and the cia delegation departed the others in the room were reacting as if an auto accident had just happened before their eyes no one moved or showed any inclination to do so well it would appear this meeting is over castillo said ellsworth looked at him with a stone face then turned to those at the table and said yes it would appear that way thank you all for coming colonel castillo said to colonel debois may i have a moment of your time sir he gestured toward the open door to his office debois nodded stood up and walked to the door then through it castillo with max and phillips behind him followed and then miller dick castillo said close and lock that behind you will you please i thought i heard you say my office debois said are you going to tell me whats going on here colonel castillo did not immediately respond he said take the leash off max phillips and then see if you can raise the safe house yes sir maxas if he had understood what castillo had orderedsat down and allowed phillips to remove the wire leash from his neck phillips went into the commo room max walked to castillo and lay down at his feet castillo met deboiss eyes sir with respect you are not here and never have been here but if you had been here everything you might have seen heard or intuited is classified top secret presidential deboiss eyebrows rose but he didnt reply phillips came to the door of the commo room and said were up sir sir castillo said and asked debois with his eyes to go ahead of him into the commo room sergeant neidermeyer handed castillo the handset the screen flashed the legend susanna sieno castillo pressed the speaker button then said good morning susanna how are things in our nations capital i just had an unpleasant session with one of your coworkers a guy named milton weiss know him unfortunately is eddie lorimer around right here colonel lorimers voice came over the speaker colonel debois of dia has been asking about you i guess that was bound to happen colonel dbs one of the good guys colonel what did you tell him nothing of course castillo said hold one eddie he put his hand over the microphone im sorry colonel castillo said but that concludes your tour of the office of organizational analysis debois looked at him a long moment before he spoke thank you colonel castillo if you ever need anything anything at all you know where to find me thank you sir and if you hear anything interesting id be grateful if youd pass it to major miller debois nodded and walked out of the commo room castillo put the handset to his ear and turned off the speaker susanna how long will it take to get just about everybody there including darby and santini and munz probably the better part of two hours well its important so will you set it up please give me a call when everybodys there will do she said break it down neidermeyer castillo said and handed him the handset stay loose as soon as im finished with that call were off yes sir castillo walked out of the commo room and sat down at his desk you shut off the phones in the hotel he asked miller shook his head castillo picked up one of the telephones on his desk and punched one of the buttons on it and how are you this bright and sunny morning uncle billy castillo asked in german i probably shouldnt admit this to you eric kocian said but im actually feeling pretty chipper madchen and i took our morning constitutional past the white house i was reminded of what people say about paris which is beautiful city if it wasnt for the people id love it and then i came back to the hotel and had a word with the manager what didnt you like i told him that once he provided a decent leather armchair with footrest the accommodations would be satisfactory and to continue to send the bill to fulda billy what am i supposed to do with max you were the one who sent madchen to him as ye sow so shall ye reap ive been thinking of sending him to my grandmother his broken heart would be on your conscience karlchen max took one look at you andfor reasons that baffle metransferred his affections to you but dogs choose their masters you know rather than the other way around castillo looked across his office max was lying on the carpet in front of the couch his head between his paws looking at him where was sandor tor when you took your walk this morning he insisted on going with me he and an apparently deaf man from the secret service he wears a hearing aid and keeps talking to his lapel castillo laughed even though he knew he shouldnt you know why hes there billy even as much as they dislike me i dont think the fsb is going to try to shoot me in front of the white house never underestimate your enemy write that down uncle billy if you have nothing important to say karlchen the hotel has at long last delivered our breakfast they do a very nice corned beef hash with poached eggs i suspect madchen will like it ive got to go out of town for a couple of days well resume this conversation when i get back remember not to give max more than one small piece of chocolate at a time too much chocolate gives him flatulence auf wiedersehen karlchen castillo put the handset back in its cradle he opened his mouth as if to say something but didnt a red led on another telephone was flashing castillo leaned to it to read the legend montvale he said and reached for it that didnt take long did it miller asked good morning mr ambassador castillo said why do i think youve just been talking to mr ellsworth he has a phone in his yukon montvale said did you actually bring that dog to the meeting actually max invited himself i gather the meeting wasnt all that we hoped it would be i didnt learn much that i didnt already know so whats next in case the president asks in case the president asks well i have to go to macdill to see general mcnab and then to fort rucker to see about hueys and then to mississippi to see if i can talk ambassador lorimer out of going to uruguay your plane is back already no im going to travel in unparalleled luxury and comfort in an execujet aircraft which will not be able to land at either macdill or fort rucker without making waves would you like to use my plane id love to use your plane but what if you need it ill get something from andrews then i gratefully accept thank you itll be waiting for you in say thirty minutes keep in touch charley yes sir i will the line went dead do you think hes loaning you his airplane because he likes you miller asked or because he can now tell the president he loaned it to you you have a suspicious and devious mind major miller have you ever considered a career in intelligence charley if you wantit would save you two hoursi can bring the people in argentina up to speed unless theres something i dont know bottom line make no waves miller nodded castillo stood up and walked to the door of the commo room come on neidermeyer he said were off three macdill air force base tampa florida september the ground handlers wanded the gulfstream v to a stop on the visiting aircraft tarmac an air force master sergeant who castillo had decided was a combination of crew chief and steward moved quickly to open the door max who had been lying in the aisle beside castillos chair greeted him at the door and went down the steps long before anyone could stop him castillo looked out his window vainly hoping that no one would be watching general bruce j mcnab was marching toward the aircraft two officers one middleaged and the other younger were on his heels all were wearing the army combat uniform a loosefitting garment of light green gray and tan camouflage material worn with the jacket outside the trousers all were wearing green berets one of mcnabs rather bushy eyebrows rose and his head moved toward the nose of the aircraft castillo couldnt see what he was watching but there was a very good chance he was watching max void his bladder on the nose gear sorry colonel neidermeyer said that sonofabitch is quick not a problem castillo said as he pushed himself out of his seat general mcnab would have found something to criticize anyway when castillo got to the door he saw max was sitting at the foot of the stair door waiting for him he went down the steps faced general mcnab came to attention and saluted crisply mcnab returned it with a casual wave in the direction of his forehead i was going to compliment you colonel mcnab said on your recruiting poster appearance but curiosity overwhelms me where did that animal come from sir im going from here to rucker i thought class as would be a good idea and the animal thats max sir im keeping him for a friend neidermeyer came down the stairs jamie general mcnab said didnt your mother ever tell you that you will be judged by the company you keep good afternoon sir neidermeyer said good to see you sir it wont be afternoon for another twentyfour minutes mcnab said but im glad to see you too gentlemen this is sergeant neidermeyer one of the better communicators from the stockade the splendidly attired officer is lieutenant colonel castillo and all the terrible things you have heard about him are true the colonel walked around mcnab and offered castillo his hand tom kingston castillo he said and i have to tell you that on the way here the general told inmanhe nodded toward the young officerthat he hopes whatever you have that made you the best aide he ever had is contagious because maybe hell get lucky and catch it colonel kingston general mcnab said who betrays my confidential remarks at the drop of a hat was wondering what youre doing here charley i couldnt tell him are you going to tell him or are you going to let him stumble around in the dark this might not be the best place to get into that sir okay inman take sergeant neidermeyerand the airplane crew and that animalsomewhere nice for lunch eat slowly when youre finished bring them by my quarters by then colonel kingston lieutenant colonel castillo and i will probably be through saying unkind things about enlisted men and junior officers yes sir the aide said mcnab made a follow me gesture and started marching across the tarmac mrs donna mcnab kissed castillo on the cheek before he was completely through the front door oh its good to see you charley for gods sake dont encourage him general mcnab said im trying to get rid of him before he gets me in trouble again how long can you stay she asked ignoring her husband maybe an hour and a half castillo said the naylors will be really disappointed they wont be back until tomorrow afternoon me too it would have been great to see them she looked at mcnab and said everythings set up on the patio darling im giving you the benefit of the doubt that this is important and will leave you alone thank you it is mcnab said made another follow me gesture and led colonel kingston and castillo through the house and out back to a walled patio there was a gas grill a side table on which sat a plate of tbone steaks and another of tomatoes and a small patio table that seated four and had place settings for three i will now be able to state that my former aide landed here for fuel and i entertained him at lunch at my quarters mcnab said purely a social occasion castillo nodded his understanding we are having steak and tomatoes mcnab went on because i am on a diet that allows me all the meat i want to eat and small portions of fresh vegetables while i am cooking the steaks you can bring kingston up to speed or as much speed as you feel appropriate yes sir castillo said colonel i have to begin this with the statement that everything i tell you or you intuit is classified top secret presidential understood kingston said maybe it would clear the air a little colonel if i told you that the secretary of defense has called general mcnab and instructed him to give you whatever you ask for and that you would tell us only what you felt was appropriate castillo nodded he began a dea agent named timmons has been kidnapped in paraguay the president has promised the mayor of chicago that he will get this guy back and tasked me to do so and there is one more problem castillo said when he had finished explaining what he had planned and the problems he saw in doing it general mcnab his mouth full of steak gestured for him to go on the agency is apparently running an operation down there to catch these people in the act of bringing drugs into the states aboard cruise ships they intend to seize the shipships pluralunder maritime law a guy named milton weisshe paused to see if either mcnab or kingston knew of weiss and when both shook their heads went oncame to see me last night and as much as told me to butt out mcnab held up his hand as a signal to wait until he had finished chewing that took at least ten seconds mcnab then said that sort of operation i would thinkcorrect me if im wrong tomwould be run by the dea or the coast guard or for that matter the navy theyve got an oni operation in key west to do just that sort of thing he looked at kingston who nodded his agreement so what does montvale have to say about this montvale doesnt know about it castillo said the agency is up to something like that and the director of national intelligence doesnt know about it mcnab said maybe doesnt want to kingston asked i dont think he knows castillo said he was there when the president gave me this job he didnt think it was a good idea neither did natalie cohen i think if heand now that i think of ithe or natalie knew about this agency operation one or the other or both would have used it as an argument to get the president to change his mind unless of course they know the president well enough to judge that he was not in a frame of mind to change his mind mcnab said i dont think he knows castillo said i dont think either of them do how did this weiss character know what youre up to kingston asked castillo told them about delchamps and then that miller had eavesdropped on the session with weiss and that both were willing to go with him to the president mcnab thoughtfully chewed another piece of beef then said my advice charley would be to obey the last lawful order you received which was to go get the dea guy back i was hoping youd say that sir castillo said that was advice charley im not in a position to give you orders yes sir i understand but thanks for the advice i hope it didnt change your mind about anything no sir it did not good maybe you did learn something after all during all those years you were my canape passer castillo chuckled as long as he had been mcnabs aidedecamp he had never passed a canape to the generals guests mcnab regarded the primary function of an aidedecamp to be sort of an intern an opportunity for a junior officer to see how senior officers functioned and learn from it he wondered if the young captain whom mcnab had sent to feed neidermeyer max and the gulfstream crew understood this mcnab had never said anything to me i had to figure it out myself that was part of the training okay tom what do you think mcnab said and thats something else i learned from bruce j mcnab id heard about it at the point but i learned it from him a wise officer getseven if he has to force the issuethe opinions and suggestions of his subordinates before he offers his own and more important makes any decisions that way they say what they think rather than what they think the boss wants to hear nothing general but how to get the hueys down there black kingston said thoughtfully that does not pose much of a real problemexcept the usual ones time and money castillo wants this done yesterday with respect sir its not me who wants it done yesterday castillo said but black outweighs time how about money kingston asked you tell me how much is wanted and where and dick miller will wire it within a matter of hours it would be impolitic of you tom mcnab said to ask where hes getting the money my concern is whether theres enough theres enough castillo said charley has some experience with how much black costs mcnab said so how do we get the hueys down there and exactly where do we send them open for a wild hair kingston asked mcnab nodded the ronald reagan kingston said mcnab pursed his lips thoughtfully excuse me castillo asked its an aircraft carrier charley named after the gipper mcnab said drily kingston added and its sailing around the world or at least down the east coast of south america and around the horn or whatever they call it and then up the west coast to san diego onto her tom mcnab corrected him shes sailing around the world kingston nodded if we could get those hueys onto her either before she leaves or even after she leaves they could just be flown off wouldnt that make waves castillo asked and then heard what he had just said and shaking his head muttered jesus christ i dont think so kingston said smiling at him we could say theyre for the press or something the navy probably wont like the idea the navy will do what the secretary of defense tells it to do mcnab said flatly you have a place where they could be landed black kingston asked i know just the place castillo said but the last time i was in uruguay their head cop told me goodbye and please dont come back you want me to set this up with the navy or not charley mcnab asked yes sir please ill find a place to fly them off to before they get there just the hueys or the hueys and the shooters just the hueys castillo said weve got a few days it would be better to send them down as tourists or soccer players a couple at a time no problem with spanishspeaking ateams tom mcnab asked no get on the horn to bragg i want four shooters on their way within twelve hours different airlines and six every twentyfour hours thereafter you have a place for them to go charley by the time they get there i will he wrote several telephone numbers on a sheet of paper and handed the paper to kingston thats if something happens and lorimer doesnt meet them at the airport kingston nodded his understanding we could send the weapons and the gear on the hueys castillo said thoughtfully if we cant get the hueys into the country black we wont need the weapons and thatll eliminate having to send them under diplomatic cover which would open a can of worms kingston grunted his approval get the weapons and gear moving to rucker right away mcnab ordered theres a buck general there crenshaw ive dealt with before ill get on the horn to him and give him a headsup tell him to stash the weapons and gear until charley knows what he wants to do with it yes sir ill also tell him to expect eight huey pilotsand four crew chiefsfrom the th at campbell same story ill get on the horn to campbell myself as soon as i can yes sir kingston said anything else for right now kingston looked at castillo the money kingston said youve got a black account here sir in the base branch of the wachovia bank if youll give me the number sir ill get on the horn to dick miller and the money will probably be in it by the close of their business day how much will you need sir this isnt going to be cheap castillo weve got will a million cover it for openers sir more than enough kingston said wrong answer tom mcnab said probably not colonel castillo but we can always come back to you for more right yes sir thats it then mcnab asked i think that covers just about everything for now sir kingston said yes sir thank you both why dont we see if miller is going to have any problems getting the money down here before i start loaning you money from my special funds mcnab said castillo took his cellular phone from his pocket kingston handed him a slip of paper ninety seconds later castillo broke the connection done sir major miller sends his compliments sir story going around is that hes being retired medically true yes sir first of the month hes going to work for me mcnab shook his head goddamn shame he said and then heard what he had said i dont mean his working for you charley i meanthis being involuntarily retired yes sir it is mcnab shook his head and then smiled okay those shrill girlish giggles you may have been hearing are those made by my wife when she is playing with a dog i suspect everybodys here once again my timing is perfect he began to scrape the meat scraps from his plate onto another and then reached for castillos plate that animal of yours eats meat right yes sir he does when they went into house mrs bruce j mcnab was already feeding max charley hes adorable she said and he really loves chocolate doesnt he thats his fourth hershey bar vii one cairns army airfield fort rucker alabama september castillo stuck his head in the cockpit of the gulfstream v and said thanks guys any time colonel the pilot an air force major said as he offered his hand youve got another general meeting you colonel the copilot a young captain said offering his hand and then pointing out the window castillo saw that the copilot was wearing an air force academy ring another bright and bushytailed young man he thought not unkindly who went through the academy dreaming of soaring through the wild blue yonder in a supersonic fighter jetand wound up in the right seat of a gulfstream and who by now has realized hes lucky to be there most of his classmates are probably still wingless flying a supply room desk the air force had far more academy graduates wantingand qualified forflight training than the air force had a requirement for pilots the bitter joke going around the air force was if you really wanted to fly you should have joined the army they have more aircraft than we do castillo looked to where the lieutenant pointed brigadier general crenshaw the deputy commander of fort rucker and the army aviation center was standing in the door of the base operations building with a young officer oh shit last time i saw him i said i was secret service that waswhatjust three days ago when castillo turned back to the passenger compartment he saw that the crew chiefsteward had already unloaded their luggage and neidermeyer was going down the stair door steps cradling the radio suitcase in his arms max was standing in the aisle straining against his makeshift leash which was firmly tied to a seat mount untying the wire leash proved difficult as maxs tugging on it had really tightened the knot castillo finally got it undone and allowed max to tow him down the stairdoor steps as he did he saw that crenshaw had walked across the tarmac to the airplane he saluted as well as he could while allowing max to make his way to the nose gear where max lifted his leg and broke wind several times loudly did you have to teach him to do that colonel general crenshaw asked or did it come naturally to him castillo could think of nothing to say but good afternoon sir so he said that welcome back to fort rucker colonel crenshaw said i have been reliably informed that you did in fact learn how to fly in texas and that there was probably a good reason you told me you were in the secret service castillos confusion showed on his face general crenshaw smiled and nodded toward base operations two familiar faces were now standing outside the building one was lieutenant general harold f wilson us army retired wearing bermuda shorts and a pink golf shirt the other was lieutenant colonel randolph richardson in acus general wilson waved happily colonel richardson smiled or is he grimacing as he squints in the bright sunlight castillo thought when general mcnab called to tell me you were coming i was on the fifteenth hole with general wilson i was once his aide so i knew about his relationship with your father i havent seen general wilson for several years castillo said he retired to phoenix i believe thats right general crenshaw said and i havent seen richardson fori dont remember the last time i saw him well hes my very competent assistant g which makes him just the man to get you whatever you came for would that be all right with you yes sir that would be fine thank you and this gentleman is crenshaw asked my communicator sir sergeant first class neidermeyer he has to be close to me so i was going to introduce him as mister neidermeyer and smuggle him in a boq with me but im a little tired of bending the truth so i guess its the daleville inn crenshaw offered his hand to neidermeyer welcome to fort rucker mr neidermeyer he said i hope you and colonel castillo find the magnolia house comfortable hearing the name magnolia house brought back fond memories for castillo more than a decade ago his grandparents had stayed in the world war iiera frame housing that had been converted to a cottage for transient vips thank you sir castillo said castillo crenshaw and neidermeyer started to walk across the tarmac two neat young sergeants trotted out to them and offered to take their luggage neidermeyer would not part with the radio suitcase when castillo and neidermeyer got close to the building general wilson spread his arms wide how are you charley he called and wrapped him in a bear hug when he let him go he said bethany talked yesterday to your grandmother who told her you had made a couple of flying trips to the doublebarc but as usual she had no idea where you were so im really glad to see you ive been moving around a lot castillo said what are you doing here oh we came to see beth and randy and the grandchildren ruckers hot but not as hot as phoenix and i do like to play golf how is beth castillo asked politely as he put out his hand to richardson well thank you richardson said without emotion what do i call him randolph randy good to see you randy likewise your grandmother general wilson went on told us your promotion finally came through congratulations they were scraping the bottom of the barrel castillo said this is jamie neidermeyer my communicator jamie general wilson flew with my father in vietnam and this is colonel richardson we were classmates at west point they shook hands it was fairly obvious from neidermeyers how do you do sirs as well as his general appearance that he was military but richardson either didnt pick up the significance of his not being identified by rank or didnt want to youre in the service neidermeyer neidermeyer looked at castillo for guidance he works for general mcnab randy general crenshaw said at the moment hes not wearing his uniform when castillo was here the last time neither was he he told me he was in the secret service mysterious indeed are the ways of the special operations command and those in it well now that thats out in the open general wilson said am i sticking my nose in where its not particularly welcome no sir not at all castillo said im scrounging things for general mcnab but if youre free id love to buy you and your bride dinner tonight beth and her mother are at this moment preparing dinner richardson said she said she couldnt remember the last time she saw you odd i remember it with great clarity the invitation of course includes you and mrs crenshaw general richardson went on and you mr neidermeyer i dont want to intrude richardson general crenshaw said it wouldnt be an intrusion at all sir and it would give you and the general more time together crenshaw looked at castillo to see what he should do and you and i could talk about the terrible things we had to do as aidesdecamp to difficult generals general castillo said then smiled who was yours crenshaw said bruce j mcnab i didnt know that crenshaw said id love to hear what that was like yes colonel richardson mrs crenshaw and i gratefully accept your kind invitation to dinner general crenshaw could i have a moment of your and randys time castillo asked certainly crenshaw led them to the pilots lounge politely asked the two pilots there if they would mind giving them a few minutes alone and then looked at castillo this operation is highly classified sir castillo said the fewer people who know im here or have been here the better what i need is four hmodel hueys for an operation what kind of an operation richardson interrupted if you dont know that randy castillo said somewhat impatiently then you can truthfully swear that i didnt tell you what i wanted them for of all the light colonels at rucker i get righteous randolph richardson nodded his understanding they have to have gps castillo went on and they have to be in very good shape and i have to tell you you probably wont get them back righteouss jaw just now about bounced off the tiled floor we have been directed to give colonel castillo whatever he asks for and that he has the highest priority general crenshaw said how do we explain your presence if someone recognizes you richardson asked the cover story is that im an executive assistant to the secretary of homeland security and that im here because this was the most convenient place for me to come and rent a light aircraftill get to that in a minuteand fly to pass christian mississippi on a mission for the secretary two things castillo general crenshaw said that area was badly mauled by hurricane katrina i dont know if any fields down there are open have you considered a black hawk theres an airstrip where im going its open and a light airplane will attract less attention than an army helicopter neidermeyer went on the internet and found a cessna h available for charter at the airport in ozark the flying hearse crenshaw interrupted chuckling sir crenshaw smiled then explained actually its a thturbocharged the fellow who owns the funeral home is a flying enthusiast flying is expensivethat airplane cost more than a quarter million dollarsbut he thought he had the solution if he had an airplane he could fly cadavers to where they were going to be buried and charge the same thing airlines dotwice the price of the most expensive firstclass ticket that would be a substantial contribution to the cost of his hobby he was so enthusiastic that he didnt check to see if a coffin would fit in the airplane they dont so it is reliably reported he transportsin of course the dead of night so to speakthe cadavers in body bags strapped into a seat and has a casket waiting wherever hes going i know him i can call and set that up for you if youd like you can fly a i can fly a and a citation castillo said will that work i dont think that will be a problem crenshaw said but hell probably want to ride around the pattern with you anything else there will be pilots and crew chiefs coming here from the th at fort campbell general mcnab told me crenshaw said and looked at his aide find accommodations for them richardson they should start arriving tomorrow eight pilots and four crew chiefs yes sir richardson said and some supplies from fort bragg castillo added which will have to be stored somewhere secure until they can be loaded on the hueys what kind of supplies richardson asked the kind that need someplace secure to store them castillo said pointedly avoiding details general mcnab said theyre coming by truck tonight crenshaw said to richardson theyll probably be here by morning have the truck put in the mp impound lot until you can make better arrangements in the morning and make sure the mps are guarding the impound lot yes sir richardson said and as soon as possible neidermeyer has to get his radio up castillo said he saw the questioning look on crenshaws face its in the suitcase castillo said nodding at it it doesnt take long but id rather not do it here may i ask what kind of a radio richardson asked i am tempted to tell you none of your fucking business but resuming hostilities with you righteous would be counterproductive its a rather amazing system developed by afc castillo said bounces signalsvoice and data both really deeply encryptedoff satellites when we get to magnolia house ill show you how it works id like to see that crenshaw said i just thought of something how are you going to pay for the flying hearse american express castillo said reaching for his wallet never leave home without it he took his amex card from his wallet and handed it to crenshaw who examined it he then looked at castillo the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund the general said castillo nodded and grinned yes sir i wont ask what that is the general went on but will simply repeat what i said before that mysterious indeed are the ways of the special operations command and those in it he paused i can call from the car on the way to the post if youd like im driving my own car but richardsons got a van ill be damned if im stuck riding the bus with righteous if youve room in your car and im not an imposition thatd be great sir castillo said thank you two would you like a drink charley general wilson asked when they were inside the magnolia house under the circumstances im going to allow myself to have one and i might even allow my dear friend general crenshaw here a little taste indeed i would castillo said i have been a good boy all day and its been a very long day and i just drove past the daleville inn which triggered a flood of not at all unpleasantly lewd and lascivious memories neidermeyer came into the living room carrying a directv dish antenna you want a drink jamie castillo said wait til i get this thing up sir what i need now is a stepladder or a chair so i can stick this thing on the roof try the kitchen general wilson said and pointed then asked directv neidermeyer looked at castillo for guidance castillo nodded actually sir neidermeyer said seriously i have a much better one but it says super duper top secret delta force satellite antenna and the colonel wont let me use it he says it makes people curious the general chuckled it took only a couple of small modifications to this neidermeyer said mostly the installation of a repeater so we dont need the coaxial cable to connect to the box it ought to be up in a minute or so need any help jamie castillo said no sir thank you richardson came in as castillo crenshaw and wilson touched glasses your man is installing a cable tv dish on the roof richardson announced and any minute now we can get fox news general crenshaw said with a straight face castillo chuckled and richardson shot him a look wondering what that was about then richardson turned his attention back to the general sir the fieldgrade od has been advised of the truck coming from bragg theyll be expecting it at the gate and there will be an mp escort to guide it to the mp impound lot where it will be under guard until colonel castillo tells me what he wants to do with it first thing in the morning randy general crenshaw said go out to hanchey field and take over a hangar large enough for four hmodels arrange for the mps to guard it then move this equipment into it that sound about right castillo yes sir that sounds fine sir richardson said am i to sign a receipt for this equipment good question castillo said i didnt think about that well when the truck gets herehe stopped as neidermeyer came back in the house then went onneidermeyer here will happily get out of bed and sign for it right jamie the stuff from bragg castillo nodded tonight it goes into an mp lot in the morning colonel richardson will have it moved to a guarded hangar at hancheyone of the airfields yes sir am i going with you tomorrow sir you and the magic box sir it might be a good idea if we had our own wheels i didnt think of that crenshaw said what would you like sir vans are pretty inconspicuous and i dont think we need a driver randy the general said ill have one here in fifteen minutes sir this should take me about ninety seconds sir neidermeyer said to castillo and walked out of the room richardson walked to a telephone on a credenza took a small notebook from his pocket found what he was looking for and dialed a number colonel richardson sergeant general crenshaw desires that a van be sent immediately to the magnolia house a driver will not be required yes sergeant im aware that its unusual but that is the generals desire he listened a moment and said thank you and hung up for christs sake righteous youre a lieutenant colonel you can give orders for a lousy van all by yourself you didnt have to hide behind crenshaws stars castillo caught general wilsons watching eye and that wasnt lost on him either a van has been laid on sir richardson announced thank you neidermeyer walked back into the living room and handed a handset to castillo they say twentyfive feet max with no wire but give it a try castillo looked at the handset saw h r miller jr on its small screen pushed the loudspeaker button and said so i shamed you into not taking off early where are you charley in magnolia house at rucker and guess whos with me no thanks general wilson and randy richardson youre on loudspeaker yeah good evening sir dick miller sir hey righteous how they hanging hello dick general wilson said good to hear your voice restraining a smile wilson added softly to general crenshaw thats dick millers son hes also a classmate of randys hello miller richardson said without enthusiasm anything happen castillo asked i made the deposit to the bank where you were earlier miller said that airplanes back from you know where the pilot thereof is crashing in suburbia he says if you need to go anywhere in the next twentyfour hours take a bicycle the copilots on his way you know where and the plane that took him will bring j edgar hoover jr back here thats about it in the morning im going to mississippi to see the ambassador then back here how are you going to get to mississippi i rented a th youll be flying right over what used to be pascagoula and biloxi yeah i guess ive been watching that on the tube right now incredible the storm surge picked up a couple of those floating casinos and dumped them two three hundred yardsmaybe moreinland there are slot machines all over no damage at rucker i didnt see any nothing like that okay chief keep in touch castillo pushed the off button ill hang this up jamie make yourself a drink and while youre at it see what colonel richardson will have as he left the living room he heard richardson say somewhat piously nothing for me thank you three red cloud road fort rucker alabama september there it is jamie general wilson said one zero four zero he and castillo were in the secondrow bench seat of the army dodge caravan max having decided he would rather ride in the front passenger seat neidermeyer slowed the van almost to a stop as they approached the house it was a singlefamily frame onestory building identical to the ones on its left and right as far as castillo could see castillo vaguely remembered that lieutenant colonels and betteror was it majors and bettergot separate houses lower ranks had to share an interior wall hanging from two eighteeninchhigh posts next to the driveway was a sign ltc r w richardson av the carport was full with a pontiac sedan and a civilian dodge van behind them on the drive was a buick sedan with arizona license plates and a mercury sedan pulled up behind the dodge it looks like the crenshaws are here general wilson maybe id better park on the street neidermeyer said its against the law wilson said pull in behind the mercury why is it against the law castillo asked about the time of custers last stand a child darted out between two cars parked on the street and was run over you just cant have that sort of thing and so they passed a law i tried to change it when i was post commander and was dissuaded by a regiment of outraged mothers what do you do if you have more people coming to dinner than you have room in your driveway you politely ask your neighbors if the extras can park in their drive wilson said if your neighbor outranks you or your wives have been scrapping youre out of luck neidermeyer pulled the van in behind the mercury the house front door opened mrs harry f wilson looked out at the van what do you say i get out and stagger up to the door general wilson said general please dont do that to me castillo said with a grin general wilson slid the back door open got out and walked to the door holding up an index finger max you stay castillo said in hungarian and followed wilson whats this mean bethany wilson asked more than a little suspiciously holding up her own index finger its the answer to your question dear how many drinks did charley feed you very funny she said hello charley how are you castillo held up three fingers havent changed a bit have you handsome she asked and kissed his cheek neidermeyer was by then standing outside the van mrs w this is jamie neidermeyer castillo said hello jamie she said he and charley are tied together general wilson said hes got a radio in that suitcase hello charley mrs randolph richardson said from behind her mother how nice to see you again shes still a looker still looks like a younger version of her mother and why do i suspect shes less thrilled than her father and mother that good ole charleys coming to dinner its nice to see you too beth castillo said beth this is my communicatorand friendjamie neidermeyer hello jamie beth said offering her hand jamies going to need a place to put a small dish antenna general wilson said a what a directv antenna wilson said except its not its the satellite antenna for the radio in his suitcase what about the patio beth smiled uneasily a small dressedforcompany girl about six years old pushed past beth and called out grandpa another girl about eleven or twelve and who looked like her mother and grandmother came through the door followed finally by a boy castillo guessed to be about twelve or thirteen charley beth said this is randy the fourth and bethany the third castillo asked girls dont usually do that beth said and marjorie this is colonel castillo you know who he is none of the three had a clue this is dona alicias grandson beth explained the boy showed a very faint glimmer of interest the girls none at all grandpa wilson flew with colonel castillos father in vietnam mrs bethany wilson said and daddy and colonel castillo were friends classmates at west point beth richardson said this produced the same level of fascination and excitement as had the previous footnotes to history theyre not being rude castillo thought they just dont give a damn and why should they something did excite marjorie the smallest theres a dog in grandpas car she ran toward it oblivious to her mothers ordermarjorie come back here this instantshe pulled open the front passenger door oh shit castillo thought the evenings festivities will begin with beths fortypound daughter being mauled by my onehundredfortypound dog he ran to the van by the time he got there max had leapt out of the van licked marjories face to the point of saturation and was sitting down offering her his paw she put her arms around his neck marjorie it would appear has found a new friend general wilson observed he had been on castillos heels and now was catching his breath is that yours beth accused from behind her father she didnt seem surprised when castillo nodded she really loves dogs beth said so did you honey general wilson said all your life weve never had one beth said and when she saw the look on castillos face added you know how it is moving around all the time in the army bad answer beth your father always was able to keep one truth is that righteous probably doesnt like dogs theyre always a nuisance and a potential source of trouble and might interfere with the furtherance of ones career beth averted her eyes as general crenshaw and lieutenant colonel richardson came out of the house look at that will you love at first sight general crenshaw called hey max oblivious to the weight of marjorie clinging to his neck max walked to general crenshaw and offered him his paw now what righteous your general thinks max and your kid make a great pair think fast beautiful animal richardson said youve got a nice one there yeah i guess i might as well face it that you are now mine max well what the hell i told abuela when she said i didnt even have a dog that id get one well richardson went on why dont we put the dog back in the car and then see about having a drink and something to eat i want to play with him marjorie announced firmly randy general wilson said what about putting him on the patio and letting the kids play with him good idea richardson said with forced enthusiasm dinnerthe whole eveningwent better than castillo thought it would beth was a good hostess why am i surprised she learned the profession of officers lady from her mother who may as well have written the book and more than that beth was gracious she seated jamie neidermeyer next to her and across from general crenshaw and went out of her way to make him comfortable and the kids were remarkably well behaved even the little one castillo was seated between mrs wilson and mrs crenshaw who struck him as another firstclass officers lady even max behaved he lay outside the sliding glass door to the patio his head between his front paws just watching and neither whining nor suggesting that he would really like something to eat general wilson a little happy but not drunk after two glasses of wine regaled everybody with stories of warrant officer junior grade jorge castillo who colonel castillo decided must have driven his commanding officer nuts one of the stories which castillo had not heard was of a middleofthenight moonlight requisitioning flight in which a messhallsized refrigerator and a generator to power it were as general wilson gaily related liberated from a qm dump and put to work for the th helicopter company he sipped his wine then with a huge grin said for the better part of the next day the old man was torn between socking it to jorge and me for misappropriation of government propertyor enjoying the cold beer cold beer won in the end castillo glanced at richardson who clearly was not as amused with the story as was his son whose face showed he thought the idea of stealing things with a helicopter sounded great then castillos eyes met beths and he wondered if she was thinking of what had happened in the daleville inn hell yes she is that would be natural but that was a very long time ago the last thing id do is try to resurrect anything a little after eightthirty just after castillo had turned down a glass of brandyi have to fly in the morningthere was a familiar faint beep and a moment later neidermeyer reached into his lap and came up with the radio handset he looked at it then stood up said excuse me its for you sir and leaned across the table to hand it to castillo the legend read gen mcnab yes sir castillo said into the handset ive got the truck driver on a landline hes fueling at benning who do i tell him to see when he gets to rucker general crenshaw has named colonel richardson as his action officer sir but neidermeyerand maybe mewill meet the truck at the gate driver and two shooters mcnab said make sure theyre taken care of yes sir of course castillo was aware that everyone was looking at him crenshaw taking good care of you mcnab went on couldnt ask for anything more sir as a matter of fact im sitting across colonel richardsons dinner table from him and general wilson i dont have the time to wander down memory lane give them my compliments mcnab said and a faint change in the background noise told castillo that mcnab had broken the connection castillo pushed the off button and handed the handset back to neidermeyer that was general mcnab castillo said his compliments to you gentlemen and his apologies for having to take another call right now the truck has just refueled at fort benning what is that an hour hour and a half from here both wilson and crenshaw nodded he was checking to make sure the truck driver and his crewtotal of threeare taken care of ill take care of that general richardson said before crenshaw could give the order and now castillo thought i can get out of here beth thank you for a delightful meal he said but im afraid that jamie and i are going to have to be the infamous guests who eat and run weve got a lot on our plate tonight and a firstlight flight tomorrow i understand she said well have to do it another time id like that i accept and with that exchange of polite lies i really can get out of here charley do you know how to find the airport in ozark general wilson asked im sure i can find it sir ill take you wilson offered thats unnecessary sir ill take you wilson insisted hes trying to be nice sure but theres more to it than that hell he wants to go why didnt i think of that sir would you like to go along what i have to do there wont take longit just has to be done in person we should be back here at say four or five i dont want to intrude charley but i really would like to see the damage along the gulf coast then youll go and theres room for one more in the airplane any takers it would be something to see can i go randolph richardson iv asked of course not son randolph richardson iii said quickly the look on beths face showed that she firmly supported that parental decision why not general wilson said this is none of my business of course general crenshaw said but think it over richardson its one hell of an opportunity for the boy for the rest of his life hed remember that right after the hurricane he flew over the area with his grandfather and saw everything well viewed in that light randolph iii said i dont think so beth announced it would be dangerous but general crenshaw is right honey randolph iii said it would be something he would remember all his life are you sure of your landing field castillo its safe to use castillo nodded i dont want to take the kid i dont even want to take general wilson i was just being a good guy no good deed ever goes unpunished okay then its settled general wilson said randy and i will pick you up at oh dark hundred at the magnolia house that way you wont have to leave the army van at the airport four ozark municipal airport ozark alabama september j g jenkins the somewhat plump proprietor of the greater dale county funeral home and crematorium inc incongruously attired in a loud flowered hawaiian shirt and powder blue shorts did insist on taking a ride around the pattern with castillo before turning over his flying hearse to him in the end castillo was glad he did as castillo turned on final jenkins idly mentioned that he was sure castillo was aware that the rucker reservationand cairns fieldwas restricted airspace youre going to have to go to either dothan or troy before heading for the beach yes i know thank you and another lie leaps quickly from my lips id forgotten that and if you hadnt reminded me i wouldve taken off and flown the most direct route to the gulfright over both the base and the airfield i doubt they wouldve scrambled jets to shoot me down but there damned sure would have been a lot of faa forms to fill out explain in two hundred words or less why you have done something really stupid like this he set the singleengine highwing th down smoothly on its tricycle gear then taxied to the hangar where general wilson randy the fourth neidermeyer and max were waiting castillo was a little surprised that jenkins hadnt at least asked questions about max getting into his pristine airplaneit was painted a glossy black like a hearse and the tan leather interior spotless he concluded in the end that jenkins had decided in view of the three hundred fifty dollars an hour that he was charging for the use of his hearsedry as castillo had to fuel it himselfit was necessary to accommodate the customer well i guess youre my copilot general castillo said after hed shut down the engine and his passengers approached the aircraft charley id be useless in the right seat i havent flown in years and general wilson held up a sony digital motion picture camera neidermeyer had an almost identical one hanging from the lanyard around his neck when castillo looked at him wilson said id really like to get pictures of the damage colonel castillo looked at the boy well i guess youre my copilot randy yes sir castillo motioned to the double doors on the starboard side of the fuselage and said then hop in and make your way forward to the right seat wilson and neidermeyer would take the middlerow bucket seats the bench seat in the rear was just wide enough for max to lie down if he wanted what do i do about a seat belt for him castillo wondered aloud try to fly smooth and not come to a sudden stop general wilson said castillo sensed the boys eyes on him as he trimmed out the airplane and set the autopilot on a more or less southwesterly course for pensacola florida back in the dark ages when your grandfather and my father were flying they had to do this just about by themselves castillo explained to randy over the intercom his voice coming through the david clark headsets that everyone wore now we just push buttons and computers do all the work he showed him the global positioning system then pointed to the screen with its map in motion here we are south of fort rucker theres where were going pass christian mississippi the computer tells me we have one hundred eightyfour miles to go that were at five thousand feet and making about one hundred fifty miles an hour over the ground the boy soaked that all in then asked wasnt it more fun when you did it yourself without really thinking about it castillo disengaged the autopilot said find out for yourself then imitating the tone of a commercial airliner pilot raised his voice attention in the passenger compartment the copilot is now flying the boy looked at him in disbelief if youre going to drive it might be a good idea to put your hands on the yoke castillo said he pointed thats the yoke the thing to remember randy is to be smooth general wilson said leaning over his grandsons shoulder dont jerk the wheel a very little goes a long way the boy put his hands on the yoke can you reach the pedals castillo asked the boy tried then nodded this probably isnt the smartest thing ive ever done but what the hell general crenshaw was right last night the kid will never forget that he went flying with his grandfather to see what hurricane katrina did to the gulf coast and we have plenty of fuel keep your feet on the pedals castillo ordered but dont move them till i say what youre going to do now is make it go up and down when youve got that down pat youre going to turn us dead south yes sir the boy said just ease the yoke forward randy his grandfather said and try to keep the wings level the hurricane damagea lot of itbecame worse as they came closer to the coast when they were over pensacola beach florida the damage was so bad that castillo decided they needed a closer look ill take it now randy i want to get down for a better look and i dont think youre quite ready to make lowlevel passes yes sir the boy said reluctantly taking his hands off the yoke the damage to pensacola beach was worse than anyone expected general wilson and jamie neidermeyer got their video then castillo adjusted the flaps and throttle in preparation for the aircraft to climb im going to give it back to you randy castillo said what youre going to do now is climb slowly to five thousand feet and steer two seven zero just ease back on the yoke grandpa wilson said youre doing fine he is what the hell his father and grandfather are pilots what was it don fernando used to say genes dont teach you how to do anything but they damn sure determine whether or not you can learn how big were we when he taught fernando and me to fly about as big as this kid i guess god fernando and i had flown all over texas and mexico by the time we were old enough to get a students license over mobile alabama castillo ordered the boy to turn south and fly to the gulf and when they were over it to turn right and start a gentle descent to fifteen hundred feet by the time they reached that altitude they were over pascagoula mississippi where the damage was literally incredible along the beach the storm had either destroyed or floated away everything within a quarteror halfmile of the normal waterline take it down another five hundred feet copilot and then ill take it yes sir the damage got worse as they flew along the beach they saw where two floating casinos had been moved five hundred yards from where they had been moored on the beach now randy since i dont know where i am or exactly where it is that i want to go we will now let the computer take over yes sir ten minutes later they were over the landing strip of the masterson plantation there was clear evidence of hurricane damagetall pines snapped and huge oaks some of them obviously hundreds of years old uprootedbut the airstrip and the house and its outbuildings seemed intact there were a number of cars and trucks parked around the house castillo made two low passes over the runway to make sure it was clear as he pulled out of the second pass to gain altitude to make his approach he happened to glance at the boys face randy clearly was excited grinning from ear to ear damned shame the general stopped flying he could have done this and the kid could remember that oh for christs sake stop it youre here on business not to pretend youre the kids loving uncle as castillo completed the landing roll he saw three suvs quickly approaching the field then as he taxied back to the single hangar where a sparkling vtail beechcraft bonanza was tied down he saw people he recognized winslow masterson and his wife and their daughter and her three children there was an older couple standing with them logic told him they were the other grandparents ambassador lorimerthe man he had come to seeand his wife and logic told him too that the two approachingmiddleaged men in business suits were members of china post no in exile the retired special operators whom castillo had arranged for masterson to hire to protect his daughterinlaw and grandchildren winslow masterson was a tall slim elegant sharpfeatured man he had told castillo that he suspected his ancestors had been tutsi the men in business suits watched carefully as castillo parked the airplane and then one of them noddedbut didnt smileat castillo when he apparently recognized him both men then leaned against the fender of their suv as everybody else walked up to the airplane welcome back to the recently renamed overturned oaks plantation major castillo masterson said when castillo climbed out of the airplane this is a pleasant surprise good to see you sir castillo said anybody afraid of dogs the question seemed to surprise everybody but no one expressed any concern neidermeyer opened the aircrafts rear double door stepped out commanded okay max and let loose of his collar at the command max jumped out of the plane headed for the nose gear and relieved himself the older masterson boy laughed it took months to train him how to do that castillo said after everyone else had crawled out of the airplane through the same double door jesus christ its hot castillo thought and the humidity is damn near unbearable worse than at rucker im not going to call you major elizabeth masterson a tall slim thirtysevenyearold said youre a friend charley she advanced on him and kissed his cheek actually im a lieutenant colonel he announced with overwhelming immodesty good for you she said and is this your son charley no randy is general wilsons grandson castillo made the introductions general wilson castillo then went on flew with my father in vietnam i bumped into him at fort rucker and since we were going to fly over what used to be the beautiful gulf coast and there was room in the plane welcome to overturned oaks formerly great oaks general masterson said any friend of colonel castillo is welcome here were all indebted to the colonel and in that connection colonel let me say that whenever your promotion came through it was long overdue i am ready and willing to sign autographs castillo said max had already discovered the masterson children and they him whered you get the dog colonel j winslow masterson iii asked as he shook maxs paw hes awesome my grandmother told me that since i didnt have a family i should get a dog and i always do what my grandmother says pay attention mrs winslow masterson said and speaking of grandparents betsy masterson said dad mother this is charley castillo who took such great care of us in argentina and brought us home my wife and i are very grateful to you colonel philippe lorimer said he was a very small very black man with closely cropped white hair and large intelligent eyes if there was visible evidence of his heart condition castillo couldnt see it how do you do sir maam mr ambassador the secretary of state sends her best regards to you and mrs lorimer thats very kind of her lorimer said but why do i suspect thats not all she sent sir in fact the secretary hopes that youll be willing to have a private minute or two with me perhaps out of this heat of course but why do i suspect thats going to take a lot longer than a minute or two castillo was aware that general wilson was taking all this in but had absolutely no idea what anyone was talking about ambassador lorimer looked at jamie neidermeyer then at castillo im surprised that someone like you colonel needs a bodyguard lorimer said dad betsy masterson protested the one advantage to being an old and retired ambassador sweetie he said is that after a lifetime of subtlety evasion and innuendo you can just say whatever pops into your mind the same thing is true of being a retired general mr ambassador general wilson said actually sir jamie is my communicator castillo said they keep me on a short leash to make sure i dont say whatever pops into my mind lorimer laughed hes got one of those satellite telephones in that suitcase yes sir with which you have direct contact with the secretary of state yes sir if youd like to dont plug it in yet young man lorimer ordered i dont wish to speak to secretary cohen until after the colonel and i have had our twominute chat you have a beautiful home general wilson said when they were in the foyer of the house castillo thought the house made tara of gone with the wind look like a holiday inn off of the foyer a curved double stairway rose to the second floor it was not hard to picture clark gable carrying whatshername the english actress up the steps to work his wicked way on her thank you mrs masterson said its been here a very long time and god spared it i told her that was gods reward for her unrelenting battle against the gambling hells of the mississippi gulf coast masterson said dont mock me winslow she said but youll notice what did happen to the casinos faulty argument darling katrina also wiped out jefferson daviss home and you know that he was a godfearing gentleman always battling the devil and all his wicked works thats right general wilson said id forgotten that my wife and i went to his home twice when i was at fort rucker that was damaged wiped out masterson said utterly destroyed then you were very lucky here wilson said yes we were masterson said and thanks more to the charm of the salesman than any wise planning on my part there were diesel emergency generators in place to kick in as they were supposed to when the electricity went off when my cousin philip flew in with emergency rationsthats his bonanza in the hangarhe found us with betsy and the lorimers watching the aftermath of the disaster on television wilson shook his head you were very lucky he said youre an admirer of jefferson davis general masterson asked changing the subject we went to the same school wilson said at different times of course then he added very seriously yes i am thats the right thing to say in this house masterson said from which my ancestors marched forth to do battle for southern rights and just as soon as the history lesson is over ambassador lorimer said im sure colonel castillo would like to have our little chat why dont you take the colonel into the library philippe masterson said smiling tolerantly ill send sophie in with coffee and croissants this way colonel if you please lorimer said the library too would have been at home in tara except that an enormous flatscreen television had been mounted against one of the booklined walls and half a dozen red leather armchairs had been arranged to face it and there was an array of bottles and glasses above a wet bar set in another wall of books ambassador lorimer headed right for it may i offer you a little morning pickmeup from winslows ample stock he asked no thank you sir im flying one of the few advantages of having a heart condition like mine is that spirits in moderation of course are medically indicated lorimer said as he poured cognac into a snifter churchill did that castillo said he began the day with a little cognac from what i hear it was a healthy belt and he was a great man wasnt he who saved england from the boche yes sir he was in large part in my judgment because he put franklin roosevelt in his pocket yes sir i suppose thats true lorimer waved castillo into one of the armchairs and sat in the adjacent one a middleaged maid wearing a crisp white apron and cap came in a moment later with a coffee service and a plate of croissants lorimer waited for her to leave before speaking i was trained to be a soldier colonel he said are you familiar with norwich university yes sir i am it was one of the few places in the old days where a black man had a reasonable chance to get a regular army commission so i went there with that intention just before graduation however i was offered a chance to join the foreign service and took it primarily i think because i thought someone of my stature looked absurd in a uniform i have a number of friends who are norwich sir i remember a pithy saying i learned as a rook at norwich never try to bullshit a bullshitter keeping that and the fact that i spent thirtysix years as a diplomat in mind why dont you tell me why secretary cohen is trying to put me in her pocket im not sure i know what you mean mr ambassador i think you do colonel lets start with why she doesnt want me to go to my late sons estancia in uruguay the secretary believes that would be illadvised sir castillo said she asked me to tell you that he nodded she sent the same message to me through others what i want to know is why im old but not braindead i dont think it has a thing to do with my physical condition or for that matter do i swallow whole the idea that the secretary as gracious a lady as i know she is is deeply concerned for poor old lorimer why doesnt she want me to go down there castillo didnt reply immediately as he tried to gather his thoughts lorimer went on i have my own sources of information colonel let me tell you what ive learned it is the belief of our ambassador there a man named mcgrory who is not known for his dazzling ambassadorial ability and that of the uruguayan government that my son died as the result of a drug deal gone wrong im having trouble accepting that i dont know what to say mr ambassador castillo said let me clarify that somewhat lorimer said sadly i did not have the same relationship with my son that winslow masterson enjoyed with his son jack i didnt particularly like jeanpaul and he didnt like me i doubt that jeanpaul was involved in the illicit drug trade not because he was my son and thus incapable of something like that but because its out of character for him he paused then finished so if he wasnt in the drug trade colonel what was he doing that caused his murder castillo didnt reply please do me the courtesy colonel of telling me i cant tell you rather than i dont have any idea what youre talking about i cant tell you mr ambassador we are now at what is colloquially known as the deal breaker lorimer said you have your choice of telling me which means i will listen to whatever else you have to say or not telling me which means our little chat is over and mrs lorimer and i will be on the first airplane we can catch to uruguay weve been imposing on the mastersons hospitality too long as it is mr ambassador this information is classified top secret presidential lorimer didnt seem surprised to me lorimer said simply that strongly suggests there has been a presidential finding castillo didnt reply i will take your silence to mean that there is a presidential finding and you dont have the authority to confirm that your choice colonel get on that satellite telephone and tell the secretaryor whoever has put you in your present predicamentthat unless you are authorized to tell me about the finding the lorimers are off to estancia shangrila well what the hell if he goes down thereand theres no way i can stop himthe chances are that hell do somethingnot on purposeto compromise that operation and thus the presidential finding and for some reasonwhich is probably foolishi trust him hes a tough old bastard i have that authority mr ambassador and youre not going to tell me the president was at the air base in biloxi when we returned from argentina with mr mastersons remains and his family he informed me there that he had made a finding a covert and clandestine organization had been formed and charged with finding and rendering harmless those responsible for tapping the balls of his fingers together ambassador lorimer considered for a good sixty seconds what castillo had told him before raising his eyes to castillo so the everpresent silver lining is that jeanpaul was not a drug dealer he said hell of a note when youre happy to hear your only son was just a thief from other thieves not a drug dealer im sorry mr ambassador why should you be sorry from what i hear youve been the knight in shining armor on a white horse in the whole sordid affair thats not an accurate description mr ambassador its my judgment to make colonel lorimer said how much of what you have just told me does my daughter know very little of it sir she doesnt have the need to know i did tell herand mr mastersonthat i was almost certain that the people who had murdered mr masterson were rendered harmless yes sir how can you be almost certain of that you dont have the need to know that sir you wouldnt have told them that unless you were almost certain which means you werent repeating what someone else had told you but rather that you were personally involved castillo didnt reply all of this except for your possible concern that i would go down and somehow compromise the presidential findingwhich is absurddoesnt explain why youand i mean you not the secretarydont want me to go to uruguay may i go off at a tangent for a moment mr ambassador lorimer nodded i understand sir why youre anxious toget out from under mr mastersons hospitality guests as with fish you know begin to smell after three days my grandfather was known to say that often in more colorful terms castillo said mr ambassador what would it take to get you to go someplaceparis for example mr lorimers apartment is there and available to youfor sixty days before you go to uruguay the apartment is no longer available colonel the man from the un who brought me the check for jeanpauls death benefitone hundred thousand eurosalso brought with him an offer for jeanpauls apartment time and half what it was worth they obviously wanted to make sure jeanpaul was forgotten as soon as possible now i know why mr ambassador i am prepared to offer you fifty thousand dollars a month for two months to lease estancia shangrila either thats your remarkably clumsy way of offering me a bribe to keep me away from the estanciawhich raises again the unanswered question of why you dont want me down thereor you really want to lease the ranch and that raises the really interesting question of why what would you do with it i understand phoenix arizona is very nice this time of year mr ambassador so is bali but im getting a little old for barebreasted maidens in grass skirts what do you want with the estancia colonel im running another operation down there sir you going to do it under the nose of this fellow mcgrory again castillo nodded i want to use it as a refueling point for several helicopters i want to get into argentina you mean get into argentina black lorimer replied he considered that a moment okay youre going to fly them off some ship in the middle of the night and under the radar right refuel them in the middle of nowhere in uruguay and then on to argentina castillo nodded whats the operation were going to try to get a dea agent back from the drug dealers who kidnapped him that sounds like a splendid idea lorimer said it also sounds like the dea agent is not an ordinary dea agent we lose a lot of dea agents in mexico and all we do is wring our hands we certainly dont send special forces teams in unmarked helicopters to get them back this ones grandfather is a friend of the mayor of chicago that would make him special wouldnt it okay you can use the estancia and i will forget that money you offered if i remembered it it would make me angry castillo looked him in the eyes a long moment and said thank you sir youre welcome and now you can tell me the best way to get from the airport in montevideo to shangrila rent a car buy one hows the roads oh shit i totally misread himhes still determined to go i cant talk you out of going down there sir you didnt really expect that you could did you i really hoped that i could lorimer held up his hands in a gesture of mock sympathy look at it this way colonel he said if im therejeanpauls father come to look after his inheritancefar fewer questions will be asked than if two or three men of military age showed up there by themselves and started hauling barrels of helicopter fuel onto the place castillo didnt say anything dont look so worried i didnt spend all my diplomatic career on the cocktailparty circuit im sure you didnt mr ambassador you ever hear of stanleyville in the exbelgian congo yes sir when the belgians finally jumped their paratroops on itout of usaf airplanesto stop the cannibalism on the town square we did things differently back then we paid less attention to the sensitive nationalist feelings of the natives than to americans in trouble there i was on the airfield with two sergeants from the army security agency whod been running a radio station for me in the bush we were waving american flags with one hand ands in the other castillo shook his head in disbelief i dont lie colonel lorimer said at my age i dont have to i wasnt doubting your word mr ambassador i hope not until just now i was starting to like you it was not sir what i expected to hear from an ambassador there are ambassadors and ambassadors colonel for example my daughter tells me we have a very good one in buenos aires yes sir we do are we through here can we go deal with her now shes going to have a fit when she hears you have failed in your noble mission to save the old man from himself sir about getting to shangrila from the airport i think i can arrange for several spanishspeaking americans to meet you and take you there maybe they could stay around and help you get organized these good samaritans just happen to be in montevideo right castillo laughed no sir theyd actually be shooters from fort bragg thats a very politically incorrect term shooters the ambassador said i like it they would have a satellite radio with them that would be useful and they would provide you and mrs lorimer with a little security i would be delighted to have your friends stay with us as long as necessary and be very grateful for their assistance thank you sir ambassador lorimer stood up picked up his now empty cognac snifter returned to the bottles on the credenza and poured a half inch of remy martin into it he raised the glass to castillo since youre on the wagon colonel mud in your eye i suspect there will be another time sir i hope so lorimer looked at him intently for a moment so intently that castillo asked sir is there something else i always look into a mans eyes when im negotiating with him lorimer said i did so just now and while i was doing that i had the odd feeling id recently seen eyes very much like yours before had you sir yes i just remembered where on that nice boy you brought with you the generals grandson he has eyes just like yours ive seen eyes very much like yours too on aleksandr pevsner i didnt notice castillo said the ambassador drained the snifter then waved castillo ahead of him out of the library j winslow masterson iii and randolph richardson iv were kicking a soccer ball on the lawn for max the adults and the younger masterson children were sitting in white wicker rockers on the porch just as castillo was about to warn them that max was likely to take a bite from the ball max did there was a whistling hiss which caused max to drop the ball push it tentatively with his paw and then take it into his mouth and give it a good bite awesome masterson iii cried did you see that i owe you a soccer ball castillo said dont be silly charley betsy masterson said then turned to her father howd your little chat go splendidly the ambassador said colonel castillo and i are agreed theres absolutely no reason your mother and i cant go to uruguay dad thats absurd betsy masterson said worse than absurd insane thats not exactly what i said mr ambassador charley protested be that as it may ambassador lorimer said for the next several months betsy your mother and i will be using jeanpauls home in uruguay in lieu of our own which is now as you may have heard the dikes having been overwhelmed under twenty feet of water and mississippi river mud betsy masterson looked at him in exasperation as if gathering her thoughts i am reliably informed lorimer went on reasonably that the house is quite comfortable that there is a staff to take care of your mother and myself more than adequatelyif not quite at the level of winslow and diannes hospitality for which we will be forever grateful you know what happened there dad she interrupted and your mother and i both speak as a result of our service in madrid quite passable spanish betsy masterson looked at castillo charley you didnt encourage him to go down there did you no maam more the opposite cant you stop him i dont see how castillo said ill call the secretary of state myself secretary cohen has already taken her best shot sweetheart she sent colonel castillo to dissuade me he failed youre in no condition to fly all the way down there dad betsy argued youre in no condition to go through the security hassle at an airport much less get on an airplane and fly that far i have survived going through the security hassles at a number of third world airports he said the one in addis ababa comes to mind as the worst despite herself she smiled general wilson stood up i think ill take a little walk he said please keep your seat general winslow masterson said this is not a family argument philippe doesnt have family arguments he politely listens to whatever anyone wishes to say then does what he had planned to do in the first place my wife does much the same thing general wilson said thanks for the support father masterson betsy said then turned to her father im not talking about down there dad and you know it im talking about here new orleans is closed youd have to go to miami and how are you going to get to miami well manage may i suggest we change the subject mrs masterson castillo began ive asked you to call me betsy charley she snapped sorry betsy since the ambassador is determined to go down there what i can do is arrange to fly your parents down there in a gulfstream i could arrange to have them picked up in new orleans and if customs and immigrations not functioning there stop at tampa or miami on the way down i dont know whether to say that would be fine thank you very much or for gods sake dont enable him you could do that charley winslow masterson said castillo nodded and ill arrange to have some friends keep an eye on your parents the same kind of friends whove been keeping an eye on betsy and the kids here winslow masterson asked castillo nodded darling betsy masterson said i agree with you if i had my way philippe and your mother would stay here with us until they can have their house repaired winslow its under water lorimer said everything in it has been destroyed and you know what they say when someone goes to the hereafteri want to remember him as he was not lying in the coffin i want to remember the house as it was im not foolish enough to try to resurrect it as i was saying darling betsy until they can have their house repaired and a new one can be built for them here or in new orleans that would be the prudent thing to do betsy said the intelligent thing the only thing but hes determined to go to uruguay and nothing you or i or anyone else has to say will deter him just be grateful that charley can arrange to carry him there in comfort and that charleys friends will be available to provide security can i offer you a taste of winslows whiskey general the ambassador asked im not a drinking man myself but a little belt in the morning is medically indicated for someone my age our age ive heard that general wilson said he looked at castillo i think one would be in order mr ambassador thank you max trotted up on the porch with the now deflated soccer ball in his mouth and dropped it at castillos feet five ozark municipal airport ozark alabama september when they walked up to general wilsons buick they found an envelope jammed under the windshield wiper general wilson opened it from beth he said please call randy as soon as you land charleys friends from fort campbell are waiting for him at the magnolia house that was quick castillo said so knowing neither randys number nor that of the magnolia house what i think ill do is call beth ask her to call randy and tell her to tell him were back and that were going to be at the magnolia house just as soon as we can drop off our copilot at their quarters and get there thank you castillo said mrs randolph richardson iii came out of her kitchen door as the buick drove up the driveway how was the flight she asked colonel castillo let me fly most of the way over there randolph richardson iv announced and just about all the way back and max flattened a soccer ball in his mouth how nice of him she said with some effort and randy did very well general wilson said ill be back right after i drop charley and jamie off mrs richardson smiled take care randy castillo said and touched the boys shoulder maybe we can do it again sometime oh yeah thanks very very much colonel the look in her eyes makes it pretty clear she thinks thats about as likely to happen as is our being canonized for a lifetime of sexual fidelity my pleasure randy i wont go in charley general wilson said as they drove up to the magnolia house but lets try to get together again while youre here ill try sir and thank you for the ride randy will never forget it and neither will i im glad it worked out your dad would have been very proud of you charley wilson said as he offered his hand thank you castillo said i never thought of that before what would my father think of me if he were around to have a look there were nine men in flight suits sitting at the dining room table of the magnolia house with lieutenant colonel randolph richardson iii when castillo and neidermeyer walked in i would have called attention colonel a barrelchested nearly bald man greeted him but i knew you would really rather have me kiss your hudson high ring my god look what the cat drug in all the way from norwich castillo said happily he put his briefcase on the table went to him and wrapped him in a bear hug how the hell are you dave max sat down and looked up at them curiously where did you get the dog charley long story castillo said but he wont tear your leg off if youre polite dave squatted and accepted maxs paw castillo became aware that except for richardson the other men at the table had stood up and i know who these guys are castillo said the misfits scalawags and neerdowells the colonel decided he could get rid of when they laid the personnel requirement on him you got it charley a tall lanky man said laughing good to see you where we going charley another asked castillo didnt reply directly instead he said has colonel richardson gotten you all a place to stay chow theyve all been given transient quarters richardson said we were discussing somewhere to eat when you came in and there are two vans for their use while theyre here i cant stay charley the barrelchested bald man said he held up a can of up as proof suggesting that he was about to fly and had not been able to help himself to anything alcoholic the boss he went on is out of town and im minding the store and as the commanding officer when general mcnab said asap i made the command decision that the best way to do that was fire up a black hawk and fly these clowns down here and i knew of coursebeing an old buddy who is at least a year senior to youyou would be delighted to tell me what the hell this is all about nice try dave castillo said but if youre not staying i cant tell you nothing not one goddamn word colonel he just shifted into his official mode jerry dave said so therell be no arguing with him we might as well go home yes sir one of the pilots said you understand charley that its breaking my heart that you dont trust me dont let the doorknob hit you in the ass dave dave put out his hand great to see you charley he said warmly youve got four more pilots and two crew chiefs coming you want them flown down the sooner they can be here the better my master has spoken dave said not you mcnab theyll be here for lunch tomorrow how long are you going to need them you are tenacious arent you thats why i got promoted eighteen months before you did another of the pilots said i thought that had something to do with charley being out of uniform while flying a borrowed black hawk the others laughed come to think of it dave said which produced more laughter and then he went on and really coming to think about it he was really much betterlooking wearing a beard and afghan robes wasnt he in these civvies he looks like a usedcar salesman castillo gave him the finger richardson can we mooch a ride from you out to cairns dave asked of course richardson said castillo will i be needed here any more tonight castillo shook his head why dont you meet us at hanchey at say ill be there richardson said then looked at dave anytime youre ready colonel charley dave said you take care of my scalawags and neerdowells or ill have your ass castillo nodded as richardson opened the door to leave neidermeyer came through it hey jamie long time no see dave said offering his hand good to see you sir you going to be in on this no goddamn it im not mcnab said not only no but hell no remember to send the colonel a postcard neidermeyer castillo said yes sir ill do that he waited until the door was closed then went around shaking the hands of the people he knew and was introduced to the others presumably you have put the antenna back up on the roof castillo said yes sir we should be up get on it please jamie tell miller and general mcnab that were back and that we have four pilots and two crew chiefs here and are promised the others by noon tomorrow and check to see whats going on yes sir castillo went to the table took his laptop from his briefcase and booted it up as the computer hard drive made whirring sounds he looked up at the others you know the drill he said this is where i tell you the operation is top secret and anyone who lets anything out goes to leavenworth the only difference this time is that the security classification is top secret presidential anyone with a loose lip gets two years as a phase i instructor pilot and then goes to leavenworth a presidential finding charley one of them asked castillo nodded let me give a quick taste and then well go get something to eat from the laptop speakers came the familiar sound of a bugle sounding chargecastillo had replaced the annoying outofthebox microsoft tuneannouncing that the computer was booted up and ready castillo opened the google world program and shifted the image of the earth so that it showed the lower half of south america where in hell are we going one of them asked patience is a virtue mr reston castillo said finally he had what he wanted and pressed the keys to zoom in on the image thats an estancia a ranch called shangrila south latitude west longitude whats there colonel a field big enough to take four hueys at once and refuel them flying in from where the uss ronald reagan at sea jesus christ and where do we go from there sir im working on that viii one west boulevard drive alexandria virginia september castillo walked into the living room with max on his heels and following the dog an enormous very black man in a threebutton black suitall buttons buttoneda crisp white shirt and a black tie colonel jake torine was sitting with edgar delchamps at the battered coffee table they both had their feet up on it and delchamps was reaching into the box of krispy kreme doughnuts on the table between them special agent david w yung of the fbi and sergeant major john davidson were sprawled in the red leather armchairs with their own krispy kreme box between them on a footstool torine was wearing a blue polo shirt and khaki pants yung davidson and delchamps wore singlebreasted nearly black suits yungs and davidsons suits looked as if they were fresh from a brooks brothers box delchampss suit looked as if it had been at least six months since it had received any attention from a dry cleaning establishment welcome home torine said taking a bite of his doughnut they all looked curiously at the black man colin castillo said this is colonel torine mr yung mr delchamps and mr davidson gentlemen the black man said in a very deep very southern voice every nice house in suburbia needs a butler castillo said so i got us one say something in butler colin yah suh the black man said in an even thicker southern accent can i fix you gentlemen a small sazerac as a lil wakemeup delchampss eyebrows rose a smile crossed davidsons face yung looked baffled torine looked confused and then recognition came ill be damned he said getting to his feet and putting out his hand i didnt recognize you in that undertakers suit how the hell are you sergeant major you are speaking sir the black man said now sounding as if he was from chicago or somewhere else in the midwest to chief warrant officer five leverette when did that happen i took the warrant a couple of years ago when some moron decided they needed two officers on an ateam and they wanted to make an instructor out of me leverette said its good to see you too colonel charley said they gave you an eagle when did you get that about four years ago where did charley find you he found me castillo said i was having my breakfast yesterday at rucker when in he walked i thought he was a bible salesman until he demanded to know what i intended to do with his team youre in on this operation with us colin davidson asked leverette nodded somebodys going to have to keep charley out of trouble right oddly enough i was just talking to somebody else about that torine said he looked at castillo we need to talk about that charley i also need a few minutes of your valuable time ace delchamps said max walked to torine and put out his paw can he have a doughnut torine asked im not sure hes giving me his paw because he likes me as long as its not chocolate covered castillo said the offer of a sazerac is still on the table leverette said any takers i thought you couldnt get one outside new orleans delchamps said today you cant get one in new orleans its under water as you may have heard he reached into his jacket pocket and came out with a small paperwrapped bottle about the size of a tabasco bottle but here you can whats that yung asked whats this or whats a sazerac twogun has led a sheltered life colin delchamps said i accept your kind offer twogun leverette parroted and then said this twogun is peychauds bitters i never leave home without it it is the essential ingredient in a sazerac cocktail which i regard as new orleanss greatest contribution to the general allaround happiness of mankind theres the booze torine said pointing to an array of bottles i know theres rye bourbon and pernod but you need powdered sugar too right when leverette nodded he added i saw some in the kitchen thanks to the everefficient corporal bradley ill go get it torine started for the kitchen then stopped and turned and added about whom we also have to talk charley leverette carried bottles of spirits to the table then began to construct a cocktail shaker full of sazerac with all the care and precision of a chemist dealing with deadly substances torine returned from the kitchen with a box of confectioners sugar a lemon and a paring knife in one hand and five glasses in the other pay attention twogun davidson said you will see a master at work its not even lunchtime yung protested they dont drink in the morning in the fbi colin delchamps said how sad leverette said charley torine said wheres jamie and his suitcase i left him in rucker things went so smoothly down there that any second now the other shoe is sure to drop and i want to be the first to know whats going wrong im going to need another communicator right about now does it have to be a communicator torine asked he stopped looked down and saw that max was again offering his paw he reached into the krispy kreme box and handed max another doughnut then he saw the look of confusion on castillos face and added i mean a delta force guy where else would i get one lester torine said he already knows how to work the satellite radio he ask you castillo said no this is what i wanted to talk to you about what happened was he went to davidson and asked him how he thought you would feel about sending him back to the marine corps he gestured for davidson to pick up the story i finally pulled it out of him davidson said that one of the secret service drivers asked him one time too many to be a good kid and go get him a cup of coffee you mean one of the secret service guys asked him too many times or they all have been mistaking him for an errand boy many of them probably most have you cant blame them but lester is pissed he looked at leverette the colonel tell you about the pride of the marine corps leverette shook his head wait till you see him davidson said he makes rambo look like a pansy well sending him back to the marines is out of the question castillo said a touch of impatience in his voice we cant afford that he knows too much and a lot of jarheads would like to know where hes been and what hes been doing and then wish theyd gone and that would just make the goddamn story circulate wider thats just about what i told him davidson said i also had a quiet word with a couple of the secret service guys okay as soon as i have my sazerac and thus the strength to get off of this couch i will inform corporal bradley that he is now my official communicator gentlemen leverette said our libation is ready you may pick your glasses up slowly and reverently they did so absent companions leverette said and started to touch glasses yung looked as if he wasnt sure whether he was witnessing some kind of solemn special operators ritual or his leg was being pulled castillo saw on leverettes face that he had picked up on yungs uncertainty and was about to crack wise twoguns one of us colin castillo said simply he was on the operation where sy kranz bought the farm i could tell just by looking at him that he was a warrior leverette said hes bowlegged wears glasses and he talks funny i think i like this guy delchamps said sorry twogun leverette said i didnt know who the hell you were yung smiled and made a deprecating gesture so was corporal bradley torine said and he probably deserves a medalfor marksmanship if nothing elsefor taking out two of the bad guys with two head shots but i dont think we ought to call him in here and give him one of these god this looks good colin mud in your eye seymour castillo said and took a swallow the others followed suit castillo put his glass on the table and exhaled audibly you look beat charley torine said castillo nodded so beat he said that i forgot that i have to call the secretary of state and tell her i couldnt talk lorimerambassador lorimerout of riding out the aftermath of hurricane katrina in uruguay i should have done that before i had this he held up the sazerac glass torine shrugged well what the hell you tried miller told me you went to mississippi just to see him whats bad about it jake is that im going to have to lie to her or at least not tell her the truth the whole truth etcetera and i dont like lying to her lie to her about what delchamps asked did miller tell you i went to see general mcnab delchamps nodded but he didnt say why were going to send two ateamsone of them colinsto argentina a couple of shooters at a time then were going to put four hmodel hueys into argentina black can you guess where were going to refuel them after they fly off the uss ronald reagan a hundred miles off the uruguayan coast before they fly on to idontyetknowwhere argentina boy you have been the busy special operator havent you delchamps said does montvale know about this no not about the ronald reagan that idea came from a bird colonel who works for mcnabkingston delchamps shook his head torine and davidson nodded tom kingston torine said good guy edgar amen leverette said and mcnab said he would set that up if its possible its possible torine said after some admiral tells him not only no but hell no he will be told to ask the secretary of the navy who will tell him that hes been told by the secretary of defense that the president told him youre to have whatever you think you need they call that the chain of command castillo chuckled with that in mind castillo said and since i couldnt talk him out of going down there i confided in the ambassador what we want to do with his estancia hes on board good guy that raised the question of an advance party at shangrila which we damn sure need one that might have a chance of escaping the attention of chief inspector ordonez how are you going to handle that with twogun delchamps asked what twogun is going to do is show up at the embassy in montevideo and introduce ambassador lorimers butler i wondered what that colinthebutler business was all about torine said smiling and shaking his head to ambassador mcgrory castillo went on explaining that colin came down to see what has to be done to shangrila before ambassador and mrs lorimer can use itwhich he has decided against advice to dobecause his home in new orleans was destroyed by hurricane katrina that just might work charley torine said edgar why not delchamps said david castillo asked mcgrory like most stupid men in positions of power is dangerous yung said i agree with that too delchamps interjected i presume hes to be kept in the dark castillo nodded as is secretary cohen who certainly is not stupid but there are people around her who might find out and might tip off mcgrory thats what i meant about having to lie to her im going to tell her lorimers going period shes liable to cable or telephone mcgrory and tell him to take care of lorimer yung said i thought about asking her to do just that castillo said but since im not going to tell her about colin that would really be lying to her deceiving her and i dont want to do that and youre not going to tell montvale either yung asked more smoke and mirrors david castillo said im going to tell him that two ateams and the hueys are being sentbut no other detailsand that as soon as i firm up the operation ill tell him all about it the reaction of just about everybody to that was almost identical their faces wrinkled in thought and then there were shrugs speaking of the director of national intelligence torine said or at least his number two i had an interesting chat yesterday with truman ellsworth he even bought me a drink delchamps raised an eyebrow and offered and i had one with the dci who didnt buy me a drink but about which we have to talk ellsworth called you jake castillo said i called him why what did you think of the crew on montvales gulfstream he asked going off at a tangent castillo said torine said reasonably id really like you to answer the question charley castillo grinned well they were air force so i was pleasantly surprised when they got it up and down three times in a row without bending it delchamps chuckled screw you colonel torine said what about the copilot nice young man academy type i had the feeling hed rather be flying a fighter cutting to the chase that nice young man was naturally curious what a doggie light bird was doing running around in montvales personal gulfstream v diligent snooping around revealed that the doggie light bird was doing something clandestine for that air force legend in his own time colonel jacob torine he found that interesting because said colonel torine was the ring knocker who talked him out of turning in his suit and going to fly airliners so he called ooa at the nebraska complex finally got miller on the horn and miller transferred the call here what did he want castillo said a transfer to do anything at all for his mentor torine said so long as it gets him out of flying the right seat in montvales gulfstream what did you tell him that id get back to him thats when i called ellsworth to ask him how the ambassador would feel about letting us have him jesus jake we could really usewe really needanother gulfstream pilot castillo said especially since one of three we have has gone home to wife and kiddies and the second can count his gulfstream landings on his fingers really i thought you had more landings than that castillo said as if genuinely surprised leverette smiled and shook his head torine gave castillo the finger so what did ellsworth say castillo asked he was charm personified he said he really couldnt talk to me then because he had to meet someone at the willard that that would take about an hour and would i be free to meet him in the round robin after his meeting as he would really like to buy me a drink the round robin is the groundfloor bar of the willard intercontinental hotel it usually has two or more lobbyists in it feeding expensive intoxicants to members of congress as an expression of their admiration and you went castillo asked i even put on a clean shirt and tie i was prepared to make any sacrifice for the ooa in the end i was glad i went mr ellsworth said all kinds of nice things to me such as he told mein confidence of coursehow happy ambassador montvale and he are that im in ooa where i can serve as a wise and calming influence on the brilliant but somewhat impetuous c castillo after all he said we all have the same responsibility to make sure the president is never embarrassed that sonofabitch castillo grunted but there was more admiration in his voice than anger i did admit to having concerns about your impetuousness torine said and then he told meas if the thought had just come to himthat if something like that came up perhaps if he and the ambassador knew about it and you of course agreed to call him i was reluctant at first he didnt push what he did say was that he thought ooa was going to not only be around for a while but grow in size and importance and that being true it would need someone more senior than a junior lieutenant colonel an impetuous junior lieutenant colonel torine nodded to run it a brigadier general for example and wasnt i eligible for promotion and then you blushed modestly uhhuh and i think we parted with him thinking i thought he and i had an understanding i dont know if im amused or disgusted castillo said but his job is to protect his boss who like us has an obligation to keep the president from being embarrassed and i am a junior lieutenant colonel an impetuous one he really would be happier if you had this job moot point charley you were there when the presidentbefore the findingasked me if i would have any trouble working for you i didnt have any problem working for you then and i dont have one now most important your name is on the finding setting up ooa not mine the commanderinchief has spoken castillo met his eyes for a moment but said nothing at first then he asked so did you get us this gulfstream jockey you talked into staying in the air force hell be here at three i told him to bring a toothbrush as you would probably want to go somewhere as hard as it may be for any of you to believe there are several minor but as yet unresolved little problems with my grand master plan for one thing i dont know where special agent timmons is being held or by who and once i get the hmodels into uruguay i dont know what to do with them and i cant keep them in shangrila long chief inspector ordonez im sure has the local cops keeping an eye on it which means that im going to have to get munz to get his pal ordonez to look the other way briefly even ifbig ifordonez is willing to do that he wont do it for long which means i will have to get the choppers out of uruguay quickly pevsner has at least one estancia in argentina maybe more than one if i can find himanother big ifmaybe thatll be the answer and then theres this small problem i have with the agency an old problem torine said or a new one the new one didnt miller tell you delchamps did if youre talking about this weiss guy coming here castillo nodded he went on i dont believe for a second of course that the agency would even think of fucking up something im doing to protect something that theyre doing perish the thought torine said in agreement what the hell is that all about edgar which brings us to my little teteatete with the dci delchamps said the bottom line of which is that hes either a much better liar than i think he is or he doesnt know what weiss and company are up to in paraguay how did you come to have a little teteatete with the dci castillo said well there i was rooting around in the bowels of the palace in langley and all of a sudden i looked up and there he was ed delchamps right he asked and put out his hand im jack powell i picked up right away on that here was john powell the director of central intelligence wanting to make kissykissy with a dinosaurslashpariah which i found interesting so i enthusiastically pumped his hand and told him i was really pleased to meet him mr director sir leverette chuckled deep in his throat so jack asked me if i had time for a cup of coffee and i said i always have time for you mr director sir or words to that effect thinking we would then take the elevator to his office where i would either be charmed or terminated wrong he takes me to a little room in the bowels furnished with chromeandplastic tables and chairs and a row of machines offering candy bars snacks coke and coffee dispensed in plastic cups it is where the filing cabinet moles go to rest from their labors one look at who had just dropped in and the room emptied of file clerks in thirty seconds flat there we are alone holding plastic cups of lukewarm undrinkable coffee two palsslashcoworkers in the noble neverending effort to develop intel against our enemies and he told you how happy he was that you were in a position to restrain the impetuosity of our charley torine asked delchamps took a sip of his drink then said no i expected something like that but thats not what happened what he said was that he understood there had been problems and disagreements in the past and that he wasnt going to pretend he wished i hadnt changed my mind about retiring or that he was happy i was in the building with an anyarea anytime pass hanging around my neck but thats whats happened more important thats what montvale ordered delchamps stopped and after a moment went on he was even honest about that he said something about montvale having ordered him to let me in only because the president had told him to and that montvale probably didnt like it any more than he did then he said but the point is the president gave that order and i have taken an oath to obey the orders of those appointed over me and i dont intend to violate that oath delchamps looked at leverette you dont know me uncle remus but these guys do theyll tell you that i am inexperienced in the wicked ways of the world i have no experience in guessing whos lying to me or not i believe in the good fairy and in the honesty of all politicians and public servants they will therefore not be surprised thatin my wellknown allaround naivetei believed my new friend jack and my new friend jack said that the reason he had come to see me was to personally ensure the presidents order was being carried out that there were those in the company who sometimes decide which orders they will obey and which they wont justifying their actions on the basis that obedience is sometimes not good for the company i want to make sure thats not happening here and now with you jesus castillo said he asked me if i had even a suspicion that i was being stiffed by anyone if i suspected that anyone was not being completely forthcoming i could have given him a twopage list but the truth was that i had modestly decided that no one had kept metheyd tried of coursefrom looking at whatever i wanted to see and in their shoes i probably would have done the same thing but nothing i decided was to be gained by being the class snitch so i took a chance i said mr director i have been led to believe youre aware that the president has tasked colonel castillo with rescuing a dea agent who has been kidnapped in paraguay to which he replied id rather you called me jack giving him time to think yung asked i dont think so twogun delchamps said could be but i dont think so the next thing he said almost immediately after he nodded was i also hear the mayor of chicago was kind enough to send a detective along with him to help him do so id love to know how the hell he found that out castillo said the point is ace he knew about paraguay i wasnt springing it on him the point there castillo asked i said jack what im really concerned about is that castillos going to go down there like john wayne and get this guy back and in the process upset one of your apple carts and he looked surprised and asked one of ours and i nodded and he said i dont know of anything we have going on down there that could possibly have a connection with colonel castillos operation and then i guess he saw the look on my face which he could have interpreted as surprise or disbelief he stabbed himself in the chest with his index fingerhe demonstratedand then he said im in the coffee shop on level three please join me two minutes later in walks a franklin lammelle the deputy dci for operations frank edgar here wonders if we have any operation going in paraguay or argentina that in any way could bear on the ooa operation to free the dea agent or the other way around can you think of anything colonel castillo could do that would in any way interfere with anything were doing down there a franklin thinks this over very carefully and says aside from getting caught getting the dea agent back no sir and being the naive and trusting soul i am i believed him too which means torine asked castillo said weiss told usright edgarthat the station agent down there is not as intellectually challenged as people think he is the implication being thats on purpose delchamps nodded and that disinformation delchamps said could not have been put in place without a very good reason to do it or without the knowledge and permission of the dci andor a franklin lammelle which means he is either really intellectually challenged or was set up by somebody in langley who didnt think the dci had to know it smells ace delchamps said and the odor is not coming from my new friend jack or lammelle castillo raised his eyebrows then asked so what should we do i want to have a long talk with alex darby and the other social pariahs down there and their contacts you mean you want to go down there delchamps nodded when jake delchamps said what time did you say our new pilot gets here two headquarters fort rucker and the army aviation center fort rucker alabama september youre not planning to take that animal in there with you are you lieutenant colonel randolph richardson iii inquired of lieutenant colonel c g castillo as castillo slid open the side door of the van to let out max i cant leave him in the van in this heat castillo said and general crenshaw likes him castillo was more than a little pleased when they marched into crenshaws office and saluted general crenshaw returned the salute said stand at ease gentlemen then clapped his hands together bent over and called hey max cmere boy max walked up to him sat down offered his paw then allowed for his ears to be scratched thats one hell of a dog castillo general crenshaw said then added please sit down gentlemen can i get you a cup of coffee no thank you sir colonel richardson said if it wouldnt be too much trouble sir colonel castillo said general crenshaw raised his voice two coffees please black right castillo yes sir both black castillo thought righteous you asskissing sonofabitch youre actually wondering if its too late to change your mind about the coffee if the general is having some its obviously the thing for you to do okay general crenshaw said what can i do for you this morning castillo sir im here to make my manners im moving down the road and its likely i wont be back i just wanted to express my thanks for all your support crenshaw waved deprecatingly and especially sir to let you know how much i appreciate everything colonel richardson has done for us hes really done a firstclass job thats true even if he took elaborate precautions to cover his ass every time he did anything crenshaws secretary delivered two china mugs of coffee youll notice colonel castillo that i am not asking how things are going crenshaw said only if they are going the way you want them to exactly the way i hoped they would sir colonel davies sent his s down here yesterday to get the hmodels off your books and onto those of the th from which they will drop into the sea never to be seen again crenshaw asked jokingly then quickly added i probably shouldnt have said that into the sea jesus christ where did he get that if he knows about the ronald reagan were compromised before we get started easy castillo that was a figure of speech nothing more he doesnt know about the ronald reagan i dont know about them dropping into the sea sir but they might wind up on ebay crenshaw laughed i dont mean to pry castillo he said yes i guess i do but i understand the ground rules sir i regret that crenshaw held up his hand to shut him off youre obeying your orders colonel i understand that thank you sir whats going to happen now sir castillo went on is that the choppers and their crews will stay here until the word comes for them to move will that come through me or directly sir i have a communicator here as you know the man from directv yes sir the execute order will pass through him to major ward the senior pilot and then they will leave taking everything with them and leaving nothing behind but their thanks and the hope that nobody even knew they were here is there going to be a problem with that richardson general crenshaw asked has anyone been extra curious about whats going on in the hanchey hangar i dont anticipate any problems in that area general richardson said crenshaw looked at castillo and asked what about my putting out a discreet word that no one is to gossip about whats going on at hanchey sir i appreciate the offer but i suggest it would be counterproductive it might call attention to the hanchey hangar we have put out the disinformationwhen the question what are you guys doing here comes up at happy hourthat the choppers are being prepared for use as opposing force aircraft at the national training center at fort irwin we think thats credible crenshaw nodded his agreement you think of everything dont you castillo sir i think of a lot but theres always something important that gets right past me crenshaw bent over again and max gave him his paw again so long max crenshaw said meeting you has been an experiencehe stood up as he glanced at castilloand so has been meeting your boss castillo put his virtually untouched coffee mug down and stood up crenshaw put out his hand to him good luck in whatever youre up to colonel thank you very much sir permission to withdraw sir crenshaw nodded castillo and richardson came to attention and saluted crenshaw returned it then castillo and richardson marched out of his office max followed three aboard gulfstream iii nlt feet above the atlantic ocean approximately nautical miles east of cancun mexico september lieutenant colonel c g castillo couldnt move his legs he was up to his knees in some kind of muck where the hell am i whats going on he opened his eyes and found himself sitting in the rearfacing seat against the right bulkhead separating the cockpit from the passenger compartment and saw the reason he had the nightmare in which he couldnt move his legs max was having a little snooze too and had chosen to take it in the space between the rearfacing seat and the forwardfacing seat and to rest his weary head on castillos feet you big bastard how did you get in there max raised his head just enough to look at castilloand for castillo to free his feetand then laid it down again castillo swung his feet into the aisle unfastened his seat belt stood up and walked down the aisle to meet the call of nature he saw that he and max were not the only ones having a little snooze davidson was sitting in the rearfacing seat across the aisle snoring softly delchamps and leverette were stretched out on the couches sound asleep yung and neidermeyer were awake talking softly in two of the aislefacing seats and bradley was in one of the forwardfacing seats in the rear of the fuselage looking as if sleep was just around the corner when he came out of the toilet he thoughtas he often didof the fat lady on a transatlantic flight whose rear end had made a perfect seal around the toilet seat something she found out when she flushed the device and the vacuum evacuation system kept her glued to it for several hours he laughed then helped himself to a cup of coffee and carried it up the aisle to the cockpit hows it going castillo said to the pilots our leader is awake torine said look busy captain captain richard m sparkman usaf glanced over his shoulder and smiled at castillo then pointed to a gps screen in the instrument panel there we are he said about a hundred miles off cancun we should make quito in fourfifteen give or take theres one of those mounted on the bulkhead in the cabin castillo said our benefactor knowing that your revered leader likes to keep an eye on the pilots torine gave him the finger castillo smiled then did the mental math thatll put us in quito just before eleven figure an hour for the fuel a piss stop and a sandwich giving us wheelsup out of there at midnight and then another fivethirty or six to buenos aires putting us in there about half past five or six in the morning which will be half past threeor fourlocal time then he had another thought which means there will be almost nothing doing at jorge newbery when we land people will be curious jake how about going into ezeiza jorge newbery will be deserted at half past three in the morning ezeiza starts getting the fedex and ups planes and some of the european arrivals very early maybe we can sort of not be noticed youre right but they expect us at jorge newbery you are forgetting our new commo equipment i stand corrected torine said and i will get on the horn just as soon as im sure theyre all asleep i dont see why dick and i should be the only ones in this group awake all night fly carefully and smoothly children castillo said your leader is going to be sleeping torine gave him the finger again castillo went back to his seat this time carefully lowering his feet onto maxs chest max opened his eyes for a moment then closed them again castillo sat for a moment then said oh shit he then gently tapped on max with his feet max raised his head sorry pal castillo said you have to get up max didnt budge although he continued to look at castillo get up damn it max didnt move castillo swung his legs into the aisle got up and took a few steps down the cabin aisle come on boy no response castillo clapped his hands together once twice a third time max not without effort got to his feet and backed into the aisle good boy castillo pushed max backward up the aisle until he had access to the drawer under his seat he bent over and pulled it open max took two steps and licked castillos face sonofabitch castillo said and pushing at max to back up realized the dog probably thought he was playing castillo reached into the drawer and pulled his laptop from it max kissed him again aw goddammit i think he likes you colonel sergeant neidermeyer said castillo looked up at neidermeyer this is one of those times when i wish i was not a fieldgrade officer castillo said sir if we were both sergeants i could tell you to take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut castillo said with all due respect colonel sir it is not the sergeants fault that the animal seems to like you sir does the sergeant have something on what is loosely known as his mind yes sir the sergeant thought the colonel might be interested in some photographs the sergeant took in louisiana or more precisely colonel sir as we were flying over mississippi and louisiana sir he handed castillo a large manila envelope castillo took it from him and removed the photographs there were twenty or more eightbyteninch crisp color prints just about all of them were photographs of the hurricane damage they had seen from the air nice jamie castillo said whats the chances of getting a set of these i made those for you neidermeyer said thanks jamie castillo said i appreciate that he was now nearly at the end of the stack of photographs the one he had on top of the stack now was of him and the richardson boy they had both turned in their seats to look into the rear of the airplaneneidermeyer must have done something called something to get us to turn and look at himcastillo was turned in his seat to his right and the richardson boy to his left the result being their heads were close together nice kid neidermeyer said if i didnt know better id think he was yours what hes got your eyes colonel neidermeyer said i have so far been spared the joys of matrimony andso far as i knowof parenthood the eyes colonel theyre as blue as yours thats what i mean no he doesnt look like me im blond and fairskinned this kid is oliveskinned he could almost be latin he looks like fernando looked the first time i saw him we were about as old then as this kid holy christ calm down how could richardsons kid possibly be mine castillo suddenly felt a chill down his spine he had goose bumps dumb fucking question well hes a nice kid i wish he was mine but hes not obviously castillo said and put the photographs back in the envelope thanks jamie happy to do it colonel jamie neidermeyer said and walked back to his seat castillo picked up his laptop from the seat sat down tucked the envelope of photographs under the laptop and then opened the computer he clicked on a file titled chklist a screen full of gibberish appeared why did i bother to encrypt this no one could make sense out of it if it was on a billboard he held down the ctrl key typed dec and the file decrypted the gibberish was replaced by a screen more or less in english rrac av when where eta u or oo cs cs how many where land pevsner where drug connection where his bell the list of numbered entriescastillos system of keeping things to do notes numbered according to what he considered was their priority at the momentran off the computer screen he scrolled slowly down the list reading each one there were twentythree he scrolled back up the list to he would deal with that first the translation of was what about the aircraft carrier uss ronald reagan is it going to be available when is it going to be available where will it be whenif it is made available what will its estimated time of arrival off of uruguayor someplace elsebe he made the necessary corrections based on his current knowledge general mcnab had sent colonel kingston to tampa international airport where they had taken on fuel and gone through the customs and immigration formalities kingston had told him the uss ronald reagan had been ordered through navy channels to be prepared to receive four possibly as many as six uhh helicopters that were engaged in a clandestine operation classified top secret the task group commander and the captain of the ronald reagan would be advised when and where the helicopters were to be brought aboard the senior officer of the flight detachment would advise the task group commander and the captain when and where the helicopters were to be launched from the reagan the cover story for the operation was that the helicopters were being ferried to an unspecified latin american country as part of a military assistance program in this connection the ronald reagan was to be prepared to strip the helicopters of their existing us army paint scheme and identification numbers and repaint them in a paint scheme and numbers to be furnished by the senior officer of the flight detachment castillo deleted the question marks after rrac as there was no longer any question that the uss ronald reagan would be the means by which the helicopters would go to south america and he deleted av because he now knew that the ship would be available he left the question marks after when and where and eta u as he and colonel kingston had agreed there was no sense in guessing when the choppers would go aboard the reagan or where or when the reagan would be off the coast of uruguay the choppers would be flown as soon as possible from rucker to socom at macdill and from macdill to the reagan they would have a communicator with them he would be in touch with both castillo and mcnaband kingston and everybody else with one of the afc radiosand his information would be up to date castillo deleted or because that entry asked at what other location the choppers could be flown off the ronald reagan if they found for whatever reason that they could not do it off the coast of uruguay that was settled off the coast of uruguay was the only place it could be done castillo turned to the translation of which was other options maybe c maybe cs how many s would be necessary where could they land now that the ronald reagan was going to ferry the choppers it was no longer necessary to give consideration to using a c galaxy or twoor moreof its little brothers the c starlifter transport aircraft to get them to south america that would have posed all kinds of problemsincluding coming up with a cover story to hide where a c one of the largest aircraft in the world was headed and why castillo deleted all of and turned to the translation of which was what about aleksandr pevsner where is he does he have any connection with these drug people wheres his bell ranger helicopter he renumbered to then shook his head and sighed audibly then he held down the ctrl key typed enc and thus encrypted the file he saved the file then closed the top of the laptop he took the manila envelope containing the photographs from beneath the computer he pulled the image of randolph richardson iv and himself from the envelope he looked at it problems dont go away by ignoring them and oh boy do i have a doozie of a problem here perhaps unconsciously perhaps by habit he raised the lid of the laptop and began to deal with this problem as he did with most others with many facets that was to say as a staff study but no clever little abbreviations this time i cant afford to fuck this up he pushed the new key and started to type facts bearing on the problem the male child known as randolph richardson iv is in fact the biological child of mrs bethany richardson and c g castillo having been conceived out of wedlock shortly before the thenmiss wilson married randolph richardson iii whose name presumably appears on the birth certificate discussion considering the ramifications of the above and inasmuch as the human animal is capable of unlimited selfdeception the following must be taken into consideration bwr probably has considered the strong possibility that her first child was conceived in the daleville inn with cgc rather than wherever the hell she was on her honeymoon and by rriii she has decided that a her liaison with cgc did not occur during her fertility vulnerability and her honeymoon with righteous did and that therefore rriii is the father of rriv or b more likely that little would be gained and there would be a great deal to be lost by fessing up c why didnt she tell me i because that would be fessing up ii because she knew there was a good chance i wouldnt give a damn would i have iii because i might have rushed in and announced i wanted to do the right thing which means everybody would have known what happened that for one there was a certain hypocrisy in her virginal white bridal gown iv and her parents would have known of her little indiscretion who else knows or suspects a rriii would have no reason to suspect anything and probably was proud as hell when people thought that he made his bride pregnant on the honeymoon i if he suspected later child doesnt look like either of them it would be hard for him to accept ii if he somehow found out including if bwr was overwhelmed with guilt or got plastered and let it out in a fight etcetera he would either have to keep his mouth shut or be faced with the humiliation of having it whispered up and down the long gray line that cgc had impregnated his virgin bride since that would affect his career he would keep his mouth shut iii or equally possible bwr told him and they decided between them that the best way to deal with the problem would be to pretend it had never happened but is it possible for anyone to sit on something so emotionally charged for that long years more or less depending on when she told him b gen amp mrs wilsonunlikely neither of them would suspect that their precious little girl could possibly do something like this c her friendsunlikely there are secrets and there are secretsand this is not the kind to be shared with girlish giggles d abuelaoh god i if abuela could take a tensecond look at a blackandwhite photograph of a twelveyearold she had never seen in her life and firmly declare thats my grandson he has jorges eyes or words to that effect then there is absolutely no chance in hell that abuela doesnt know so why hasnt she said anything because she figures the kid would be better off where he is or maybe she has said somethingindirectlywith all that talk about me not having a family and getting a dog but a dog is not the kid the kid hes your son you asshole your blood the fruit of your loins the whole goddamn nine yards and what about the boy whats better for him castillo stopped typing looked at what he had written ran the cursor over everything to highlight it and then put his finger on the delete key this is not going to go away by sending it into cyberspace then he held down the ctrl key then typed enc he saved the now encrypted file as fatherhood and turned off the laptop ix one aeropuerto internacional ministro pistarini ezeiza buenos aires argentina september colonel jacob torine usaf turned from the left seat in the cockpit of gulfstream iii nlt toward lieutenant colonel c g castillo usa who was standing in the doorway and pointed his index finger toward the passenger compartment torine ordered sit colonel castillo complied with the order captain richard m sparkman usaf suppressing a smile then retarded the throttles a tad waited two seconds more then greased the aircraft onto the runway nice colonel torine said to captain sparkman over the privacy of the intercom your other option of course was coming in hard andor short or long and having charley remind you of it for the rest of your natural life what kind of a pilot is he if you quote me i will deny it but hes one of the naturals get him to take you for a chopper ride sometime youll feel like one of those soaring swallows that fly from capistrano to plaza de mayo here in b a stupid question i guess sparkman said i saw all those dfcs three of them torine said each for doing something with a helicopter that the manufacturer will tell you is aerodynamically impossible ezeiza ground control directed them to the far left of the terminal building where ground handlers parked them between two mcdonnell douglas md cargo aircraft one belonging to fedex and the other to lufthansa which made the gulfstream look very small indeed passengers may now feel free to move about the aircraft torine called over the cabin speakers please remember to take your personal items with you that includes ravenous bears masquerading as lapdogs castillo reappeared in the cockpit doorway how do you want to handle this charley torine asked use the valet parking or have us stick with it and catch up to you later theres nothing on here of interest except the afc radios and well take them with us lets stick together and the weapons torine argued no problem right until we try to take them off the airplane just leave them i will now go deal with the authorities torine said when do i tell them well need it on an hours notice castillo said remember were here to fish torine said castillo knew that that had come from darby when torine had radioed him their arrival time at ezeiza darby had said the purpose of your visit is sportfishing on the pilcomayo river max took one look at the customs officials at the foot of the stair door and decided he didnt like them he was however now on a leashcastillo had bought in quito a hefty woven leather souvenir lariat for that purposeand thus didnt pose a real problem still the customs officials smiling nervously gave max a wide berth as he towed castillo to the nose gear inside the terminal when castillos group tried to pass through customs and immigration there was another problem with max they were told that the official charged with ensuring that live animals entering the country had the proper documentationin maxs case a certificate from a doctor of veterinary medicine stating he had the proper rabies and other inoculationshad not yet come to work they would have to wait until he showed up castillo then saw at about the same time delchamps did the two burly men in civilian clothing leaning against the wall across the baggage carousel from them trying not to conceal their interest in the newly arrived american sportfishermen they might as well have had cop tattooed on their foreheads when castillo locked eyes with delchamps it was obvious they were both wondering if the officialwhohadnotyetcometowork was really late or whether this was some kind of stall max was not concerned he had for some reason changed his mind and decided he liked the customs officers who wouldnt let him into the country and had offered them his paw they had responded by offering him a thick rope to tug on and he now was dragging two of them across the baggage room castillo was somewhat concerned that when it came to inspecting their luggage there might be special interest in the afc satellite telephones in the suitcases carried by lester bradley and jamie neidermeyer there was a cover story ready of coursethat they were ordinary satellite telephones necessary to keep senor castillo in touch with the world headquarters of the lorimer charitable amp benevolent fund in washington dcbut that sounded fishy to even senor castillo and there might be problems later if the customs officers decided they had best make a record of the entry of the radios into argentina so that they would leave the country when senor castillo did and not be sold in argentina without the appropriate taxes being paid the problem did not come up by the time the official charged with making sure max was healthy showed up a half hour later max had so charmed the customs officialsmostly by being stronger than the two of them tugging on the ropethat as soon as the official had stamped his vaccination certificate they waved them past the luggage xray machines and through the doors to the lobby for arriving passengers there were no familiar faces waiting for them but torine nudged castillo and nodded toward a man waving a sign with herr gossinger written on it castillo discreetly signaled the others to wait then walked over to the man before castillo could open his mouth the man with the sign greeted him in german herr munz welcomes you to argentina herr gossinger he awaits you and your party at the estancia danke schoen castillo replied and motioned for the others to follow him out of the corner of his eye he saw that the two cops who had been in baggage claim were now in the terminal and obviously about to follow him and the others wherever they went the man with the sign led them out of the terminal to a small yellow mercedes bus with argentours painted on its doors as the driver eyeing max warily stuffed their luggage into it and the two cops watched the process torine discreetly nudged castillo again this time indicating a bmw with ordinary argentine license plates castillo saw alfredo munz behind the wheel alex darby the commercial attache of the united states embassy was sitting next to him neither darby nor munz gave any sign of recognition there were two people in the backseat of the bmw whom castillo couldnt identify not surprising i can barely see darby and munz through those darkened windows but what the hell is this all about when the yellow mercedes bus pulled away from the terminal munzs bmw followed it and when they had left the airport property and were on the highway headed toward downtown buenos aires munz passed the bus and pulled in front that wasnt surprising either but a minute or so later corporal lester bradley made his way with some difficulty through the crowded bus to kneel in the aisle beside castillo colonel i may be wrong but i thought i should bring to your attention the possibility that were being followed yung heard him he said its those two cop types who were eyeing us in the terminal castillo looked out over the luggage stacked in the back of the bus there behind them were four men in a blue peugeot sedan and two of their friends castillo said whats going on colonel yung asked i think theyre friendlies bringing up our rear munz and darby are in that bmw in front of us as to whats going on i havent a clue ten minutes later perhaps five seconds after castillo had decided they were en route to the safe house in pilarthey were on the sort of parkway that connects the downtown buenos airesezeiza autopista with the acceso norte which turns into ruta the bmw ahead of them suddenly turned onto an exit road and the bus tires squealing followed them when castillo looked out the back he saw that the peugeot behind them had come to a stop in the middle of the exit road effectively blocking anyone who might be following they drove three blocks into what looked like a workingclass neighborhoodrows of small wallsharing singlefamily homes built of masonry broken only by buildings that could have been small factories or garages or warehousesthen made another screeching turn and abruptly slowed before making a left turn off the street and rolling through an opened overhead door into a threestory building a stocky man wearing a pistol shoulder holster was standing just inside the door and as soon as the bus was inside he pulled on a chain mechanism that quickly lowered a corrugated steel door the room had been dimly lit now fluorescent lights flickered on filling the area with a bright harsh light they could see they were in some kind of garage vehicles of all descriptionstwentyfive or thirty perhaps more including several taxis and a nearly new mercedesbenz were parked closely together noses out against the walls there was a ramp at the end of the room leading upward is this where we go fishing colonel chief warrant officer five colin leverette asked the bus driver opened the door munz stuck his head into the bus we change vehicles here he announced whats going on alfredo castillo asked in german in a moment please karl munz replied in german then said in english would everybody please get off the bus max needed no further encouragement munz ducked out of his way at the last possible second max ran around the areain a strange gait castillo noticed almost as if hes running on his toes hes hunting thats what hes doing ill be damned if he didnt sense that just about all us warriors of legendary icy courage on the bus were scared shitless by this mysterious little joyridefound nothing that worried him and returned to munz where he sat down and offered him his paw max says its safe to get off the bus fellas davidson said dont laugh at him castillo said remember the last time he went looking for something in a garage whos laughing davidson said agreeably everybody piled off the bus the driver went to the rear and started unloading the luggage two more large men who looked like copsthe ones who had been in the backseat of munzs bmw castillo decidedmoved quickly to help him castillo caught munzs eye and wordlessly asked who they were and what was going on ill explain this all in a minute munz said were pressed for time lester could you find acceso norte from here yes sir corporal bradley replied i am fairly familiar with the area yung munz asked yeah i know my way around ba karl would it be all right with you if lester and yung drove everybody not needed here out to nuestra pequena casa whos needed here alfredo castillo asked edgar and jake should be in on this charley alex darby said okay castillo said are we going to need a radio right now darby shook his head okay load the cars that mr darbys going to give you castillo ordered neidermeyer if you ride with twogun we wont have both radios in one car otherwise suit yourselves take all the luggage edgar and jake youll stay they nodded two minutes later the corrugated steel door clanked noisily up yung drove a volkswagen golf out of the building the door came clanking quickly down again to rise two minutes later to permit the exit of a jeep grand cherokee with bradley driving when the corrugated steel door had crashed noisily down again one of the cops who had helped with the luggage raised his hand toward the ramp please he said in english they started to follow him up the ramp max ran past him without difficulty the others had a little trouble the ramp was quite steep not very wide and had sixinchwide antiwheelslip bumps running across it at the next level they found themselves in an area much like the level they had just left vehicles of all descriptions were parked tightly together against the walls max was standing in the middle looking at a brown uniformed gendarmeria sergeant sitting on a folding chair with an uzi in his lap the gendarme sat in front of a steel door in an interior concreteblock wall as the man led them across the open area toward the door the gendarme eyeing max warily got quickly out of his chair and had the door open by the time the man got to it the man went inside and there was again the flicker of fluorescent lights coming on please he said once more as he waved them inside max trotted in first the room was dominated by an old deskonce grand and elegantbefore which sat a simple sturdy rather battered oak conference table there were eight chairs at the table the wall behind the desk was covered with maps of argentina in various scales including an enormous one of buenos aires province along both walls were tables holding computers facsimile machines telephones a coffee maker and some sort of communications radios all of it looked old please the man said again this time an invitation for everyone to sit down that will be all thank you munz said to the man si mi coronel the man said and left the room closing the door behind him max lay down with his head between his paws and looked at the closed door okay alfredo castillo said whats going on starting with where are we we have a law of confiscation in argentina karl munz said this building was being used as a warehouse for cocaine and marijuana it was seized and so were the vehicles you saw comandante liam duffy of the gendarmeria nacional now uses it unofficially as an office and base of operations hes the guy who the dea guy was on his way to see when he was snatched delchamps asked munz nodded so what are we doing here delchamps went on and who are all the guys with guns comandante duffy thought there was a good chance that you would be at some risk at the airport how did he know we would be at the airport torine asked he was with us at the house when you radioed saying you were going to ezeiza instead of jorge newbery darby offered you had this guy in nuestra pequena casa castillo snapped at alex darby thats supposed to be our safe house a lot of things have happened charley darby replied obviously castillo said thickly sarcastic easy ace delchamps said then looked at darby like what alex what has happened the bottom line is that chief inspector jose ordonez of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional is back in the game jesus christ castillo exploded how the hell let him finish ace delchamps said reasonably castillo glowered at him but said nothing if i may alfredo munz began and when castillo motioned impatiently for him to go on munz picked up the explanation the day i came back here i called jose ordonez for several reasons one to thank him for what he had done for us and to tell him that i was back and frankly the primary reason i called was to ask him how well he knew duffy i knew we had to deal with duffy and i knew duffy only casually and i knew duffy would know that i had been retired from side and was afraid that he wouldnt want to have anything to do with me and castillo said jose told me that duffy had come to uruguay to see him and that as a result of the interesting conversation hed had with him he had called bob howell and asked him how duffy could get in touch with me and more important with you robert howell the cultural attache of the us embassy in montevideo was in fact the cia station chief and what did howell tell him castillo asked carefully the truthor what he thought was the truth that both you and i were in the united states but that he would relay the message and what did howell do he got on the next plane to buenos aires and came to see me darby said so i took him out to nuestra pequena casa to see alfredo to see if he had any idea what this was all about did you castillo asked munz shook his head i dont think we were in the house thirty minutes darby said when duffy showed up at the front door the front door or at the gate castillo asked the front door darby said obviously he had people on me or howellmore likely bothand they followed us from the embassy and no country club security guard is going to tell a comandante of the gendarmeria he cant come in what did he want castillo asked to talk to me munz said but especially to you what about i wanted to show you some photographs colonel a voice behind castillo said it sounded not only american but as if the speaker were a native of brooklyn castillo turned to see a tall muscular very fairskinned man with a full head of curly red hair he was in the process of taking off his suit jacket under which he carried in a shoulder holster what looked like a fullframe model a colt semiautomatic pistol max was now on his feet his head cocked to one side looking at the newcomer so youre liam duffy castillo thought and how long have you been outside listening to this conversation senor duffy duffy walked around to behind the ornate desk he hung his jacket on the back of his chair sat down and then announced i am comandante duffy of the gendarmeria nacional he really does sound like hes from brooklyn where the hell did that come from how do you do comandante castillo said am i to thank you for the protection weve had since we walked into the terminal at ezeiza alfredo who i recently learned is a very dear friend of a very dear friend of mine in uruguayjose ordonezwhich makes him a very dear friend of mine thinks we might work together colonel with that in mind it was in the interest of the gendarmeria to guard you and your men against a threat i dont think you knew existed what kind of a threat possibly being shot or perhaps being strangled now who would want to do something like that to innocent tourists who came to your beautiful country to flyfish its rivers of trophy trout the same people who did this colonel duffy said he tossed a large manila envelopevery skillfully it landed right where castillo was sittingacross his desk castillo took from the envelope a thick sheath of color prints they had been printed on ordinary paper but the quality told him they had been taken with a highquality digital camera he took a quick look at the first one then passed it to delchamps and signaled that he was to pass it to torine and the others when he had seen it it showed a bulletriddled body of a man in a brown militarytype uniform he was lying on his back eyes open in a dark pool of blood on what was probably the gravel shoulder of a macadam country road there were in all eight photographs of the body several fairly close photographs of the head and torso showed the head was distorted it had been shot several times at close range including castillo judged once in the mouth there were more signs of entrance wounds in the body than castillo could conveniently count which strongly suggested the use of a submachine gun with what looked like an entirely unnecessary coup de grace shot in the mouth next came as many photographs of a second gendarme he had died of strangulation a blue metal garrote had been so tightly drawn against his throat that it had cut into the flesh he had lost a substantial quantity of blood before he had died then there were glossy photographs of two gendarmes sitting in a chair both had their wrists handcuffed and showed signs of having been beaten castillo passed along the last of the pictures and the envelope to delchamps then looked at duffy duffy locked eyes with him and castillo sensed it would not be in his best interests to break the eye contact first castillo didnt look away until munz touched his arm with the envelope now again thick with pictures he took it from munz stood up and walked to duffys desk he put the envelope on the desk then walked back to his chair sat down and looked at duffy again my gendarmes were manning road checks when the hijos de puta did this to them duffy then said the gendarmeria sometimes sets up road checks at random sites and sometimes at sites where we have information about where drugs will be coming down the highway in both cases here we had had information that drugs would be coming down two particular highways which happen to be some seventy kilometers apart duffy paused a moment then continued killing and kidnapping gendarmes is very unusual criminals almost never kill members of the gendarmeria and never before have kidnapped any of them why is that comandante delchamps asked softly because they know it is unacceptable munz said what does that mean unacceptable castillo demanded it means the gendarmes will take revenge munz said killing anyone they suspect may have been involved he let that sink in for a moment then went on the gendarmeria operates all over argentina very often in remote areas and with very few men they usually operate in twoman teams and sometimes alone they are not attacked because the price for doing so is too high when this happened when did this happen castillo interrupted before or after timmons was snatched a week after timmons was taken munz said the dayor the day aftermax found lorimer in the bushes at nuestra pequena casa the gendarmeria colonel duffy said prides itself on always getting its man it was not wise to do what these hijos de puta did and i asked myself why these narcos had the first conclusion obviously to be drawn was that they decided to send the gendarmeria the same kind of message they have been sending your dea people in asuncionthat they will not tolerate interference with their business then i asked myself why they had suddenly decided to do this what came to mind there was that they were about to start significantly increasing the flow of product to the point where so much money would be involved that they would think that protecting the shipments was worth the risk of behaving toward the gendarmeria in a manner heretofore considered unacceptable if this were true i reasoned it was possibleeven likelythat my men were targeted by the narcos rather than it being that they simply had stopped a narco truck and that the narcos had resisted if the latter were the case then both men would have been killedno witnessesnot one of them taken away that posed a number of questions including how they had learnedthat is who had told themwhere the road checks would be i had some ideas about that but nothing that i could prove the most kind was that the hijos de puta offered the farmhands the peones in the area a little gift if they would telephone a number to report where we had set up a road check less kind was the possibility that the narcos offered a little gift to the officers of the policia federal in the area to do the same thing but the major question in my mind was what had happened to cause the sudden increase in actions by the hijos de puta that they had to know were not only unacceptable to the gendarmeria but would also call attention to them which was also not in their best interests at that point i remembered hearing some gossip about something interesting that had happened in uruguay it sounded incredible but i decided it was worth looking into what i had heard was that a drug deal had gone wrong on an estancia in tacuarembo province in central uruguay according to this story six men all dressed in black like characters in a childrens movie had been found shot to death i thought that checking out the story would be a simple matter jose ordonez is more than a professional associate with whom i have worked closely over the years as i said we are dear friends i thought all i would have to do would be to telephone joseunofficially of course i have joses private number and he has mineand ask him what there was to this incredible story and also to ask him if he had noticed any sudden increase in the drug shipments into and out of his country so i called him when i asked him what had happened in tacuarembo province he didnt answer directly he said that it had been too long since we had seen one another and that we should really try to have lunch very soon well the very next morning i was on the buquebus to montevideo duffy went on tourist class as i was paying for it myself getting an official authorization to travel to uruguay is difficult takes time and then only results in a voucher for a touristclass seat is it that way in the us army colonel very much so comandante getting the us army to pay for travel is like pulling teeth that then raises the question of who is paying for the helicopter in which you have been flying all over down here castillo looked duffy square in the eyes and said evenly i have no idea what youre talking about comandante if we are going to work together colonel we are going to have to tell each other the truth the last three words of the sentence came out udder da trute castillo couldnt restrain a smile you find that amusing duffy asked colonel munz didnt tell me you were from brooklyn comandante i dont understand you have a brooklyn accent comandante duffy visibly annoyed looked at munz munz gestured that he didnt understand and then turned to castillo and said i dont understand either karl okay delchamps said cultural history pay attention there will be a pop quiz sometime around the time of the potato famine in ireland the catholic church sent a large number of priestsfrom kilkenny i think but dont hold me to thatto minister to irish catholic immigrants in the new world many of them went to brooklyn and many to new orleans their flocks picked up their accent now that ive heard comandante duffy speak i wouldnt be a bit surprised if some of them were sent down here too now duffy smiled on the other hand duffy said to castillo you sound like a porteno colonel what did holy mother church in argentina do send porteno priests to new york castillo laughed actually im a texican castillo said a what a texican one whose family came from mexico a very long time ago before texas was a state my familys from san antonio i am a great admirer of the texas rangers duffy said i have two ancestors who were texas rangers a long time ago sometimes we think of the colonel as the lone ranger delchamps said can i ask what a porteno is somebody from buenos aires alex darby offered who speaks with sort of a special cant and a hijos de puta delchamps pursued argentina is a society where people like narcos are held in scorn by men darby said chuckling hijos de puta is a pejorative i believe you would say sonsofbitches duffy said what did you have in mind comandante castillo asked when you said if we are going to work together well jose and i had a very nice luncheon in the port restaurant in montevideo do you know it castillo shook his head youll have to try it sometime its really excellent if you like meat prepared on a parrilla its right across from the buquebus terminal can we get to the point of this castillo asked during which duffy went on nodding ordonez told me in confidence of course that what really happened at estancia shangrila had nothing to do with narcos would you believe me if i told you i never heard of estancia shangrila no but i certainly understand why you would profess never to have heard of it if i may continue castillo made a dramatic sarcastic gesture for him to do so i also learned from my friend jose that his very dear friend el coronel alfredo munz formerly the head of side was associated with you colonel i had only the privilege of a casual acquaintance with el coronel munz before the interior ministry threw him to the wolves following the murder of senor masterson but i had always heard that he was an honest man despite the rumors that he was very close to a very bad man named aleksandr pevsner never heard of him either castillo said you edgar delchamps shook his head duffys face first paled then flushed enough of this nonsense comandante liam duffy said angrily let me tell you what i know about you colonel castillo when the diplomats wife was kidnapped you suddenly appeared on the scene and were placed in charge of the situation but by someone superior to the ambassador because the ambassador was placed at your orders you directed the protection of the masterson family after masterson was murdered you found out who had killed him and when those hijos de puta went to the estancia of mastersons brotherinlaw most probably to eliminate him and take possession of some sixteen million dollars they were surprised to find you and a team of your men waiting for them having traveled there by helicopter you eliminated all of the bastards and took possession of the sixteen million dollars you lost one of your men and colonel munz suffered a wound and these were not ordinary narcos one of them was major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia he paused shall i go on colonel castillo what is it that you want from me comandante castillo asked what i intend to do colonel is find and deal with the criminales who murdered and kidnapped my men i will make the point very strongly that this was unacceptable behavior im very much afraid that in your efforts to free special agent timmons you will interfere with my plans to do this that is something i cannotwill notpermit from what both ordonez and munz tell me about you you let nothing get in your way of what you consider your mission so you have the choice colonel between working under my orders or leaving argentina you have already broken many of our laws and are obviously prepared to break whatever of our laws might interfere with your mission working under my orders will mean that i will have access to your assets including money intelligence equipment and personnel more important it will mean that you will take no action of any kind without my approval on the other hand you will have access to my intelligence and what few assets i have ordonez has told munz i am a man of my word i am we have a more or less common goal you want to get your man timmons back from the narcos beyond that i dont know we share an interest in interdicting the flow of drugs of course but we both know that neither you nor ior you and i togethercan stop the trade but we can i believe cost the hijos de puta a great deal of money thats something so what you are going to do now colonel castillo is go out to nuestra pequena casawhich was rented under fraudulent conditions for illegal purposesand get on that marvelous radio of yoursthe possession and use of which are also offenses under argentina lawand tell your superior of this conversation if he is agreeable to our working together alfredo knows how to contact me if not i will give you twentyfour hours from noon today to get out of argentina before i notify the interior ministry of your illegal behavior and the foreign ministry of the actions of el senor darby el senor la senora sieno and others which i feel certain will merit their being declared persona non grata do i make myself clear colonel castillo met duffys eyes and nodded i mentioned sharing my intelligence with you duffy said it has come to my attention that the narcos were aware you were coming to argentina to deal with special agent timmonss kidnapping their solution to that potential problem for them was to kidnap you and failing that to kill you and of course your men it was for that reason that my men were at ezeiza and escorted you here i didnt want that to happen to you until we had a chance to talk thank you very much for your concern castillo said with a sarcastic edge it is nothing colonel have a pleasant day duffy stood up behind his desk and threw the envelope of photographs back across the desk to castillo you may have those colonel he said as he put on his suit jacket in case you might need a reminder that if the hijos de puta are willing to do this to my men theyll certainly be willing to do the same to special agent timmons then he walked out of the room leaving the door open max lay down again watching the door with his head resting between his front paws they heard the sound of an engine starting of a car moving then the sound of it bumping down over the bumps of the ramp then the screech of the corrugated steel overhead door opening to the street castillo looked at the others and found they were all looking at him gentlemen he said why dont we go out to nuestra pequena casa and get some breakfast he paused then went on and if you have nothing better to do please assemble your thoughts visavis getting your leader out of this fucking mess two mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina september when munz slowed the bmw as they approached the striped pole barrier to the country club he looked over at castillo who was sitting beside him max had somehow managed to squeeze himself between castillos feet and now had his head on castillos lap castillo his head bent was apparently asleep munz smiled and shook his head were here karl munz announced our gendarmeria escort has just left us castillos head immediately jerked erect would you believe i was thinking he asked no jake torine said from the backseat torine was jammed in between alex darby and edgar delchamps i was trying to make an important decision castillo said and did you i thought i would seek your wise counsel before reaching a final decision castillo said based on your vast pokerplaying experience what the hell are you talking about ace delchamps asked when do i call that evil leprechaun sonofabitch and tell him i surrender is that what youre going to do darby asked castillo did not reply directly instead he went on do i call almost immediately as if my superior in washington immediately caved in or in an houror two or threegiving duffy the idea that my superior ordered me to surrender only after solemn thought probably after he consulted with his superiors i gather you are not going to seek montvales sage advice delchamps said or anybody elses two problems with that castillo said the first of course being that montvale is not my superior second my asking montvale would permit him to happily run to the presidentwho is my bossthen sadly report that as he predicted the impetuous young colonel has gotten himself in a bind in argentina the idea there being to really put me in montvales pocket so the only anybody else i can call is my bossgood morning mr president the lone ranger here a redheaded argentine cop has got me by the balls and i really dont know what to do delchamps chuckled make the call in two or three hours karl munz said softly but seriously reasoning castillo asked liam duffy would be suspicious if you called him right away that you did not consult with your superior and were lying to him he expects that you do have a superiorfar down the ladder from your president but a superior or superiors if you wait the several hours he will probably think that you have been ordered to cooperate with him and will think that makes you less of a problem to him castillo grunted then looked at darby alex i think you should follow alfredos advice alex darby said he tends to be right jake castillo said turning thats a decision someone of my pay grade is not qualified to make torine said edgar i go with alfredo delchamps said okay ill call him in three hours castillo said karl munz said remember that duffy said munz knows how to contact me i remember castillo said so i suggest it might be better if i was your contact with duffy castillo was considering the implications of that when delchamps said hes right again ace okay again then castillo said he looked out the window they were almost at nuestra pequena casa i thought with a little bit of luck i might never see this place again he said susanna sieno opened the door of the house as they pulled up to it max got out first climbing over castillo into the rear seat and then jumping out the rear door as darby opened it castillo swore not very well trained is he ace delchamps asked innocently there was a man sitting in a straightbacked chair just inside the door he stood up and came to attention as castillo entered he was short stocky oliveskinned had a neatly trimmed pencilline mustache and a closely cropped ring of dark hair circling the rear of his skull the rest of which was hairless and shiny he was wearing a shiny blue singlebreasted suit a white shirt and a really ugly necktie which ended halfway down his stomach that irish sonofabitch has had the balls to put a spy in here confirmation of that seemed to come when the man said buenos dias mi coronel a sus ordenes castillo nodded and replied in spanish good day and you are capitan manuel delia mi coronel castillo continued the exchange in spanish and what are you doing here i am here for duty mi coronel comandante duffy sent you no mi coronel then who did general mcnab mi coronel youre an american si mi coronel where are you from captain captain delia switched to english miami colonel its not your day is it ace delchamps said he really got you castillo flashed him a dirty look delia said i sent colin leverette to ruckerhe said he knew you sirwhile i got the team moving from bragg and i brought up the rear i got here yesterday morning mrs sieno brought me out here your whole team is here yes sir here here or someplace else im the only one here sir the others are stashed in hotels around buenos aires except our commo and intel sergeants whoat mr darbys suggestioni sent ahead to asuncion where in asuncion darby said theyre in the hotel resort casino yacht amp golf club paraguay charley gambling chasing ladies maybe even playing golfon your nickeland incidentally looking around theyre not going to attract attention doing that theyre traveling on mexican passports colonel delia said legitimate ones theyre texicans he looked at castillo to see if he understood the term youre looking at one castillo said delia smiled with all possible respect sirand i admit you do talk the talkyou look like a gringo to me and you dont fortunately castillo said what about your sergeants in asuncion no one will think theyre gringos colonel and the rest of your team everybody but colin leverette can passhas passedas a native latino thats presuming paraguay isnt that much different from bolivia or venezuela or cuba for that matter although not everybody on my team has had the chance to see how castro has fucked up the land of my ancestors colin told me hed been to cuba castillo said he did fine in cuba as a brazilian delia said in venezuelanot so many blackskinned folkshe also passed himself off as a brazilian he speaks pretty good portuguese he also speaks pretty good pashtu castillo said so do i delia said in pashtu darby and i were talking about that we must have just missed each other over there sir you knew alex there delia nodded and mrs sieno and i have been exchanging cuban war stories he said under those circumstances welcome welcome captain castillo said just as soon as we get something to eat ill bring you up to speed on whats going down he turned to susanna sieno how about mustering the troops in the quincho susanna everybody castillo nodded then understood her question ask sergeant mullroney and lieutenant lorimer to come watch us eat first please then muster them in the quincho sit down please sergeant mullroney lieutenant colonel c g castillo said politely when the chicago detective came into the dining room of the main house with lorimer while we talk about what were going to do with you mullroney sat down across the table from castillo lorimer sat down between torine and delchamps a plump middleaged woman and a younger one began distributing ham and eggs and plates of rolls her daughter castillo wondered whoever they are they wouldnt be here if susanna didnt trust them castillo pushed a coffee thermos across the table has charley here been a good boy eddie castillo asked a very good boy sir first lieutenant edmund lorimer said then we mustnt forget to give him a gold star to take home to mommyi mean the mayormustnt we no sir we mustnt ill be sure to do that may i ask when that will be colonel first thing tomorrow morning castillo said he looked at mullroney for a long moment then asked no comment sergeant you know the mayors not going to be happy if you send me home colonel mullroney said after a moment i guess not castillo said but the situation herealready badgot worse about an hour ago which leaves me with two choices making the mayor unhappy by sending you back home or watching this operation blow up in my facewhich as you know sergeant means in the presidents facewhich is not really an option lorimer just told you i havent been giving anybody any trouble mullroney protested thats because lieutenant lorimer has been sitting on you under my orders to take you out if you even looked like you were thinking of doing something you shouldnt so you behaved and you get to go homealivewith that gold star i was talking about you really dont want to piss off the mayor colonel mullroney said no i dont and i dont think i will making him unhappy and pissing him off are two different things do you know what we mean by a gold star for mommy sergeant mullroney didnt reply and his face showed embarrassed confusion i will send a letter to the mayor with colonel torine castillo said with copies to the president and the director of national intelligence saying how much we appreciate his offering us your services and how hard you have tried to be of use but that i have reluctantly concluded you just dont have the investigative analytical and other skills necessary and that i decided the best thing to do to ensure the success of the operation was to send you home you sonofabitch mullroney said castillo went on as if he hadnt heard him now that will almost certainly make the mayor unhappy but i think if hes going to be pissed off at anybody it will be at you sergeant mullroney for not being able to cut the mustard i dont think that will make you too popular with special agent timmonss family either mullroney locked eyes with castillo but didnt say anything permission to speak sir lorimer asked castillo appeared to be considering that before he made a come on with it gesture sir inasmuch as sergeant mullroney didnt ask to be sent with us it doesnt seem fair that he should find his ass in a crack from the expression in mullroneys eyes ol charley did in fact volunteer to come along with us volunteering no doubt scored a lot of points with the mayor and thered be even more brownie points if weand hemanaged to get timmons back were not in the fair business lorimer castillo said coldly and therefore since you are presumed to understand that colonel delchamps interrupted if i may castillo appeared to be considering that too before he gestured for delchamps to continue i dont know what youre going to say edgar but obviously you picked up on where im trying to go with mullroney you even called me colonel whats going to happen now i think is instead of the ordinary good guy bad guy scam were going to have two good guys saving mullroney from bad ol colonel castillo i understand your concerns colonel delchamps went on but what i have been thinking is that detective mullroney might be useful when we go to paraguay how castillo asked his tone on the edge of sarcasm in dealing with both the people in the embassy and the local police with regard to the former whether you go there as colonel castillo or as mr castillo you are still going to be the important visitor from washington and they are not going to tell you anything that might come around in that marvelous phrase to bite them on the ass as far as the local police are concernedyour command of the language notwithstandingyou are going to be a visiting gringo and they are not going to tell you anything delchamps paused then continued now detective mullroney actually im a sergeant mullroney interrupted delchamps flashed mullroney a look making it clear that he didnt like being interrupted then went on sergeant mullroney is a bona fide police officer low enough in rank so as not to frighten away the people in the embassy but yet to be so to speak one of them im suggesting that he might be toldor would seethings they would not tell or show you i am now pretending to carefully consider what delchamps just said the funny thing is it makes sense even if he came up with it just to help lorimer and me keep mullroney on a tight leash there may be something to what you say delchamps castillo said after what he considered to be a suitable pause but do you really believe that it outweighs the risk of mullroney doing something stupid that would blow the operation well youd have to keep him on a short leash of course delchamps said but yes colonel i do you might be surprised how valuable he might be sir ill be sitting on him lorimer said but you have this odd notion of fair play lieutenant castillo said castillo put what he hoped was a thoughtful look on his face and kept it there for thirty seconds which seemed much longer and castillo then went on to be of any use to us in the manner you suggest he would have to know whats going onstarting with being present at the briefing i am about to deliverand im uncomfortable with that sir ill be sitting on him lorimer said again youve mentioned that castillo snapped sorry sir lorimer said and looked at mullroney with a look that said well i tried all right castillo said ill go this far you will not return to the united states with colonel torine tomorrow i will give this matter further thought and let you know what i finally decide thank you mullroney said softly take sergeant mullroney out to the quincho and tell the others ill be there shortly i need a word with these gentlemen yes sir lorimer said he gestured for mullroney to get up and then followed him out of the room when the door had closed castillo mimed applauding the others chuckled may i ask a question karl munz said sure you dont trust him do you he strikes me as the kind of nottoobright guy who meaning well is likely to rush off in the wrong direction and we cant afford that can i ask why you trust me aside from all that money were paying you and the bullet you took for us torine darby and delchamps chuckled you know what i mean karl munz pursued straight answer munz nodded there are some people i intuitively know i can trust youre one of them that may not be professional or even smart butthe proof being im not pushing up daisiesso far its worked thank you munz said softly on the edge of emotion i had the same feeling about you their eyes met for a moment hurriedly changing the subject castillo said pay close attention your leader has just had one of his brilliantif somewhat off at a tangentthoughts can you hold it a minute ace delchamps asked sure when i talked about mullroney being useful in paraguay i meant it not only for the reasons i gave okay did you pick up on what duffy said about him being worried about your health castillo nodded delchamps said somebodyweiss probablyhas sent the cia guy in asuncion a headsup watch out for castillo i sort of thought he would castillo said and did you sort of think his reaction would be whack castillo andor whack him and everybody with him whos weiss darby asked delchamps held up his hand palm outward as a sign to darby to wait a minute castillo shook his head no i didnt castillo said simply whats your take on the threat alfredo delchamps asked a little theater on duffys part no i think he believes there was a threat which would mean he has somebody in the embassy or at least somebody in asuncion who he trusts and who fed him that delchamps said munz nodded his agreement delchamps turned to darby maybe you know him alex he said company oldtimer milton weiss i dont know him ive seen him around weiss first came to me then to castillo and told us a that the station chief in asuncion is a lot smarter than he wants people to think he is and b that theyve got an operation going where theyre going to grab a cruise ship maybe ships cruise ships darby said incredulously delchamps nodded and continued under maritime law theyre subject to seizure if the owners collude in their use to transport drugs how are they going to prove the owners knew darby asked according to weiss they have that figured out castillo said and they dont want our operation to free timmons to fuck up that operation delchamps said at first it made sort of sense but then i found out that the agency doesnt know anything about this operationfor that matter anythinggoing on down there that we could screw up getting timmons back you think the bastards in langley would tell you darby asked delchamps answered with a question alex do you think an operation like that would or could escape the notice of either john powell or a franklin lammelle darby considered that for a moment no one or the other probably both would know about it the potential for it blowing up the dci told me he knew of no such operation told you personally yeah and i believed him then he sent for lammelle and asked him and lammelle said he didnt know anything about it either and i believed him too so what do you thinks going on i dont know but when i thought about it putting myself in the asuncion station chiefs shoes if i had come up with an operation anything like what weiss told us hes got goingand im not known for either modesty or my love for the langley bastardsid want all the help i could get even if that meant taking it to langley myself and waiting in the lobby or the guard shack to catch lammelle or the dci wherever i could find them again edgar what do you thinks going on castillo asked no goddamn idea ace except that i know its not what weiss has been feeding us but now that we have it on good authority that my fellow officers of the clandestine service want to whack me and the presidents agent im beginning to wonder if maybe theyve changed sides jesus christ jake torine said softly so what do we do castillo said i dont know that either but i thinkwhat i was saying before about mullroney being usefulthat you and he should go to the embassy in asuncion and let him stumble around use him as a beard castillo asked delchamps nodded then asked can i use your radio to make a couple of calls like maybe two hundred there are some questions i can ask some people i know you dont have to ask for christs sake castillo said thats the best i can do right now ace i suggest you go to asuncion with mullroney acting as if you dont think theres anything wrong but its your call you dont have to be a rocket scientist to whack people i want to talk to pevsner before i go to asuncion theyll expect you two in asuncion as soon as you can get there delchamps said simply lets make that choice after we hear what duffy has to say castillo said okay you need me in that meeting or can i get on the horn before castillo could open his mouth delchamps went on sorry we havent heard your brilliant thought it was brilliant just a few minutes ago castillo said now it doesnt seem either very brilliant or especially important lets hear it delchamps said i was worried about the hueys and the guys from the th on the ronald reagan why torine asked theres a twostar admiral on board twostar admirals tend to cover their ass we cant afford not to get those choppers repainted and off the ship but the senior th guy is a major majors tend to do what flag and general officers tell them to do i knew a major one time an army aviator who didnt seem all that impressed by twostars darby said he even stole one of their black hawks borrowed alex borrowed i gave it back castillo said what are you thinking charley torine asked that we need a more senior officer aboard the reagan castillo said like maybe an air force colonel bearing a letter from truman ellsworth or maybe even montvale saying in essence dont fuck with the hueys god you are devious torine said he thought that over a moment and then said what if i got onwhat did edgar call itthe radio and called ellsworth and said i was a little worried talk about devious delchamps said he would think it was his idea torine finished when are the hueys going to leave rucker i dont know castillo said so you callyou jake delchamps said and find out and then you call ellsworth and say i just found out the choppers are about to go on board the reagan and im a little worried about something going wrong why do i feel i have just been had torine asked okay charley youre right some admiral is liable to feel he cant get in trouble launching black helicopters if something happenslike being too far at seathat keeps him from launching them thanks jake dont be too grateful ace delchamps said with a grin nobodys going to shoot at him on the reagan which i think explains his sudden enthusiasm torine gave him the finger we can call from right here right torine asked castillo nodded that will be all colonel torine said you may now go brief the troops x one nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina september castillo rapped a spoon against his coffee mug and waited silently until everybody who had gathered in the quincho was looking at him then castillo began an initial review of our current situation gentlemenand ladysuggested the possibility of some minor problems a more detailed analysis indicates that we are really in the deep dodo that got the chuckles he expected let me trace the events from the moment max found lieutenant lorimer sneaking through our shrubbery castillo had gotten as far into his recapitulation of what had happened since they had hurriedly left argentina as the chicago meeting of special agent timmonss familyand the mayorwhen jake torine appeared in the door of the quincho castillo made a t with his hands signaling time out and walked to the quincho door sorry to interrupt colonel torine announced but i really need a moment of your time castillo gestured for torine to follow him outside i called rucker torine said once they were alone major ward told me theyre going to fly to jacksonville naval air station tomorrow and then the day after tomorrow fly out to the ronald reagan why jacksonville florida torine explained east coast almost at the georgia border i know where jacksonville is jake but why not go to jacksonville the day after tomorrow take on fuel and then fly onto the reagan their sitting around jacksonville for a day will cause questions to be asked ward says the navy wants to make sure theyre not going to sink the aircraft carrier trying to land on it thats bullshit jake the pilots in the th are the best in the army the most experienced and landing a huey on a carrier is a hell of a lot easier than making an arrested landing with a fighter thats what i told truman ellsworth torine said he waited until he saw castillos reaction to that then smiled and nodded i called him torine went on and reminded him that he had suggested i call him if you had done something impulsive and then i told him you had arranged to send choppers to south america aboard the ronald reagan and i was afraid that the navy didnt like itproof being the orientation they were insisting onand was going to cause trouble he paused i was good charley i didnt know i had it in me maybe because you dont like ellsworth any more than i do thats a real possibility my conscience didnt bother me at all and what did our mutual friend have to say he said hed call me right back five minutes later montvale called me first thing he asked where you were i told him you were somewhere between buenos aires and asuncion which is true so then he said he would have to deal with this himself he said it was a pity i wasnt in the states because what he really would like to do is send me aboard the reagan to keep an eye on things and i told him i would be in the states tomorrow and and he said dont plan on unpacking your bags when you get to washington colonel youre going for a little voyage to which i replied what will i tell castillo to which he replied ill deal with lieutenant colonel castillo colonel torine you dont have to worry about that so the thing to do castillo said is get you back to the states as soon as possible which opens a new can of worms for one thing you just got here youre tired you dont want toshouldntfly right back the flip side of that is what is the evil leprechaun going to say when i call him he may consider the gulfstream as one of the assets he wants me to share with him so getting it out of here as soon as possible is probably smart what about me taking dave yung and colin leverette to montevideo torine suggested right now i mean sparkman and i could crash in twoguns apartment for a whilefive six hours anywaythen leave for the states later today tonight or first thing in the morning thatd work but the worm that pops up there is how do we get the airplane back here ambassador lorimer his wife and the two guys from china post will be on board i can get another gulfstream pilot from the presidential flight detachment castillo visibly thinking didnt reply isnt that what you meant torine pursued castillo didnt have time to reply edgar delchamps was walking toward them from the house max decided delchamps had come out to play intercepted him and dropped a tennis ball at his feet delchamps picked up the ball and threw it as far across the yard as he could then walked up to castillo and torine i just had a brilliant insight of my own delchamps announced anybody interested im breathless with anticipation torine said were just spinning our wheels if we cant get the choppers off the reagan and refuel them at shangrila and the key to making that happen is chief inspector jose ordonez if you cant get ordonez to look the other way were fucked and you dont know how much damage your new pal duffy has done with him castillo considered that a moment youre right he said i dont suppose you had a solution to go along with your insight the obvious one go see him me or alfredo or both you remember the last time we saw ordonez he said so long and dont come back why dont you ask munz jake and i had just about decided that hed drop off yung and leverette in montevideo on his way to the states castillo said no reason he couldnt take munz with him or both of us he stepped into the quincho doorway and motioned for alfredo munz to come out then he raised his voice and announced to the others somethings come up that we have to deal with right away just sit tight munz waited for castillo to speak two questions alfredo how much damage did liam duffy do to us with ordonez i was about to suggest that we go see him munz said until we do that we wont know how much damage hes caused and its important that we know arent we liable to cause more damage if i go i just reminded delchamps that the last time i saw him he said goodbye and dont come back he knows youre planning an operation in either argentina or paraguay thats none of his business what he doesnt wantand will work very hard to preventis another operation in uruguay were not planning anything in uruguay castillo said except the refueling and done right that shouldnt take much more than a couple of hours he paused then added well lets go off on another tangent probably the best way to get the hueys ashore is to launch them one at a time from the reagan one every fortyfive minutes or an hour and have them fly into and out of shangrila on different courses he looked at torine for any input youre the expert charley torine said four hueys or even two flying overhead is going to attract more attention than just one castillo said true torine agreed whatever you decide to do karl munz said ordonez would be more assured if he heard it from you than from me like me jose believes you can tell if a man is lying by looking into his eyes ive got to ask this castillo said would a little gifthell a great big giftmake any difference the very offer would probably kill any chance at all of him being willing to look the other way munz said what youre going to have to do karl is convince him that his permitting your helicopters to entereven secretlyuruguayan airspace and using shangrila as a refueling place is in the best interests of uruguay that it wont cause any problems for uruguay okay so we go to uruguay castillo said and right now he gestured for the others to follow him back into the quincho comandante duffys going to be annoyed when he finds out weve left here castillo explained but i will deal with that later when i call him from montevideo what i dont want to do is have any friction with him as we leave that might cause trouble about us going to montevideo i regard his threat to have us kicked out of the countryor arrestedas valid but i think hes very interested in what he calls our assets and i dont think hes going to blow that whistle until i tell him no or until i do something suspicious i am also convinced that the arrogant bastard thinks hes got me really scared which as a matter of fact he does so were going to go with exactly thatim scared and im leaving what were going to do is load in the van everybody whos going to uruguaythats yung leverette sparkman munz torine bradley and meand have neidermeyer drive us out to ezeiza where we will file a flight plan to montevideo then clear immigration and customs and leave castillo glanced at the others who would remain at the safe house alex darby delia the sienos and lieutenant lorimer showed no signs of having any problem with that but castillo thought he saw questions in sergeant mullroneys eyes questions castillo thought that hes learned not to ask thanks no doubt to our little incident in the mountains outside vegas maybe hes not completely stupid castillo went on i think we can presume duffy has a carmaybe twositting on us at the gate we are not going to try a la james bond to lose them in traffic if they cant keep up much better but were not going to look as if were running away we can also presume that if they have managed to follow us to ezeiza theyll follow us inside the terminal and learn what were doing and tell duffy with a little luck theyll also tell him we havent tried anything sneaky thatll give him the choice between letting us leave or trying to stop us and hell have to make that choice in a hurry i think hell decide okay good riddance possibly because keeping us from leaving might be hard for him to do anyway if were brazen hell reason thats because weve destroyed everythingthe radios for examplethat could get us in trouble and he doesnt want the stink that would be made if a bunch of american tourists were stopped without cause so i think we can make it to uruguay once were airborne well call on the radio if you dont hear from us or if somebody comes knocking at the door be ready to use the thermite grenades to torch the radios and anything else thats incriminating he looked at everybody and added if anybody has any better ideas im wide open there was a moments silence what about max delchamps asked what about him if you dont take him ace that might give duffy the idea you plan to come back but if you do what are you going to do with him how are you going to get him back here from uruguay the gulfstreams going to the states castillo looked down at max who was lying with his head between his paws his big eyes looking up at him max goes he said after a moment youre right duffy would expect me to take him with me if i was leaving did i say that because i believe it or because quite clearly i just again heard abuela saying you dont even have a dogand i dont have the heart to just leave the big sonofabitch here not knowing if i am coming back hes saved my life once for sure in budapest and probably in the garage of the sheraton pilar and i could hide behind that but the truth is castillo that youre a goddamned softie you like the way he looks at you with those big soft eyes okay lieutenant lorimer sound boots and saddles castillo ordered two suite radisson montevideo victoria plaza hotel plaza independencia montevideo republica oriental del uruguay september special agent david w yung was smiling and shaking his head as he watched jake torine toss peanuts to max who snapped them from the air chief warrant officer five colin leverette holding a bottle of beer stood up from the minibar looked at yung and announced twogun is thinking about sex hes shaking his head in disbelief and smiling close yung replied im thinking i cant believe the general manager believed charleys yarnim an epileptic and this dog has been trained to alert me when he senses a seizure coming on i was counting on him having seen that malady on fox news castillo said solemnly you always have to have an answer prepared david what our dog lover here was actually counting on working was that hundreddollar bill he slipped the manager torine said max is up here isnt he despite those no pets signs in three languages on the door castillo said and a good thing for you that he is charley torine said youre going to need him to protect you from that cop when he learns youre back the telephone buzzed castillo signaled for yung to pick it up thank you yung said in spanish into the receiver well be right down he hung up looked at castillo and switched back to english the car from the embassy is here that was quick leverette said the embassys only a couple of blocks from here yung explained and then added maybe i better take max with me to protect me from ambassador mcgrory i dont think hes going to be happy to see me nonsense castillo said hell be thrilled the secretary of state called him personally to tell him youre coming thats what i mean yung said okay castillo said you get the keys to your apartment for jake and sparkman and the keys to your car if thats been fixed all mcgrory has to know about jake and sparkman is that theyre pilots from the presidential flight detachment and will be leaving as soon as they get some rest but tell him that even if he doesnt ask hes liable to be impressed with that and then come back here and let us know how he reacted yes sir yung said castillo picked up on something in yungs tone something just shy of sarcasm dave he said i learned a long time ago that its better to piss off one of your guys by telling him again and again how to do something he already knows how to do than to take the chance he misunderstood you if i didnt think you could handle mcgrory i wouldnt be sending you to the embassy yung met his eyes then smiled and shrugged yeah he said simply castillo raised his right arm and hand in the manner of a priest blessing one of the faithful go forth and do good twogun he said solemnly yung smiled shook his head and started for the door castillo waited until they had left then turned to munz lets get it over with he said call ordonez munz punched an autodial number on his cellular telephone when it began to ring munz pushed the speaker button ordonez the familiar voice came over the speaker alfredo munz jose ive been waiting for your call my friend were in the victoria plaza i know stay there munz exchanged glances with castillo who raised his eyebrows where are you munz said into the phone sixty kilometers out of punta del este i should be there in about an hour did you hear what i said about staying where you are yes that includes colonel castillo understood munz said looking at castillo again they werent supposed to permit castillo or anyone with him to enter the country ordonez said when i pointed this out to them they wanted to arrest you i think i stopped that but i would not try to leave the hotel yung and three others were with us they were just picked up by an american embassy car i know stay in the victoria alfredo very well there was a change in the background noise and munz pushed the phones end call button munz said he apparently meant it when he said goodbye and dont come back i dont know what to think karl castillo silently raised his hands in a gesture of helplessness the door chimes sounded pleasantly almost exactly an hour later and munz went to the door and opened it uruguayan policia nacional chief inspector jose ordonez a trim welldressed oliveskinned man in his late thirties stepped into the room he was visibly surprised to see maxwho sat with his head cocked as if making up his mind about the visitorbut ordonez didnt seem afraid of the dog he ignored him he embraced munz and kissed the air next to his cheek then looked at castillo after a moment he put out his hand i wont say that im delighted to see you colonel castillo he said in spanish nevertheless good evening chief inspector castillo replied in spanish amazing ordonez said if i didnt know better id swear he is a porteno the accent is perfect carlos is an amazing man jose munz said may we offer you something to drink chief inspector castillo said yes thank you ordonez said without hesitation scotch please if you have it he looked at an array of bottles on a credenza some of that famous grouse single malt if it wouldnt be an imposition not at all castillo said he remembered hearing that uruguay consumed more scotch whiskey per capita than any other nation in the world and that the present head of the family that had had the lock on importing the whiskey for generations was a dartmouth graduate what remote corner of the memory bank did that come from he started to open the bottle just one lump of ice please ordonez said and half as much gasfree water as whiskey coming up castillo said he made three identical drinks and handed ordonez and munz theirs they clicked glasses ordonez walked to the window pushed the curtain aside and looked out if this hotel had been built in he said millingtondrake could have watched in comfort from herefor that matter from the bar in the arcadiarather than having to climb all those stairs to stand in the rain over there excuse me castillo asked the arcadia restaurant on the twentyfifth floor it has a bar castillos confusion showed on his face you do know who millingtondrake was dont you colonel i have no idea who he was castillo said does the name langsdorff mean anything to you langsdorff who the hell is he talking about what the hell is he talking about oh hell you are a disgrace to the long gray line castillo of course castillo said hes buried in buenos aires isnt he yes he is ordonez said and from the towers of that buildingcome have a look castillo went to the window in a moment munz and max followed ordonez pointed to a tall building across the street the open ornate masonry towers of which seemed to be fifty or sixty feet below them ordonez said sir john henry millingtondrake the british ambassador who was a close friend of my greatgrandfather climbed to the top of the towers you see thereit was raining hard i understand he must have gotten soakedto watch the pocket battleship graf spee sail out of the harbor and scuttle herself when the conditions are right you can make out her superstructure interesting man castillo said as the memory banks suddenly opened after seeing to the burial of his dead and negotiating the terms of the internment of the rest of the crew he put on his dress uniform and shot himself to prove that he had scuttled his ship to save the lives of his men that he personally wasnt afraid to die he positioned himself so that his body fell on the german navy battle flag rather than the nazi swastika flag ordonez said i thought perhaps youas a graduate of your military academywould know who langsdorff was yeah i indeed know who he was an officer and a gentleman who lived and died by his code death before dishonor the motto that murderers rapists drug dealers and other human scum in prisons now tattoo on one another to help pass the time of course castillo said my greatgrandfather told me colonel castillo that despite the public story that said it was millingtondrakes eloquence and strong personality that caused the uruguayan government to scrupulously follow international law and order the graf spee to leave montevideo within the seventytwohour period required by the law it was in fact enormous pressure applied by the united states governmentwhich as im sure you know was like uruguay ostensibly neutral in the war between the english and the germansthat caused it to do so i hadnt heard that castillo said but it seems credible so what are you doing here colonel you knowim sure you remember me telling youyoure not welcome here so again what is it youre doing here im helping ambassador lorimer move onto estancia shangrila ambassador lorimer jeanpaul lorimers father hes a retired diplomat you didnt know ordonez did not reply directly instead asking why on earth would he want to move to a remote estancia in tacuarembo province the lorimers lost their home in new orleans to hurricane katrina castillo said it isor at least wasunder fifteen feet of water i understand that mr lorimerthe late mr lorimerhad an apartment in paris wouldnt that be more comfortable for ambassador lorimer the ambassador told me the united nations took his sons paris apartment off his hands at a very good price he said he had the feeling they would rather he didnt go to paris so he decided to come here castillo nodded what are yung and the others doing at your embassy the state departmentactually the secretary of state herselfcalled ambassador mcgrory to tell him to help ambassador lorimer in any way he can theyre going to see him about that ordonez took a notebook from his pocket read from it then asked who are sparkman and leverette sparkman is the copilot of the gulfstream leverette is the ambassadors butler hes going out to shangrila and set things up as soon as thats done well fly the ambassador and his wife down here all right colonel thats your cover story and its a good one he paused as he looked him in the eyes then he added now lets get to the truth why are you here i just told you castillo began but when he saw ordonez hold up his hand and was about to interrupt him went on andandi need your help to do what ordonez asked matteroffactly i need to secretly move helicopters into uruguayan airspace refuel them and fly them out of uruguay using estancia shangrila using shangrila castillo confirmed and what would the helicopters be used for one of our dea agents in paraguay is being held by drug dealers my orders are to get him back from the people who have kidnapped him you know who they are castillo shook his head or where they are holding this man castillo shook his head not even in which country castillo shook his head again then this man whom you have been ordered to rescue could be in uruguay thats possible but unlikely have you had the opportunity to meet comandante duffy of the argentine gendarmeria nacional colonel ordonez asked i know he was hoping to talk to you i met comandante duffy this morning did he tell you that two of his men have been murdered and two kidnapped presumably by the same people who have taken your man castillo nodded did he tell you what he intends to do to the people who have done this or who he thinks may have done this he didnt spell it out in so many words but he made it pretty clear that he intends to take them out he intends not only to kill them but to leave their bodies where they fall as an example of what happens to people who murder gendarmes castillo nodded much as you did with the people at shangrila ordonez added castillo met his eyes for a moment castillo then softly but angrily said sorry ordonez i cantwontlet you get away with equating what happened at shangrila with the coldblooded murder of duffys gendarmes youre not going to deny that there were six bodiesseven counting lorimers corpseleft lying in pools of blood at estancia shangrila are you colonel actually eight men died at the estancia castillo said his voice rising i lost one of my men and we damn near lost alfredo but we acted in selfdefense they opened fire on us without warning we returned it they died what the hell were we supposed to do call a priest give them the last rites and bury them jose munz said evenly colonel castillo went to estancia shangrila with plans to take lorimer backaliveto the united states violence was neither planned nor expected and you went with him alfredo fully aware that kidnapping is just as much a crime in uruguay as it is in argentina ordonez said munz his eyes narrowed nodded and was making off with lorimers sixteen million dollars planned or expected we didnt know about the money until we went into lorimers safe castillo said so youre admitting you stole the money neither castillo nor munz replied what did you do with the money alfredo and i spent most of it on whiskey and wild women castillo said ordonez stared at him coldly so tell me ordonez what happens now castillo asked after a moment you escort us to the buquebus excuse me well obviously our coming here has been a waste of time youre not going to help us but on the other hand weve given you no reason to arrest us weve broken none of your laws not today ordonez allowed except of course the small matter of trying to get a senior police official to acquiesce in your violation of the laws of his country we came to ask your help jose munz said with an edge in his voice help in getting a fellow police officerwho happens to be an americanback from the hijos de puta who kidnapped him the hijos de puta who have him also have two of duffys gendarmes ordonez replied evenly and have brutally murdered two of his gendarmes and thats what worries me alfredo thats who worries me the narcos or duffy munz asked you and i both know alfredo that these people are not ordinary narcos if they were id probably be hopingmay god forgive methat duffy would be leaving bodies not suitable for viewing in their caskets all over corrientes and entre rios provinces and for that matter paraguay hes right that the kidnappingand the murderof police officers cannot be tolerated and that leaving bulletriddled bodies on the side of the road or at narcotics refining plants would send that message far more effectively than running them through a justice system where sadly justice is often for sale ordonez paused a moment but he went on as i say these are not ordinary narcos major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia is proof of that castillo thought how the hell does he know thatand how the hell much more does he know excuse me castillo asked certainly someone of your background colonel has considered that vincenzo was herepossibly even probably in paraguaylong before lorimer went missing in paris and as their man on the scene was available to supervise the very professional kidnapping of mrs masterson and the subsequent murder of her husband when they wanted to locate lorimer and their sixteen million dollars can you define they and their castillo asked obviously vincenzo was a cuban but what is the connection between the russian fsb and the cuban direccion general de inteligencia there are two possibilities one no connection here in this instance vincenzo was here to a make money from the drug trade and b cause what trouble he could in the interests of cuba or two the russians are involved for the same purposesmaking money and causing trouble i place more credence in the latter in no small measure because of the murder of lieutenant colonel viktor zhdankov of the fsb in punta del este and the presence of your friend aleksandr pevsner so far as i know pevsner is not under the fsb castillo said and as a matter of fact he as much as admitted to me that he had zhdankov and kennedy eliminated in punta del este i suspected that of course and i appreciate your candor which leads us right now to what i was going to come to eventually from this point on we will tell each other the truth duffy has lied to me about what munz asked it doesnt matter alfredo but it is one more reason that i am worried about him and this situation i want to have nothing whatever to do with him as he goes after these narcos does that bring us back to my question about you escorting us to the buquebus terminal castillo asked listen to what i am saying please colonel i said i wanted to have nothing to do with duffy in what hes going to do i am prepared with the understanding that we will tell each other the truth to help you with your helicopters the truth about everything and that includes el senor pevsner castillo met his eyes so far as i know castillo repeated pevsner is not under the fsb thats the truth he almost certainly has flown things around for them but he has also flown things around for the cia but again so far as i know he is no more an asset of the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti than he is an asset of the central intelligence agency munz added andother than what carlos has just saidi found no connection between him and the fsb when i worked for him ordonez looked at munz a moment nodded then said i have to ask you something alfredo munz made a go on gesture when you worked for him ordonez said who were you working for argentina munz said but since were telling the truth i never turned the money pevsner paid me over to side one more indelicate question old friend i have to ask who are you working for now i am working for carlos munz said met castillos eyes then looked back at ordonez but we have the unspoken agreement between us that i am not workingand will not workagainst argentina in this case it should go without saying that these hijos de putaor whoever else the direccion general de inteligencia andor the fsbare working against the best interests of my country my conscience is clear jose before god i have not will not sell out my country thank you ordonez said the problem we have hereim sure you will agreeis that duffy also believes hes working for his country and cantor doesnt want tounderstand that his duty to argentina is to turn over what he has to side and not embark on this mission to murder whoever killed and kidnapped his men he let that sink in for a moment then added i dont want youby you i mean you and colonel castilloworking with duffy and you think i want to castillo said what if i have to then i cant permit you to bring your helicopters into uruguay all i want to do is refuel helicopters at estancia shangrila they would be on the ground less than an hour and they would not be coming back an hour or two plus whatever time it took them to reach the estancia and then to leave uruguayan air space ordonez corrected him thats right castillo said if i had your word and alfredos i could arrange it so that you will not be working with duffy i cant give you my word castillo said its going to be hardimpossiblefor me not to work with duffy duffys told me that unless i can get my superiors to order me to work under his orders and share my assets with him i will have to leave argentina within twentyfour hours and i have to say this if you hadnt run at the mouth i wouldnt have that problem ordonez considered that a moment then almost visibly decided not to take offense i ran at the mouthan interesting phrasebefore i understood what duffy was planning to do and before i discovered that he had lied to me but the cows out of the barn it doesnt matter who opened the barn door or when or why the damage has been done and have your superiors ordered you to work with duffy castillo hesitated before replying okay truth time i have not asked my superior but im going to call duffy very soon and tell him that i have been ordered to do whatever he wants me to do youre taking that responsibility on yourself i have been ordered to get an american drug enforcement administration agent back from his kidnappers the order carried with it the authority to do whatever i have to do to get himhis name is timmonsback there is no point in me calling my superior when i know his answer will be to do whatever i have to do ordonez nodded colonel he said let me tell you about my superior superiors nominally i am under the authority of the minister of the interior but when a situation has international implications i get my directions from the foreign minister as well actuallyfor purposes of credible deniabilityi get them from deputy foreign minister alvarez it was alvarez who decided with me that it was in the best interests of uruguay to ascribe the murder of lorimer at his estancia the murders of lieutenant colonel viktor zhdankov of the fsb and howard kennedy in punta del este and of course the deaths of major vincenzo and his five friends at shangrila to internecine warfare in the drug business i dont knowand dont want to knowwhat if anything alvarez told the foreign minister about what we had done but there was no pressure from either the foreign ministry or the interior ministry on me to zealously pursue the people responsible for all those deaths he paused then added which of course would have included you and your men it seemed to be the best solution to the problem while murder is a terrible crime no uruguayans had been murdered kennedy and zhdankov were buried beside vincenzo and the others in graves marked unknown in the sacred heart of jesus church cemetery in tacuarembo david yungthrough the american embassywas repatriating the remains of lorimer and it seemed unlikely that the russians or the cubans would ask questions about zhdankov or vincenzo and you and i had the little chat in which i suggested you should leave uruguay and not come back soon when you agreed to do so i thought the matter was closed i was wrong about that of course the day before duffy called metwo days before he came herealvarez told me our ambassador in washington had called him to report that senator homer johnshe paused and looked at castillo to see if he knew who he was talking about and when castillo nodded went onto ask him what he could tell himofficially or otherwiseabout the death of lorimer or if he had heard anything about your special forces having conducted an operation in uruguay and what did the ambassador tell him castillo asked that lorimer was involved in the drug trade and that he had heard nothing about special forces operating secretly in uruguay the senator then asked him to discreetly inquire again and the ambassador agreed to do so as it happens the ambassador and i are old friendsuruguay is a small country and we have a saying dont worry if you dont know someone hell marry into your family by the end of the week but the ambassador and i are friends from school and youll remember it was he who i turned to for help in identifying the mm national match cartridge case we found at shangrila so unofficially i called him to see what else senator johns had had on his mind he told me that the senator had told him hed gone to see ambassador charles w montvale who as your director of national intelligence could be presumed to know about such things and that montvale had denied any prior knowledge of lorimers involvement in the drug trade and denied any knowledge of a special forces operation in uruguay ordonez looked more intensely at castillo ive always suspected montvale is the man you answer to colonel do you castillo shook his head i thought we were agreed to tell one another the truth ordonez said i dont work for ambassador montvale for whom then the secretary of defense castillo shook his head again ah then the secretary of state ordonez said clearly pleased with himself of course i should have thought of that it explains a great deal the authority you wielded in your embassy in buenos aires the decision to keep ambassador mcgrory in the dark about your operation i dont work for secretary cohen either castillo said ordonezs face showed that not only did he not believe that but that the denial offended him munz caught that and said he doesnt jose well who does he work for do you know munz was quiet a moment then laughed yes i do he said but if i told you id have to kill you what did you say ordonez asked incredulously its a useful phrase ive learned working for carlos munz said its not said seriously you never know jose munz said youre not going to put it to the test are you i may not be sherlock holmes ordonez said to castillo but after we eliminate montvale and your secretaries of state and defense theres not many people left are there from whom you could be taking orders what else did you learn from your old pal the ambassador castillo asked ignoring the question ordonez looked at him for a long moment as if deciding whether or not to pursue the question of who gave castillo his authority and orders finally he said he said that he had the distinct feeling that senator johns would like nothing more than proof that there had been a secret special forces operation in uruguay and that montvale had lied to him about it perhaps he doesnt like ambassador montvale a lot of people dont castillo said i dont like him much myself but i would hate to see him embarrassed by senator johns and so would i ordonez said because that would mean the decision alvarez and i made about everything would come to light the cubansand probably the russians toowould go to the united nations to righteously denounce uruguay i get the picture castillo interrupted and youre right of course for not only permitting the imperialist yankees to send their infamous special forces to murder innocent cuban tourists and czechoslovakian businessmen on uruguayan soil but then to shamelessly deny it castillo was silent for a moment then he said just for the recordoh hell go on ordonez said i was going to split a hair castillo said my people at shangrila were not all special forces it was not an sf unit that was sent here i dont think whatever the legalities that anyone will believe that thats what i decided and the people who came here now to rescue timmons are bona fide special forces theyre already here just about all of them castillo said and the helicopter pilots are from the ththe special operations aviation regiment and the helicopters too presumably no i got the helicopters from a graveyard by the time they get here theyll be cleaned and black cleaned and black ordonez parroted anything that could indicate they belong to the us army will be removed and theyll be painted in the color scheme used by the argentine army theyll be more or less identical to the hueys the argentines are flying and if nothing goes wrong and you manage to rescue your man without murdering everyone whoever so much as talked to the narcos how do you plan to get your men and the helicopters out of argentina or paraguay if hes not going to let me use shangrila to bring the choppers in castillo thought what the hell does he care about the details of whatsnottohappen what the hell is he hinting at the men will leave the same way they came in as tourists i havent given much thought to the helicopters you werent planning on flying them back to where they came from the field from which they will have been flown into uruguay is an aircraft carrierthe uss ronald reagan by the time i can get timmons back it will have sailed around cape horn and be halfway up the pacific coast to valparaiso chile so i understand some of the lakes in argentina are very deep castillo said youre not suggesting that you intend tosink four helicopters in an argentine lake what the hells going on here why the curiosity and its damned sure not idle curiosity what else would you suggest i do with them i cant just leave them in a field somewhere or for that matter destroy them torch them they have to disappear my orders are to come down here quietly get timmons back quietly and leave quietly tell me colonel are helicopters of this type readily available on the commercial market sure but wouldnt there be some means of tracing their history all the way back to the factory the communists captured several hundred of them when vietnam fell many of those have appeared at various places around the world ordonez nodded and asked involved with criminal activity of some sort castillo nodded ill be a sonofabitch does mr clean who munz warned me was above taking a bribe want my birds confirmation of that wild theory came immediately it would then be credible if your helicopters somehow made their way to a field somewhere in uruguay for me to find them and announce that they probably had been in the use of drug dealers criminals who arrived at the field to refuel them found no fuel and had to abandon them whereupon they would enter the service of the policia nacional castillo said ordonez nodded then asked parts would be available for them ordonez if you let me refuel the choppers at shangrila ill fly them anywhere in uruguay you say when im finished my operation even if i have to fly them there myself when ordonez didnt immediately reply castillo added and i will get you all the parts you need for them either through government channels or black this black would be better ordonez said it would continue to keep ambassador mcgrory out of the picture also it would be better if you had someone other than yourself bring them back into uruguay colonel then we have a deal castillo asked ordonez nodded and exhaled audibly but let me clarify it colonel i dont think its quite what youre thinking you havent bribed me with a gift of helicopters for which you will no longer have a need and which in fact give you a disposal problem what they represent is a sugar pill for me to accompany the bitter one i have to swallowthat of assisting you in an operation which is really none of my business and which i am really afraid is going to end in a disaster i realized that i was going to have to help you not because i want to but because i have no choice but to hopeeven praythat you are successful your failure would be a disaster for me do we understand each other castillo nodded ordonez went on you mentioned the buquebus why dont you fly back to buenos aires castillo pointed at max who was lying beside him with his head between his paws and said yung told me that taking him on austral or aerolineas would be very difficult ordonez considered that then said and even if i helped you overcome the difficulties it would still attract attention let me make a suggestion if you could arrange to have someone meet you at the customs house at the international bridge at fray bentosgualeguaychus ill fly you there in one of the policia nacional hueys we have four very old ones two of which are flyable it will perhaps make you understand why i am so interested in yours thats very kind of you jose munz said you alfredo and your animal anyone else my communicator give me an hour to set it up ordonez said call me when youre ready to go he stood up i presume alfredo will keep me advised of whats happening castillo nodded thank you for your hospitality ordonez said offering castillo his hand he embraced munz went through the hugandkiss rite and walked out of the room three embassy of the united states of america lauro miller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay september the honorable michael a mcgrory the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states to the republic of uruguay was a small and wiry welltailored man of fiftyfive with a full head of curly gray hair his staff referred to him as napoleon and senor pomposo mcgrory looked across his highly polished wooden desk at special agent david w yung who sat beside colin leverette robert howell the embassys cultural attache stood near the door mcgrory smiled and said to yung if youll be good enough to give me a minute alone with mr howelli need to speak with him on another matteryou can be on your way thank you mr ambassador yung said and its been a pleasure meeting you mr leverette if you need something for ambassador lorimeranything at allthat either mr yung or mr howell cant arrange please feel free to come see me at any time thank you very much sir leverette said yung and leverette stood up shook the ambassadors hand and walked out of the ambassadors office closing the door behind them well howell what do you think mcgrory asked what do i think about what mr ambassador howell replied while officially the cultural attache of the embassy howell was in fact the cias uruguay station chief what do we really have here excuse me you dont see anything odd in lorimers father coming down here to live on that estancia in the middle of nowhere with a butler i thought that was pretty well explained when yung told us the ambassador lost his home in hurricane katrina sir and the presence of yung that didnt strike you as unusual i can think of a likely scenario sir lets have it it could very well be that the secretary who i think has known the ambassador a long time went out of her way to do what she could for the ambassador she knows he has a heart condition his soninlaw was murdered and right after mr mastersons remains were repatriated the hurricane struck and destroyed the ambassadors home huh the ambassador snorted and yung who was on the secretarys personal staff we learned after the fact mcgrory interrupted nobody knew that when he was here yes sir well he was available he was still accredited diplomatically down here yung probably struck her as the obvious choice to come here and set things up traveling in a private gulfstream jet airplane i wonder what that cost i dont like to think mr ambassador but on the other hand we know the ambassadors daughter came into her husbands money and we know how much of that there is it poses no financial strain on her to charter airplanes or for that matter to pay for the private security people who will be coming here with the ambassador and none of this strikes you as suspicious i dont know what to suspect mr ambassador years ago howell there was a terribly racist saying to the effect that one suspected an africanamerican in the woodpile im familiar with the expression sir but i dont know what ambassador lorimer could be concealing im not referring to ambassador lorimer ambassador mcgrory said impatiently stopping himself just in time from finishing the sentence with you idiot youre referring to the butler sir leverette mcgrory stared at howell and thought i cant believe this this man works for the central intelligence agency if hes typical and i suspect he is they should call it the central stupidity agency no ambassador mcgrory said carefully aware he was on the edge of losing his temper after a moment hoping his contempt wasnt showing he went on that was a figure of speech howell a figure of speech only i was suggesting that theres something about this whole sequence of events that doesnt seemhe stopped himself just in time from saying kosherquite right and what is that mr ambassador howell asked if youve been in this business as long as i have howell you develop a sense a feeling mcgrory explained somewhat smugly i understand howell said how may i help mr ambassador you can keep a close eye on yung and that man leverette see if they do anything suspicious see who they talk to yes sir i think the best way to handle this is just report everything you see or hear yes sir any time of the day or night yes sir ambassador mcgrory dismissed howell with a wave of his hand then rose from his desk and walked to the window it provided a view of the rambla the road that ran along the atlantic ocean beach the water was muddy because it bore all the siltand god only knows what elsefrom the river plate it didnt become clearreally become the atlantic oceanuntil punta del este a hundredodd kilometers north mcgrory stood at the window for perhaps three minutes debating whether or not to call his brotherinlaw he really didnt like senator homer johns while mcgrory admitted that his brotherinlaw had had a lot to do with his being named ambassador to uruguay it was also true that homer not only reminded him of this entirely too often but accompanied the reminder with some snide observation about mcgrorys slow movement up the ranks of the foreign service mcgrory didnt know why homer bitterly hated the director of national intelligence ambassador charles w montvale but he suspected it was because montvale and not homer had gotten that job when it was created after homer was on the senate intelligence committee and thought the job should have been his homer hadnt been at all sympathetic when mcgrory had called him and told him how the deputy foreign minister alvarez had as much as called him a liar in his own office when he had told him that there were no special forces teams operating in uruguay that anything like that could not take place without his permission and the senator hadnt been at all impressed when mcgrory told him that he had figured out what had really happened with lorimer at his estanciathat lorimer had been a bigtime drug dealer on the side using his united nations diplomatic passport whenever that helped the first time hed told that to the senator the senators reply had been mike thats the most absurd bullshit youve ever tried to hand me and homer hadnt even apologized when mcgrory had called him to report a the uruguayan cops had finally figured out what had happened a drug deal gone bad just as mcgrory had said and b that he had gotten this from deputy foreign minister alvarez together with an apology for what alvarez had said to him in the beginning hed gotten back a little at homerhe didnt want to go too far with that of course there were more important diplomatic posts than uruguay and his brotherinlaw could be helpful again in that regardthe last time homer had called homer said hed just gotten word from a good sourcea woman who had been canned by the cia and was highly pissedthat montvale had indeed sent a special forces team to uruguay to keep lorimer from running off at the mouth homer said shed also supplied the name of the guy in charge castillo mcgrory had smiled knowingly at the purported news homer hed said i know all about castillo he works for the department of homeland security and he just happened to be in argentina and was put in charge of protecting the masterson family until they could get out of argentina thats all hes a lousy major is all i think your source is full of shit you know about this castillo do you yes i do lorimer was killed by drug people not by special forces i dont know mike my source sounded pretty sure of herself why did she come to you homer as an outraged citizen or a disgruntled employee trying to make trouble for the cia whyd she get fired she didnt tell me that homer had said and then added she does have a reputation around town for sleeping around well there you have it homer maybe but what i want you to do anyway mike is keep your eyes and ears open i want to hear of anything at all that happens down there thats out of the ordinary let me decide whether or not its important okay ambassador mcgrory thought still looking out his window at the muddy waters of the river plate on the one hand while ambassador lorimer coming down here is a little odd it is true that new orleans is under water and that his daughter mastersons widow now has her hands on that sixty million dollars jack the stack got when that beer truck ran over him so having a butler and flying around in a chartered jet airplane isnt so strange what the hell could a retired old ambassador with a heart condition be into but waiting to die and on the other hand homer said he wants to hear anything out of the ordinary to let him decide whats important so ill call him and tell him about this and he can run it past his source the lady with the round heels reputation who got canned from the cia and see what she has to say and when some other postbuenos aires for examplecomes open he can remember how useful i have been to him whenever he asked for something mcgrory went to his desk picked up the telephone and told the operator to get senator homer johnsand not anyone on johnss staffon a secure line four suite radisson montevideo victoria plaza hotel plaza independencia montevideo republica oriental del uruguay september howd it go dave castillo asked as yung howell and leverette came into the room i didnt tell mcgrory that jake and sparkman were from the presidential flight detachment jesus christ robert howell suddenly said as max walked toward him whered that dog come from i keep him around to eat people who dont do what i tell them castillo said why didnt you dave i thought it would be better to let him think the gulfstream was a charter castillo considered that a moment good thinking you were right and i was wrong he said and he bought that yung nodded but after that i wondered if he was going to wonder why i had sent the pilots of a chartered aircraft out to my apartment and not to a hotel and you think he will i dont know but its too late to do anything about it even if he actually comes looking for them its not a problem munz said while you were telling the manager about your seizure problem jake gave them his credit card for this room its in his name seizure problem howell asked dont ask yung said it will make you question the sanity of our leader i asked how it went castillo said i dont think theres a problem howell said so howd you make out with ordonez we get to use the estanciadave told you whats going down howell nodded ordonez gets the choppers when were through with them but and this is important he gets themwhat did he sayas a sugar pill to accompany the bitter one he has to swallow of helping us to help duffy in something thats none of his business in other words it wasnt a bribe howell nodded so what happens now he asked how are you planning to go to the estancia dave castillo said my car is fixed i really cant believe it the last time i saw it it was full of doubleaught buckshot holes okay that means you can take the radio with you colinll need communication but not a communicator right butler leverette replied with a thumbsup gesture i dont see any need for you to drive all the way out there and then back do you bob howell shook his head ordonez is going to chopper us to the international bridge atwhats the name of that place alfredo gualeguaychu munz furnished making it sound like wallywhachew where someoneone of uswill meet us and drive us into buenos aires not to the safe house im going to the four seasons where i will entertain comandante duffy at breakfast but on the way towherever the international bridge is gualeguaychu munz repeated how do you spell it munz spelled gualeguaychu no wonder i cant pronounce it castillo said on the way to wallywhachew im going to suggest to ordonez that he go home by way of the estancia a couple of words from him to the local cops who are sitting on the place will make colins job easier and get them accustomed to helicopters dropping in unannounced yung nodded you seem to be in pretty good spirits charley compared to this morning you mean yung nodded this morning after meeting with the evil leprechaun i thought this operation had no chance at all of succeeding now i think the odds are one in say eight or ten that we can carry it off thats a hell of an improvement wouldnt you say xi one presidente de la rua suite the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina september fuck it castillo said more or less to himself we can either carry this off or we cant and i dont think the evil leprechaun would be dazzled by uniforms yours or mine or both of ours so its civvies pegleg go change back wrapped in a plush anklelength terrycloth robe with the four seasons logo embroidered on the chest castillo was in the large sitting room standing by the plateglass windows that offered a view of the retiro railway station and at a distance the river plate first lieutenant eddie lorimer wearing a class a uniform complete to green beret and ribbon decorationsand there was an impressive display of ribbonsstood between castillo and the others in the room the latter seated on couches and chairs and at the dining table edgar delchamps reclined in one of the armchairs with his legs stretched straight before him cleared his throat for what its worth ace he began i agree with you but that leaves unanswered the question of how do we dazzle the bastard looking at the beautiful mrs sieno just now i realized how castillo said and gestured at susanna sieno who was sitting at the dining table her husband was on one of the couches seated beside tony santini why do i think im not going to like this susanna sieno asked females are masters of deception castillo said theyre born with the ability which is why they run the world mrs sieno gave lieutenant colonel castillo an unladylike gesture extending her center finger from her balled fist in an upward motion castillo gestured dramatically toward her exactly right there the lady proves my point complete control and how do they do that they wing it thats how and thats what were going to do when there was no response save for several raised eyebrows castillo went on think about it lady and gentlemen what we have in here are spooks cops soldiers and of course a marine he smiled at corporal lester bradley usmc who was sitting at a small desk on which sat an afc corporation communications console bradley wore a dark gray brooks brothers suitone of two identical garments the first suits he had ever owned dick miller told castillo that he had taken lester to brooks brothers in washington as a morale booster after the secret service agents at the house kept treating him like an errand boy max lying at bradleys feet had one paw on his highly polished black leather loafers due to the peso exchange rate bradley had acquired them for next to nothingthirty bucks us hed told castillo for what wouldve run me more than a hundred back homeat one of the luxury leathergoods stores in downtown buenos aires none of us are actors castillo went on in explanation and even if we were we dont have time before comandante duffy shows up to write a script and memorize our lines and even if we did that sure as god made little apples wed either forget them or blow them trying to deliver them and it would look rehearsed sowell wing it there was some nodding of understanding around the room what we should do i think castillo then said is make sure were all on the same page so herewith a recap weve got the helicopters as far as estancia shangrila presuming of course theres no tropical storm off montevideo to keep them from flying and the navy doesnt push them over the side or sail too far from the coast to cover their buttocks one of the reasons ordonez came through for us on that is because duffy lied to him i dont know about what but he lied to ordonez and that pissed ordonez off right alfredo el coronel alfredo munz who was sitting in the armchair facing delchamps with his legs also stretched out nodded castillo continued we should keep duffys lying in mind then the question of what to do with the choppershow to get them near asuncion how to refuel them en route etceteracomes up we need duffy to do all those things for us plus of course reassure any authorities who might spot the choppers that argentina is not being invaded by the gringos then we get to the snatchandgrab itself we need duffy not only to help but to do it our way i want this op to go down as quietly as possible which means im going to have to dissuade him from leaving bodies all over the place ill figure out how to do that later right now getting him under control is the thing he paused i cant think of anything else anyone he looked around the room to see if someone had a better idea no one did okay then castillo said edgar how about you sitting out the confrontation in my bedroom what im thinking is that if weve done something stupid and are about to blow it you can come in that would surprise duffy take his mind off what we did wrong and if you pick up on how we screwed up youll probably have a fix delchamps nodded his agreement okay eddie and i will go change clothes while were gone alfredo will you check on the aero commander we may not need it if we screw this up but if we dont the sooner we get to bariloche the better itll be waiting for us at jorge newbery karl munz said the owner owes me several large favors susanna if you realize were screwing up you might consider flashing some thigh at him susanna smiled shook her head and gave him the finger again the door chime bonged discreetly fifteen minutes later castillo now wearing a business suit and sitting on the couch as he sipped at a cup of coffee signaled first with his right index finger for eddie lorimer to open the door and then his eyebrows raised signaled to all by holding up his right hand with the index and middle fingers crossed everyone in the large sitting room took his meaning hope like hell we get away with this lorimer pulled the door open comandante liam duffy of the gendarmeria nacional in civilian clothing looked somewhat disapprovingly at lorimer and then at the others in the room tony santini and manuel delia were sitting at the dining table on which a room service waiter was arranging tableware around chromedomecovered plates alfredo munz was standing at the plateglass windows drinking a cup of coffee well good morning comandante castillo called cheerfully youre just in time for breakfast he pointed at the dining table duffy who did not look at all pleased with what he saw ignored castillo eyed max warily looked curiously at the others then crossed the room to munz so alfredo duffy said stiffly and went through the hugandkiss rite munz did not respond with anything close to warmth liam he said simply so whats going on alfredo who are these people right now comandante castillo replied for him you dont have to know that i thought you understood that if we are to work together i am to know everything duffy said castillo didnt immediately reply insteadwith a grunthe pushed himself off the couch and walked to the dining table he sat down and waved for duffy to take a seat ive had my breakfast duffy said curtly well have a little more castillo said as my muchloved abuela is always saying breakfast is the most important meal of the day it gives you the strength to attack the days problems i asked who these people are duffy said maybe we can get to that a little later castillo said i want to know who they are and what theyre doing here duffy said his voice rising or castillo asked quietly or what duffy responded i didnt detect some sort of a threat in that request did i i really dont like to be threatened whats going on here colonel well everybody but you is having their breakfast you remember our conversation yesterday morning i presume yes of course actually ive given it a lot of thought the twentyfour hours i gave you to leave the country unless your superiors authorize you to place yourself under my orders is about over colonel and i am not amused by thisthis whatever it is oh come on duffy castillo said you didnt really think that little act of yours was going to work did you he looked up at duffy youre sure you dont want to sit down and have some of these scrambled eggs they put little chopped up pieces of ham in them delicious coronel munz you had best advise your yankee friend that im serious so is colonel castillo serious comandante munz said actually duffy im more of a texican than a yankee castillo said wouldnt you agree manuel i would say thats so colonel delia said duffy glared at delia as if trying to identify his accent and then looked at castillo on the telephone you said that you had contacted your superiors and what i actually said castillo interrupted was ive been in touch with washington and then i suggested we have breakfast and you agreed but then you come and say youve already had yours all right enough duffy said i am a man of my word colonel i will not have you arrested if you leave the country by midnight tonight he walked to the door at midnight tonight ill be somewhere in patagonia castillo said when i know in which hotel the llao llao colonel munz furnished confirmation came when you were in the bathroom what an odd name castillo said the hotel llao llao then in san carlos de bariloche i dont think we have our room numbers yet but im sure the management will be able to tell you where we are when your people come to arrest us duffy turned and looked at him in disbelief and anger duffy youre not going to have me or anyone else arrested and we both know that castillo said unpleasantly im not duffy flared you are under arrest for possession and use of an unauthorized radio transmitter you dont give up do you castillo said tell him about the radio tony just to make sure comandante santini said i checked with the communications ministry they tell me that a radio telephone such as that is perfectly legal well see about that at the police station duffy said you may also consider yourself under arrest senor santini forced back a grin theres a small problem with that comandante santini said straightfaced ive got one of these things he waved a small plastic carnet im an assistant legal attache at the us embassy you have no authority to arrest me when duffy didnt reply santini went on i also called the foreign ministry and told them that we were registering nuestra pequena casa at the mayerling country club in pilar as the official residence of el senor la senora sieno which of courseas they also enjoy diplomatic statusgives the house and grounds diplomatic status and makes it inviolate to search duffy looked at castillo you sonofabitch duffy said ill tell you this one time duffy castillo replied coldly you can call me just about anything you want but a sonofabitch if you ever call me a sonofabitch again ill break both of your arms duffy shook his head in disbelief alfredo this man is crazy he said he has threatened violencebefore witnesses you if no one elseagainst a comandante of the gendarmeria nacional i didnt hear any threats liam munz said but if you ever hear one pay attention the colonel doesnt make them idly duffy castillo announced then realized that all of duffys attentionconfused or outraged or bothwas focused on munz duffy he repeated more forcefully duffy finally looked at him are you going to continue with this nonsense castillo went on or shall we start all over again after a very long moment duffy asked what do you mean start all over again well i say good morning comandante youre just in time for breakfast and then you say how nice im starved and then you come and shake my hand and sit down and we have our breakfast and we start talking about how we can help each other you want to try that duffy or do you want to cut your nose off to spite your face they stared at each other for a long moment good morning comandante castillo said youre just in time for breakfast i will listen to what you have to say duffy said finally well thats not exactly what i hoped to hear you say castillo said but its a start and im willing to bend a little he waved duffy into a chair and offered him a plate of scrambled eggs and ham when duffy shook his head castillo passed the plate to delia then castillo put several spoonfuls of the egg and ham onto another plate there was a basket of hardcrusted baguettes castillo took one broke off a piece of the bread then forked egg onto that he generously applied salt and pepper shook several drops of tabasco on it then popped the openfaced sandwich into his mouth and chewed appreciatively por favor mi coronel delia asked as he motioned with his hand for the bottle of hot sauce castillo passed the tabasco to him delia then made a little sandwich much like castillos except that delia was far more liberal with the application of tabasco when he had it in his mouth his face showed his satisfaction with his efforts he handed the tabasco back to castillo as castillo finished constructing another little egg sandwich when he had that one in his mouth he passed the tabasco to duffy who had been watching impatiently but who took the bottle as a reflex action id be careful with that castillo said they make it in louisiana and some men find it a little too spicy duffy rose to the challenge after he made himself a chopped ham and scrambled egg openfaced sandwich he began to liberally polkadot it with tabasco be careful munz warned duffy popped the little sandwich in his mouth he chewed and smiledbut then his lips contorted and his face broke out in a sweat la puta madre he exclaimed spitting out the sandwich into a napkin i told you to be careful and so did alfredo castillo said smiling and shaking his head sympathetically duffy ignored that what is it you wish to say colonel he said impatiently after taking a sip of water you said we should start talking about how we can help each other as castillo began making himself another sandwich he said pegleg why dont you tell comandante duffy what you told us about where you think these people are holding special agent timmons and the problems of extracting him pegleg duffy said without thinking show the comandante your leg pegleg castillo ordered yes sir lorimer said and hoisted his trouser leg the knee is fully articulated he said and its titanium so light i hardly know its on there then without breaking his cadence he went on theyre more than likely holding timmons at a remote farm most likely in paraguay but possibly in argentina another possibility is that hes being held on a watercraft of some sort on the rio paraguay wherever it is then you dont know where hes being held i gather duffy interrupted sarcastically not yet castillo answered for lorimer let him finish comandante wherever timmons is being held it will be difficult to approach without being detected the moment they suspect that there will be visitors they will take timmons into the bush or put him in a small boat and hide it along the shore of the river a variation of this scenarioa likely one because of their changed modus operandiis that theyve got timmons at a plant where they refine the paste into cocaine hydrochloride that sort of place would also be difficult to approach without detection difficult impossible duffy snorted as it will almost certainly be approachable over only one road in this latter scenario furthermore there would probably be additional betterarmed and moreskilled guards better communication and a generator or generators to provide the electricity necessary for the refining operation in case the local power grid goes down the availability of electricity would probably allow them to have motionsensing and other intrusiondetecting devices may i ask a question colonel duffy said castillo gestured that he could duffy looked at lorimer and said where did you acquire this information senor i didnt get your name i didnt give it lorimer said he looked at castillo and when castillo just perceptibly nodded lorimer went on special agent timmons and i were close in asuncion we talked i was not aware that you were friends duffy said so were we if thats so castillo put in then perhaps you might consider devoting more of your effort to the problem of getting timmons and your two men back instead of planning for the massacre of those who took them duffy gave him a dirty look but didnt respond directly how would you deal with the problems you see he asked lorimer starting with locating precisely where timmons and my men are presuming theyre together castillo answered for him were working on that as we speak ill let that pass for the moment duffy said to castillo then turned back to lorimer how would you go about rescuing timmons and my men lorimer looked to castillo again for permission castillo nodded and lorimer replied a simple helicopter assault operation like the one staged at estancia shangrila duffy said more than a little sarcastically not quite castillo said shangrila was supposed to be a passenger pickup not an assault we were really surprised when those people shot at us well go into this one expecting resistance and act accordingly how many helicopters do you think you can borrow from pevsner colonel how many does he have enough for even a simple helicopter assault operation excuse me isnt that why youre going to bariloche duffy asked almost triumphantly to borrow a helicopter again from that russian criminal aleksandr pevsner no thats not why im going to bariloche not that that is any of your business the helicopters involved in this operation will begin to arrive somewhere around midnight on the eighteenth of september in one week plus one day plus however many hours between now and midnight this is tentative i havent had much time to plan and frankly i need your help with the planning castillo noticed that that got duffys attention between now and thenthis is where you come in comandantewe are going to have to set up refueling stations for the helos a landing field between where i plan to initially land the aircraftwhich is on the playing fields of the polo association in pilarand then somewhere near asuncion the landing field will need to be big enough for a jp fuel cache for each helo every three hundred kilometers and be an isolated field of course and we need a base of operations in argentina also isolated where we can conceal the helicopters from anyone flying over and from which we can operate into paraguay duffy considered all of this a moment how many helicopters will you have four at least and you think youll be able to fly four us army helicopters across a thousandfifteen hundredkilometers of argentina and get away with it undetected us army helicopters no but i dont think one or two argentine army helicopters flying anywhereacross the pampas or up the rio de la plata or the rio paraguayare going to attract attention from anybody your helicopters will be painted like ours duffy replied is that what youre saying castillo nodded and thought now i really have his attention i just have to sink the hook except maybe other argentine army helicopters duffy pursued their pilots might say i wonder who that is mine will be flying nap of the earth very low i know what nap of the earth means duffy protested and will have radar on board which will permit my pilots to take evasive action should they detect any other aircraft in the vicinity like a sudden turn of course which will take them right over an airfield or a city theyre equipped with satellite navigation systems to keep that from happening castillo said and the pilots do this sort of thing for a living you seem very sure of yourself colonel this is what i do for a living comandante castillo said evenly now would you like to hear our very preliminary plans for the actual assault i really need your input on this duffy nodded without hesitation got him castillo glanced at munz who nodded just perceptibly castillo then motioned at delia this is captain delia comandante castillo said he will be in charge of the actual assault duffy offered his hand mucho gusto mi comandante delia said then glanced at castillo with your permission mi coronel go ahead castillo said generally speaking delia began as i understand we not only intend to rescue our men but plan to take prisonersand if we determine our people are being held at a refinery or transfer point to either seize or destroy both the drugs and the plant itself you are an argentine capitan duffy interrupted no but thank you mi comandante for your error i have worked hard on the porteno accent well you could have fooled me duffy said we all fooled you duffy castillo thought and thank god for that i dont know what the hell i would have done if you had stormed out of here in a rage right after you came in if i may continue delia asked politely then went on if we are to take prisoners and seize drugs etcetera the fact that lieutenant lorimer has told us these places are accessible only by one road works in our favor duffys face was expressionless if theres only one way in delia explained theres only one way out duffy nodded knowingly thats where your men will come in comandante delia continued at the moment the assault beginswe call that boots on the groundthe road will have to be cut not a moment before which would alert them nor a moment after as it has been my experience that an amazing number of rats can get through even a very small hole in a very short period of time when they are frightened and we intend to do our very best to badly frighten them duffy again nodded his understanding castillo looked at munz who very discreetly gave him a thumbsup signal castillo smiled at him but thought why am i waiting for the other shoe to drop two above san carlos de bariloche rio negro province argentina september there it is alfredo munz said pointing castillo in the pilot seat of the aero commander looked where munz was pointing out the copilot side window then banked the highwinged airplane to the right so that he could get a better view below darkness was rising but there was still enough light to see a redtileroofed collection of buildingsthe llao llao resort hotelsitting on a mountainside sticking into and several hundred feet above the startling blue waters of a lake lakes castillo corrected himself lake moreno and lake nahuel huapi well it looks like we cheated death again the airport is only twentysix clicks from here and im only half kidding he straightened the wings then put his hand palm upward over his shoulder let me have the magic black box navigator he said corporal lester bradley very carefully laid a small laptop computer in his hand and castillo very carefully lowered it into his lap he was navigating using a prototype afc global positioning system device connected to the laptop aloysius francis casey himself had warned him that it was a prototype its database incomplete and he really shouldnt rely on it itll take me three four days to come up with a good data chip for argentina and that part of the world charley casey had told him in las vegas you got somebody down there i can fedex it to since aloysius francis casey was a man of his word presumably the data chip was on its wayor shortly would beto mr anthony santini assistant legal attache embassy of the united states of america colombia buenos aires argentina but the bottom line was that it hadnt arrived still what castillo hadthe prototypelooked a helluva lot better to him than the navigation system hed found in the cockpit of the aero commander when theyd gone to jorge newbery there had been a bigger problem than aged avionics when they first went to get the airplane at jorge newbery the commanders owner had presumed that when munz had told him he needed to borrow the aircraft munz had meant using the owners pilot and he had shown up with his pilot in tow ordinarily castillo was a devout believer in the aviators adage there are old pilots and there are bold pilots but there are very few old bold pilots and accordingly he really would have preferred a pilot experienced in a flying his own aero commander and b flying it around argentina particularly since castillo himself had not flown an aero commander for a long time but the unspoken problem was that after bariloche castillo planned on going on to asuncionand intended en route to take the opportunity to make what the us army called a lowlevel visual reconnaissance of the area for some wild reason castillo believed that a the owner would not be too fond of such an activity and b even if the owner gave his blessing the pilot would not be experienced in such lowlevel visual reconnaissance techniques after considerable discussion the aero commanders owner had apparently decided that the several large favors he owed to el coronel munz outweighed his enormous reluctance to turn over his airplane to some gringo friend of munz even if that gringo sounded almost like a porteno the owners agreement had come with a caveat that the owners pilot take the gringo friend for a couple of touchandgoes what was tactfully explained as being helpful to familiarize one with the aircraft and what that familiarization flight had done was convince castillo that while the airplane was obviously scrupulously maintained most of its navigation equipment had been in its control panel when the aircraft was first deliveredsome fortyodd years earlier clearly none of it was going to be as reliable as what aloysius francis casey had given castillo in the form of a prototype laptop computer and was worried about his using all of this had taken time of course and it was quarter to one before castillo finally managed to get colonel munz lieutenant lorimer sergeant mullroney corporal bradley and max aboard and could take off on what he announced to the jorge newbery tower as a local area flight visual flight rules destination private field near pilar as castillo retracted the landing gear he suddenly remembered that another us army lieutenant colonelthe most decorated soldier of world war ii audie murphy who later became a movie starhad been flying in an identical aero commander in when its wing came off in a thunderstorm over roanoke virginia murphy also a skilled aviator crashed to his death right on the money alfredo castillo said pointing to the gps satellite map on the laptop screen the airports twentyodd clicks thataway pevsners place is on the other side of the lakemoreno munz replied and pointed again i dont see how we can get over there tonight itll be dark by the time we get to the hotel youll think of something alfredo you always do then he reached for the radio microphone to call the bariloche tower three the llao llao resort hotel san carlos de bariloche rio negro province argentina september the general manager of the llao llao was about as unenthusiastic with the notion of providing accommodations to max as the owner of the aero commander had been about turning his airplane over to a rich gringo but as castillo holding maxs leash in one hand and his briefcase in his other watched munz discussing this with him he knew that munz was going to prevail and at the precise moment castillo reached this conclusion the problem of how to meet aleksandr pevsner at his home across the lake now that it was darkreally dark there was no moonsolved itself mama a young female voice said enthusiastically in russian look at that dog stay away from him a mothers voice warned castillo turned twenty or thirty feet down the wide highceilinged thickly carpeted lobby there stood a tall darkhaired welldressed man in his late thirties with him was a striking blond womanmamaand a girl of thirteen or fourteen whose own blond hair hung down her back nearly to her waistmy god elenas about as old as randyand two boys one about age six and the other maybe ten behind them stood two burly men one of them castillo knew but only by his first name janos he was pevsners primary bodyguard and janos knew him even if there was no sign of recognition on his face proof of that came when the other burly man put his hand under his suit jacketand got a sharp elbow in the abdomen followed by the slashing motion of janoss hand its all right anna castillo said to the mother in russian max only eats the fathers of pretty girls named elena simultaneously janos and aleksandr pevsner said its all right pevsner looked at castillo and added i thought i saw youi even asked janosbut we decided no what would my friends charley and alfredo be doing in patagonia with a dog the size of a horse can i pet him elena asked does he speak russian he speaks dog elena castillo said but he understands russian she giggled and went to max who sat down and offered his paw she scratched his ears and when he licked her face she put her arms around his neck so what are my friends charley and alfredo doing in patagonia with a dog the size of a horse pevsner asked would you believe we came to see the fossilized dinosaur bones castillo said knowing that you never lie to me i would have to how about we heard you would be here and decided to buy you dinner it would be a strain but i would have to believe that too we need to talk alek castillo said that i believe thats what i was afraid of pevsner said all right tomorrow morning ill send the boat for you at say half past nine how about tonight castillo said im really pressed for time pevsner obviously didnt like that but after a moment he said we came for dinner we could talk about what you want to talk about after dinner if you like that would be fine castillo said thank you and youll be my guests at dinner of course thats not what i meant as i suspect you know full well friend charley but faced with the choice between the long face of elena over dinnerhaving been separated from her newfound friendor breaking bread with you i opt for the less painful of the two alek his wife protested its all right anna castillo said what are friends for if not to insult im afraid that after dinner i will learn what you really think friends are for pevsner said shall we go in he gestured toward the dining room elena the dog goes with the understanding he does not get fed from the table understood yes poppa i dont think theyll let him in there alek castillo said this isnt budapest yes i know pevsner said in patagonia you have to have a substantial financial interest in the hotel if you want to bring a dog into the dining room castillo smiled and shook his head the maitre dhotel appeared clutching menus to his chest these gentlemen pevsner ordered indicating castillo and munz will be dining with us their friendshe pointed to lorimer mullroney and bradleywill dine with mine his spanish was good even fluent but heavily russianaccented bradley castillo ordered go to your room and see if i have any telephone calls if its important tell me otherwise just come down here and have your dinner aye aye sir bradley said a waiter arrived with a tray of champagne glasses almost as soon as the headwaiter had laid their menus before them two of the glasses held a bubbling brown liquid that castillo decided was cocacola for sergei and aleksandr he was surprised when elena was offered and accepted one of the champagne stems i dont need champagne if im going to be flying ill just take a sip when we get to the inevitable toast that came almost immediately pevsner got half out of his chair picked up his glass and reached out with it to touch castillos to dear and trusted friends pevsner said and then moved his glass to tap the rims of the others including his daughters when that was over pevsner just about emptied his glass elena didnt do that but she took a healthy ladylike sip they let her drink maybe she is older than randy when were you born honey castillo asked her sixteen november by the western calendar elena said jesus christ she is almost exactly as old as randy thirteen and her drinking champagne shocks you pevsner said do you always think the worst of people alek castillo asked and then he turned to elena and his mouth went onto autopilot what i was thinking honey is that youre just about the same age as my son jesus christ i just said my son out loud for the first time i didnt know you had a family charley anna said you never said anything castillo was aware of munzs eyes on him i have a grandmother a cousin who is more of a brother and his family and a sonrandywho was also born in november of he lives with his mother and her husband you dont get to see him elena asked sympathetically i saw him just a few days ago castillo said i gave him flying lessons as we flew over the gulf coast looking at the damage hurricane katrina had done was it as terrible as we saw on television anna asked if anything worse unbelievable have you got a picture elena asked youre interested she nodded in my son or the hurricane damage she giggled and blushed both she said castillo reached under his chair and picked up his soft leather briefcase whats that pevsner asked my american express card i never leave home without it pevsner exhaled audibly smiled and shook his head castillo took out the envelope of photographs that sergeant neidermeyer had made for him and handed it to elena show these to your father and mother when youre finished castillo said hes beautiful charley pevsner said some moments later his eyes are just like yours so much for the question does abuela know boys are handsome alek castillo said then glanced at elena girls are beautiful she smiled as she flipped to another photo my boys are beautiful pevsner said and so is yours the waiter approached excused his interruption and said a cocktail before dinner ginger ale for the children pevsner ordered very dry vodka martinis with onions for my wife and myself alfredo i would like scotch munz said singlemalt famous grouse the waiter nodded and looked at castillo nothing for me thanks im driving have one friend charley pevsner said i never trust a man who doesnt drink when i do you never trust a man period castillo said what the hell ill just get off the ground in the morning a little later ill have what hes having he said to the waiter except hold the vegetables and vermouth four corporal lester bradley appeared at their table about the same time as the appetizers of prosciutto crudo with melon and pate de foie gras major miller would like to speak to you sir bradley announced he said its really important i knew i shouldnt have had that martini excuse me please castillo said and stood ill try to cut this as short as possible cmon max he signaled for bradley to lead the way castillo and max followed him down the lobby to an elevator which took them up to the second floor then down a corridor almost to the end bradley unlocked a hotel room door waved them ahead of him and then followed them inside the control console was nowhere in sight but castillo saw a directv dish fastened to the railing of the small balcony and remembered that there was a repeater mounted in the antenna no cable was required bradley took the control console from the shelf of a small closet and put it on a small table barely large enough to hold it for a fivestar hotel this room is pretty damn small he looked around the room and saw that the only furniture beside the bed and tiny table was a small chest of drawers and a small upholstered armchair the chair was across the room from the table with the control console now sitting on it will that work in my room without moving the antenna lester this rooms pretty small this is your room sir bradley replied mine is even smaller a moment later bradley announced were up sir and handed castillo what looked very much like an ordinary wireless telephone handset why dont you sit sir bradley asked nodding at the armchair when castillo settled in the armchair he learned that it was not only small but also uncomfortably close to the ground his head was now as far off the ground as maxs which max interpreted to mean castillo wanted to be kissed which he did is this damn place designed for dwarfs castillo looked at the handset the afc logo was discreetly molded into the plastic he also saw that there was a thin soft black cushion on the earpiece not for comfort thats to muffle the incoming voice bradley wont be able to hear what millers saying but needs to put it on speaker les castillo said as he put the handset to his ear aye aye sir bradley said and when he had pushed the appropriate button went to the corridor wall and leaned on it it was either that or sit on my bed hello castillo said into the handset where the hell have you been charley major richard miller announced ive been trying to raise you for two hours whats up castillo replied and then hurriedly added are we secure according to my indicators we are okay so whats so important now youve got me worried charley i therefore will talk in tongues four of the birds managed to land where they were going without sinking it the reason i know thisoh to hell with it i think this may damned well be blown anyway what may be damned well blown the reason i know theyre on the carrier is because a bluesuita commandershowed up here to personally deliver to you an info copy of an urgent from the captain to the cno it took me five minutes to get the bastard to give it to me what did it say there was a rattling at the door to the hotel room and it suddenly swung open what the hell castillo said and then hold one dick castillo saw that the manager of the hotel was holding the door open for pevsner and janos i dont recall inviting you up here castillo said angrily in russian we have to talk friend charley pevsner said matteroffactly also in russian it wont wait until after dinner pevsner shook his head thanked the manager in spanish then closed the door on him he turned to castillo and switching back to russian asked do you have a weapon no but bradley does castillo said and pointed at corporal bradley bradley held his ma pistol in both hands its hammer back and the muzzle aimed at the floor at janoss and pesvners feet he didnt understand a word of the russian but he saw the look on my face and hes taking no chances neither is max hes on his feet and inching toward pevsner and janos thats the pistol janos castillo said almost conversationally that bradley used to take down colonel komogorov in the hotel garage in pilar after komogorov put a bullet in you we mean you no harm friend charley pevsner said for some reason i dont think that tone of anguish is phony put it away lester castillo ordered in english he switched to hungariandown maxand then to russian people who come barging into my room are likely to get shot you might want to write that down alek we came to make sure you had a gun in order to do just that pevsner said janos give it him janosvery carefully using his thumb and index fingertook what looked like a model colt pistol from his jackets inside pocket and handed it to castillo thats an argentine copy of your pevsner said almost identical a ballester molina stolen im told from the argentine army ten years ago in almost a pavlovian act castillo ejected the magazine and worked the pistols slide a cartridge flew through the air and landed on the bed castillo picked it up put it in the magazine then put the magazine back in the pistol and dropped the hammer what the hell is going on there charley major richard millers voice demanded over the speaker circuit turn the speaker off lester castillo ordered and picked up the handset pevsner looked as if he was going to leave the room oh what the hell stay alek castillo said hell be able to hear only one side of the conversation and he already knows i work for the president castillo spoke into the handset excuse the interruption richard the maid wanted to turn down the bed you were saying i was about to read the message the bluesuit didnt want to give me please do skipping the address crap at the top pursuant to verbal order issued by depsecnav to undersigned in telecon september four us army hud rotarywing aircraft were permitted to land aboard uss ronald reagan at september senior officer among them who states he is a us army major but declines to further identify himself with identity card or similar document also has refused to inform the undersigned of the nature of his mission stating it is classified top secret presidential and neither the undersigned nor radm jacoby usn the task force commander is authorized access to such information good for him castillo said it gets better miller replied us army major was denied permission by undersigned to communicate with us army ltcol costello of dept of homeland security using a nonstandard satellite radio he brought aboard he said ltcol costello could quote clarify unquote the situation he refused use of reagans communication services stating he could not be sure of their encryption capabilities us army major has also refused inspection of cargo aboard helicopters again citing classification of top secret presidential and again good for him castillo said who screwed up and didnt clue the navy in on whats happening im not finished miller said get this helicopters and their crews are presently on flight deck in what amounts to a standoff between members of my crew and the army personnel oh shit castillo said continuing right along miller replied further action was not taken because the us army personnel are obviously american and they pose no threat to uss ronald reagan that cannot be dealt with urgently and respectfully request clarification of this situation and existing orders it is suggested that contacting ltcol costello only might be useful thats why the bluesuit didnt even want to give me this jesus christ castillo said and we conclude with uss ronald reagan proceeding the signature is kenton captain usn captain uss ronald reagan and below that it says rear admiral k g jacoby usn concurs what did montvale have to say thats why i called you charley i cant get through to montvale what do you mean you cant get through to him your buddy truman ellsworth who answers his line says hes not available he does castillo said coldly get me the white house switchboard he saw pevsners eyes light up when he heard white house miller said before you charge off in righteous indignation would you be interested in hearing my probably somewhat paranoid assessment of the situation as long as it doesnt take longer than sixty seconds what happened i submit is that general mcnab went to the secretary of defense and told him he had to move the hueys down there black under the authority of the presidential finding so far so good as the secretary of defense knows about the finding and that hes being told not asked so the secretary of defense got on the horn to the secretary of the navy and told him to do it he paused i dont know if the secretary of the navy knows about the finding do you no okay miller said i dont think he does but it doesnt really matter im pretty sure that the deputy secretary of the navy doesnt agree he probably doesnt the urgent says the bluesuit captain got his orders to land the hueys on his ship from the deputy on the phone i think its very reasonable to assume the bluesuit captain asked the deputy what the hell was going on and the deputy couldnt tell him because he didnt know any more than he was told which was essentially just do it explanation to follow okay castillo agreed which causes the bluesuit captain to shift into covermyass mode so he goes and tells the admiral who is in charge of the whole carrier group which causes the admiral not only to be pissed because hes the admiral and the deputy should have called him not the captain but also causes him to shift into his covermyass mode probably castillo agreed so the admiral says theres nothing we can really do except wait for the army choppers to land whoevers in charge of them probably will explain whats going on and based on that we can decide how to best protect our beloved navy from the fucking army and then the birds land on the carrier and good ol major bob ward in the sacred traditions of the th aint gonna tell nobody nothingor show anybody anything not even a bluesuit with starswithout permission from the guy running the operation one c g castillo he is willing to get this permission providing they let him set up his nonstandard radio whichfor reasons i dont know they were in their covermyass mode which may explain itthey were unwilling to do so theres the standoff and why they sent the urgent very credible castillo said but whats it got to do with ellsworth not letting you talk to montvale let me finish miller said montvale knew you were worried about the navy giving us trouble because jake torine called him right so and montvale is going to get jake on the carrier to make sure theres no trouble caused by the aforementioned impetuous light colonel castillo right so again so if you were montvale and had nsa at fort meade in your pocket and wanted to stay on top of the situation wouldnt you task nsa to look forsearch filter army choppers on navy ships any referenceand immediately give him any and all intercepts of course you would and ill bet that sonofabitch had the urgent before i did where are you going with this dick castillo asked i think i know he thought but id like confirmation montvale doesnt give a damn whether or not you get timmons back charley we both heard him say as much he wants to protect the president ill give him that much and he thinks your operation is going to blow up in everybodys face including the presidents and truman ellsworth for sure and probably montvale would love to see you fuck up and embarrass the president which would happen if you cant run the snatchandgrab successfully which you cant without the choppers thats why he was so helpful in arranging to get jake onto the gipper montvale not you would have sent him that means jake works for montvale which cuts you out of the picture then and you know the sonofabitch is good at this he whispers in the admirals ear that no serious harm would be done if something happened to keep him from launching the choppers and an embarrassingtothenavy situation might well be avoided sonofabitch and he knows youre out of touch and he knows that being the case when i got the urgent i would try to call him so he tells ellsworth that hes not available to me i think hes betting that i wouldnt call the president and if i did so what all that would mean was that the lunatics chief of staff is as loony as he is and if the president asked him what the hells going on montvale could pull the rug out from under youfor this operation and generally yeah except the lunatic found out and is perfectly willing to get on the horn to the president permission to speak sir miller said castillo sensed that miller was not being clever he had used the phrase a subordinate officer uses when his superior officer is about to do something the subordinate thinks is wrong granted sir how often do you think admiral jacoby gets phone calls from the white house switchboard it was a moment before castillo answered wheres torine now he asked forty minutes ago he was about to land at macdill as soon as we get off here contact him bring him up to speed on whats happened tell him montvale is not to know were onto him and to call me once hes on the gipper okay but whats happened i must have missed something stay on the line while i brighten admiral jacobys dull daily routine with a call from the white house white house the pleasant professional female voice answered what can i do for you colonel castillo i need rear admiral k g jacoby on a secure line hes aboard the uss ronald reagan which is somewhere between norfolk and key west there was a moments pause then the operator replied the difficult we do immediately sir the impossible takes a little longer ill have to go through the navy thatll take a little time can i call you when its set up can i stay on the line certainly navy white house we need a secure encrypted voice connection to the uss ronald reagan its in the atlantic some we know where she is thank you very much white house reagan navy establish secure encrypted voice connection hold one navy navy reagan this connection is encrypted class two reagan the white house is calling request upgraded encryption hold one navy navy reagan this connection is now encrypted class one white house navy you read reagan this is the white house were calling rear admiral k g jacoby white house reagan maam the admiral is in his cabin he has only class two encryption on that line it will take a minute to get him to the secure voice communication room well wait thank you radio voice commo room go we have admiral jacoby encryption status class one white house navy you read admiral jacoby speaking this is the white house please hold for colonel castillo go ahead colonel we have verified class one encryption yes sir we do good evening admiral my name is castillo yes sir sir im a lowly lieutenant colonel whats this all about colonel sir i am in receipt of your urgent referring to the army helicopters you now have aboard your message referred to me as costello sorry about that sir getting my name wrong apparently is not the only communications problem we are having is that so sir it was intended by the secretary of defense that you or captain kenton receive your orders regarding the helicopters from the secretary of the navy according to your urgent captain kenton spoke with the deputy secretary that is correct colonel frankly i wondered why the deputy secretary didnt call me sir i had nothing to do with that call but i am calling to do what i can to straighten out the mess let me begin by saying the helicopters are involved in an operation classified top secret presidential ive heard nothing of the kind colonel yes sir i understand but that being the case it is the reason the army officer in charge was unable to explain what hes doing or permit inspection of his helicopters unless im mistaken there is no one aboard the reagan with that security clearance excuse me colonel is there some way i can verify what youre telling me this is highly unusual yes sir it is may i suggest sir that you contact the secretary of defense or alternatively wait until colonel jacob torine usaf arrives on the reagan what did you say the director of national intelligence ambassador montvale as we speak is arranging for colonel torine who is my deputy to be put aboard the reagan your deputy you gave me to believe you are a lieutenant colonel i am sir and colonel torine is my deputy we have both been detached from our respective services sir for this duty and normal military protocol does not apply i will be damned i admit it often causes some confusion sir but as i was saying sir colonel torine will arrive on the reagan probably within a matter of hours and hell tell you what he can about what is being required of you in the meantime sir i would be grateful if you could do several things such as sir please permit the major to establish communication with us using the equipment he has with him that is so much simpler for us than going through the white house switchboard well i cant see any reason why that cant be done and admiral the sooner you have the helicopters moved to the hangar deck and the paint stripping started the better i dont know anything about any paint stripping colonel whats that all colonel torine will explain what has to be done sir when he comes aboard he paused crossed his fingers and went on sir with respect i suspect youre having trouble accepting all this may i ask sir that you immediately communicate with the secretary of defense to get his assurance there was a moments silence and then admiral jacoby said i think we can hold off colonel until your deputy comes aboard but in the meantime ill have the aircraft moved to the hangar deck and the paint stripping started yes sir thank you sir break it down white house admiral jacoby just had time to say shit before a hissing announced the connection was gone howd i do dick i think you ruined the admirals day he was about to ruin mine you know what to tell jake right he just took off from macdill thats next thanks a hell of a lot dick castillo said then signaled to lester to break the connection castillo looked at pevsner now that thats done you want to tell me about the pistol castillo said people are trying to kill you friend charley you mean right here and now or can we go finish our dinner we will talk after dinner pevsner said castillo picked up the argentine slipped it into the waistband at the small of his back and gestured for pevsner to precede him out of the room xii one the llao llao resort hotel san carlos de bariloche rio negro province argentina september they all crowded into the elevator and rode to the lobby floor when the door opened pevsner touched castillos arm and motioned everyone else out i need a moment with my friend charley he announced waving toward the dining room the rest of you go in everyone obeyed but max who simply sat down and looked to castillo for instructions the others made their way around him and when they all had left the car pevsner pushed one of the upperfloor buttons the door closed and the elevator started to rise pevsner somehow managed to stop the elevator as it ascended castillo wondered if an alarm bell was about to go off i dont want to scare anna and the children pevsner said so dont say anything at the table whats going on alek pevsner didnt respond directly i will arrange for your baggage to be taken to the boat he said you can spend the night at the house among other things thatll give us the opportunity to talk i cant get far from the communicator castillo said thinking aloud and the boy who operates it castillo nodded then said hes the communicator and hes young alek but dont think of him as a boy again pevsner didnt respond directly after a moment he said all right everybody goes thatll take a little longer to arrange he smiled thats probably better anyway a gun battle would disturb the guests theres a possibility of that pevsner nodded whats going on alek about an hour and a half ago pevsner said gellini called and said you were back in argentina gellini castillo wondered aloud then made the connection the side guy pevsner nodded the man who replaced alfredo when he was relieved he confirmed and who now works for you castillo asked pevsner seemed unable to answer that directly too he admires you friend charley the way you stood up for alfredo when he was relieved alfredo munz had been chief of side when j winslow masterson was murdered he had been retiredin fact firedin order to be the argentine governments scapegoat castillo who had found munz not only unusually competent and dedicated thought that the argentine governments action was inexcusable and had told his replacement coronel alejandro gellini so much in less than tactful terms alfredo was screwed alek and you know it i told gellini what i thought of it and him gellini could not protect alfredo from the foreign minister and neither could i but there was a silver lining to that cloud alfredo now works for you and gellini admires you and what did my admirer have to say besides telling you that i was back down here that people are trying to kill you a lot of people have been telling me that lately he didnt happen to say who this is serious business friend charley pevsner said smiling and shaking his head in exasperation gellini didnt happen to say who castillo asked again what is that word you use bounty gellini said there is a bounty on you i think he probably meant contract castillo said meaning whoever would whack me would get paid pevsner nodded what is a bounty a price the good guys put on the head of a bad guy castillo explained or on some bad guy who jumps bail who put out the contract on me gellini knows only that the gangsters know about the contract he didnt know who issued it it could be something the fsb has done in addition to their own plans for you but i dont know they usually like to do that sort of thing themselves whatre the fsbs plans for me what do you think friend charley first you took out the cuban vincenzo major vincenzo was shooting at me at the time and then komogorov of the fsb colonel komogorov was shooting at you at the time and i didnt take him out lester did pevsner shook his head in exasperation again as you well know when something like that happens what the fsb wants to hearwhat putin himself wants to hearis not some excuse or explanation they want confirmation that whoever has killed one of them has himself been killed i know an argentine cop who has much the same philosophy of life pevsner looked at him curiously i dont understand he said finally its too long a story to be told in an elevator it will have to wait until after dinner this time pevsner expressed his exasperation by exhaling audibly he pushed a button on the control panel and the elevator began to descend two the dinner was first class which did not surprise castillo but he was surprised at how hungry he was and how much he ate including all of an enormous slice of cheesecake topped with a strawberry sauce he thought was probably a hundred calories a spoonful afterward pevsner led the group back to the elevator bank and they filled both elevators this time the elevators went down and the doors opened on a corridor in the basement at the end of the corridor a door opened to the outside where a peugeot van and three menobviously armedwaited for them they climbed into the van and were driven maybe a kilometer to a wharf on the lakeshore this has to be lake moreno castillo decided munz said pevsners place is on the other side of the lakemoreno floodlights came on as they stepped onto the wharf castillo saw a cabin cruiser what looked like a thirtyfiveor fortyfoot bertram sportfisherman tied to the pier and had a mental image of the boat being hauled along some narrow provincial road on a trailer dazzling the natives there were no lights on the boat but as they approached the vessel he heard its exhaust burbling as soon as they were on the boat in the cockpit aft the floodlights on the pier went on and the cabin lights on the boat illuminated pevsner asked with a gesture whether castillo wanted to go into the cabin or up to the flying bridge castillo opted for the flying bridge despite the fact that the air was chilly these were the andes mountains and springtime would not come to argentina for several weeks but castilloperhaps as a reflex responsewanted to see what could be seen and began climbing the ladder fashioned of heavygauge aluminum tubing toward the flying bridge max barked his protest at not being able to follow him up the ladder elena appeared at the cabin door and called to him he looked to castillo for guidance go with elena castillo ordered and after a moments thought max walked into the cabin the man who had been with pevsner when castillo had first seen them was at the helm his hands on the controls as soon as pevsner was on the flying bridge the boat began to move set into the panel were radar and gps screens and the man used the latter to navigate meaning of course that hes pretty sure nothing is out there on the surface or below wrong i hear other engines a moment later as castillos eyes adjusted to the darkness he saw first the wake of a boat ahead of them and then the boat itself a twentyoddfoot inboard the three men who had been waiting for them outside the llao llao were in it the small inboard boat picked up speed and began to turn obviously intending to circle the sportfisherman nice boat alek castillo said raising his voice over the sound of wind and the rumble of twin diesels how did you get it here by truck pevsner replied the first try was a disaster they went off the road and turned over jesus castillo said sympathetically always look for the silver lining friend charley it took another month to get another boat from miamithis wouldnt fit in any of my airplanesbut i now have spare parts for everything but the hull twenty minutes later a light appeared almost dead ahead the radar screen showed something that had to be a pier extending into the lake from the shore the engines slowed a minute later floodlights on a pier came on and the inboard boat came out of the darkness and tied up a twin of the peugeot van at the llao llao was backed up onto the pier three minutes later they had tied up to the wharf and were in the van which started down the pier as soon as the vehicle reached the foot of the pier the floodlights went off it was a fiveminute drive along a steep curving gravel road and then they passed through a gate in a tenfoottall stone wall and came to a stop before an imposing house pevsner led them all inside anna and the boys and the girlelena who is almost exactly as old as my sonsaid a polite good night castillo looked around there was an enormous room off the entrance foyer a crystal chandelier hung from what was probably a thirtyfoothigh ceiling illuminating a wall on which hung probably fifty stuffed deer and stag heads on either side of a desk two stuffed snarling pumas faced each other this is familiar why do i recognize it the memory bank produced an image of a large fat jowly man standing at the entrance to the room dressed in lederhosen and a bavarian hat with a pheasant tail feather stuck in it and holding a bow and arrow ill be goddamned pevsner said in russian my people will take care of your bags friend charley does the boyyour communicatorhave to be present while we talk no but he has to be close castillo answered in russian and hell need some place to set up his radio will he require help castillo shook his head then lets go in there pevsner said pointing to the enormous room and taking castillos arm castillo switched to german and asked are you sure it will be all right with the reichsforst und jagermeister you are amazing pevsner said in russian how are you familiar with that with carinhall castillo continued to speak german my grandfather had a booka large leatherbound bookthat goring gave him when he was a guest i used to look at it when i was a kid your grandfather was a nazi he was an army officer who was badly wounded at stalingrad and evacuated just before it fell with billy kocian incidentally he told me goring used to receive busloads of wounded senior officers at the place and everyone got a book the first picture inside so help me god was of goring in lederhosen holding a bow and arrow but no to answer your question my grandfather was not a nazi my mother told mewhen she knew she was dying she said she thought i should knowthat he was on the sss list of those officers known to be associated with claus von stauffenberg in the bomb plot and they were looking for him until the end of the war what kind of a senior officer karl pevsner said now speaking german infantry detailed to intelligence he was a lieutenant colonel at stalingrad they promoted him to colonel while he was recuperating and now the german senior officers grandson is an american senior officer detailed to intelligence and the descendants of the ss now in the employ of the russians are looking for him in order to kill him blood really does run deep doesnt it friend charley castillo realized that pevsners observation made him uncomfortable and wondered why i think you mean history does repeat itself doesnt it castillo said then went on quickly before pevsner could reply i had a couple of days off one time in berlin and went to see carinhall its in brandenburg in the schorfheide forestwas there goring had the place blown up to keep the russians from getting it they did a good job the gates are still there but aside from that not much else is left a maid rolled a cart loaded with spirits and the necessary accoutrements into the room cutting off the conversation after she had positioned the cart she looked at pevsner that will be all thank you pevsner said and waited to continue speaking until she had left them alone would you have me serve you friend charley or wait on me please i find that flattering some of that famous grouse singlemalt will do nicely thank you very much pevsner shook his head and turned to making the drinks pevsner began the fellow who built this placei bought it from his grandsonwas german nothing much is known about him before he came hereand i have inquired and have had friends inquire there is no record of a heinrich schmidt having ever lived in dresden which is where his argentine document of national identity says he was born of course the records may have been destroyed when dresden was firebombed whats interesting is that there is no record of his having immigrated to argentina or having been issued a dni or of herr schmidt becoming an argentine citizen what i did learn was he bought this placeit was then four hundred sixteen hectares of forestlandand began construction of the house two months after it was alleged that a german submarine laden with cash and jewelry and gold had discharged its cargo near mar del plata and then scuttled itself at sea pevsner handed charley a glass held his own up and tapped rims to friends you can really trust friend charley amen brother may their tribe increase unlikely but a nice thought pevsner replied took a sip then went on such a submarine was found eighteen months ago off mar del plata incidentally probably just a coincidence i know that story there were three of them loaded with loot one was known to have been sunk in the english channel the second is known to have made it here i thought the third one just disappeared it did butfrom what i have learnedonly after it unloaded its cargo here in argentina anyway herr schmidt lived very quietlyone might say secretlyhere with his familya wife a daughter and a sonuntil his wife died then he passed on under argentine law property passes equally to children the sonno one seems to know where he got the cashbought out his sisters share and she went to live in buenos aires where she met and married an american and subsequently moved to the united states the son married an argentine and aside from shopping trips to buenos aires and santiago chilenever to europe which i found interestinglived here with his wife and their only sonthe fellow from whom i bought the placemuch as his father had done i understand that the fatherand later the sonwere silent partners in a number of business enterprises here when the son passed on the widow did not want to live here alone so she moved to buenos aires the property sat unused for some years until at her death it was finally put on the market and i bought it interestingly they reduced the asking price considerably on condition i pay cash more specifically in gold and that payment take place in the united arab emirates what are you suggesting alek that the guy who built this place was a nazi im suggesting nothing friend charley but i too noticed the architectural similarity to the reception hall at carinhall and went to some lengths to check that out between you and me friend charley if hermann goring walked in the front door he would think he was in carinhall i wouldnt be surprised if herr schmidt used the same architect for that matter the same drawings that led me to look into which business associates of goringnot party members or people like thathad gone missing during and after the war no luck in making a connection with herr schmidt what you are suggesting is that some nazi big shot did in fact get away with running off to here that has happened you know just a year or so ago they found that the owner of a hotel here in bariloche a man named pribke had been an ss officer deeply involved in the massacre at the ardeatine caves outside rome he was extradited to italy and actually friend charley there is an interesting legend that one of the founders of this area was an american from texas who was here because the authorities were looking for him at home butch cassidy the sundance kid castillo asked sarcastically pevsner shook his head they were in bolivia i didnt know you were such a history buff alek pevsner looked into castillos eyes for a long moment what i am friend charley is a man who would like to build a future for his children that would be unconnected with their fathers past i am more than a little jealous of herr schmidt castillo looked at him but didnt reply jesus christ hes serious wheres he going with this youre a father you will understand pevsner went on actually alek im having a hard time accepting that i am a father but yeah i understand i think so castillo said i never thoughti am a pragmatistthat i could do what herr schmidt did these are different times but i did think that i could perhaps do something like it did you see the godfather now what castillo nodded i thought i could do something like young michael corleone wanted to do go completely legitimate you remember that part castillo nodded again i reasoned that if i gave up the more profitable aspects of my businessesreally gave them upand maintained what you would call a low profile here i get the picture castillo interrupted not quite i dont think friend charley and i think its important that you do go ahead i have been using you since you came into my life sometimes successfully sometimes at a price you recall how we met herr gossinger on the cobenzl in vienna castillo said i thought you had stolen an airplane you came very close to dying that night friend charley when i heard that you wanted to interview me i thought i would send a message to the press that looking into my affairs was not acceptable and was indeed very dangerous i believe him but why is he bringing that up now but then howard found out that you were really an american intelligence officerkennedy was very good at what he did its sad he turned out to be so weak and greedyand you were using the name karl gossinger as a cover i found that interesting so i decided to meet you in person and when you suggested thati love this american phrasewe could scratch each others back i went along to see where that would go cutting to the chase castillo interrupted i would never have found that without you and i made good on my promise i got the cia and the fbi off your back so you did proving yourself intelligent capable and a man of your word im going to blush if you keep this up youll remember certainly that the southern cone especially argentina never came up in vienna you found the where i told you it would be in central america yeah i remember when that transaction between us was over i thought it had gone extraordinarily well you got what you wanted and i got what i wanted the cia and the fbi to leave me alone which was very important to me as i was already establishing myself here andbeing pragmatici knew that if they were still looking for me they would have inevitably found me and then i showed up here castillo said pevsner nodded now that we both know who howard kennedy really was pevsner went on i dont think it is surprising that when you bumped into howard in the elevator at the four seasons his first reaction was to suggest to me that we had made a mistake in vienna and it was now obviously the time to rectify that omission you mean whack me he suggested we could have our russian friends do it so there would be no connection with me my initial reaction was to go alongi naturally thought that you had turned on me and had come here to demand something of me but again i was curious and told howard that that would wait until we learned what you wanted from me so i told howard to put a bag over your head and bring you out to my house in buena vista in pilar the bag offended you i understood so i told howard to bring you anyway you could be dealt with at buena vista while i was waiting for you i realized that i was really sorry i had misjudged you and regretted that i would have to deal with the problem the strange truth seemed to be that i liked you more than i knew i should giving me an indian beauty mark in the center of my forehead with a smallcaliber softnose pistol bulletthats how you were going to deal with the problem if you try to kiss me alek ill kick your scrotum over the chandelier you areimpossible pevsner said but lovable pevsner shook his head in disbelief i often function on intuition i knew when i looked into your eyes that you were telling me the truth about your reason for being in argentina that not only didnt you want anything from me but you had no idea i was in argentina oh but i did i wanted to borrow your helicopter that came later pevsner said somewhat impatiently what happened at the time was that i decided we were friends i have very few friends howard was a trusted employeemy mistakebut i never thought of him as my friend i trust my friends completely so i introduced you to my family anna liked you from the moment you met so i decided to help you findand possibly assist in getting backthe kidnapped wife of the american diplomat alfredo was then working for me it wouldnt take much effort on my part that night i asked anna whether she thought i had made a mistake about you she thought not she said hes very much like you i thought you said she liked me why do you always have to mock me because it always pisses you off pevsner smiling despite himself shook his head the next morning you met alfredo on your way to where pavel primakovs people had left mastersons body whose people colonelive heard hes actually a colonel generalpavel primakov is the fsbs senior man for south america you did know they were responsible for the murder of masterson didnt you i had no proof and no names but there was no question in billy kocians mind that the fsb was responsible trying to cover putins involvement in the iraqi oilforfood cesspool the proof of that would seem to be what they tried to do with kocian on the szabadsag hid wouldnt you say an attempt to kidnapor failing that murdereric kocian on the liberty bridge in budapest had been thwarted by his bodyguard sandor tor and by max whose gleaming white teeth had caused severe muscular trauma to one of the triggermens arms point taken castillo said where is the old man now in washington the fsb wants him deadto get ahead of myselfabout as much as they do you the last time i talked to billy he complained that he was being followed around by deaf men wearing large hearing aids who kept talking into their lapels it took a moment for pevsner to form the mental picture then he smiled good men i hope the best secret service most of them are on or were on the presidents protection detail getting back where we were friend charley pevsner went on i asked alfredo what he thought of you and his response was unusual he said that he felt you were a lot more competent than your looksand your behaviorsuggested and that strangely he felt you were one of the very few men he trusted instinctively you proved your competence almost immediately by finding lorimer on his estancia getting there with your men before major vincenzo and his men didand they had been looking for him for some timeand then of course by effectively dealing with vincenzo and losing one of my men in the process and getting alfredo wounded lets not forget that pevsner ignored the comment and then there are two more things keep it up castillo said raising his glass in a mock toast then taking a large sip of the singlemalt flattery will get you anywhere what motivates you to always be a wise guy friend charley pevsner asked exasperated but went on before castillo could reply first when alfredo told you he thought i was trying to dispose of him you took care of him and his family knowing that wasif the situation was what you thought it wasin defiance of me i was annoyedvery disappointedwith you at the time by that and worse by the way you threatened me with turning the cia loose on me again unless i loaned you my helicopter for your uruguayan operation i dont like being threatened would you break out in tears if i told you that you have the reputation for being a ruthless sonofabitch castillo said helping alfredo was a nobrainer for me alek i knew that alfredo hadnt betrayed you how did you know that pevsner interrupted we were talking a moment ago about there being men you instinctively trust and you do have that ruthless sonofabitch reputation alek who should i have trusted a man like alfredo or a man with a reputation like yours who incidentally had a known ruthless sonofabitch whispering in his ear and that brings us to that treasonous scum doesnt it does it a traitor who told my good friend lieutenant colonel yevgeny komogorov that i was going to meet with you in the sheraton in pilar knowing full well well that didnt happen did it if it were not for you janos and i would be dead true and i am grateful which gratitude you demonstrated by having howard kennedy and viktor zhdankov beaten to deathslowly apparentlyin punta del este after i told you i wanted kennedy alive so that i could ask him a couple of dozen questions howard knew too much about me for him to continue to live and i could not permit it to get around that anyone who attempted to assassinate me would live very long after a moment castillo asked are we getting near the end of our walk down memory lane alek id really like to know who wants me whacked pevsner ignored the question he took a long thoughtful sip of his drink and now you are here friend charley presumably to ask me something or for something i wanted you to know where you and i stand before you do that okay cutting to the chase a dea agent by the name of timmons was kidnapped in paraguay so far as i know hes still alive as quietly as possible i want him back alive a dea agent pevsner parroted incredulously a dea agent named timmons castillo repeated how did you get involved in something like that how would you guess the president of the united states is involving himself personally in rescuing one drug enforcement agent castillo didnt answer and how did you think i could help i thought maybe you could get word through mutual acquaintances to whoever is holding him that if agent timmons were to miraculously reappear unharmed either in asuncion or somewhere in argentina i would not only be very happy but would be out of here within twentyfour hours otherwise im going to have to come after him which would make everybody unhappy including me i think im missing something here pevsner said you dont really think you can load a halfdozen men on my helicopter and just take this man away from these people your helicopter is not in my contingency plans alek but thank you just the same do you even have an idea who has this man or where im working on that or who they are i dont think theyre liable to be bolivian drug dealers why would you say that my information is that major vincenzowho was in charge of dealing with the drug people for colonel primakovhas already been replaced by another officer from the cuban direccion general de inteligencia as have the exstasi people who you also eliminated in uruguay im not surprised you cant be seriously considering dealing with people like that with a handful of men no more than you can load on my helicopter werent you listening when i said your helicopter is not in my contingency plans then what can you keep a secret friend alek you dare ask me that yes or no my god charley if youll give me boy scouts honorhe demonstrated what that was by holding up his right hand with the center three fingers extended pevsner looked at him in confusionthats boy scouts honor alek very sacred meaning that you really swear what im about to tell you will not leave this room castillo waved his right hand with the fingers extended and gestured with his left for pevsner to make the same gesture pevsner looked at him in disbelief then offered a somewhat petulant philosophic observation maybe you behave in this idiotic and childish manner to confuse people he said to appear to be a fool so that no one will believe youre as competent as you are yes or no alek pevsner raised his right hand extended three fingers and waved it angrily in castillos face thank you castillo said solemnly alek youre a betting man tell me who do you think would come out on top between senor whateverhisname isvincenzos replacementand his stalwart men and two delta force ateams dropping in on them with four helicopters armed with roundperminute machine guns pevsner looked at him for a long moment youre serious pevsner said it was a statement not a question and other interesting lethal devices castillo continued said force backed up by a hundred or so gendarmes argentinos who want not only to get back two of their number also kidnapped by these people but also to seek righteous vengeance for two of their number who were murdered pevsner looked at him intently castillo nodded knowingly and went on and their orders will bei know because their commanding officer told me and i believe himto leave as many bodies scattered over the terrain as possible and then to blow everything up pevsner looked at him curiously but didnt say anything castillo answered the unspoken question he wants to send the message that kidnapping or murdering members of the gendarmeria is unacceptable behavior and is punished accordingly your president is going to do all this over one drug enforcement agent a lot of people alek and i unequivocally count myself among them castillo said evenly believe in the work of these drug enforcement agents and do not consider them expendable youre a soldier friend charley you know men die in wars we dont shoot our own men in the back or write them off when theyre captured my god theres no way something like this could happen without it getting out and that is why i was hoping you would pass the message through your mutual acquaintances to these bastards that i would much prefer that timmons miraculously reappear unharmed instead of me having to come after him that is wishful thinking i am surprised you even suggested it all they can say is no give it a shot please i will not be talking to mutual acquaintances about this man pevsner said it would not only be a waste of my breath butand im surprised you didnt think of this tooit would warn them that action is contemplated castillo shrugged hoping it suggested pevsners refusal didnt matter he instead was thinking now what the hell do i do pevsner took a moment to drain his glass and think you couldnt possibly get four helicopters and all the men you say you have into argentina without at least the tacit approval of the argentine government pevsner went on the argentine government knows nothing about this castillo said and if i can work it never will and yes i can i already have most of the shooters in country the rest will be here in a day or two and so will the helicopters im going to get agent timmons back i hope i can do it without the evil leprechaun carrying out the bloodbath he wants but if that happens the evil leprechaun reminding you that youre still bound by the boy scouts oath of secrecy his name is liam duffy hes a comandante in the gendarmeria nacional you know him pevsner shook his head i think ill have another drink friend charley you castillo emptied his glass and held it out please as pevsner made the drinks castillo heard him say as if he was thinking aloud i almost wish i had given you a beauty mark in vienna oh alek you dont mean that you love me a moment later pevsner turned and handed castillo the drink unfortunately i do he said sincerely but i never dreamed how expensive that would be theres no reason you have to be involved in this castillo said seriously pevsner snorted you had better pray your evil leprechaun does what he says he wants to do he said meaning what meaning thats the only way your noble rescue mission can succeed without bringing yourself downand me down with you youre going to explain that right pevsner raised his glass toward castillos and touched rims oh god friend charley you do cause me problems thats what friends are for right pevsner shook his head and exhaled audibly youre sure that the argentine government is not involved either with you or that theyre not winking at this man duffy the argentine government has no idea what i plan and i dont think they know what duffy plans castillo said why do you say that when i got here he had men waiting for me he knew i was coming which means he has someone in the us embassy in asuncion someone in your embassy knew you were coming thats another whole story i should know it if im to help pevsner said thats really none of his business but why not tell him maybe he can fill in the blanks as i understand it alek the drugs are moved to the united states with fresh meat shipped from ezeiza by air to jamaicamaybe on your airplanes although i dont expect you to fess up about that my airplanes make a number of such flights sometimes every other day pevsner said somewhat indignantly but the pilots will not take off until they have in their hand documents from argentine customs stating that the sealed and locked containers they are carrying have passed customs inspection there may well be drugs in those containers but i dont know about it and neither does anyone who works for me and my people know what happens to people who do what i have told them not to do okay i believe youstrangely enough i do especially the part about what happens to people who do what youve told them not tobut in jamaica they are loaded aboard cruise ships and smuggled into the united states from the cruise ships the cia station chief in the asuncion embassy and maybe the head man from the dea has been setting up an operation to seize the cruise ships under international law which permits the seizure of ships whose owners collude in the shipment of drugs you believe this story pevsner interrupted what i know is that a cia guy heard i was being sent down here to grab timmons and looked me up to tell metimmons be damnedthat he would be unhappy if my operation interfered with his and you were sent down here anyway one drug agent is worth more than seizing a cruise ship to answer the second question first yeah alek in my book one drug agent is worth more than a cruise ship and whats really interesting here the director of the cia and his deputy dont know anything about the shipseizing operation i find that hard to believe i believe that but that operation smells somehow you dont have any idea whats going on no but to get back to the evil leprechaun i told you the only way that he could have known i was coming down here was that he has somebody in the asuncion embassy close to either the cia station chief or the head of the dea there theres no question in my mind that the cia guy who came to me in washingtonafter i told him i didnt care about his operation i was going to get timmons backwarned the cia guy in asuncion that i was coming with the delta force people and the helicopters castillo shook his head he didnt know that and i dont think hes found out but the evil leprechaun told me he had word that there were people intent on whacking me and the people with me i believe him you dont mean your own cia people castillo shrugged meaning he didnt know duffy tried to bluff me castillo went on to get back to your original original question he threatened to have me kicked out of the country within twentyfour hours unless i put myself and my assets under his command he knew about the helicopters andwhat did you call themthe shooters castillo nodded as he sipped his singlemalt he didnt then he explained i told him this morning after i called his bluff he backed down i dont think he would have backed down from his threat if the governmenthell even his boss in the gendarmeriaknew about the massacre hes planning why did you tell him anything because i need his help in getting the helicopters up there around asuncion where i can stage them and to find out where these people have timmons you trust him not very much but as long as he thinks im on board to get his men back and im willing to go along with his plan to shoot everybody in sight and let the lord sort them out i dont think hes going to cause me any problems i left him with one of the ateam commanders wholl warn me if hes about to go out of control what have you got against letting him do what he wants to do im an army officer alek for one thing not the avenging hand of god for another if i let him do that and this operation blows up in my face they call that murder letting him do what he wants is the only chance you have to get away with this friend charley unless you can get these people to let timmons go ive told you that that is not going to happen these people are making a point they can kidnap people theyre not going to turn this fellow loose because you threaten them and if you just drop in and get him leaving their men aliveand their refining facility and warehouse full of drugs intactthey would have to send another message on the other hand if youor this fellow duffyleave bodies all over the terrain to use your phrase and blow up their warehouse and refinery what do you think will happen i think youre about to tell me theres no way that could be kept a secret the word will get outduffys gendarmes will talk more important duffy will want it to get out to take credit he got the people who killed and kidnapped his gendarmes and that will leave the argentine government with the choice of trying duffy for murder or saying congratulations comandante for dealing so effectively with these criminals it is to be regretted of course that so many of them died but those who live by the sword etcetera etcetera what about my involvement whos going to believe the united states government sent delta force shooters and helicopters to carry them down here to rescue one ordinary drug agent i find that hard to believe myself even coming from you friend charley castillo looked at him with a sinking feeling in his stomach all you have to do is get out of wherever theyre holding your man as soon as you have him pevsner said then added as if he had read castillos mind you know im right friend charley castillo still didnt reply and colonel primakov is wise enough to take his losses hes too smart to attempt retribution against what he will believe is the argentine government hell lay low for a while and then start up again he may even call off the people he sent looking for you after all youll no longer be here will you shit castillo said whats next for you pevsner asked the question implying that a discussion had been held and a conclusion drawn im going to asuncion in the morning castillo said to see what i can find out about who in the embassy ordered me whacked and i want to see what i can find out about this scheme to seize cruise ships theres something about it that smells is there an expression in english to the effect that wise men leave sleeping dogs lie thats really none of your business is it friend charley castillo looked at him and thought and hes right about that too no it isnt any of my business neither i suppose is finding out who in the embassy wants me whacked unless of course they succeed before i can get out of here three la casa el bosque san carlos de bariloche rio negro province argentina september castillo munz janos and pevsner were standing on the steps of the house smoking cigars and holding mugs of coffee steaming in the morning cold max was gnawing on an enormous bone they had begun smoking the cigars at the breakfast table but had been ordered out of the house by annas raised eyebrow when sergei the youngest boy had sneezed he and aleksandr both have colds poor things she had said and then raised her eyebrow directly at her husband gentlemen why dont we have our coffee on the verandah pevsner had suggested once there he had said not bitterly there is a price one must pay for children it generally has to do with giving up something one is fond of true friend charley absolutely castillo agreed i think i have been a father about a week and im still not familiar with the priceor the rules he heard a cry a strange one of a bird and looked around to find the bird he didnt see the bird but as he looked up he saw a legend carved into the marble above the massive doors ill be a sonofabitch he said and read it aloud house in the woods thats what schmidt called it pevsner said its what our family calls the house in germany haus im wald castillo said where you grew up castillo nodded dont tell me it looks like carinhall no it looks like a factory castillo said or maybe a funeral home bad memories quite the contrary good memories except when my grandfather and uncle killed themselves on the autobahn and then my mother developed pancreatic cancer a couple of months later haus im wald wasisugly but its comfortable and interesting from the dining room window i could look out and see the volkspolitzeiand every once in a while a real russian soldierrunning up and down the far side of the fence that cut across our property and the stalwart troops of the th armored cavalry regiment running up and down on our side of the fence i decided right off that i would rather be an american you didnt know you were an american pevsner asked confused not until i was twelve i had a number of surprises in my twelfth year but your son doesnt live there you said something about his living with his mother i didnt know i had a son until last week alek castillo met munzs eyes theres more than idle curiosity in those eyes jesus did he make the connection with the pictures does he know he cant know but he damned sure suspects after a perceptible pause pevsner said and youd rather not talk about it i didnt know i had a son until one of my men gave me the picture i showed you last night the boy doesnt know about me about our connection a youthful indiscretion friend charley thats what they call a massive understatement castillo said his motherfive days before she married a west point classmate of minehad so much to drink that what began as a deepseated feeling of revulsion toward me was converted to irresistible lust but she must know i dont know if she does or not im sure her husband doesnt and im certain randy the boy doesnt the problem is her father does im sure he flew with my father in the vietnam warwas flying with my father when he was killed randy looks just like my father he has your eyes pevsner said the photo was clear castillo nodded worse im sure my grandmother knows for the same reason the eyes she took one look at my eyes in a pictureand i was then a twelveyearold blueeyed blondheaded aryanand announced that i was my fathers son subsequently confirmed by science of course but she knew when she saw my eyes karl munz said this is none of my business but there is a picture of the boy at the doublebarc on a table next to your grandmothers chair in the living room with pictures of your father and your cousin and you all as boys the boy looks like your father as a boy i asked who he was and she said that he was general wilsons grandson and told me who general wilson was and then she said hes an adorable child i often wish he was my grandson and there were tears in her eyes karl he paused she knows castillo shook his head how terrible for you pevsner said what are you going to do i dont have a fucking clue alek pevsner gripped castillos shoulder firmly in what castillo recognized as genuine sympathy the left of the double doors to the house opened and corporal lester bradley came out he held the radio handset saved by the marine corps once again castillo said sir what have you got lester colonel torine sir hes on the gipper castillo gestured for him to give him the handset the legend on the small screen flashed col torine encryption enabled and how are things on the high seas jake castillo said into the handset you wouldnt believe how big this mobile airfield is charley and how are you getting along with the admiral im going to have breakfast with him shortly hes a little confused hows that he somehow had the idea that i was bringing a letter to him from ambassador montvale for whom i work and you didnt have a letter i guess you talked to miller i seem to have misplaced the letter but i didnt want to admit that to the admiral but i did clear up his misunderstanding about who i work for howd you do that i told him that i worked for you and who you work for and under what authority that was necessary i thought so charley wrong move i guess it couldnt be helped did he believe you not until i suggested he could get that confirmed at the source you called the president i got as far as getting the white house switchboard on here when the admiral heard the white house operator say good evening colonel torine the admiral said he didnt think it would be necessary to disturb the president good move jake i also told the admiral my orders were to keep you advised of our position every four hours aside from coming right out and telling the admiral not to launch the birdswhich i dont think montvale would dare doi think thats the end of the montvale problem and there goes the star he promised you for changing sides jake yeah well what the hell jake i want you to take a close look at the pilots what will i be looking for any of them who would be uncomfortable with a really dirty operation ouch thats likely it looks that way i dont want you to explain the operation and then ask for volunteers ill do that here but if theres somebody who strikes you asbeing reluctantto do what has to be done just leave him on the carrier these are all th pilots charley i dont think ill find anybody you never know i knew a th guy who turned in his suit and became a catholic priest after kosovo anything else dont put the argentine insignia on the birds until the last minute this operation still may get called off done and keep me posted will do give the admiral my regards when you have breakfast castillo said out castillo held out the handset to bradley who didnt make any effort to take it sir corporal lester bradley said mr darby wants to talk to you ill have to set that up at the console just watch the legend sir until you see his name castillo nodded and lester trotted back into the house he held the handset in his palm until the legend read alex darby encryption enabled whats up alex delia had an interesting telephone call from some friends vacationing in paraguay really they asked him to send them a couple of dozen golf balls you dont say they said they were completely out and theyd had to spend a lot of time looking for balls in the rough and although theyd found a bunch they found only one really good one they said they were watching that one very carefully bingo i dont see what else they could mean charley neither do i you going over there just as soon as i can get to the airport when you find out for sure do you want me to tell the irishman ill tell you that when i call from there pevsner been any help in a manner of speaking ill explain that later thanks alex talk to you soon charley bradley came back onto the verandah you want to speak to anyone else sir call major miller and see what the schedule for the lorimers coming down is and then break it down lester aye aye sir castillo looked at munz and pevsner since you could only hear one side of that conversation i suspect youre curious bingo munz said the shooters in paraguay have apparently found where theyve got timmons castillo said or thats what i think a message about golf balls meant well know as soon as we get there a really dirty operation munz then asked alek says he thinks the only way we can get out of here with timmons without appearing on the front page of the new york times and other newspapers around the world is to let the evil leprechaun do what he wants to do munz considered that i know you dont like that karl but im afraid alek is right why did i think you were going to say that castillo said okay thank you for your hospitality alek and will you now arrange for us to get to the airport youre all going to asuncion yeah why well im going to buenos aires and if someone has to go there i could take him in the lear why are you going to buenos aires he asked greatly concerned to see what i can turn up that might be helpful to you ive got a good deal at stake here if you cant do what you want to do just dont do anything to help unless you tell me first okay alek i wouldnt dream of it pevsner said mockingly i mean that alek i know friend charley pevsner said seriously xiii one silvio pettirossi international airport asuncion paraguay september it was winter here and night came early making moot castillos worry that maybe he should have made a lowlevel reconnaissance anyway even after learning the shooters had located where timmons was being held i wouldnt have been able to see anything even if i knew what i was looking for it had been a long flight they had been in the air almost eight hours with an hour and a half on the ground at the taravell airport in cordoba where theyd gone through argentine customs and immigration there almost had been a dogfight at cordoba max had taken an instant dislike to a large black labrador retrievera drug sniffer for the policia federalwhen the lab had put his curious nose in the commander the moment the door openedand found himself facing a visibly belligerent max determined to protect his airplane after considering his situation for perhaps twenty seconds the lab concluded that there was only one wise course of action to take when faced with an apparently infuriated fellow canine twice his size the lab took itand rolled over on his back putting his paws in the air in surrender max examined the lab for a moment gave him a final growl then exited the aircraft and trottedsomewhat arrogantly castillo thoughtto the nose gear of the commander for what had become his routine postlanding bladder voiding the labs handler was mortified thus castillo was not surprised when he and his fellow officers subjected the cabin and the baggage compartment to a very thorough inspection as they were doing it however munz softly told him it was probably routine and they could expect a similar close inspection when they landed in asuncion a lot of drugs are brought across the border in light aircraft like this one munz said they dont take off or land at airports with their contraband of course but they sometimeswhen emptyput down at airfields like this one to take on fuel or whatever sometimes the sniffer dogs pick up traces of heroin or cocaine or marijuana and that lets the police know that the aircraft is involved in the trade and they thereafter try to keep an eye on it its about as effective as trying to empty the river plate with a spoon but he shrugged and castillo nodded they landed at pettirossi international immediately after an aerolineas argentinas set down thats the last flight today from buenos aires munz said and it will return what that means is were going to have to wait until the authorities deal with both flights before they turn their sniffer dogs loose on this airplane wonderful more delay castillo said disgustedly standing on the tarmac waiting for the paraguayan officials castillo saw on the terminal building that it was possible to still make out the lettering of aeroporto presidente gen stroessner under the fresh paint of its new name for some reason the wait wasnt as long as they feared they got lucky and when they finally made it through customs and were in the unsecured area of the terminal they saw that a van with hotel resort casino yacht amp golf club paraguay painted on its side was waiting for guests alfredo why dont you take lester out there get us rooms andwithout askingsee if you cant find my shooters im ashamed to admit i dont have their names which they almost certainly arent using anyway when castillo arrived with lieutenant lorimer sergeant mullroney and max at the us embassy at almost eight oclock an officious paraguayan security guard at the welllit gate informed castillo and his party that the embassy had closed for the day get the marine guard out here castillo ordered angrily in english as castillo listened to the security guard speak into his radio in spanish he pretended not to understand the unkind things the guard said under his breath about americans in general and this one in particular the marine guard who came to the guardhouse several minutes later recognized lorimer hello lieutenant he said we need to get inside i can let you in but i cant let your friends in were american castillo offered without getting one of the officers to pass them in well then sergeant castillo said get an officer preferably mr crawford the marine guard now examined him more closely mr crawford sir our commercial attache mr jonathon crawford whatever his title castillo said may i ask who you are and the nature of your business with mr crawford sir castillo handed him the credentials identifying him as a supervisory agent of the united states secret service the sergeant examined the credentials very carefully and this gentleman sir he is detective sergeant mullroney of the chicago police department show the sergeant your tin sergeant mullroney did so the sergeant examined the leather folder carefully and then handed it back i guess i can let you gentlemen in as far as station one sir the sergeant said i mean to the building but not inside ill call mr crawford from there sir thank you but you cant bring that dog into the building sir why dont we take max as far as station one and then see what mr crawford has to say about that i dont know sir that was more in the nature of an order sergeant lorimer said than a question yes sir the marine sergeant said there was a row of chromeframe plastic seats in the lobby of the building and two sandtopped chromecan ashtrays despite the absolutely no smoking signs on two walls mr jonathon crawford commercial attache of the embassy appeared thirty minutes later he was a nondescript man in his fifties whose only distinguishing characteristic was his eyes they were deep and intelligent you wanted to see me he asked without any preliminaries if youre crawford i do castillo said and handed him the secret service credentials crawford examined them and looked at mullroney show mr crawford your badge charley castillo said then turned back to crawford i think you know lieutenant lorimer crawford examined the credentials and handed them back but said nothing toor aboutlorimer this wouldnt have kept until morning i have guests at my house if it would have kept till morning i would have come in the morning castillo said that your dog castillo nodded no dogs in the embassy sorry what do you want me to do crawford call frank lammelleor for that matter john powelland tell him that you find it impossible to talk to me right now because you have guests and dont like dogs i dont think i like your attitude castillo well then were even arent we i dont like being kept waiting for half an hour while you schmooze your guests and finish your drink frank sent you a headsup that i was coming you should have been expecting me crawford looked at him a long moment with tight lips make a note in your log sergeant crawford ordered thatover my objectionsmr castillo insisted on bringing his dog into the embassy then he gestured for the sergeant to open the door there came the sound of a solenoid buzzing and then crawford pushed the door open he led them to an elevator waved them onto it then punched in a code on a control panel to make the elevator operable it rose two floors he led them down a corridor to an unmarked dooralso equipped with a keypadpunched in the code and then pushed open that door they entered an outer office and he led them through that to a larger office and then gestured for them to sit in the leatherupholstered chairs im sorry i kept you waiting he said the cold truth of the matter is my wife flipped when i told her i had to come down here i was not in a very good mood can we start all over my name is castillo mr crawford how are you tonight thanks i think i just told you how i am how are you lorimer im fine thank you youre now working for the office of organizational analysis i understand whats that all about what is the office of organizational analysis castillo answered for him and that transfer mr crawford he concluded was already in the works when special agent timmons went missing he said i brought lorimer with me because he had been stationed here ive never been in paraguay do you speak spanish castillo nodded im a texican a what a texan with mexican roots i speak mexican spanish i also can pass myself off as a porteno and after im here three days people will swear that i sound just like whatever they call the natives here asuncionites but the less qualified you think i am the better i heard you were coming here mr costello castillo castillo corrected him castillo sorry but not from deputy director lammelle actually it was backchannel you want to call lammelle and check my bona fides before this goes any further no i understand youre here officially theres no need to bother deputy director lammelle but i dont know exactly why youre here theres unusual interest in special agent timmons my boss sent me down to find out what i can and your boss is crawford asked casually and to report to him what i find out castillo went on you didnt say who your boss is no i didnt are those secret service credentials the real thing about as real as your commercial attache diplomatic carnet if somebody were to call the secret service they would be told there is indeed a supervisory special agent by the came of castillo exactly what is it that you want from me mr castillo i want you to give lieutenant lorimer and sergeant mullroney access to all information regarding this incident and that means i want them to have access to your people alone what exactly is sergeant mullroneys role in this personal and professional professionally he works drugs in chicago personally hes special agent timmonss brotherinlaw thats not a problem but is that all thats all im going to do for now castillo said ill write my report then see if these people turn him loose or not or if he dies of an overdose well i dont think thats going to happen timmons will more than likely be turned loose maybe tonight maybe two weeks from now but for the sake of knowingwhat do you plan to do if he isnt released bring some people and other things down here to help you get him back other things for example for example a couple of helicopters ambassador montvale is working on that now crawfords eyebrows went up the paraguayan government is not going to let you try to get timmons back he said much less bring people and helicopters into the country to do it ambassador montvale is a very persuasive man castillo said and besides that wasnt my decision i will just implement it how are you going to do that im sure i will be told what to do and how and when i understand you met milton weiss crawford said castillo nodded then said is that who gave you the backchannel headsup about us coming down here crawford nodded milton he said led me to believe he let you know a little about an interesting operation were planning here grabbing the cruise ships castillo said crawford didnt reply well castillo went on i told weiss i was not a dea agent and my paycheck doesnt come from langley so that was none of my business and i wouldif possiblestay out of your way so i wont compromise your operation if possible im not prescient crawford i dont know what my orders will be if timmons isnt turned loose and turns up dead at that point someone will decide whats important and ill be told what to do if this cruiseshipgrabbing operation of yours is so important maybe you should start doing more than you have so far to get special agent timmons back crawford sat up in his chair just who the hell do you think you are castillo to waltz in here and question what ive done or not done castillo did not immediately reply he thought that took me a little longer than i thought it would to make him lose his temper like you castillo then said im just a simple servant of the public hoping i can make it to retirement so tell me what have you done crawford to get timmons back anything at all or have you placed your faith in the honesty and competence of the paraguayan law enforcement community with a little luck he will now say fuck you castillo crawford glowered at him for a long moment then said is there anything else i can do for you tonight mr castillo i really have to get back to my guests by ten oclock tomorrow morning crawford i need a list of the things youve done to get special agent timmons back my boss said i was to get that to him as soon as possible give it to lorimer maybe now a fuck you or a kiss my ass very well mr castillo crawford said but youll really have to excuse me now he stood up and smiled then gestured toward the door ill have to check you out with the marine guard he said two hotel resort casino yacht amp golf club paraguay avenida del yacht asuncion paraguay september just as the elevator door was closing a tall goodlooking oliveskinned young man stopped the door and got on he wore his shiny black hair long so that it covered his shirt collar and on his hairy chesthis yellow shirt was unbuttoned almost to the navelthere gleamed a gold medallion the size of a saucer thank you ever so much he said smiling broadly muy amable castillo who had automatically classified the spanish as mexican managed a smile but not without effort i dont feel very amiable asshole the last thing i need right now is a mexican drunk breathing charm and booze fumes all over me the door closed and the elevator started to rise as pevsner had done in llao llao the mexican manipulated the control panel and stopped the elevator castillo felt a rush of adrenaline and then the mexican drunk said in english welcome to the hotel resort casino yacht and golf club paraguay colonel master sergeant gilmore sir gilmore castillo asked incredulously yes sir my mothers the texican she married a gringo if the colonel will give me a look at his room key castillo held it up sir if the colonel will wait until they deliver his luggage and then flick his lights three times and then leave the lights off repeat off and unlock the balcony sliding door technical sergeant bustamante and i will be able to report properly without attracting attention you dont just want to walk down the corridor and knock on the door who are we hiding from there have been some unsavory characters colonel who seem fascinated with bustamante and myself bolivians maybe maybe cubans but what would cubans be doing here ill explain that when you surreptitiously appear in my room but give me a couple of minutes ive got some people with me i want them to be there yes sir corporal bradley told me he did mean little sonofabitch isnt he master sergeant gilmore said admiringly i was having a surreptitious look at what looked like an afc case in his room when all of a sudden there he was with his aimed at my crotch he got me hands down colonel it was five minutes before hed let me get off the floor if i hadnt been able to tell him who sergeant major jack davidson was id probably still be there never judge a book by its cover sergeant you might want to write that down should i call him and the german guy and tell them you want to see them right now castillo nodded and ill call lorimer and mullroney castillo said okay castillo ordered when everyone was in the room unlock the sliding door then flick the lights three times and leave them off then he firmly grasped maxs collar he didnt want to surprise the shooters when they came into the darkened suite ill be curious to see how they do this charley munz said as the lights blinked these places are supposed to be burglarproof and were on the third floor i have no idea castillo confessed corporal bradleys voice in the darkness explained theyre using a rubbercovered chain with loops every foot or so for handholds and it has a collapsible grappling hook at the end sir sergeant gilmore showed me when he came to my room id never seen a system like that before ninety seconds later there was the sound of the sliding door opening and then closing the drapes are in place master sergeant gilmore said somebody can hit the lights when the lights came on castillo didnt see any kind of a chain on either gilmore or technical sergeant bustamante who looked like captain delias younger brother you used a chain sergeant gilmore gilmore pulled a thin chain from a deep pocket on the hip of his trousers clever castillo said well you know how it is when youre in the stockade colonel youve got nothing to do but think up things like this castillo laughed the armys elite delta forceand some other even more secret unitswere housed at fort bragg north carolina in what at one time had been the post stockade isnt a stockade a military prison sergeant mullroney asked yes it is mullroney castillo said mock seriously its where we keep people like these two chained up when theyre not working he went to bustamante and offered his hand my name is castillo sergeant were glad to have you im glad to be here sir thats because you dont know whats going to happen castillo said can i ask another dumb question mullroney asked castillo thought not no but hell no and was about to say exactly that when mullroney asked anyway maybe im out of line colonel but was pissing off that cia guy the way you did smart you bet your ass youre out of line who the hell do you think you are calling me on that but actually actually im glad you brought that up what i was trying to do with crawford was make him think im a wiseass out of my league much like you mullroney i think i managed to do that but i couldnt make him lose his temper and i tried okay mullroney nodded castillo looked at the others and went on crawford is dangerous i still dont know what hes up to but hes not on our side everybody got that there were nods okay the burglars are sergeants bustamante and gilmore from captain delias team this is colonel munz who works for me lieutenant lorimer who also works for me and sergeant mullroney who is a chicago cop and timmonss brotherinlaw and corporal bradley our designated marksman castillo looked at gilmore so what have you got i dont know if its what youre looking for colonel gilmore said but there is a very strange setup on the river a couple of miles downstream from the hotel you have a laptop sir what are you going to do google earth it yes sir ive got the coordinates on this sir he held up a usb flash memory device that recorded data it was the size of a small disposable butane lighter i thought id start with the big picture within a minute everyone was looking at the laptop computer screen which now showed a composite aerial photograph of the river south of asuncion as it would appear from an airplane at five thousand feet what exactly are we looking at castillo asked i finally learned how to add my own data to the imagery colonel hold one sir he plugged the flash memory device into one of the usb ports on the side of the laptop an icon of it immediately popped up on the screen thirty seconds later after he touched several keys a more or less circular ring of tiny flashing spots appeared on the map on the paraguayan side of the river i still dont know what im looking at castillo said bustamante found it sir we were fishing fishing yes sir i even caught a couple gilmore said with a grin then sighed we had covered a lot of water before we came across it we noticed something wasnt right hows that castillo said there was something about the riverbank sir bustamante offered what castillo said gesturing give it to me with the fingers of his right hand bustamante anticipating the reaction his answer was going to cause shrugged the grass was too green colonel twelve feet or so of green grass the rest was all brown suggesting castillo asked i didnt know sir maybe it was near a stream maybe somebody was watering it but i figured it was worth a look so we took one as soon as it was dark how he swam sir gilmore said you brought wet suits with you no sir we have night goggles it was a little chilly bustamante admitted why bustamante he found the green fucking grass colonel gilmore said reasonably and what did you find it was planted bustamante said plastic boxes maybe three feet by a foot four of them and all mounted on a heavy timber so they could be moved out of the way and put back easy i figured somebody wanted access to the river and didnt want anybody to see it and farther inland well there was also a motion sensor on the boxes of grassi almost set it offso i went kind of slow i called gilmore and told him he ought to have a look so he came in with the boat you have radios we bought throwaway cell phones in the airport gilmore said they work fine and well we reconnoitered colonel bustamante said the place is crawling with detection devices and put in by somebody who knows what hes doing after a moment he added damned near got caught castillo turned quickly and looked at him caught castillo parroted by who bustamante shrugged i dont know sir some big sonofabitch moving like a cat gilmore offered at least one guy maybe more he shrugged if he was a perimeter guard he sure as hell didnt act like one oh shit castillo thought is this a repeat of our runin at estancia shangrila who the fuck can this guy beanother exstasi ormaybe one of duffys goons going in ahead of us who the hell knows with drugs and money anything is fucking possible i swam the hell out of there just the same bustamante said i was more afraid this guy was going to trigger one of the sensors gilmore moved the cursor on the screen to one of the blinking dots the one closest to the river an inset appeared a photo you can barely see the device bustamante said but if i had stepped over the grass boxesor even touched themit would have gone off gilmore moved the cursor to another of the flashing dots and another inset photo appeared this one of a trip wire i couldnt tell if it would do anything but set off a claymore bustamante said an inset of a concealed barely visible claymore mine appeared but i guess that would be like an alarm bell right a claymore going off thats about all we were able to do colonel gilmore said we worked our way around their perimeter i figure theres probably five six acres of protected terrain we just didnt have the stuff to try to penetrate it sorry you couldnt penetrate it castillo asked in mock shock a couple of trip wires and some claymores and you just quit turn in your ranger tabs youre a disgrace to the hurlburt school for boys then he smiled and finished great job guys i never expected anything like this you think thats the place youre looking for sir unless its some pig farmer worried about piglet rustlers castillo said what else could it be the claymore was made in east germany bustamante said i thought that was sort of interesting roads one a couple of clicks from this highway gilmore said pointing you want us to have another shot at penetration colonel absolutely not castillo said as clumsy as you two are that would let them know we plan to do terrible things to them both smiled neither spoke but there was a question in their eyes are we up lester yes sir get me major miller aye aye sir put the gps coordinates on the screen so i can read them castillo ordered the legend on the handset read agnes forbison i was beginning to worry that youd been stolen by gypsies she said as she opened the conversation where are you charley in paraguay wheres dick hes arranging ambassador lorimers trip down to the estancia oh hell i cannot tell a lie charley he decided hes up to flying the gulfstream as copilot and in the absence of the only one who could have told him no thats what he authorized himself to do shall i call him and tell him you said no they probably are still in the country castillo considered that for a moment no he would know you ratted on him itll be all right all hell have to do is work the radios but it poses a problem right now what do you need continuous satellite surveillance starting yesterdayusing every sensing technique they haveof a small piece of paraguayan real estate you found where they have this guy god that was quick where we strongly believe he is castillo said two very good shooters from the stockade did it i was going to have dick set up the surveillance you dont think i can i think we have to go through montvale and im not at all sure that montvale will produce what he promises to produce i was going to send dick to fort meade or langleywherever this stuff will come into watch what he does and make sure that it doesnt slip through the cracks and that no copies are passed around the intelligence community i cant afford any tracks either i can go to meade or langley and do that as well as dick could and hes not here unless you dont want me to with profound apologies for not remembering that you are of all of the merry band the best one to deal with the ambassador agnes get the sob on the line and listen in of course youre forgiven agnes said white house colonel castillo needs ambassador montvale on a secure line please yes maam ambassador montvales line truman ellsworth this line is secure colonel castillo calling the ambassador the ambassadors not immediately available will the colonel talk to me ellsworth castillo jumped in when the ambassador becomes available tell him that when i couldnt get him i called the president and that hell probably be hearing from him hold one castillo and how are things in the southern cone charley looking up mr ambassador what can i do for you got a pencil i want to give you some coordinates coordinates of what castillo began to read the coordinates from the laptop screen wait wait a moment castillookay im ready start again castillo did then said would you read those back to me please so we know we have them right montvales exasperation was evident in his voice as he read back the coordinates okay montvale asked finally okay now what i need starting immediately is satellite surveillance of that area i want everything photographs infrared electronic emissions of all kinds everything those clever people have and i probably dont know about what are they looking for whatever they can find whats there colonel i think special agent timmons is there but before i go after him i want to make sure go after him thats what ive been ordered to do youll remember but ive been thinking about the sensitivity of the operation im glad to hear that so what i want you to do please his voice trailed off in thought then he said where is the first place the imagery will go langley or fort meade im surprised you dont know it goes to meade then is linked to langley okay do you have any idea what youre asking how difficult it will be to shift satellites how much it will cost i didnt think it would be easy mr ambassador and im sure it will be expensive would you rather i ask the president to authorize it whats in the back of my mindare you interested and can i say what i have to say without you taking offense of course if you have found timmons and if those helicopters youre trying to send down actually get there and you can stage a successful operation fine but youre not sure youve found timmons and somethinggod knows anythingcan interfere with those helicopters getting down there id love to have them the helicopters of course but i have a plan b in case something goes wrong and didnt you get colonel torine onto the ronald reagan to ensure that everything possible is being done will be done to get them to me yes i did but to continue if something goes awry questions will be asked especially about the satellite surveillance people are going to know that happened i have a plan b for that too mr ambassador do you really when you order the surveillance i want you to have the analysts at meade taken off all other duties until this is over i want them told this is classified top secret presidential and i want the automatic link to langley cut off what are you going to do with the data at meade mrs forbison will be there she will forward to me what the analysts tell her your office manager actually shes the deputy chief of ooa for administration castillo said and shes been cleared for the finding youre going to send her to meade montvale asked incredulously and by the time she gets there i hope youll have ordered that no one but sheor whichever of my men with a finding clearance she designatesis to get any of the material generated by the surveillance when is she going to meade just as soon as we get off the phone right agnes yes sir mrs forbison said good evening mrs forbison montvale said icily i wasnt aware you were on the line standard office procedure mr ambassador agnes said sweetly whenever the chief is speaking with you or the president you didnt know no i didnt unless youve got something for me mr ambassador thats all i have castillo said ill get right on this of course montvale said and you will keep me up to speed right colonel absolutely castillo said break it down lester its broken down lester yes sir get agnes back for me please aye aye sir yes chief who won that one agnes you did hands down you couldnt tell i thought i did so why am i worried what happens now she asked im going to buenos aires first thing in the morning theres a lot to be done im going to leave lesters radio here so youll be able to send the data to the shooters here how do i get them into the voicerecognition circuit you identify yourselfit has to be you me or millerand say adding voicerecognition personnel then you have them give their names and say a few words stand by castillo said and motioned for sergeants bustamante and gilmore to join him you heard that he asked and they nodded colonel castillo adding voice recognition personnel master sergeant gilmore he looked at gilmore and said repeat after me master sergeant gilmore master sergeant gilmore gilmore said castillo nodded and went on when i failed reconnoitering as a ranger i had to become a green beanie gilmore automatically began when i failed then he paused with all possible respect colonel sir screw you an artificial voice joined the conversation sufficient data system recognizesthe voice now changed to gilmoresmaster sergeant gilmore castillo nodded appreciatively colonel castillo he went on adding voicerecognition personnel technical sergeant bustamante he looked at bustamante and said repeat after me technical sergeant bustamante technical sergeant bustamante bustamante began then quickly added thank you colonel for all those very kind things you have said about me while im normally a modest sufficient data the artificial voice broke in system recognizesand bustamantes voice addedtechnical sergeant bustamante wiseass castillo said okay agnes theyre on the communicator will be able to help you pick what data to send down i wasnt going over there by myself if they say something about the radio tell them to check with montvale but dont let it out of your hands entirely separate from this those nsa guys would really like a look at the encryption circuits i will guard it as i would my virtue thats the best you can do castillo said with mock shock there was a moments silence then agnes said with laughter in her voice screw you charley break it down lester okay castillo said in the morning lester max and i are going to go to buenos aires lorimer and mullroney are going to go to the embassy and nose around half for show half to see if they can come up with something lorimer and mullroney nodded castillo went on colonel munz will do whatever he thinks makes the most sense you two will start writing the ops order based on what you know and what intel we get from the satellite or anybody else number them whenever one is complete based on what you have send it to me to the safe house theres a radio there and probably some others have caught up with us by now between now and oh dark hundredi want to leave as early as possible its a long way to buenos aireslester will check you out on the radio and procedures any questions heads shook good lets go three nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina september duffy and delia just came in the gate susanna sieno announced as she hung up a telephone in the quincho if i were not a modest man i would say we are about to blow the comandantes mind castillo said this is pretty impressive stuff charley susanna said i meant with our drapes he said gesturing toward drapes now closed over the plateglass windows lavender and pink stripes with gold highlights really chic she gave him the finger next time you buy them she said more important you look soulfully into the eyes of the drapeshanger or whatever the hell hes called to get him to hang them right now not manana sometime the lavenderandpinkstriped drapeswith gold highlightswere thick enough to shut out all light from the outside and of course ensured that no one could see into the quincho the quincho was now the command post at least for the time being for what had been jokingly dubbed operation ggtgo get timmons four sixtyfourinch flatscreen lcd television monitors sat on a low table against the new drapes one was tuned to the fox news channel with the sound barely audible another monitor was connected to the afc console and showed the data coming in from fort meade as it arrived the encryption system was fast but there was an enormous amount of data being sent the result of this was that the screen first filled with what looked like snowlike static which then began to take form until the entire image was clear the third monitor was connected both to a large computer server and to castillos laptop computer he could call up any of the satellite images to the flatscreen by pushing a key or two on the laptop now since the decryption process was over the images appeared almost instantaneously the fourth monitor was connected both to the server and to a laptop computer being operated by sergeant major jack davidson who castillo had announced was going to be our map guy his job was to prepare and continuously update the maps that would be issuedeither in printed copies or as a computer fileto everyone who would have need of one like castillo davidson could instantly call up on his laptop screen and the monitor any of the maps and any other data stored in the database the difference was that davidsonand he alonecould change the data they were both devout believers in the adageone that went back to the dark ages when maps were printed hung on a wall covered with a sheet of acetate and corrections and additions made with a grease pencilthat if more than one man can make changes to a map said map invariably will soon be fucked up beyond all repair they had worked together before and they worked together now with a smoothness born of practice the first satellite imagery had arrived in nuestra pequena casa an hour before castillo and bradley it was the first photography of the site and about all it was good for was to enable davidson to set up the system he knew castillo would want to use by the time castillo and bradley walked into the quincho the refining data had begun to come in the first imagery had been much like the imagery provided by google earth but in far greater resolution it hadnt shown anything but suggestions of human activity the refining data that began to come in about the time castillo and bradley walked in used a number of sensing techniques at first primarily infrared it sensed differences in temperature between objects in the target area computer analyses of these defined what they were the easiest to identify were human beings their normal temperature was a given the ambient temperature of the area was known a difference of so many degrees determined with a great deal of certainty that that moving blob was a human being and that one a cow and that one a dog similarly the heat generated by such things as open fires stoves internal combustion enginesmaking the distinction between gasoline diesel and sizewas recognized by the computers at fort meade and transferred as refined data the blobs were replaced with a symbolan outline of a truck for example or of a manin which was a number estimating how confident on a scale of to the computer was of its interpretation there would be more refining data as more satellites passed over the target area and the results of more sensing techniques were fed to the computers at fort meade but after davidson had laid the first refining data on top of the aerial photographs what they had was enough for castillo to make a decision bingo he said that has to be it what that is charley is some sort of a hidden operation davidson said reasonably a fairly large one to judge by the bodies and probably a refinery to judge by the large unknown infrared blobs he paused but none of this data has timmonss name on it so what do we do jack castillo had asked send bustamante or someone else back to penetrate running the risk that they get caught in which case the best scenario would be that they would move timmons and the gendarmes someplace we couldnt find them or cut their throats and toss them in the river dont forget giving them an overdose davidson said he made a face of frustration thats why they pay you the big bucks charley to make decisions like that or we just go in castillo went on and if timmons isnt there we kidnap a couple of them and arrange a swap i dont think you want to do that susanna said do you no i dont want to do that she raised an eyebrow is that the same as no i wont do that no come on in gentlemen castillo called cheerfully as comandante duffy and captain delia appeared in the quincho door and illoops a third manstocky nearly bald darkskinned and in his thirtieshad followed them in castillo had no idea who he was and was already phrasing how he would tell duffy he was not to bring any of his gendarmes to the safe house without prior permission when the man saluted very casually and in english introduced himself captain urquila colonel he said i ran into delia at the embassy and he saidsince i hadnt actually reported in to youthat i probably should come out here and do it that you were either here or would be shortly castillo returned the salute as casually what were you doing at the embassy captain urquila castillo asked very softly and politely davidson who knew what it often meant when castillo spoke very softly and politely looked concerned i wanted to ask mrs sieno sir when i could expect you to be in country and how long have you been in country captain castillo asked again softly and politely urquila did the math in his head before replying a week sir i got here the morning of the fifth my team was up when general mcnab laid this on us i appointed myself and my medic the advance party and we were on the lan chile flight out of miami that night youve been here a week captaincorrect me if im wrongand today you went looking for mrs sieno at the embassy thats right sir andcuriosity frankly overwhelms me captainhow have you passed the time since you arrived in beautiful argentina ive been nosing around asuncion sir looking for someplace where these people could be holding this dea guy you and your medic castillo said his tone making it more a question than a statement just he and i at first sir but now my whole team is up there and why did you do that general mcnab briefed me on the problem sir and when i came to see mrs sieno before is he saying he saw susanna before castillo looked at susanna she nodded right after i got here and she said she didnt really know where you were and to hang loose i figured the best thing to do was start nosing around looking for this place tonys found something very interesting colonel delia offered really castillo said and what would that be captain well theres a sort of hidden compound on the paraguayan side of the riverright on the riverprotected by some really heavy antiintrusion stuff including claymores now ive never seen this timmons guy but these people have three guys chained together to a pole two of them are latinos wearing some kind of brown uniform the third is in a suit hes got light skin and id say the odds are hes timmons or whatever his name is jesus christ youve penetrated this compound castillo asked suddenly very serious not me sir my intel sergeant master sergeant ludwicz skinhead ludwicz castillo interrupted that master sergeant ludwicz yes sir he said you two had been around the block a couple times maybe thats who bustamante saw on his intrusion ill be a sonofabitch indeed we have castillo said well hes one hell of a penetrator as you probably know so he went in alone i didnt want to take any more chances than i had to until i knew what was coming down and skinhead says he saw two brownuniformed latinos and a gringo in a suit all chained to a pole yes sir sir he said they have two bowls one with water one with food and that theythis is what ludwicz said sirand that they looked stoned sir as if for example they had been injected with heroin captain urquila shrugged personally sir i dont know that id recognize the signs of someone on heroin what theyd look like and ludwicz didnt say anything about seeing a needle sir just that they looked stoned put the composite on the monitor jack castillo ordered why dont you have a look at this comandante castillo said the composite appeared a second later duffys eyes widened what is that he asked your compound look anything like this captain castillo asked urquila examined the composite very carefully and shook his head thats not it castillo asked incredulously oh thats it urquila said i should have known youd be way ahead of me colonel i hope i havent fucked anything up by sending ludwicz in there come here captain castillo said gesturing with his hands for urquila to move in very close when he had castillo grabbed both of urquilas ears and kissed him wetly on the forehead captain urquila i love you i love skinhead ludwicz and i love you captain urquila and comandante duffy both looked somewhat dazed corporal bradley castillo called sir there is a bottle of famous grouse singlemalt in my room i have been saving it for a special occasion this is it go get it aye aye sir bradley and the famous grouse singlemalt appeared three minutes later but bradley was not alone edgar delchamps and david yung followed him into the quincho you really should let people know when you come home daddy delchamps greeted him otherwise twogun and me will start to think you dont love us sorry ed i just wanted to see what the satellite is that why youre celebrating delchamps asked and crossed the room so that he could look at the monitors he moved quickly but not as quickly as sergeant major davidsons fingers on his laptop keyboard all four monitors now displayed images of provocatively posed naked young females delchamps gave davidson the finger me too jack susanna sieno said disgustedly really davidson hit more keys and the composite came back up on the center screen what are we looking at delchamps asked thats where these people have timmons and two gendarmes chained to a pole castillo said its a couple of miles south of asuncion in paraguay believed to be the location delchamps asked or confirmed to be we have a visual from a very good man castillo said master sergeant ludwicz who is captain urquilas intel sergeant he pointed to urquila first name tony right urquila nodded yes sir this is ed delchamps known as the dinosaur and twogun yung of the federal bureau of ignorance the men nodded at each other for real urquila delchamps asked you got a man into this place and got an eyeson castillo said what ludwicz saw was two guys in brown uniforms and a gringo in a suit chained to a pole and probably doped up thats what were going on i asked him ace but okay thats enough really good news to start pouring the sauce lester my boy but the colonel dont get none might i dare to inquire why not castillo responded there are several obvious reasons delchamps said but primarily because youre about to fly twogun and me to montevideo and i have this perhaps foolish aversion to being flown about by a saucedup pilot curiosity overwhelms me why am i flying you and twogun to montevideo why cant you go commercial and what are the other obvious reasons to which you allude well ace if you insistabout three inches please lester two ice cubes and no waterfor one thing ordonez wants to see you before ambassador lorimer arrives which will be about seven pm if miller is to be believed and what is the gimp doing flying that airplane i am wondering for another before you slip into your armor and gallop off on your white horse to do battle with the forces of evil we have to have a long chat about what the cia is up to in asuncion and i want you to be sober for that and what evil is the cia up to in asuncion castillo was having trouble restraining a smile captain urquila had absolutely no idea what was going on and it showed on his face when i explain that to you ace im sure you will have cause to shamefully remember what you said about twogun being a member of the federal bureau of ignorance oh i doubt that thats because i havent told you what splendid service inspector john j doherty has rendered to our noble cause which is i will tell you on the way to montevideo on which journey will we embark immediately after brother davidson has explained to me the computer game he is playing and of course after i finish this drink and probably another i always need a little liquid courage in order to fly with you at the wheel he turned a chair around and sat in it backward facing the monitor you may proceed brother davidson delchamps said and speak slowly and use itsybitsy words as twogun will also be watching and i dont want to have to explain everything all over again to him xiv one jetstream aviation jorge newbery international airport buenos aires argentina september corporal lester bradley was in the copilot seat of the aero commander holding castillos laptop with which castillo was going to navigate their route to montevideo edgar delchamps and david yung sat behind them trying with little success to get max to move to the area behind their seats were up sir bradley announced castillo looked at the laptop screen there was a representation of an automobilecaseys programmers had yet to add the option of an aircraft iconsitting just off the single main runway of the downtown airport you guys ready castillo asked over his shoulder as he reached for the main buss switch dont wind it up just yet ace delchamps said daddy has a confession to make castillo turned to look at him oh really oh really and my shame and humiliation is tempered only by the fact that youonce you hear itare going to have to abjectly apologize for all the unkind things you have been saying about the fbi time will tell edgar castillo said you can listen to this lester delchamps went on even though it will probably shatter the childlike faith you have in me and with the caveat of course that once you hear this i shall probably have to kill you to keep you from spreading this among your friends and you are going to make this confession in the next fifteen minutes or so right castillo said this is very difficult for me ace i seldom make errors of this magnitude the last time was in when i erroneously concluded i had made an error bradley giggled dont encourage him for gods sake lester castillo said well never get to montevideo my mistake this time was in thinking i had conned milton weiss when the opposite is true delchamps said hes serious now this is no joke that whole scenario about how he and crawford plan to seize cruise ships is pure bullshit delchamps said and i not only swallowed it hook line and sinker but encouraged you to do the same mea culpa ace how do you know castillo asked inspector john j doherty of the blessed federal bureau of investigation those wonderful checkers of fact told twogun delchamps said before twogun could come from shangrila to tell me dohertydamn his black irish heartgot on the geewhiz radio himself to break the news to me as gently as a mother telling her child sorry there really is no santa claus he actually was embarrassed to have to tell me what a spectacular ass id made of myself you are going to give us the details right castillo said softly not yet not until you say something really nice to twogun who turned over the rock so to speak okay castillo said and turned to yung something nice twogun now what damn rock did you turn over yung shrugged there was something about that shipseizure plot that smelled colonel he said so i got on the radio to inspector doherty went over all the details we knew of it then asked him what he thought it smelled to him too so he checked it out he called me back and said it doesnt work that way there are fines for companies whose ships do something illegal like moving drugs but its not like what the cops can doseize a car then have the bad guys go to court and try to get their car back delchamps picked up the story according to doherty the only way these people could lose their ship is if after a trialactually a hearingthere is a fine and they dont pay it then the ship could theoretically be sold at auction to pay the fine according to doherty that doesnt often happenalmost never happensbecause the fines are never more than a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand never anything approaching the value of the ship and according to doherty yung interrupted the only ships that tend to get sold to pay the fine are old battered small coastal freighters the like of which arent worth the cost of the fine the drug people just let them go as a cost of doing business so we was had ace delchamps said not only was i led down the primrose path but i held your hand as you skipped innocently along beside me whats their angle castillo asked almost as if to himself after my admission im surprised youre asking me delchamps said come on ed you made a mistake thats all i was conned by a guy i knew was a con artist so whats his angle i have a theory which of course i cant prove lets have it weiss and crawford are almost as old as i am theyre close to retirement and i really dont think theyve salted much away for their golden years can your imagination soar from that point charley they sold out castillo said and justifying their actionswhich wouldnt be hard i admitby telling themselves the company never appreciated all theyd done for it for all their long years of faithful service the proof of that being weiss riding a desk in langley and crawford being station chief in godforsaken asuncion paraguay so why not take a few bucks for slipping the drug guys a little information from time to time everybody knows the damn drugs are going to go through anyway ill be a sonofabitch castillo said softly that explains why nobody in langley knew about their seizethecruiseships operation there was no seizethecruiseships operation it also explains why they were going to tryprobably still are tryingto whack you you were liable to stumble across something they didnt want you to hear or pass to langley so you get whacked and they of course would have no idea who did you isnt whacking me a little extreme so was weiss coming to me at langley and then to you with that bullshit story desperate people do desperate things ace these guys are not only liable to lose their pensions theyre liable to get sent to the slam okay point taken but doesnt that suggest theyll try to whack you too and twogun and anybody else they consider a threat delchamps agreed and we must bear in mind they probably have access to the ninjas and anybody else would include ambassador lorimer and his wife shit yeah delchamps agreed including ambassador lorimer and his wife who will arrive in montevideo shortly after we do castillo exhaled audibly and with us whacked and pushing up daisies delchamps went on nobody even hears about the bullshit seizethecruiseships scenario they handed us because were the only ones they handed that line to except dick miller castillo said he eavesdropped on that conversation and now hes coming down herewhere they can whack him too they dont know he heard it delchamps said hes close to me so they whack him just to be sure and blame that on the drug guys too yeah delchamps agreed after a moment so what do we do castillo asked well we can go to langley and tell the dci or lammelle you can go to the dci or lammelle without going through montvale and an investigation will be started which they will hear of castillo interrupted and so long special agent timmons or we can get timmons back and then go to the dci who may or may not believe us castillo said more egg on their face or yung put in we can try to find out where their money is i dont think theyd have it in a stateside bank or in paraguay or argentina the caymans maybe or maybe in montevideo i ran across a number of accounts with interesting amounts in them that i couldnt tie to anybody that possible twogun that you could tie them to these bastards castillo asked yeah with some help from doherty for example it would take some time but yeah charley now that we know what were looking for say something nice about the fbi ace delchamps said hallelujah brother castillo said waving both hands above his head i have seen the light i am now second to no one in my admiration of that splendid law enforcement organization just hearing the acronym fbi sends shivers of admiration up and down my spine actually its full of assholes yung said inspector doherty and myself being the exceptions that prove the rule there may be one or two more there were chuckles sir me too bradley said you too what lester castillo asked i heard what mr weiss told you and mr delchamps about the seizetheships op how did you manage that corporal bradley you were not supposed to be listening i was listening to hear what you were going to say about me going back to the corps well the dci and lammelle might have trouble believing you and me ace but all they would have to do is look at the pride of the marine corps honest face and know he is incapable of not telling the truth delchamps said i can probably lie as well as any of you bradley said indignantly and probably a lot better than me lester castillo said i say that in all modesty so what do we do now yung asked may i suggest we think that over carefully before charging off in all directions delchamps said wind up the rubber bands ace and get this show on the road two fortyfive minutes later as the altimeter slowly unwound past feet what had been the dull glow of the lights of montevideo suddenly became the defined lights of the apartment houses along the rambla and the headlights of cars driving along it there it is lester castillo cried in mock excitement montevideo just where its supposed to be will miracles never cease so the data on the gps indicates sir bradley said very seriously pointing to the screen of the laptop castillo looked the representation of an automobile was now moving over the river plate parallel to the rambla what the hell am i going to do with you lester i cant send you back to the marine corps not only do you know too much but after everything youve been through youre not going to be happy as a corporal pushing keys on a computer and now if you will excuse me lester i will talk to the nice man in the tower after which i will see if i can get this aged bird on the ground in one piece yes sir castillo reached for the microphone carrasco approach control aero commander four three five minutes later as they turned off the carrasco runway bradley said theres chief inspector ordonez sir and pointed castillo looked ordonez was leaning against the nose of a helicopter sitting on the tarmac before the civil aviation terminal i wonder what he wants thats one of the old and battered police hueys i am about to replace for him but thats an aerospatiale dauphin parked next to it i thought he said there was only one of those and that it belonged to the president what the hell is going on and how the hell did he know we were going to be here ordonez was standing outside the aero commander when castillo opened the cabin door there has been a development colonel he said without any preliminaries and how are you chief inspector ordonez castillo said ordonez ignored the greeting would you be surprised to hear that your secretary of state has evinced an interest in the welfare of ambassador lorimer and his wife no i wouldnt i thought so i thought so what that you were behind what has happened whats it all about i dont like being pressured would you be surprised to hear i have no idea what youre talking about max exited the airplane and made for the nose gear delchamps yung and bradley got out and looked at ordonez id heard youd left the estancia ordonez said to yung by car in the middle of the night and had gone to argentina which means he has people watching shangrila why not is that whats got him pissed off i wasnt aware he needed your permission to do anything castillo said it was not in connection with your secretary of state is that what youre saying no it was not then what in my experience ordonez castillo said when someone in your frame of mindto use the norteamericano phrase highly pissed offasks a question he usually thinks he has the answer and is not interested in yours even if yours happens to be the truth would i be wasting my breath in other words i suggest you try answering and well find out ordonez said okay bluff called when in doubt tell the truth okay castillo said we have reason to believeyung found outthat the cia station chief in asuncion is dirty ninety percent certainty he went to argentina to tell delchamps and me if he could find me ordonez looked at him very closely somehow i dont think thats what you expected to hear is it jose wrong answer jose castillo said smiling at him not what i expected ordonez said is that true david yung nodded then i apologize ordonez said i had decided that you were entirely capable of doing something like that and probably had but i couldnt figure out why done something like what at eleven oclock this morning i was summonedtogether with the minister of the interiorto the foreign ministry the president was there they had just been on a conference call with our ambassador to washington he reported that your secretary of state had requested a quote personal service unquote from him and requested that he receive her at his earliest convenience half an hour later she was at our embassy she told him that she was very deeply concerned about the welfare of ambassador lorimer and his wife whoagainst her advice and wisheswere already on their way to estancia shangrila she said the ambassador has a serious heart condition which had been almost certainly exacerbated by the loss first of his son and then of his home in new orleans during hurricane katrina she asked as a personal request not as the secretary of state that we do whatever we could for ambassador lorimer and his wife he paused the president thought that was amusing amusing he said the lady may have gone to see the ambassador as a private citizen but that inasmuch as she is the secretary of state your american eagle was sitting on her shoulder ill tell you what i know jose castillo said she likes ambassador lorimer i dont even know how she knows him but she likes him she doesnt want him down here she told him that personally and she sent me to mississippiwhere he and his wife were staying with mastersons widow and her fatherto talk him out of coming i couldnt my only connection with this was to send my airplane the gulfstream to bring them here that would at least spare them the hassle of going through airports so what im saying is that your ambassador got what he saw a very nice lady worried about a nice old man she had no other agenda and what are you going to tell this nice old man about your plans for estancia shangrila have you considered that he knows castillo said he knows ordonez asked incredulously that was my hole card in trying to talk him out of coming i played it and it didnt work well let me tell you how this very nice ladys concern for a nice old man is going to complicate things for you castillo the presidentnot my chief the interior minister and not the foreign minister but my presidentpointed a finger at me and told me i was now responsible for the comfort and safety of ambassador lorimer and his wife as long as they are in uruguay if i dont believe i can adequately protect them with any of our police agencies it can be arranged for a company of our infantry to conduct routine maneuvers near estancia shangrila for as long as necessary to spare the ambassador and his wife the long ride by car from here to the estanciaand to preclude any chance of a mishap on the roadi am to suggest to them that they accept the presidents offer of his personal helicopterhe pointed at the aerospatiale dauphinto transport them to the estancia by the time the helicopter would have reached shangrilathis was the interior ministers suggestioni would have ensured that the estancia had been visited by appropriate police officials under my command to make sure there were no security problems he paused castillo thought hes actually out of breath you sound as if theres some reason you cant do that castillo said cant do what take the lorimers to the estancia in the presidents helicopter how are you going to take them there in the dark ordonez said gesturing speaking hypothetically of course i think that would pose no problem what you do is fly there and when people on the estancia who are expecting you hear you overhead they turn on the headlights of their cars which have been positioned to light the field near the house and then you land how are you going to find shangrila gps the aerospatiale doesnt have it i asked i do castillo said lester show the chief inspector the laptop you would trust this to get you there ordonez asked several minutes later when bradley had finished his demonstration is it safe absolutely and absolutely castillo said and what small risk it might involve is far less i submit than the alternatives which are either to drive the lorimers and everybody else all the way up there oreven worseto put them in a hotel overnight which carries with it the risk that the secretary of state not having heard from me that the lorimers are safely at the estancia might telephone ambassador mcgrory and enlist him in her cause whereupon he can be counted upon to start making a lot of noise we dont need i was worried about that ordonez said if perhaps she hasnt already called the ambassador if she had i think wed know i think so lets keep him out of this if possible ordonez nodded then said wed have to make two trips right we cant get everybody in the aerospatiale is the pilot of the aerospatiale any good of course theyre good theyre the presidential pilots okay then i go in the huey and they follow me in their aerospatiale you mean with my pilots of course it would be better if i went as copilot can you fly a huey no but im a quick learner when that got the dubious look that castillo anticipated he added his tone bordering on annoyance yeah i can fly one jose fifteen minutes later as castillo was talking to the uruguayan pilots beside the aerospatiale he heard millers voice on the aerospatiales radio carrasco approach control gulfstream three seven nine castillo walked toward the runway to watch the gulfstream land bradley walked up to him im sure thats our airplane sir bradley said pointing castillo looked at bradley then at the gulfstream touching down our airplane huh lester another reason i cant send you back to the marine corps you not only consider yourself a member of this ragtag outfit of ours but you have earned the right to think just that three minutes later the gulfstream rolled to a stop on the tarmac in front of the civil aviation terminal and next to the helicopters miller was the first to come down the stair door when he saw castillo he triedand failedto make it appear he was able to reach the tarmac without difficulty castillo walked to meet miller who told you that you could fly that down here castillo greeted him i got tired of riding a desk charley miller replied unrepentant and if the air force couldnt operate the rudder pedalsfor any number of reasons that come quickly to mindthen what if i had had to push on the pedals i would have pushed on the pedals and you know it next off the airplane was a burly man whose loose raincoat only partially concealed the uzi he held against his leg christ if ordonez sees the uzi will he make waves the burly man recognized castillowho did not recognize himand saluted sort of he touched two fingers of his left hand to his left temple castillo returned the salute with the same subtle gesture then the burly man satisfied there was no threat on the tarmac turned to the stair door when ambassador lorimer started down the stairs the burly man started to help him lorimer curtly waved him away ah lorimer said colonel castillo how nice of you to meet me entirely unnecessary of course how was the flight mr ambassador it made me feel like a rockandroll star lorimer said wheres your dog he looked around and finally located max edgar delchamps had him at the end of a tightly held leash ah there you are max the ambassador said put his fingers to his lips and whistled shrilly max towed delchamps to the ambassador without apparent effort the ambassador squatted and scratched maxs ears mr ambassador theres a couple of small problems castillo said would you and mrs lorimer feel up to a helicopter flight of about an hour and a half perhaps a little less to the estancia you mean yes sir sir the president of uruguay welcomes youthis is mr jose ordonez of the interior department on behalf of the president of the republic mr ambassador welcome to uruguay the president hopes you will be willing to use his helicopter for the final leg of your journey thats very kind of him lorimer said may i ask a personal question yes sir of course do all officials of your interior department go about with a glock on their hips castillo laughed ordonez glowered at him try not to let my wife see it please lorimer said andpartially because i think colonel castillo thinks this is necessaryi accept the kind offer of the president there will be time when we get to the estancia for you to explain the nature of the small problems colonel castillo has mentioned right this way mr ambassador ordonez said if you please before we do that im sure my wife will wish to powder her nose as the expression goes and i will need a little sustenance youre hungry mr ambassador ordonez asked thirsty actually lorimer said ive been told senor ordonez that uruguays male population consumes more scotch whiskey per capita than any other such population is that true i believe it is mr ambassador ordonez said then it wouldnt be too much trouble for you would it to come up with a little tastehe held his thumb and index fingers about as widely separated as the joints would allowof say some of macallans finest while my wife is powdering her nose of course i think that can be arranged mr ambassador ordonez said smiling appreciatively you know senor ordonez that according to saint timothy our lord said take a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine other infirmities ive heard that mr ambassador ordonez said if they had had macallan in those dayseven the eighteenyearold never mind the thirtyim sure he would have said take a little macallan wouldnt you agree i think youre right mr ambassador ordonez said nodding and smiling even more broadly lorimer turned to castillo and while senor ordonez is arranging a little outofthesightofminewife sustenance for me colonel why dont you get on that marvelous radio of yours and inform my daughter that her mother and i have not only survived this perilous journey but are now in your capable protective hands yes sir three estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay september after a quickbut castillo noticed quite thoroughinspection of the big house of estancia shangrila ambassador lorimer said that he thought it would be a good idea if everyone had a little tasteperhaps a sazeracto wet down our new home one philippe mrs lorimer said one small one she looked at colinthebutler you understand colin yes maam mrs lorimer then said if you will excuse me gentlemen im going to have another look around the kitchen and may i suggest the sitting room gentlemen colin said gesturing grandly in that direction everyone filed into the sitting room and watched as colin prepared the drinks when he was finished he gave the first one to the ambassador and then passed the others what is this ordonez asked suspiciously if we tell you you probably wont drink it castillo said this is a sazerac el senor ordonez ambassador lorimer said holding up his glass a nearsacred new orleans tradition and certainly the appropriate libation with which to wet down my new home but frankly im reluctant to have colin offer you one why is that mr ambassador ordonez asked politely and more than a little uncomfortably now that i am a retired diplomat i dont have to drink with people i know are lying to me ordonez flushed who are you really lorimer asked ordonez was silent a long moment ill make a deal with you mr ambassador ordonez then said you tell me who he really ishe pointed at colinand i willclarifymy identity the butler looked at castillo who was smiling and shaking his head castillo nodded the butler said chief warrant officer five colin leverette el senor ordonez youre a soldier ordonez asked leverette nodded and you are ambassador lorimer pursued im chief inspector ordonez of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional mr ambassador thank you lorimer said you may give him the sazerac please colinor should i address you as chief colin is fine sir castillo answered for him leverette delivered the drink to ordonez then said to clarify my identity chief inspector i am what is known in the profession as a shooter from the stockade and now that ive told you that ill have to kill you ordonez shook his head in disbelief to the ambassadors new home castillo said raising his glass there was a chorus of hear hear and the drinks were sipped after a moment the ambassador held out his empty glass to colin leverette if youll be so kind as to freshen that up colin before my wife returns from her inspection of the culinary facilities we can turn to the discussion of the few little problems colonel castillo mentioned ten minutes later castillo looked around the room did i leave anything out that pretty well covered it ace edgar delchamps said and actually now that ive had a chance to think it over its not all gloom and despair despite what the secretary of state has done to us with her decision to become mother teresa in addition to her other duties he looked at the ambassador no offense sir none taken please tell me how thats not all gloom and despair ed castillo said my definition of total gloom and despair is when i have to admit i dont have a fucking clue how the hell i can stage a helicopter assault without helicopters and the floodlight secretary cohens shined on the estancia is so brilliant that theres no way that i can bring them in here black doing it without them comes to mind delchamps said is he saying that because hes stupid or trying to bring me back from the depths of despair and gloom theres absolutely no fucking way i can do this without the choppers without the choppers i wont even have any weapons may i offer an observation ambassador lorimer said i hesitate to thats all i fucking need a diplomatic solution certainly mr ambassador castillo said perhaps i dont understand lorimer said the problem as you see it is that because of the secretary of states concern for my welfare and the kind response of the government of uruguay is that there will be so much activity here at the estancia that it would be impossible to bring the helicopters secretly here from the ronald reagan is that it i thought i just said that yes sir mr ambassador that sums it up succinctly castillo said well as i am speaking from a position of total ignorance and you are the recognized experts in this sort of thing i rather suppose you will think this question reflects my ignorance mr ambassador i would love to hear whatever you have to say castillo said what i was thinking when you first outlined the plan colonel castillo was that mother teresa hadcertainly unintentionally but i would submit inarguably he called the secretary of state mother teresa i really like the old guy i dont give a damn what he suggests im going to let him down as gently as i can provided you an opportunity to hide your helicopterrefueling operation in plain sight excuse me listening to your original plan i thought the one weakness was your belief that flying four helicopters in here at night would go unnoticed is that so they are not silent and the noise they make is alien to the rural areas am i right so far please stop me please go on ordonez said that was one of my concerns sir but it was a risk i decided had to be taken but now the first helicopters to come here the first helicopter to come here was the one i flew during my failed attempt to repatriate his worthless son doesnt he know that of course he does what hes doing is being diplomatic and not bringing it up attracting i am sure a great deal of curiosity are government helicopters questions will be asked i submit and these will be answered by announcing that the government is doing something on the estancia thus setting the precedent that helicopters here are legitimate and what you want to do mr ambassador delchamps said softly is pass charleys choppers off as just more government helicopters taking care of that nice sick old man and his wife ambassador lorimer said smiling then finishing his sazarac nothing to be concerned about by the indigenous personnel or the local police the more activity here i would suggest chief inspector ordonez the better all colonel castillo would have to do is make sure that none of his helicopters are here when yours are a matter of scheduling it would seem and we could move all the fuel were going to need onto the estancia in the open castillo thought aloud the fuel to service the police helicopters will be brought to shangrila on policia nacional trucks ordonez offered may i infer that this suggestion has been helpful ambassador lorimer asked you have just saved our ass mr ambassador castillo said and then suddenly serious added and very possibly the lives of special agent timmons and the two argentine gendarmes those bastards are holding ambassador lorimer locked eyes with castillo a moment if thats true colonel its true mr ambassador i was about to say that would please me very much im familiar with the philosophy that vengeance is the lords but i am a sinner and i would very much like to think i did some harm to the people who took my sons life castillo didnt reply and that being the case lorimer went on dont you think a small celebratory taste would be in order yes sir i would indeed four estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay september when the radio went offlittle bopeep red riding hood onelieutenant colonel c g castillo usa wearing a dyedblack flight suit and puffing on a long thin nearly black cigar was sitting at a somewhat unstable table it was set up in a field about five hundred meters from the big house of estancia shangrila and held a glowing coleman lantern two large thermos bottles of coffee two insulated food containers and the control console of an afc communications system sipping coffee at the table were chief inspector jose ordonez of the uruguayan policia nacional us ambassador ret philippe lorimer us army chief warrant officer five colin leverette and corporal lester bradley usmc answer them lester castillo ordered as he glanced at the hueyonce glossy white but now looking tired and batteredfifty meters away that belonged to the policia nacional go red riding hood corporal bradley said into his microphone were due east of you on the deck estimate five minutes the voice said over the console speaker bradley looked at castillo for instructions acknowledged no wind look for automotive headlights castillo said acknowledged no wind look for automotive headlights bradley repeated into the microphone chief inspector ordonez stood up i suppose i had best get back to montevideo ordonez said castillo stood up too thats probably a good idea castillo said he put out his hand thank you jose i realized just now why i really dislike you carlos ordonez said castillo raised an eyebrow why is that jose you are a corrupting influence like satan when i heard thathe gestured toward the sky meaning he meant the radio exchangeinstead of being consumed by shame and remorse for having done what i know i should not have done i realized i was smiling nearly as broadly as you were not to worry castillo said thatll pass ordonez nodded and started walking toward the policia nacional helicopter halfway there just as the pilot started the engineand the lights of half a dozen cars and pickup trucks came onhe turned and walked back to castillo tell your people to be very careful with my helicopters he said ill do that castillo said sixty seconds later the policia nacional huey broke ground the sound of its rotor blades faded into the night then the distinct sound of huey rotors grew louder i believe that is our bird coming in sir corporal bradley said youre probably right lester castillo agreed sixty seconds later a huey appeared out of the pitch dark surprising everybody even though it had been expected the helicopter displayed no navigation lights even the grimes light on top of the fuselage had not been illuminated the huey quickly settled to the ground and the moment it did the headlights of the vehicles illuminating the field went dark and sixty seconds after that colonel jacob torine usaf and us army major robert ward th special operations aviation regimentboth wearing dyedblack insignialess flight suits like castilloswalked up to the table ward came to attention and saluted good evening sir he said i hope that is a cattlefree field i would really hate to get bullshit all over my rudder pedals and i hope you have not been letting that bluesuit fly one of my choppers screw you colonel torine said i say that with affection and sincerity howd it go castillo asked getting off the gipper was a bit of a problem torine said the navy has a rule that they want to know where aircraft leaving their ships are going and we of course did not wish to share that information with them what did you do i told them the admiral would tell him after we were gone does he know no everybody got off all right at thirtyminute intervals which means we have to get you fueled and out of here right now castillo said mr leveretteyou know each other right bob hey colin ward said how are you my father just went to jail and my mother just broke both of her legs how about you and this castillo went on excuse me sir is ambassador lorimer i have been waiting for the opportunity to say this the ambassador said welcome to shangrila gentlemen theres coffee and sandwiches please help yourself as i was saying castillo went on mr leverette has been checked out on the fuel truck charley did you steal a police fuel truck ward asked i borrowed it you do have that reputation for borrowing things ward said ill try for the third time to finish this sentence castillo said mr leverette has been checked out on the fuel truck and has volunteered my crew chief would rather do that himself colonel thank you very much just the same drive it over to the chopper will you please colin castillo said carefully please colin ward said keeping in mind my crew chief testfired his gatling gun on the way here burning six hundred rounds a minute i thought it was three thousand rpm castillo said the sixbarrel md corporal lester bradley automatically recited is capable of firing perminute fixed rates of three thousand or four thousand rounds of mm nato ammunition he paused at three thousand rpm thats an extreme shot density of fifty rounds each second the dense grouping designed to quickly suppress multiple targets simultaneously well castillo said after a moment weve heard from the marine corps lester youre right ward said and our weapons are tweaked for sixhundredrpm test firings conserves ammo charley torine said why were you talking in tongues on the radio i didnt know if your pal the admiral might be listening castillo said turns out we have a problem in asuncion yung found out the cia station chief is on the bad guys payroll i couldnt take the chance the admiralwho im convinced is talking backchannel to at least one pentagon admiralwould pass on anything that might wind up in langley where another rotten apple would pass it on to asuncion jesus christ charley torine said shocked thats one hell of an accusation you sure unfortunately a long story delchamps will bring you up to speed when youre at nuestra pequena casa our little house whats that major ward asked a safe house outside buenos aires your next stop were going to hide the birds there during the day and finish the ferry operation as soon as it gets dark tonight and well give you the basic plan during the day we have some really interesting satellite stuff finish the ferry operation how and where to ward asked castillo looked at his watch he didnt want to get into this now but on the other hand ward had a right to know and if he told him later ward would be annoyed the next leg is to pilar its a little bit out of the way but were working with an argentine cop on this specifically a gendarmerie comandante named duffy and thats where he is hes arranged fuel to be at a couple of the argentine polo associations polo fields ones sort of closed down for the day either duffys peopleor ourswill take the crews to the safe house where we can make the first operation briefing and get them something to eat and some rest as soon as its dark the chopperseach having taken aboard a couple of gendarmes in case you have to land someplace you hadnt planned theyll make you legitimatewill fly separate routes to fields in the boonies for refueling youll get the coordinates at the briefing there are redundant fields in case anything goes wrong youll wind up at a field in argentina several miles from the paraguay river and about ten miles from the target this place has got a couple of big barns where we can conceal the hueys and the shooters the shooters are already moving there in private cars and trucksmostly trucksand again with a gendarme or two aboard in case they get stopped as soon as everybodys assembled and the choppers checked and fueled well make the assault no dry run no that would attract too much attention and you know as well as i do bob that things happenlike dumping birdsduring dry runs you guys have done this sort of thing before im not worried about that ward nodded what were going to do castillo went on is make a simultaneous approach to the target three birds will take out the two generators what we think is the main generator and its spare and their radio duffys gendarmes will cut the telephone and power lines at the same time three of the birds will use suppressing fire and get ready to put their shooters on the ground if necessary while the fourth bird with a couple of shooters will land and grab the dea guy and two gendarmes who these nice people have chained to a pole and we believe are keeping them doped up with some drug youve located them master sergeant ludwiczyou know him skinhead castillo nodded skinhead penetrated this place and got a positive visual so you know where they are castillo nodded again then said unless theyre moved which will probably happen the fourth bird will put two shooters plus an exgreen beret and a cop who both know the dea guyhis name is timmonson the ground grab them put them on the chopper whereupon the chopper will haul ass the quicker were in and out the better an exgreen beret and a cop where did they come from the exgreen beret is called pegleg because one of them is titanium lorimer you know him of him good man and the cop hes a detective sergeant is the dea guys brotherinlaw you brought a cop in on this it was not my idea but i dont know what shape the dea guy is going to be in and i dont want to have to fight with him to get him into the chopper so maybe hell be useful as a friendly face major ward did not look convinced i know i know castillo said best scenario we get them aboard the chopper and haul ass without having to put the shooters on the ground back to the field across the river the bird evacing the dea guy will go to the airport at formosaa hundred clicks from the targetwhere the gulfstream will be waiting and therell be medics to let torine know if its safe for the dea guy to fly first to uruguay and then home why uruguay because the uruguayan cops get the choppers when were done with them the gulfstream will also take all the pilots home where are you going to be while all this is going on ill be flying the bird that lands to get the dea guy ward did not respond to that not to worry bob colin leverette said coming into the light of the coleman lamp ill be with him to make sure he doesnt do something stupid where did that idea come from castillo asked for that matter where the hell did you come from i thought you were pumping fuel my offer to be of assistance was declined leverette said somewhat rudely i thought your offer to be of assistance to me is herewith politely declined colin i need you to stay with the ambassador anticipating what you were planning for me i had vic dalessando send the best available shooters from the stockade down here with the ambassador ill be fine colonel ambassador lorimer said there are all sorts of local police as well he paused and added what is that phrase from tactics i think youve been outflanked by colin colonel colonel leverette added you didnt really expect me to wave a tearful byebye while you and jack davidson flew off to do battle with the forces of evil did you castillo was silent then he shook his head in an exaggerated fashion i give up he said colonel whats the worst scenario ward asked castillo inhaled deeply exhaled audibly and said these people took out two of comandante duffys gendarmes he wants to leave bodies all over to make the point they shouldnt have done this i cant stop himfrankly im not sure i blame himbut i cant afford to get us involved in anything like that so worst scenario is that we get in a firefight on the ground that would take time i think duffys men are going to be in the compound where timmons is within five minutes of the time we get there i want to be gone by then long before theres any chance of us taking fireor casualties there came the sound of the hueys engine starting well bob i think youd better take this old air force type to the house castillo said hes had enough excitement for one day what i think we need colin is a kinder gentler commander colonel torine said almost exactly two hours later at castillo and leverette looked out the side door of red riding hood fouraround the gatling gunas the aircraft lifted off they waved goodbye to ambassador lorimer who was standing by the table in the field with the two next best available shooters from the stockade at his side xv one estancia san patricio near clorinda formosa province argentina september castillo had an uneasy feeling that things were going too well too smoothly even the damn tvs came through all four of them and in working order they were the sixtyfourinch flatscreen lcd television monitors from the quincho at nuestra pequena casa he had mentioned idly to comandante duffy that it was a pity they wouldnt have one of them at what edgar delchamps had dubbed the cathedralas in saint patricks cathedralmeaning the huge warehouse buildings at estancia san patricio theyd sure make the final briefing a lot easier castillo had said not a problem duffy said ill have one of them there in the morning maybe we should send two to be sure hell take all of them theyre not going to do us any good here in the quincho and if were really lucky hed thought maybe more than one will survive getting trucked over a thousand clicks of bumpy provincial roads thirty minutes later one of the seized trucks from duffys combination headquartersgaragewarehouse had arrived at nuestra pequena casa the cargo area of the truck was half filled with mattresses and the next dayyesterday at lunchtimewhen castillo arrived at the cathedral with delchamps lester leverette and max in a confiscated mercedes suv sergeant major jack davidson had all four of the screens up and running displaying the latest satellite updates this is great jack but now everybody knows more than they should castillo said well surprising me not a little duffy didnt argue with me when i told him that we were in the lockdown stage of the operation and that nobody leaves the cathedral once they come in youre a good man jack dont pay any attention to what people are always saying about you comandante liam duffy now wearing what was apparently the gendarmeria nacional uniform for going to warcamouflage shirt and trousers sort of jump boots and web equipment that seemed designed primarily to support many ammunition magazineswalked up to castillo pointed at his wristwatch and raised his eyebrows in question yeah liam castillo said its about time duffy bellowed a name an enormous gendarme with a sleeve full of chevrons appeared came to attention before duffy and announced that he was at his orders form the men duffy ordered loudly the gendarme bellowed something not quite intelligible but what apparently was the gendarme command to come to attention all the gendarmes popped to their feet stamped their feet in the british manner and stood rigidly at attention comandante duffy grandly gestured for castillo to precede him to the speakers platform the cargo bay of yet another confiscated vehicle pressed into service more than a few of the americans in the roomtwo dozen delta force shooters and the crews of the hueysobviously found this military precision amusing perhaps even ludicrous shit the last thing i need is for the gendarmes to think the gringos are laughing at them but its too late now for the speech about respecting the customs of your brothersinarms castillo started to walk toward the pickup truck chief warrant officer five colin leverette put his hand on lieutenant colonel c g castillos arm stopping him leverette then screamed or shouted or bellowed on your feet you candyasses this caught the attention of the americans but no one moved leverette then announced at equal volume i will personally castrate any one of you candyasses not standing tall by the time i get to the truck then politely he said to castillo with your permission sir and marched erectly toward the pickup truck loudly and rapidly repeating up up up until he got there by then the americans understood what was going on and had gotten to their feet leverette jumped nimbly into the bed of the pickup popped to rigid attention and bellowed assault force attenhut the shooters and the fliers stood at rigid attention sir leverette bellowed as he saluted your assault force is formed by then even the assault force commander understood what was going on lieutenant colonel castillo marched across the cathedral to the truck jumped nimbly into the cargo area put his hands on his hips and examined his force as if he didnt like what he saw he turned to leverette who was still holding his salute very well he said quite loudly carry on mr leverette yes sir leverette bellowed then ordered the men atease leverette turned back to face castillo neither the assault force nor the gendarmes could see his face and they could not hear him as he softly said and to think you didnt want me to come ive never thought pep talks did much good castillo said loudly to the assault force and gendarmes so im not going to give one and if theres anybody out there who doesnt know what hes supposed to do and when hes supposed to do it hes out of luck theres no time for that now the only things i am going to say and im sure comandante duffy agrees with me is that the priority of this missionabove all elseis to get our people back from these hijos de puta and to do that we have to follow the schedule this is one of those situations where one man acting a minute too soon or a minute too late can screw up the whole operation dont jump the gun thatll get peoplealmost certainly the people were going after but members of the assault team as wellkilled and when your time comes to take action dont hesitate hesitation will get people killed too and thats all i have castillo looked down at duffy who stood beside the truck comandante comandante duffy put his hands on the waist of a slight man in a gendarme uniform and hoisted him into the back of the pickup what the hell the gendarmes bowed their heads and the slight man then invoked a lengthy somewhat flowery blessing of the deity upon the noble mission they were about to undertake it was only after everyone raised their heads that castillo saw the clerical collar under the slight mans camouflage shirt max sensed that something was going on that he was not going to be part of but didnt protest when castillo put him in the back of the mercedes suv and firmly lashed his leash to a metal loop in the floor delchamps would drive the truck and max to the airfield at formosa where torine and miller had taken the gulfstream castillo had planned to send lester bradley with torine and max but the piteous look in bradleys eyes when he was told of this was even more piteous than the look in maxs eyes and castillos resolve melted cover my back lester and thats all castillo ordered aye aye sir leverette intercepted castillo and bradley as they walked toward big bad wolf its rotor blades already turning lorimer mullroney and two shooters were getting situated inside go get aboard lester leverette ordered i need a word with the colonel and dont shoot anything until i tell you when bradley was out of earshot castillo said now what colin would the colonel accept some friendly advice not right now thank you just the same mr leverette i have a lot on my mind thank you sir how long has it been since the colonel has been referred to as hotshot charley the boy wonder meaning what may i remind the colonel that he is now a colonel and that colonelseven light colonels sirare supposed to keep their minds free to make command decisions not drive helicopters castillo stared at leverette let the kid drive charley hes good ive been around the block with him and the other kid before castillo glanced at the huey then looked back at leverette if the old mans memory serves youve been around the block with me once or twice too colin some people thought i was pretty good at this sort of thing you were that was then this is now he paused let the kids drive charley fuck you colin castillo said and walked quickly toward big bad wolf the pilot a young captain was holding open the pilots door where would like me to ride sir probably there would be a good idea colonel castillo said pointing to the pilot seat thats where they keep the handles and levers and all that aircraft crap yes sir big bad wolf light on the skids big bad wolf off big bad wolf commo check one two three big bad wolf mminute in ten engage computer on my bong bong this was far from the first time castillo had flown an assault mission using the technique known informally as flying the needles but it would be the first when he would not actually be flying from the pilots seat of oneusually the leadhelicopter im not flying the kids are colin was right about that i havent flown a huey for a long time i am no longer hotshot charley the boy wonder this is no time for me to fuck it up by thinking i am castillo knew that the destination coordinates and the desired time of arrivalin this case six hundred seconds from his bong setting orderhad been all fed into computers aboard the hueys the computers would make the necessary computations and convert them to signals that activated indicator pointersthe needleson the compass the radar altimeter and the ground speed indicator by keeping each helicopters compass and its altitude and ground speed indicators pointers lined up precisely with the computergenerated datacontinuously making adjustments en routeas many as ten helicopters can arrive simultaneously within two to three seconds on target from several directions in our casebig bad wolf and red riding hood one two and threefrom three different directions making this damned difficult and complicated and requiring pilots of extraordinary skill and great experience to carry it off and these kidsthese army aviators of the thare the worlds best damn chopper jockeys at mminute less three seconds red riding hood one popped up from its nap of the earth altitude east of the target and rose to one hundred feet above the ground there were faint lights visible within the compound beneath red riding hood one at mminute what looked like an orange ribbon flashed down to the ground from the opened side door of the helicopter it lasted about ten seconds and then red riding hood one made a steep turn and left the area the orange ribbon had come from a dillon aero md mm weapon system mounted on a pintle in the helicopter this weapon is patterned after the gatling gun a multiplebarrel weapon that was developed just in time for private tiffany of the jewelry firm tiffany amp company and of the first united states volunteer cavalry to buy several from the colt people with his own money and in take them to cuba where he put them to use assisting lieutenant colonel theodore roosevelt in chasing the spaniards off san juan hill the mdwith six rotating barrels like the original gatling but ones electrically powered rather than handcrankedon red riding hood one was fed by a round magazine that could empty in just over sixty seconds in the ten seconds the weapon did fire it sent from red riding hood one almost seven hundred grain bullets into a corrugated steel shed that contained a nearly new cummins dieselpowered onehundredfiftykilowatt generator this caused the generator to malfunctionand the lights in the compound to go black a moment later the diesel fuel in the tank behind the shed burst into flame several moments after that the electric lights of the compound flickered back on as an automatic system fired up the backup generator an identical cummins this coincided with the arrival of red riding hood two from the north at mminute plus five seconds and again there was an orange ribbon coming from the sky and again somewhere around seven hundred bullets flowed down these striking the shed housing the backup generatorand causing the generator to malfunction its fuel supply to ignite and the lights in the compound to go out again as red riding hood two left the immediate area red riding hood three and big bad wolf appeared from the south red riding hood was going to go in as low as possible to the ground and train its md on the corrugated steel building that the satellite imagery interpreters believed to be the compound headquarterslots of people and a rather powerful shortwave radio station had been detectedand a motor pool behind that building big bad wolf was going to land in the compound as soon as red riding hood three fired at the headquarters building then offload three shooters the shooters would rush to the pole where dea special agent timmons and the two gendarmes had been chained free them and load them onto big bad wolf which would then immediately take off under cover of red riding hood one and two which by then would have returned to lay down covering fire red riding hood three by then would be seeing what it could do to facilitate the passage of the gendarmes from the highway to the compound conducting what is known as reconnaissance by fire everything went as planned until red riding hood three picked up a little altitude to give it a better shot at the motor pool the pilot of big bad wolf the copilot and castillowho was kneeling on the deck just behind themalmost simultaneously said oh shit fuck he hit a wire the copilot said it cut the fucking blade red riding hood three which was tilted to the left straightened out for a moment looked as if it was trying to turn then tilted back left and was almost upside down when it crashed into the motor pool the pilot looked at castillo for orders castillo gestured impatiently at the ground as soon as youre down turn it around so we can take off the way we came in castillo ordered big bad wolf three is down repeat three is down two go cover the gate one give us some covering fire one on you big bad wolf see what you can do for the guys on three colin castillo ordered im going to get timmons give me your chaincutters leverette gave him a thumbsup and jumped off the helicopter castillo turned to the two shooters you go with mr leverette castillo said to one then to the other said and you come with me there was also a former green beret and a chicago police officer on the helicopter the latter grasping a snubnosed smith amp wesson revolver you stay on the chopper castillo ordered them hes my brotherinlaw mullroney protested shit thats why we brought him along in the first place castillo looked at lorimer and shouted i dont want him hurt pegleg got it lorimer nodded castillo turned to bradley lester cover my back aye aye sir special agent timmons was sitting with his back resting against the pole to which he had been chained he was looking with confused eyes at what was going on the two gendarmes were asleep hey charley he said with slurred speech dimly recognizing his brotherinlaw and smiling whats up mullroney and lorimer worked as a team to hold and cut through the chain castillo then hoisted the freed timmons over his shoulder in a firemans carry he started trotting toward big bad wolf mullroney and lorimer quickly snipped the chains on the gendarmes then followed castillo back toward the helo halfway there castillo suddenly felt as if somebody had hit him with a baseball bat in the leg and then a moment later in the buttocks he felt himself falling oh shit he heard a burst from a car then his lights went out its okay kid weve got him dont you call me kid you oversized sonofabitch goddamn charley didnt you hear me when i said to remember to duck wheres timmons you took a couple of hitsone in the ass one in the legfrom what id say was that short russian round the not too much tissue damage but you lost a lot of blood wheres timmons you want a shot or the happy pill i dont want either where the fuck is timmons not your choice charley the one you took in the leg broke it its going to start hurting bad right about now i dont want to go out goddamn you he didnt remember a needle prick or any sense of being drugged or even of feeling dizzy one moment he was fighting with colin leverette the next moment nothing two room hospital britanico avenida italia montevideo uruguay september i shudder to think how youre going to answer the calls of nature in that apparatus colonel chief warrant officer five colin leverette said to lieutenant colonel c g castillo from the door of the room castillo was suspended overnot inhis hospital bed his left leg was encased in plaster from above the knee stainless steel cables attached to small drings in the plaster held the leg six inches over the mattress this was necessary to keep the leg straight this in turn being necessary to accommodate a cradle under colonel castillos buttocks which allowed his left buttock to hang free which was also suspended from stainless steel cables attached to a frame above the bed colonel castillo gave mr leverette the finger with his right hand his left hand held a long black cigar i dont think youre supposed to be smoking leverette said castillo gave him the finger again where am i and what am doing here youre in the british hospital in montevideo uruguay i think the term is recuperating you apparently were involved in a firearms accident while hunting feral swine in the north and timmons special agent timmons is undergoing drug detoxification in saint albans hospital in washington dc sergeant mullroney is also in saint albans recovering from minor injuries he suffered while shooting feral hogs with you anybody else get hit leverette shook his head amazing they were waiting for us charley a lot of them what i remember is three hitting an antenna cable and going in what it hit was a fucking cable one of a bunch of fucking cables strung across every area in that compound large enough to land a chopper i dont see why everybody didnt hit one but just three did leverette nodded and bruises and contusions one broken arm we brought him here too they set the arm and put him on an american airlines flight last night for miami why here you lost a lot of blood charley and your leg was a mess delchamps took one look at you in formosa and decided you were in no shape for a tenhour flight to the states so he flew you here and where is he he went on the gulfstream with timmons mullroney and the guys from the th lester he took out the guy who shot you and then started dragging you to the chopper i was right he went into his pocket and came out with a small clear plastic ziptop disposable bag he handed it to castillo it held three bullets one fairly intact the other two distorted thats mm pab i suppose the beatup ones are the ones that did the damage to your leg i didnt even hear any firing and i thought i took two hits not three these are the rounds the fsb uses in theirsuppressedas val special purpose assault rifle odd that a bunch of drug dealers would have weapons like that isnt it we were up against russians maybe maybe cubans dead men tell no tales and after duffy got there and found his two guys full of holes from these things thats all that was left he took out everybody leverette nodded and then blew everything up he said spectacular it looked like something from a rambo movie all kinds of secondary detonations i was surprised nobody got hurt or the choppers our guys get involved leverette shook his head there was a momentthe first word was that youd bought the farmwhen i thought they would but jack davidson stopped it and you castillo said it was a statement not a question what the hell im a wfive and jacks just a lousy sergeant major where is he he and lester are trying to sneak max in here hes still here why the almighty has spoken mcnab leverette nodded the verbal orders of our leader were you dont let that sonofabitch out of your sight until you can get him up here so i can ream hima new rectal orifice or words to that effect castillo shook his head you know the general charley any shooter gets shot its his fault for not shooting first the door opened and was held open by a nurse a slight young man wearing dark glasses and tapping his way carefully with a white cane then entered holding a very large dog on a leash castillo grinned lester if those at quantico could only see the pride of the marines now the dog whining very carefully put his feet on the bed and then licked first colonel castillos left hand then his face its all right nurse sergeant major jack davidson said he was wearing a white nylon surgeons smock and had a stethoscope hanging around his neck i cleared it with the chief of staff and actually canine saliva has a certain germicidal quality the nurse shook her head but left letting the door slowly close by itself three room hospital britanico avenida italia montevideo uruguay september the very tall welldressed somewhat asceticlooking man entered the room without knocking and found himself facing a nicelooking teenage boy in a gray suitwho was holding a acp pistol aimed at his crotch beside the boy was the largest dog the man had ever seen showing an impressive array of teeth and growling deeply the man quickly put up his hands you must be corporal bradley the man said who the hell are you castillo demanded my name is frank lammelle colonel im the ddci ambassador montvale suggested i come to see you you have any identification sir bradley demanded its okay lester castillo said i dont think hes making that up may i put my hands down castillo nodded and would you give the colonel and me a few minutes alone please corporal go get a coke or something lester castillo ordered when the door had closed after bradley lammelle said that looks very uncomfortable colonel until ten oclock this morning they had me literally twisting in the wind that was worse and now now i have to lie on my side they looked at each other curiously how did you know who bradley was castillo asked edgar delchamps described him to me as a choirboy with a who is seldom far from your side castillo smiled but didnt say anything delchamps came to see me and the dci immediately after he came from saint albans hospital lammelle said castillo said nothing you didnt know he planned to do that no but now that i think about it im not surprised he told us an incredible unsupportable unbelievable tale about several members of the cia having so to speak sold out well you dont have to believe delchamps if you dont want to mr lammelle castillo said coldly and softly but im going to tell the president about those two bastards just as soon as i can get to washington i suspect hell believe me his voice changed tenor jesus christ did montvale send you down here to talk me into going along with a whitewash of those two traitorous sonsofbitches my mother always taught me it was bad form to speak ill of the dead lammelle said excuse me we are both referring to mr milton weiss and mr jonathon crawford are we not colonel i think of them as miserable cia sonofabitch one and miserable cia sonofabitch two im afraid that im the bearer of bad news colonel mr crawford and mr weiss are no longer with us what did they do catch a plane to the former soviet union they are deceased lammelle said mr crawford was found three days ago in his apartment in asuncion he had apparently been strangled to death during a robbery with a garrote actually a blue steel garrote and weiss mr weiss was found in his car in the parking lot at langley yesterday morning he died of a drug overdose the needle was still in his armno actually it was in his neckwhen his body was discovered how interesting well naturally since mr delchamps had raised these awful allegations against mr weiss our investigators had some questions for him and apparently mr delchamps had been involved in a marathon poker game at the house he shares with you in alexandria during the time the coroner tells us mr weiss got his fatal injection with some other cia veterans now mostly retired they have a small informal organization they call themselves the dinosaurs so ive heard well the cia certainly is willing to take the word of such a group regarding who was where and when thats probably a good idea some of those cold war warriors the dinosaurs tell fascinating storiesthey cant be believed of courseabout what happened to traitors in their day such as i really dont like to get into this sort of thing so let me just say its rumored they acted as judge jury and executioner when they were sure one of their number had sold out just a legend im sure yeah well aside from saying that i dont think you could get arrested in chicago for anythingsergeant mullroney has told both the mayor and the president of your courageous dash through fierce smallarms fire carrying special agent timmons on your back oh jesus thats about all i have i have to get to buenos aires why well i probably shouldnt tell you this as its classified nevertheless weve decided to beef up our operation in asuncion in light of whats happened there mr darby is going there to help mr and mrs sieno get things straightened out i want to see them before they go he put out his hand its been a pleasure meeting you colonel and i wish you a speedy recovery four red cloud road fort rucker alabama december major general harry wilson usa ret elected to park his buick sedan on red cloud road although he was fully aware that this was prohibited there were several reasons he chose to do so not the least of which was sitting next to him in the person of justpromoted major general crenshaw the newly appointed post commander military police only rarely ticketed post commanders for any nonfelonious breach of the law other reasons included that he and general crenshaw had had several drinks on the flight from texas and he really could not handle more than one ounce of alcohol per hour master randolph richardson iv was out of the buick and up the lawn before either general wilson or general crenshaw could brief him on the best approach to the problems that were about to develop young randy was holding something black and about the size of a shoe in his hand oh shit general wilson said my thoughts exactly general crenshaw said but ill deal with him hes my soninlaw general wilson said but i write the officers efficiency report on the officer who writes his general crenshaw said point taken general wilson said you bring your animal and ill bring the dead birds general crenshaw opened the rear door and picked up a small animal more or less identical to the one randolph richardson iv had rushed to the door holding generals wilson and crenshaw got to the door just as lieutenant colonel randolph richardson iii opened it his wife stood behind him i made twenty takeoffs and landings young randy announced then held up the soft black object in his hands for inspection and look at this you did what mrs richardson asked what is that lieutenant colonel richardson asked his name is goliath randy answered general crenshaws got his brother david you did what mrs richardson asked again i made twenty takeoffs and landings in a ryan pt her son answered that isnt one of those huge dogs colonel castillo had is it lieutenant colonel richardson asked not yet richardson general crenshaw said right now goliath and david are what they call puppies max had eight randy said or histhe girl dog did colonel castillo gave general crenshaw one and he gave me one how nice of him lieutenant colonel richardson said carefully choosing his words but im not sure well be able to keep it moving around the way we do nonsense generals crenshaw and wilson said almost in unison every boy should have a dog general crenshaw added teaches him character general wilson agreed a dog that size lieutenant colonel richardson said and colonel castillo gave one to a girl he knows in argentina randy said a girl my age he says he wants me to meet some time i would like to know what he means by twenty takeoffs and landings mrs richardson said not by himself certainly what kind of an airplane lieutenant colonel richardson said a ryan pt opencockpit tail dragger randy announced with a pilots elan hundredandsixtyhorse kinner fivecylinder radial cruises at about one thirtyfive colonel castillo has such an airplane lieutenant colonel richardson inquired i dont think ive ever seen one uncle fernando does randy said softly stroking goliath you remember fernando beth her father said charleys cousin she smiled somewhat wanly youre calling this man uncle fernando she said to her son if he lets me fly his airplane randy replied matteroffactly ill call him anything he wants me to call him and what do you call colonel castillo his mother asked he said that hes not my uncle so i could call him either sir or charley beth exchanged a long look with her father so this uncle fernando took you for a ride in his airplane did he lieutenant colonel richardson inquired no randy explained somewhat impatiently colonel castillo taught me how to fly uncle fernandos pt i made twenty takeoffs and landings i told you and you found nothing wrong with this dad mrs richardson asked not a thing he said ive always thought of the castillos as family havent you
