iain m banks the player of games culture plate this is the story of a man who went far away for a long time just to play a game the man is a gameplayer called gurgeh the story starts with a battle that is not a battle and ends with a game that is not a game me ill tell you about me later this is how the story begins dust drifted with each footstep he limped across the desert following the suited figure in front the gun was quiet in his hands they must be nearly there the noise of distant surf boomed through the helmet soundfield they were approaching a tall dune from which they ought to be able to see the coast somehow he had survived he had not expected to it was bright and hot and dry outside but inside the suit he was shielded from the sun and the baking air cosseted and cool one edge of the helmet visor was dark where it had taken a hit and the right leg flexed awkwardly also damaged making him limp but otherwise hed been lucky the last time theyd been attacked had been a kilometre back and now they were nearly out of range the flight of missiles cleared the nearest ridge in a glittering arc he saw them late because of the damaged visor he thought the missiles had already started firing but it was only the sunlight reflecting on their sleek bodies the flight dipped and swung together like a flock of birds when they did start firing it was signalled by strobing red pulses of light he raised his gun to fire back the other suited figures in the group had already started firing some dived to the dusty desert floor others dropped to one knee he was the only one standing the missiles swerved again turning all at once and then splitting up to take different directions dust puffed around his feet as shots fell close he tried to aim at one of the small machines but they moved startlingly quickly and the gun felt large and awkward in his hands his suit chimed over the distant noise of firing and the shouts of the other people lights winked inside the helmet detailing the damage the suit shook and his right leg went suddenly numb wake up gurgeh yay laughed alongside him she swivelled on one knee as two of the small missiles swung suddenly at their section of the group sensing that was where it was weakest gurgeh saw the machines coming but the gun sang wildly in his hands and seemed always to be aiming at where the missiles had just been the two machines darted for the space between him and yay one of the missiles flashed once and disintegrated yay shouted exulting the other missile swung between them she lashed out with her foot trying to kick it gurgeh turned awkwardly to fire at it accidentally scattering fire over yays suit as he did so he heard her cry out and then curse she staggered but brought the gun round fountains of dust burst around the second missile as it turned to face them again its red pulses lighting up his suit and filling his visor with darkness he felt numb from the neck down and crumpled to the ground it went black and very quiet you are dead a crisp little voice told him he lay on the unseen desert floor he could hear distant muffled noises sense vibrations from the ground he heard his own heart beat and the ebb and flow of his breath he tried to hold his breathing and slow his heart but he was paralysed imprisoned without control his nose itched it was impossible to scratch it what am i doing here he asked himself sensation returned people were talking and he was staring through the visor at the flattened desert dust a centimetre in front of his nose before he could move somebody pulled him up by one arm he unlatched his helmet yay meristinoux also bareheaded stood looking at him and shaking her head her hands were on her hips her gun swung from one wrist you were terrible she said though not unkindly she had the face of a beautiful child but the slow deep voice was knowing and roguish a lowslung voice the others sat around on the rocks and dust talking a few were heading back to the club house yay picked up gurgehs gun and presented it to him he scratched his nose then shook his head refusing to take the weapon yay he told her this is for children she paused slung her gun over one shoulder and shrugged and the muzzles of both guns swung in the sunlight glinting momentarily and he saw the speeding line of missiles again and was dizzy for a second so she said it isnt boring you said you were bored i thought you might enjoy a shoot he dusted himself down and turned back towards the club house yay walked alongside recovery drones drifted past them collecting the components of the destructed machines its infantile yay why fritter your time away with this nonsense they stopped at the top of the dune the low club house lay a hundred metres away between them and the golden sand and snowwhite surf the sea was bright under the high sun dont be so pompous she told him her short brown hair moved in the same wind which blew the tops from the falling waves and sent the resulting spray curling back out to sea she stooped to where some pieces of a shattered missile lay half buried in the dune picked them up blew sand grains off the shining surfaces and turned the components over in her hands i enjoy it she said i enjoy the sort of games you like but i enjoy this too she looked puzzled this is a game dont you get any pleasure from this sort of thing no and neither will you after a while she shrugged easily till then then she handed him the parts of the disintegrated machine he inspected them while a group of young men passed heading for the firing ranges mr gurgeh one of the young males stopped looking at gurgeh quizzically a fleeting expression of annoyance passed across the older mans face to be replaced by the amused tolerance yay had seen before in such situations jernau morat gurgeh the young man said still not quite sure guilty gurgeh smiled gracefully and yay saw straightened his back fractionally drawing himself up a little the younger mans face lit up he executed a quick formal bow gurgeh and yay exchanged glances an honour to meet you mr gurgeh the young man said smiling widely my names shuroim he laughed i follow all your games i have a complete set of your theoretical works on file gurgeh nodded how comprehensive of you really id be honoured if any time youre here youd play me at well anything deploy is probably my best game i play off three points but whereas my handicap regrettably is lack of time gurgeh said but certainly if the chance ever arises i shall be happy to play you he gave a hint of a nod to the younger man a pleasure to have met you the young man flushed and backed off smiling the pleasures all mine mr gurgeh goodbye goodbye he smiled awkwardly then turned and walked off to join his companions yay watched him go you enjoy all that stuff dont you gurgeh she grinned not at all he said briskly its annoying yay continued to watch the young man walking away looking him up and down as he tramped off through the sand she sighed but what about you gurgeh looked with distaste at the pieces of missile in his hands do you enjoy all this destruction its hardly destruction yay drawled the missiles are explosively dismantled not destroyed i can put one of those things back together in half an hour so its false what isnt intellectual achievement the exercise of skill human feeling yays mouth twisted in irony she said i can see we have a long way to go before we understand each other gurgeh then let me help you be your protégée yes yay looked away to where the rollers fell against the golden beach and then back again as the wind blew and the surf pounded she reached slowly behind her head and brought the suits helmet over clicking it into place he was left staring at the reflection of his own face in her visor he ran one hand through the black locks of his hair yay flicked her visor up ill see you gurgeh chamlis and i are coming round to your place the day after tomorrow arent we if you want i want she winked at him and walked back down the slope of sand he watched her go she handed his gun to a recovery drone as it passed her loaded with glittering metallic debris gurgeh stood for a moment holding the bits of wrecked machine then he let the fragments drop back to the barren sand he could smell the earth and the trees around the shallow lake beneath the balcony it was a cloudy night and very dark just a hint of glow directly above where the clouds were lit by the shining plates of the orbitals distant daylight side waves lapped in the darkness loud slappings against the hulls of unseen boats lights twinkled round the edges of the lake where low college buildings were set amongst the trees the party was a presence at his back something unseen surging like the sound and smell of thunder from the faculty building music and laughter and the scents of perfumes and food and exotic unidentifiable fumes the rush of sharp blue surrounded him invaded him the fragrances on the warm night air spilling from the line of opened doors behind carried on the tide of noise the people made became like separate strands of air fibres unravelling from a rope each with its own distinct colour and presence the fibres became like packets of soil something to be rubbed between his fingers absorbed identified there that redblack scent of roasted meat bloodquickening salivatory tempting and vaguely disagreeable at the same time as separate parts of his brain assessed the odour the animal root smelled fuel proteinrich food the midbrain trunk registered dead incinerated cells while the canopy of forebrain ignored both signals because it knew his belly was full and the roast meat cultivated he could detect the sea too a brine smell from ten or more kilometres away over the plain and the shallow downs another threaded connection like the net and web of rivers and canals that linked the dark lake to the restless flowing ocean beyond the fragrant grasslands and the scented forests sharp blue was a gameplayers secretion a product of standard genofixed culture glands sitting in gurgehs lower skull beneath the ancient animalevolved lower reaches of his brain the panoply of internally manufactured drugs the vast majority of culture individuals were capable of choosing from comprised up to three hundred different compounds of varying degrees of popularity and sophistication sharp blue was one of the least used because it brought no direct pleasure and required considerable concentration to produce but it was good for games what seemed complicated became simple what appeared insoluble became soluble what had been unknowable became obvious a utility drug an abstractionmodifier not a sensory enhancer or a sexual stimulant or a physiological booster and he didnt need it that was what was revealed as soon as the first rush died away and the plateau phase took over the lad he was about to play whose previous game of fourcolours he had just watched had a deceptive style but an easily mastered one it looked impressive but it was mostly show fashionable intricate but hollow and delicate too finally vulnerable gurgeh listened to the sounds of the party and the sounds of the lake waters and the sounds coming from the other university buildings on the far side of the lake the memory of the young mans playing style remained clear dispense with it he decided there and then let the spell collapse something inside him relaxed like a ghost limb untensed a mindtrick the spell the brains equivalent of some tiny crude looping subprogramme collapsed simply ceased to be said he stood on the terrace by the lake for a while then turned and went back into the party jernau gurgeh i thought youd run off he turned to face the small drone which had floated up to him as he reentered the richly furnished hall people stood talking or clustered around gameboards and tables beneath the great banners of ancient tapestries there were dozens of drones in the room too some playing some watching some talking to humans a few in the formal latticelike arrangements which meant they were communicating by transceiver mawhrinskel the drone which had addressed him was by far the smallest of the machines present it could have sat comfortably on a pair of hands its aura field held shifting hints of grey and brown within the band of formal blue it looked like a model of an intricate and oldfashioned spacecraft gurgeh scowled at the machine as it followed him through the crowds of people to the fourcolours table i thought perhaps this toddler had scared you the drone said as gurgeh arrived at the young mans gametable and sat down in a tall heavily ornamented wooden chair hurriedly vacated by his justbeaten predecessor the drone had spoken loudly enough for the toddler concerned a touslehaired man of about thirty or so to hear the young mans face looked hurt gurgeh sensed the people around him grow a little quieter mawhrinskels aura fields switched to a mixture of red and brown humorous pleasure and displeasure together a contrary signal close to a direct insult ignore this machine gurgeh told the young man acknowledging his nod it likes to annoy people he pulled his chair in adjusted his old unfashionably loose and widesleeved jacket im jernau gurgeh and you stemli fors the young man said gulping a little pleased to meet you now what colour are you taking aah green fine gurgeh sat back he paused then waved at the board well after you the young man called stemli fors made his first move gurgeh sat forward to make his and the drone mawhrinskel settled on his shoulder humming to itself gurgeh tapped the machines casing with one finger and it floated off a little way for the rest of the game it mimicked the snicking sound the pointhinged pyramids made as they were clicked over gurgeh beat the young man easily he even finessed the finish a little taking advantage of forss confusion to produce a pretty pattern at the end sweeping one piece round four diagonals in a machinegun clatter of rotating pyramids drawing the outline of a square across the board in red like a wound several people clapped others muttered appreciatively gurgeh thanked the young man and stood up cheap trick mawhrinskel said for all to hear the kid was easy meat youre losing your touch its field flashed bright red and it bounced through the air over peoples heads and away gurgeh shook his head then strode off the little drone annoyed and amused him in almost equal parts it was rude insulting and frequently infuriating but it made such a refreshing change from the awful politeness of most people no doubt it had swept off to annoy somebody else now gurgeh nodded to a few people as he moved through the crowd he saw the drone chamlis amalkney by a long low table talking to one of the less insufferable professors gurgeh went over to them taking a drink from a waiting tray as it floated past ah my friend chamlis amalkney said the elderly drone was a metre and a half tall and over half a metre wide and deep its plain casing matt with the accumulated wear of millennia it turned its sensing band towards him the professor and i were just talking about you professor boruelals severe expression translated into an ironic smile fresh from another victory jernau gurgeh does it show he said raising the glass to his lips i have learned to recognise the signs the professor said she was twice gurgehs age well into her second century but still tall and handsome and striking her skin was pale and her hair was white as it always had been and cropped another of my students humiliated gurgeh shrugged he drained the glass looked round for a tray to put it on allow me chamlis amalkney murmured gently taking the glass from his hand and placing it on a passing tray a good three metres away its yellowtinged field brought back a full glass of the same rich wine gurgeh accepted it boruelal wore a dark suit of soft fabric lightened at throat and knees by delicate silver chains her feet were bare which gurgeh thought did not set off the outfit as say a pair of heeled boots might have done but it was the most minor of eccentricities compared to those of some of the university staff gurgeh smiled looking down at the womans toes tan upon the blond wooden flooring youre so destructive gurgeh boruelal told him why not help us instead become part of the facility instead of an itinerant guest lecturer ive told you professor im too busy i have more than enough games to play papers to write letters to answer guest trips to make and besides id get bored i bore easily you know gurgeh said and looked away jernau gurgeh would make a very bad teacher chamlis amalkney agreed if a student failed to understand something immediately no matter how complicated and involved gurgeh would immediately lose all patience and quite probably pour their drink over them if nothing worse so ive heard the professor nodded gravely that was a year ago gurgeh said frowning and yay deserved it he scowled at the old drone well the professor said looking momentarily at chamlis perhaps we have found a match for you jernau gurgeh theres a young then there was a crash in the distance and the background noise in the hall increased they each turned at the sound of people shouting oh not another commotion the professor said tiredly already that evening one of the younger lecturers had lost control of a pet bird which had gone screeching and stooping through the hall tangling in the hair of several people before the drone mawhrinskel intercepted the animal in midair and knocked it unconscious much to the chagrin of most of the people at the party what now boruelal sighed excuse me she absently left glass and savoury on chamlis amalkneys broad flat top and moved off excusing her way through the crowd towards the source of the upheaval chamliss aura flickered a displeased greywhite it set the glass down noisily on the table and threw the savoury into a distant bin its that dreadful machine mawhrinskel chamlis said testily gurgeh looked over the crowd to where all the noise was coming from really he said what causing all the rumpus i really dont know why you find it so appealing the old drone said it picked up boruelals glass again and poured the pale gold wine out into an outstretched field so that the liquid lay cupped in midair as though in an invisible glass it amuses me gurgeh replied he looked at chamlis boruelal said something about finding a match for me was that what you were talking about earlier yes it was some new student theyve found a gsv cabinbrat with a gift for stricken gurgeh raised one eyebrow stricken was one of the more complex games in his repertoire it was also one of his best there were other human players in the culture who could beat him though they were all specialists at the game not general gameplayers as he was but not one of them could guarantee a win and they were few and far between probably only ten in the whole population so who is this talented infant the noise on the far side of the room had lessened its a young woman chamlis said slopping the fieldheld liquid about and letting it dribble through thin strands of hollow invisible force just arrived here came off the cargo cult still settling in the general systems vehicle cargo cult had stopped off at chiark orbital ten days earlier and left only two days ago gurgeh had played a few multiple exhibition matches on the craft and been secretly delighted that they had been clean sweeps he hadnt been beaten in any of the various games but he hadnt played stricken at all a few of his opponents had mentioned something about a supposedly brilliant though shy young gameplayer on the vehicle but he or she hadnt turned up as far as gurgeh knew and hed assumed the reports of this prodigys powers were much exaggerated ship people tended to have a quaint pride in their craft they liked to feel that even though they had been beaten by the great gameplayer their vessel still had the measure of him somewhere of course the ship itself did but that didnt count they meant people humans or value drones you are a mischievous and contrary device boruelal said to the drone mawhrinskel floating at her shoulder its aura field orange with wellbeing but circled with little purple motes of unconvincing contrition oh mawhrinskel said brightly do you really think so talk to this appalling machine jernau gurgeh the professor said frowning momentarily at the top of chamlis amalkneys casing then picking up a fresh glass chamlis poured the liquid it had been playing with into boruelals original glass and replaced it on the table what have you been doing now gurgeh asked mawhrinskel as it floated near his face anatomy lesson it said its fields collapsing to a mixture of formal blue and brown illhumour a chirlip was found on the terrace boruelal explained looking accusingly at the little drone it was wounded somebody brought it in and mawhrinskel offered to treat it i wasnt busy mawhrinskel interjected reasonably it killed and dissected it in front of all the people the professor sighed they were most upset it would have died from shock anyway mawhrinskel said theyre fascinating creatures chirlips those cute little furfolds conceal partially cantilevered bones and the looped digestive system is quite fascinating but not when people are eating boruelal said selecting another savoury from the tray it was still moving she added glumly she ate the savoury residual synaptic capacitance explained mawhrinskel or bad taste as we machines call it chamlis amalkney said an expert in that are you amalkney mawhrinskel inquired i bow to your superior talents in that field chamlis snapped back gurgeh smiled chamlis amalkney was an old and ancient friend the drone had been constructed over four thousand years ago it claimed it had forgotten the exact date and nobody had ever been impolite enough to search out the truth gurgeh had known the drone all his life it had been a friend of the family for centuries mawhrinskel was a more recent acquaintance the irascible illmannered little machine had arrived on chiark orbital only a couple of hundred days earlier another untypical character attracted there by the worlds exaggerated reputation for eccentricity mawhrinskel had been designed as a special circumstances drone for the cultures contact section effectively a military machine with a variety of sophisticated hardened sensory and weapons systems which would have been quite unnecessary and useless on the majority of drones as with all sentient culture constructs its precise character had not been fully mapped out before its construction but allowed to develop as the drones mind was put together the culture regarded this unpredictable factor in its production of conscious machines as the price to be paid for individuality but the result was that not every drone so brought into being was entirely suitable for the tasks it had initially been designed for mawhrinskel was one such rogue drone its personality it had been decided wasnt right for contact not even for special circumstances it was unstable belligerent and insensitive and those were only the grounds it had chosen to tell people it had failed on it had been given the choice of radical personality alteration in which it would have had little or no say in its own eventual character or a life outside contact with its personality intact but its weapons and its more complex communications and sensory systems removed to bring it down to something nearer the level of a standard drone it had bitterly chosen the latter and it had made its way to chiark orbital where it hoped it might fit in meatbrain mawhrinskel told chamlis amalkney and zoomed off towards the line of open windows the older drones aura field flashed white with anger and a bright rippling spot of rainbow light revealed that it was using its tightbeam transceiver to communicate with the departing machine mawhrinskel stopped in midair turned gurgeh held his breath wondering what chamlis could have said and what the smaller drone might say in reply knowing that it wouldnt bother to keep its remarks secret as chamlis had what i resent it said slowly from a couple of metres away is not what i have lost but what i have gained in coming even remotely to resemble fatigued pathpolished geriatrics like you who havent even got the human decency to die when theyre obsolete youre a waste of matter amalkney mawhrinskel became a mirrored sphere and in that ostentatiously uncommunicable mode swept out of the hall into the darkness cretinous whelp chamlis said fields frosty blue boruelal shrugged i feel sorry for it i dont gurgeh said i think it has a wonderful time he turned to the professor when do i get to meet your young stricken genius not hiding her away to train her are you no were just giving her time to adjust boruelal picked at her teeth with the pointed end of the savoury stick from what i can gather the girl had rather a sheltered upbringing sounds like she hardly left the gsv she must feel odd being here also she isnt here to do gametheory jernau gurgeh id better point that out shes going to study philosophy gurgeh looked suitably surprised a sheltered upbringing chamlis amalkney said on a gsv its gunmetal aura indicated puzzlement shes shy shed have to be i must meet her said gurgeh you will boruelal said soon maybe she said she might come with me to tronze for the next concert hafflis runs a game there doesnt he usually gurgeh agreed maybe shell play you there but dont be surprised if you just intimidate her i shall be the epitome of gentle good grace gurgeh assured her boruelal nodded thoughtfully she gazed out over the party and looked distracted for a second as a large cheer sounded from the centre of the hall excuse me she said i think i detect a nascent commotion she moved away chamlis amalkney shifted aside to avoid being used as a table again the professor took her glass with her did you meet yay this morning chamlis asked gurgeh he nodded she had me dressed up in a suit toting a gun and shooting at toy missiles which explosively dismantled themselves you didnt enjoy it not at all i had high hopes for that girl but too much of that sort of nonsense and i think her intelligence will explosively dismantle well such diversions arent for everybody she was just trying to be helpful youd said you were feeling restless looking for something new well that wasnt it gurgeh said and felt suddenly inexplicably saddened he and chamlis watched as people began to move past them heading towards the long line of windows which opened on to the terrace there was a dull buzzing sensation inside the mans head he had entirely forgotten that coming down from sharp blue required a degree of internal monitoring if you were to avoid an uncomfortable hangover he watched the people pass with a slight feeling of nausea must be time for the fireworks chamlis said yes lets get some fresh air shall we just what i need chamlis said aura dully red gurgeh put his glass down and together he and the old drone joined the flow of people spilling from the bright tapestryhung hall on to the floodlit terrace facing the dark lake rain hit the windows with a noise like the crackling of the logs on the fire the view from the house at ikroh down the steep wooded slope to the fjord and across it to the mountains on the other side was warped and distorted by the water running down the glass and sometimes low clouds flowed round the turrets and cupolas of gurgehs home like wet smoke yay meristinoux took a large wroughtiron poker from the hearth and putting one booted foot up on the elaborately carved stone of the fire surround and one pale brown hand on the ropelike edge of the massive mantelpiece stabbed at one of the spitting logs lying burning in the grate sparks flew up the tall chimney to meet the falling rain chamlis amalkney was floating near the window watching the dull grey clouds the wooden door set into one comer of the room swung open and gurgeh appeared bearing a tray with hot drinks he wore a loose light robe over dark baggy trousers slippers made small slapping noises on his feet as he crossed the room he put the tray down looked at yay thought of a move yet yay crossed over to look morosely at the gameboard shaking her head no she said i think youve won look gurgeh said adjusting a few of the pieces his hands moved quickly like a magicians over the board though yay followed every move she nodded yes i see but she tapped a hex gurgeh had repositioned one of her pieces on so giving her a potentially winning formation only if id doublesecured that blocking piece two moves earlier she sat down on the couch taking her drink with her raising her glass to the quietly smiling man on the opposite couch she said cheers to the victor you almost won gurgeh told her fortyfour moves youre getting very good relatively yay said drinking only relatively she lay back on the deep couch while gurgeh put the pieces back to their starting positions and chamlis amalkney drifted over to float notquitebetween them you know yay said looking at the ornate ceiling i always like the way this house smells gurgeh she turned to look at the drone dont you chamlis the machines aura field dipped briefly to one side a drone shrug yes probably because the wood our host is burning is bonise it was developed millennia ago by the old waverian civilisation specifically for its fragrance when ignited yes well its a nice smell yay said getting up and going back to the windows she shook her head sure as shit rains a lot here though gurgeh its the mountains the man explained yay glanced round one eyebrow arched you dont say gurgeh smiled and smoothed one hand over his neatly trimmed beard how is the landscaping going yay i dont want to talk about it she shook her head at the continuing downpour what weather she tossed her drink back no wonder you live by yourself gurgeh oh that isnt the rain yay gurgeh said thats me nobody can stand to live with me for long he means chamlis said that he couldnt stand to live for long with anybody id believe either yay said coming back to the couch again she sat crosslegged on it and played with one of the pieces on the gameboard what did you think of the game chamlis you have reached the likely limits of your technical ability but your flair continues to develop i doubt youll ever beat gurgeh though hey yay said pretending injured pride im just a junior ill improve she tapped one set of fingernails against the other and made a tutting noise with her mouth like im told i will at landscaping you having problems chamlis said yay looked as though she hadnt heard for a moment then sighed lay back on the couch yeah that asshole elrstrid and that prissy fucking preashipleyl machine theyre so unadventurous they just wont listen what wont they listen to ideas yay shouted at the ceiling something different something not so goddamn conservative for a change just because im young they wont pay attention i thought they were pleased with your work chamlis said gurgeh was sitting back in his couch swilling the drink in his glass round and just watching yay oh they like me to do all the easy stuff yay said sounding suddenly tired stick up a range or two carve out a couple of lakes but im talking about the overall plan real radical stuff all were doing is building just another nextdoor plate could be one of a million anywhere in the galaxy whats the point of that so people can live on it chamlis suggested fields rosy people can live anywhere yay said levering herself up from the couch to look at the drone with her bright green eyes theres no shortage of plates im talking about art what did you have in mind gurgeh asked how about yay said magnetic fields under the base material and magnetised islands floating over oceans no ordinary land at all just great floating lumps of rock with streams and lakes and vegetation and a few intrepid people doesnt that sound more exciting more exciting than what gurgeh asked more exciting than this meristinoux leapt up and went over to the window she tapped the ancient pane look at that you might as well be on a planet seas and hills and rain wouldnt you rather live on a floating island sailing through the air over the water what if the islands collide chamlis asked what if they do yay turned to look at the man and the machine it was getting still darker outside and the room lights were slowly brightening she shrugged anyway you could make it so they didnt but dont you think its a wonderful idea why should one old woman and a machine be able to stop me well chamlis said i know the preashipleyl machine and if it thought your idea was good it wouldnt just ignore it its had a lot of experience and yeah yay said too much experience that isnt possible young lady the drone said yay meristinoux took a deep breath and seemed about to argue but just spread her arms wide and rolled her eyes and turned back to the window well see she said the afternoon which had been steadily darkening until then was suddenly lit up on the far side of the fjord by a bright splash of sunlight filtering through the clouds and the easing rain the room slowly filled with a watery glow and the house lights dimmed again wind moved the tops of the dripping trees ah yay said stretching her back and flexing her arms not to worry she inspected the landscape outside critically hell im going for a run she announced she headed for the door in the corner of the room pulling off first one boot then the other throwing the waistcoat over a chair and unbuttoning her blouse youll see she wagged a finger at gurgeh and chamlis floating islands their time has come chamlis said nothing gurgeh looked sceptical yay left chamlis went to the window it watched the girl down to a pair of shorts now run out along the path leading down from the house between the lawns and the forest she waved once without looking back and disappeared into the woods chamlis flickered its fields in response even though yay couldnt see shes handsome it said gurgeh sat back in the couch she makes me feel old oh dont you start feeling sorry for yourself chamlis said floating back from the window gurgeh looked at the hearth stones everything seems grey at the moment chamlis sometimes i start to think im repeating myself that even new games are just old ones in disguise and that nothings worth playing for anyway gurgeh chamlis said matteroffactly and did something it rarely did actually settling physically into the couch letting it take its weight settle up are we talking about games or life gurgeh put his darkcurled head back and laughed games chamlis went on have been your life if theyre starting to pall id understand you might not be so happy with anything else maybe im just disillusioned with games gurgeh said turning a carved gamepiece over in his hands i used to think that context didnt matter a good game was a good game and there was a purity about manipulating rules that translated perfectly from society to society but now i wonder take this deploy he nodded at the board in front of him this is foreign some backwater planet discovered just a few decades ago they play this there and they bet on it they make it important but what do we have to bet with what would be the point of my wagering ikroh say yay wouldnt take the bet certainly chamlis said amused she thinks it rains too much but you see if somebody wanted a house like this theyd already have had one built if they wanted anything in the house gurgeh gestured round the room theyd have ordered it theyd have it with no money no possessions a large part of the enjoyment the people who invented this game experienced when they played it just disappears you call it enjoyment to lose your house your titles your estates your children maybe to be expected to walk out on to the balcony with a gun and blow your brains out thats enjoyment were well free of that you want something you cant have gurgeh you enjoy your life in the culture but it cant provide you with sufficient threats the true gambler needs the excitement of potential loss even ruin to feel wholly alive gurgeh remained silent lit by the fire and the soft glow from the rooms concealed lighting you called yourself morat when you completed your name but perhaps you arent the perfect gameplayer after all perhaps you should have called yourself shequi gambler you know gurgeh said slowly his voice hardly louder than the crackling logs in the fire im actually slightly afraid of playing this young kid he glanced at the drone really because i do enjoy winning because i do have something nobody can copy something nobody else can have im me im one of the best he looked quickly briefly up at the machine again as though ashamed but every now and again i do worry about losing i think what if theres some kid especially some kid somebody younger and just naturally more talented out there able to take that away from me that worries me the better i do the worse things get because the more i have to lose you are a throwback chamlis told him the games the thing thats the conventional wisdom isnt it the fun is what matters not the victory to glory in the defeat of another to need that purchased pride is to show you are incomplete and inadequate to start with gurgeh nodded slowly so they say so everybody else believes but not you i the man seemed to have difficulty finding the right word i exult when i win its better than love its better than sex or any glanding its the only instant when i feel he shook his head his mouth tightened real he said me the rest of the time i feel a bit like that little exspecial circumstances drone mawhrinskel as though ive had some sort of birthright taken away from me ah is that the affinity you feel chamlis said coldly aura to match i wondered what you saw in that appalling machine bitterness gurgeh said sitting back again thats what i see in it it has novelty value at least he got up and went to the fire prodding at the logs with the wroughtiron poker and placing another piece of wood on handling the log awkwardly with heavy tongs this is not a heroic age he told the drone staring at the fire the individual is obsolete thats why life is so comfortable for us all we dont matter so were safe no one person can have any real effect any more contact uses individuals chamlis pointed out it puts people into younger societies who have a dramatic and decisive effect on the fates of entire metacivilisations theyre usually mercenaries not culture but theyre human theyre people theyre selected and used like gamepieces they dont count gurgeh sounded impatient he left the tall fireplace returned to the couch besides im not one of them so have yourself stored until a more heroic age does arrive huh gurgeh said sitting again if it ever does it would seem too much like cheating anyway the drone chamlis amalkney listened to the rain and the fire well it said slowly if its novelty value you want contact never mind sc are the people to go to i have no intention of applying to join contact gurgeh said coming back to the couch being cooped up in a gcu with a bunch of gungho dogooders searching for barbarians to teach is not my idea of either enjoyment or fulfilment i didnt mean that i meant that contact had the best minds the most information they might be able to come up with some ideas any time ive ever been involved with them theyve got things done its a last resort mind you why because theyre tricky devious theyre gamblers too and used to winning hmm gurgeh said and stroked his dark beard i wouldnt know how to go about it he said nonsense chamlis said anyway i have my own connections there id a door slammed holy shit its cold out there yay burst into the room shaking herself her arms were clenched across her chest and her thin shorts were stuck to her thighs her whole body was quivering gurgeh got up from the couch come here to the fire chamlis told the girl yay stood shivering in front of the window dripping water dont just stand there chamlis told gurgeh fetch a towel gurgeh looked critically at the machine then left the room by the time he came back chamlis had persuaded yay to kneel in front of the fire a bowed field over the nape of her neck held her head down to the heat while another field brushed her hair little drops of water fell from her drenched curls to the hearth hissing on the hot flag stones chamlis took the towel from gurgehs hands and the man watched as the machine moved the towel over the young womans body he looked away at one point shaking his head and sat down on the couch again sighing your feet are filthy he told the girl ah it was a good run though yay laughed from beneath the towel with much blowing and whistling and brrbrrs yay was dried she kept the towel wrapped round her and sat legs drawn up on the couch im famished she announced suddenly mind if i make myself something to let me gurgeh said he went through the corner door reappearing briefly to drape yays hide trous over the same chair shed left the waistcoat on what were you talking about yay asked chamlis gurgehs disaffection do any good i dont know the drone admitted yay retrieved her clothes and dressed quickly she sat in front of the fire for a while watching it as the days light faded and the room lights came up gurgeh brought a tray in loaded with sweetmeats and drinks once yay and gurgeh had eaten the three of them played a complicated cardgame of the type gurgeh liked best one that involved bluff and just a little luck they were in the middle of the game when friends of yays and gurgehs arrived their aircraft touching down on a house lawn gurgeh would rather they hadnt used they came in bright and noisy and laughing chamlis retreated to a corner by the window gurgeh played the good host keeping his guests supplied with refreshments he brought a fresh glass to yay where she stood listening with a group of others to a couple of people arguing about education are you leaving with this lot yay gurgeh leant back against the tapestried wall behind dropping his voice a little so that yay had to turn away from the discussion to face him maybe she said slowly her face glowed in the light of the fire youre going to ask me to stay again arent you she swilled her drink around in her glass watching it oh gurgeh said shaking his head and looking up at the ceiling i doubt it i get bored going through the same old moves and responses yay smiled you never know she said one day i might change my mind you shouldnt let it bother you gurgeh its almost an honour you mean to be such an exception mmm she drank i dont understand you he told her because i turn you down because you dont turn anybody else down not so consistently yay nodded frowning at her drink so why not there hed finally said it yay pursed her lips because she said looking up at him it matters to you ah he nodded looking down rubbing his beard i should have feigned indifference he looked straight at her really yay i feel you want to take me yay said like a piece like an area to be had to be possessed suddenly she looked very puzzled theres something very i dont know primitive perhaps about you gurgeh youve never changed sex have you he shook his head or slept with a man another shake i thought so yay said youre strange gurgeh she drained her glass because i dont find men attractive yes youre a man she laughed should i be attracted to myself then yay studied him for a while a small smile flickering on her face then she laughed and looked down well not physically anyway she grinned at him and handed him her empty glass gurgeh refilled it she returned back to the others gurgeh left yay arguing about the place of geology in culture education policy and went to talk to ren myglan a young woman hed been hoping would call in that evening one of the people had brought a pet a protosentient styglian enumerator which padded round the room counting under its slightly fishy breath the slim threelimbed animal blondhaired and waisthigh with no discernible head but lots of meaningful bulges started counting people there were twentythree in the room then it began counting articles of furniture after which it concentrated on legs it wandered up to gurgeh and ren myglan gurgeh looked down at the animal peering at his feet and making vague swaying pawing motions at his slippers he tapped it with his toe say six the enumerator muttered wandering off gurgeh went on talking to the woman after a few minutes standing near her talking occasionally moving a little closer he was whispering into her ear and once or twice he reached round behind her to run his fingers down her spine through the silky dress she wore i said id go on with the others she told him quietly looking down biting her lip and putting her hand behind her holding his where it rubbed at the small of her back some boring band some singer performing for everybody he chided gently taking his hand away smiling you deserve more individual attention ren she laughed quietly nudging him eventually she left the room and didnt return gurgeh strolled over to where yay was gesticulating wildly and extolling the virtues of life on floating magnetic islands then saw chamlis in the corner studiously ignoring the threelegged pet which was staring up at the machine and trying to scratch one of its bulges without falling over he shooed the beast away and talked to chamlis for a while finally the crowd of people left clutching bottles and a few raided trays of sweetmeats the aircraft hissed into the night gurgeh yay and chamlis finished their cardgame gurgeh won well i have to go yay said standing and stretching chamlis also ill come with you we can share a car gurgeh saw them to the house elevator yay buttoned her cloak chamlis turned to gurgeh want me to say anything to contact gurgeh whod been absently looking up the stairs leading to the main house looked puzzledly at chamlis so did yay oh yes gurgeh said smiling he shrugged why not see what our betters can come up with what have i got to lose he laughed i love to see you happy yay said kissing him lightly she stepped into the elevator chamlis followed her yay winked at gurgeh as the door closed my regards to ren she grinned gurgeh stared at the closed door for a moment then shook his head smiling to himself he went back to the lounge where a couple of the house remotedrones were tidying up everything seemed back in place as it should be he went over to the gameboard set between the dark couches and adjusted one of the deploy pieces so that it sat in the centre of its starting hexagon then looked at the couch where yay had sat after shed come back from her run there was a fading patch of dampness there dark on dark he put his hand out hesitantly touched it sniffed his fingers then laughed at himself he took an umbrella and went out to inspect the damage done to the lawn by the aircraft before returning to the house where a light in the squat main tower told that ren was waiting for him the elevator dropped two hundred metres through the mountain then through the bedrock underneath it slowed to cycle through a rotatelock and gently lowered itself through the metre of ultradense base material to stop underneath the orbital plate in a transit gallery where a couple of underground cars waited and the outside screens showed sunlight blazing up on to the plate base yay and chamlis got into a car told it where they wanted to go and sat down as it unlocked itself turned and accelerated away contact yay said to chamlis the floor of the small car hid the sun and beyond the sidescreens stars shone sharply the car whizzed by some of the arrays of the vital but generally indecipherably obscure equipment that hung beneath every plate did i hear the name of the great benign bogy being mentioned i suggested gurgeh might contact contact chamlis said it floated to a screen the screen detached itself still showing the view outside and floated up the car wall until the decimetre of space its thickness had occupied in the skin of the vehicle was revealed where the screen had pretended to be a window was now a real window a slab of transparent crystal with hard vacuum and the rest of the universe on the other side chamlis looked out at the stars it occurred to me they might have some ideas something to occupy him i thought you were wary of contact i am generally but i know a few of the minds i still have some connections id trust them to help i think i dont know yay said were all taking this awful seriously hell come out of it hes got friends nothing too terribles going to happen to him as long as his pals are around hmm the drone said the car stopped at one of the elevator tubes serving the village where charnlis amalkney lived will we see you in tronze the drone asked no ive a site conference that evening yay said and then theres a young fellow i saw at the shoot the other day ive arranged to bump into him that night she grinned i see chamlis said lapsing into predatory mode eh well enjoy your bumping ill try yay laughed she and the drone bade each other goodnight then charnlis went through the cars lock its ancient minutely battered casing suddenly bright in the blast of sunlight from underneath and went straight up the elevator tube without waiting for a lift yay smiled and shook her head at such geriatric precocity as the car pulled away again ren slept on half covered by a sheet her black hair spilled across the top of the bed gurgeh sat at his occasional desk near the balcony windows looking out at the night the rain had passed the clouds thinned and separated and now the light of the stars and the four plates on the far balancing side of the chiark orbital three million kilometres away and with their inner faces in daylight cast a silvery sheen on the passing clouds and made the dark fjord waters glitter he turned on the deskpad pressed its calibrated margin a few times until he found the relevant publications then read for a while papers on gametheory by other respected players reviews of some of their games analyses of new games and promising players he opened the windows later and stepped out on to the circular balcony shivering a little as the cool night air touched his nakedness hed taken his pocket terminal with him and braved the cold for a while talking to the dark trees and the silent fjord dictating a new paper on old games when he went back in ren myglan was still asleep but breathing quickly and erratically intrigued he went over to her and crouched down by the side of the bed looking intently at her face as it twitched and contorted in her sleep her breath laboured in her throat and down her delicate nose and her nostrils flared gurgeh squatted like that for some minutes with an odd expression on his face somewhere between a sneer and a sad smile wondering with a sense of vague frustration even regret what sort of nightmares the young woman must be having to make her quiver and pant and whimper so the next two days passed relatively uneventfully he spent most of the time reading papers by other players and theorists and finished a paper of his own which hed started the night ren myglan stayed ren had left during breakfast the next morning after an argument he liked to work during breakfast shed wanted to talk hed suspected she was just tetchy after not sleeping well he caught up on some correspondence mostly it was in the form of requests to visit other worlds take part in great tournaments write papers comment on new games become a teacherlecturer professor in various educational establishments be a guest on any one of several gsvs take on suchandsuch a child prodigy it was a long list he turned them all down it gave him a rather pleasant feeling there was a communication from a gcu which claimed to have discovered a world on which there was a game based on the precise topography of individual snowflakes a game which for that reason was never played on the same board twice gurgeh had never heard of such a game and could find no mention of it in the usually uptodate files contact collated for people like him he suspected the game was a fake gcus were notoriously mischievous but sent a considered and germain if also rather ironic reply because the joke if it was a joke appealed to him he watched a gliding competition over the mountains and cliffs on the far side of the fjord he turned on the house holoscreen and watched a recently made entertainment hed heard people talking about it concerned a planet whose intelligent inhabitants were sentient glaciers and their iceberg children he had expected to despise its preposterousness but found it quite amusing he sketched out a glacier game based on what sort of minerals could be gouged from rocks what mountains destroyed rivers dammed landscapes created and bays blocked if as in the entertainment glaciers could liquefy and refreeze parts of themselves at will the game was diverting enough but contained nothing original he abandoned it after an hour or so he spent much of the next day swimming in ikrohs basement pool when doing the backstroke he dictated as well his pocket terminal tracking up and down the pool with him just overhead in the late afternoon a woman and her young daughter came riding through the forest and stopped off at ikroh neither of them showed any sign of having heard of him they just happened to be passing he invited them to stay for a drink and made them a late lunch they tethered their tall panting mounts in the shade at the side of the house where the drones gave them water he advised the woman on the most scenic route to take when she and her daughter resumed their journey and gave the child a piece from a highly ornamented bataos set shed admired he took dinner on the terrace the terminal screen open and showing the pages of an ancient barbarian treatise on games the book a millennium old when the civilisation had been contacted two thousand years earlier was limited in its appreciation of course but gurgeh never ceased to be fascinated by the way a societys games revealed so much about its ethos its philosophy its very soul besides barbarian societies had always intrigued him even before their games had the book was interesting he rested his eyes watching the sun going down then went back to it as the darkness deepened the house drones brought him drinks a heavier jacket a light snack as he requested them he told the house to refuse all incoming calls the terrace lights gradually brightened chiarks farside shone whitely overhead coating everything in silver stars twinkled in a cloudless sky gurgeh read on the terminal beeped he looked severely at the camera eye set in one corner of the screen house he said are you going deaf please forgive the override a rather officious and unapologetic voice gurgeh did not recognise said from the screen am i talking to chiarkgevantsa jernau morat gurgeh dam hassease gurgeh stared dubiously at the screen eye he hadnt heard his full name pronounced for years yes my name is loash armascoiap wuhandrahen xato koum gurgeh raised one eyebrow well that should be easy enough to remember might i interrupt you sir you already have what do you want to talk with you despite my override this does not constitute an emergency but i can only talk to you directly this evening i am here representing the contact section at the request of dastaveb chamlis amalkney ephandra thedreiskre ostlehoorp may i approach you providing you can stay off the full names yes gurgeh said i shall be there directly gurgeh snapped the screen shut he tapped the penlike terminal on the edge of the wooden table and looked out over the dark fjord watching the dim lights of the few houses on the far shore he heard a roaring noise in the sky and looked up to see a farsidelit vapourtrail overhead steeply angled and pointing to the slope uphill from ikroh there was a muffled bang over the forest above the house and a noise like a sudden gust of wind then zooming round the side of the house came a small drone its fields bright blue and striped yellow it drifted over towards gurgeh the machine was about the same size as mawhrinskel it could gurgeh thought have sat comfortably in the rectangular sandwich plate on the table its gunmetal casing looked a little more complicated and knobbly than mawhrinskels good evening gurgeh said as the small machine cleared the terrace wall it settled down on the table by the sandwich plate good evening morat gurgeh contact eh gurgeh said putting his terminal into a pocket in his robe that was quick i was only talking to chamlis the night before last i happened to be in the volume the machine explained in its clipped voice in transit between the gcu flexible demeanour and the gsv unfortunate conflict of evidence aboard the drou zealot as the nearest contact operative i was the obvious choice to visit you however as i say i can only stay for a short time oh what a pity gurgeh said yes you have such a charming orbital here perhaps some other time well i hope it hasnt been a wasted journey for you loash i wasnt really expecting an audience with a contact operative my friend chamlis just thought contact might i dont know have something interesting which wasnt in general circulation i expected nothing at all or just information might i ask just what youre doing here he leant forward putting both elbows on the table leaning over the small machine there was one sandwich left on the plate just in front of the drone gurgeh took it and ate munching and looking at the machine certainly i am here to ascertain just how open to suggestions you are contact might be able to find you something which would interest you a game i have been given to understand it is connected with a game that does not mean you have to play one with me gurgeh said brushing his hands free of crumbs over the plate a few crumbs flew towards the drone as hed hoped they might but it fielded each one flicking them neatly to the centre of the plate in front of it all i know sir is that contact might have found something to interest you i believe it to be connected with a game i am instructed to discover how willing you might be to travel i therefore assume the game if such it is is to be played in a location besides chiark travel gurgeh said he sat back where how far how long i dont know exactly well try approximately i would not like to guess how long would you be prepared to spend away from home gurgehs eyes narrowed the longest hed spent away from chiark had been when hed gone on a cruise once thirty years earlier he hadnt enjoyed it especially hed gone more because it was the done thing to travel at that age than because hed wanted to the different stellar systems had been spectacular but you could see just as good a view on a holoscreen and he still didnt really understand what people saw in actually having been in any particular system hed planned to spend a few years on that cruise but gave up after one gurgeh rubbed his beard perhaps half a year or so its hard to say without knowing the details say that though say half a year not that i can see its necessary local colour rarely adds that much to a game normally true the machine paused i understand this might be rather a complicated game it might take a while to learn it is likely you would have to devote yourself to it for some time im sure ill manage gurgeh said the longest it had taken him to learn any game had been three days he hadnt forgotten any rule of any game in all his life nor ever had to learn one twice very well the small drone said suddenly on that basis i shall report back farewell morat gurgeh it started to accelerate into the sky gurgeh looked up at it mouth open he resisted the urge to jump up is that it he said the small machine stopped a couple of metres up thats all im allowed to talk about ive asked you what i was supposed to ask you now i report back why is there anything else you would like to know i might be able to help you with yes gurgeh said annoyed now do i get to hear anything else about whatever and wherever it is youre talking about the machine seemed to waver in the air its fields hadnt changed since its arrival eventually it said jernau gurgeh there was a long moment when they were both silent gurgeh stared at the machine then stood up put both hands on his hips and his head to one side and shouted yes probably not the drone snapped and instantly rose straight up fields flicking off he heard the roaring noise and saw the vapourtrail form it was a single tiny cloud at first because he was right underneath it then it lengthened slowly for a few seconds before suddenly ceasing to grow he shook his head he took out the pocket terminal house he said raise that drone he continued to stare into the sky which drone jernau the house said chamlis he stared at the terminal no that little scumbag from contact loash armascoiap wuhandrahen xato koum thats who the one that was just here just here the house said in its puzzled voice gurgeh sagged he sat down you didnt see or hear anything just now nothing but silence for the last eleven minutes gurgeh since you told me to hold all calls there have been two of those since but never mind gurgeh sighed get me hub hub here makil strabey mind subsection jernau gurgeh what can we do for you gurgeh was still looking at the sky overhead partly because that was where the contact drone had gone the thin vapourtrail was starting to expand and drift and partly because people tended to look in the direction of the hub when they were talking to it he noticed the extra star just before it started to move the lightpoint was near the trailing end of the little drones farsidelit contrail he frowned almost immediately it moved only moderately fast at first then too quickly for the eye to anticipate it disappeared he was silent for a moment then said hub has a contact ship just left here doing so even as we speak gurgeh the demilitarised rapid offensive unit zealot gurgeh said hoho it was you was it we thought it was going to take months to work that one out youve just seen a private visit gameplayer gurgeh contact business not for us to know wow were we inquisitive though very glamorous jernau if we may say so that ship crashstopped from at least forty kilolights and swerved twenty years just for a fiveminute chat with you it would seem that is serious energy usage especially as its accelerating away just as fast look at that kid go oh sorry you cant well take it from us were impressed care to tell a humble hub mind subsection what it was all about any chance of contacting the ship gurgeh said ignoring the question dragging away like that business end pointed straight back at a mere civilian machine like ourselves the hub mind sounded amused yeah we suppose so i want a drone on it called loash armascoiap wuhandrahen xato koum holy shit gurgeh what are you tangling with here handrahen xato thats equivtech espionagelevel sc nomenclature heavy messing shit well try just a moment gurgeh waited in silence for a few seconds nothing the voice from the terminal said gurgeh this is hub entire speaking here not a subsection all of me that ships acknowledging but its claiming there is no drone of that name or anything like it aboard gurgeh slumped back in the seat his neck was stiff he looked down from the stars down at the table you dont say he said shall i try again think itll do any good no then dont gurgeh this disturbs me what is going on i wish gurgeh said i knew he looked up at the stars again the little drones ghostly vapourtrail had almost disappeared get me chamlis amalkney will you on line jernau what hub be careful oh thanks thanks a lot you must have annoyed it chamlis said through the terminal very likely gurgeh said but what do you think they were sizing you up for something you think so yes but you just refused the deal did i yes and think yourself lucky you did too what do you mean this was your idea look youre out of it its over but obviously my request went further and quicker than i thought it would we triggered something but youve put them off they arent interested any more hmm i suppose youre right gurgeh im sorry never mind gurgeh told the old machine he looked up at the stars hub hey were interested if it had been purely personal we wouldnt have listened to a word we swear and besides itd be notified on your daily communication statement we were listening never mind all that gurgeh smiled oddly relieved the orbitals mind had been eavesdropping just tell me how far away that rou is on the word is it was a minute and fortynine seconds away a light month distant already clear of the system and well out of our jurisdiction were very glad to say hightailing it in a direction a little upspin of galactic core looks like its heading for the gsv unfortunate conflict of evidence unless one of thems trying to fool somebody thank you hub goodnight to you too and youre on your own this time we promise thank you hub chamlis you might just have missed the chance of a lifetime gurgeh but it was more likely a narrow escape im sorry for suggesting contact they came too fast and too hard to be casual dont worry so much chamlis he told the drone he looked back at the stars again and sat back swinging his foot up on to the table i handled it we managed will i see you at tronze tomorrow maybe i dont know ill think about it good luck i mean against this wonderchild at stricken if i dont see you tomorrow he grinned ruefully into the darkness thanks goodnight chamlis goodnight gurgeh the train emerged from the tunnel into bright sunlight it banked round the remainder of the curve then set out across the slender bridge gurgeh looked over the handrail and saw the lush green pastures and brightly winding river half a kilometre below on the valley floor shadows of mountains lay across the narrow meadows shadows of clouds freckled the treecovered hills themselves the wind of the trains slipstream ruffled his hair as he drank in the sweet scented mountain air and waited for his opponent to return birds circled in the distance over the valley almost level with the bridge their cries sounded through the still air just audible over the windrush sound of the trains passing normally hed have waited until he was due in tronze that evening and go there underground but that morning hed felt like getting away from ikroh hed put on boots a pair of conservatively styled pants and a short open jacket then taken to the hill paths hiking over the mountain and down the other side hed sat by the side of the old railway line glanding a mild buzz and amusing himself by chucking little bits of lodestone into the tracks magnetic field and watching them bounce out again hed thought about yays floating islands hed also thought about the mysterious visitation from the contact drone on the previous evening but somehow that just would not come clear it was as though it had been a dream he had checked the house communication and systems statement as far as the house was concerned there had been no visit but his conversation with chiark hub was logged timed and witnessed by other subsections of the hub and by the hub entire for a short while so it had happened all right hed flagged down the antique train when it appeared and even as hed climbed on had been recognised by a middleaged man called dreltram also making his way to tronze mr dreltram would treasure a defeat at the hands of the great jernau gurgeh more than victory over anybody else would he play gurgeh was well used to such flattery it usually masked an unrealistic but slightly feral ambition but had suggested they play possession it shared enough ruleconcepts with stricken to make it a decent limberingup exercise theyd found a possession set in one of the bars and taken it out on to the roofdeck sitting behind a windbreak so that the cards wouldnt blow away they ought to have enough time to complete the game the train would take most of the day to get to tronze a journey an underground car could accomplish in ten minutes the train left the bridge and entered a deep narrow ravine its slipstream producing an eerie echoing noise off the natched rocks on either side gurgeh looked at the gameboard he was playing straight without the help of any glanded substances his opponent was using a potent mixture suggested by gurgeh himself in addition gurgeh had given mr dreltram a sevenpiece lead at the start which was the maximum allowed the fellow wasnt a bad player and had come near to overwhelming gurgeh at the start when his advantage in pieces had the greatest effect but gurgeh had defended well and the mans chance had probably gone though there was still the possibility he might have a few mines left in awkward places thinking of such unpleasant surprises gurgeh realised he hadnt looked at where his own hidden piece was this had been another unofficial way of making the game more even possession is played on a fortysquare grid the two players pieces are distributed in one major group and two minor groups each up to three pieces can be hidden on different initially unoccupied intersections their locations are dialled and locked into three circular cards thin ceramic wafers which are turned over only when the player wishes to bring those pieces into play mr dreltram had already revealed all three of his hidden pieces one had happened to be on the intersection gurgeh had sportingly sown all nine of his mines on which really was bad luck gurgeh had spun the dials on his single hiddenpiece wafer and put it face down on the table without looking at it he had no more idea where that piece was than mr dreltram it might turn out to be in an illegal position which could well lose him the game or less likely it might turn up in a strategically useful place deep inside his opponents territory gurgeh liked playing this way if it wasnt a serious game as well as giving his opponent a probably needed extra advantage it made the game as a whole more interesting and less predictable added an extra spice to the proceedings he supposed he ought to find out where the piece was the eightymove point was fast approaching when the piece had to be revealed anyway he couldnt see his hiddenpiece wafer he looked over the card and waferstrewn table mr dreltram was not the most tidy of players his cards and wafers and unused or removed pieces were scattered over most of the table including the part supposed to be gurgehs a gust of wind when theyd entered a tunnel an hour earlier had almost blown some of the lighter cards away and theyd weighed them down with goblets and leadglass paperweights these added to the impression of confusion as did mr dreltrams quaint if rather affected custom of noting down all the moves by hand on a scratch tablet he claimed the builtin memory on a board had broken down on him once and lost him all record of one of the best games hed ever played gurgeh started lifting bits and pieces up humming to himself and looking for the flat wafer he heard a sudden intake of breath then what sounded like a rather embarrassed cough just behind him he turned round to see mr dreltram behind him looking oddly awkward gurgeh frowned as mr dreltram just returned from the bathroom his eyes wide with the mixture of drugs he was glanding and followed by a tray bearing drinks sat down again staring at gurgehs hands it was only then as the tray set the glasses on the table that gurgeh realised the cards he happened to be holding which he had lifted up to look for his hiddenpiece wafer were mr dreltrams remaining minecards gurgeh looked at them they were still face down he hadnt seen where the mines were and understood what mr dreltram must be thinking he put the cards back where hed found them im very sorry he laughed i was looking for my hidden piece he saw it even as he spoke the words the circular wafer was lying uncovered almost right in front of him on the table ah he said and only then felt the blood rise to his face here it is hmm couldnt see it for looking at it he laughed again and as he did so felt a strange clutching sensation coursing through him seeming to squeeze his guts in something between terror and ecstasy he had never experienced anything like it the closest any sensation had ever come he thought suddenly clearly had been when he was still a boy and hed experienced his first orgasm at the hands of a girl a few years older than him crude purely humanbasic like a single instrument picking out a simple theme a note at a time compared to the drugglandboosted symphonies sex would later become that first time had nevertheless been one of his most memorable experiences not just because it was then novel but because it seemed to open up a whole new fascinating world an entirely different type of sensation and being it had been the same when hed played his first competition game as a child representing chiark against another orbitals junior team and it would be the same again when his drugglands matured a few years after puberty mr dreltram laughed too and wiped his face with a handkerchief gurgeh played furiously for the next few moves and had to be reminded by his opponent when the eightymove deadline came up gurgeh turned over his hidden piece without having checked it first risking it occupying the same square as one of his revealed pieces the hidden piece on a sixteenhundredtoone chance turned up in the same position as the heart the piece the whole game was about the piece ones opponent was trying to take possession of gurgeh stared at the intersection where his welldefended heart piece sat then again at the coordinates hed dialled at random on to the wafer two hours earlier they were the same there was no doubt if he d looked a move earlier he could have moved the heart out of danger but he hadnt hed lost both pieces and with the heart lost the game was lost hed lost oh bad luck mr preltram said clearing his throat gurgeh nodded i believe its customary at such moments of disaster for the defeated player to be given the heart as a keepsake he said fingering the lost piece um so i understand mr dreltram said obviously at once embarrassed on gurgehs behalf and delighted at his good fortune gurgeh nodded he put the heart down lifted the ceramic wafer which had betrayed him id rather have this i think he held it up to mr dreltram who nodded well of course i mean why not i certainly wouldnt object the train rolled quietly into a tunnel slowing for a station set in the caverns inside the mountain all reality is a game physics at its most fundamental the very fabric of our universe results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules and chance the same description may be applied to the best most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games by being unknowable by resulting from events which at the subatomic level cannot be fully predicted the future remains malleable and retains the possibility of change the hope of coming to prevail victory to use an unfashionable word in this the future is a game time is one of the rules generally all the best mechanistic games those which can be played in any sense perfectly such as grid prallian scope nkraytle chess farnic dimensions can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe let alone the reality they are also i might add invariably premachine sentience societies the very firstrank games acknowledge the element of chance even if they rightly restrict raw luck to attempt to construct a game on any other lines no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but technophilosophically lagging several ages behind our own as a historical exercise it might have some value as a work of the intellect its just a waste of time if you want to make something oldfashioned why not build a wooden sailing boat or a steam engine theyre just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game and youll keep fit at the same time gurgeh gave an ironic bow to the young man whod approached him with an idea for a game the fellow looked nonplussed he took a breath and opened his mouth to speak gurgeh was waiting for this as he had on the last five or six occasions when the young man had tried to say something gurgeh interrupted him before hed even started im quite serious you know there is nothing intellectually inferior about using your hands to build something as opposed to using only your brain the same lessons can be learned the same skills acquired at the only levels that really matter he paused again he could see the drone mawhrinskel floating towards him over the heads of the people thronging the broad plaza the main concert was over the mountain summits around tronze echoed to the sounds of various smaller bands as people gravitated towards the specific musical forms they preferred some formal some improvised some for dancing some for experiencing under a specific drugtrance it was a warm cloudy night a little farside light shone a milky halo directly overhead on the high overcast tronze the largest town on both the plate and the orbital had been built on the edge of the gevant plates great central massif at the point where the kilometrehigh lake tronze flowed over the lip of the plateau and tumbled its waters towards the plain below where they fell as a permanent downpour into the rain forest tronze was the home of fewer than a hundred thousand people but to gurgeh it still felt too crowded despite its spacious houses and squares its sweeping galleries and plazas and terraces its thousands of houseboats and its elegant bridgelinked towers tronze for all the fact that chiark was a fairly recent orbital only a thousand or so years old was already almost as big as any orbital community ever grew the cultures real cities were its great ships the general systems vehicles orbitals were its rustic hinterland where people liked to spread themselves out with plenty of elbow room in terms of scale when compared to one of the larger gsvs containing billions of people tronze was barely a village gurgeh usually attended the tronze sixtyfourth day concert and he was usually buttonholed by enthusiasts normally gurgeh was civil if occasionally abrupt tonight after the fiasco on the train and that strange exciting shaming pulse of emotion hed experienced as a result of being thought to cheat not to mention the slight nervousness he felt because hed heard the girl off the gsv cargo cult was indeed here in tronze this evening and looking forward to meeting him he was in no mood to suffer fools gladly not that the unlucky young male was necessarily a complete idiot all hed done was sketch out what had been after all not a bad idea for a game but gurgeh had fallen on him like an avalanche the conversation if you could call it that had become a game the object was to keep talking not to talk continuously which any idiot could do but to pause only when the young man was not signalling through bodily or facial language or actually starting to speak that he wanted to cut in instead gurgeh would stop unexpectedly in the middle of a point or after having just said something mildly insulting but while still giving the impression he was going to keep talking also gurgeh was quoting almost verbatim from one of his own more famous papers on gametheory an added insult as the young man probably knew the text as well as he did to imply gurgeh continued as the young mans mouth started to open again that one can remove the element of luck chance happenstance in life by jernau gurgeh not interrupting anything am i mawhrinskel said nothing of note gurgeh said turning to face the small machine how are you mawhrinskel been up to any fresh mischief nothing of note the tiny drone echoed as the young man gurgeh had been talking to sidled off gurgeh sat in a creepercovered pergola positioned close to one edge of the plaza near the observation platforms which reached out over the broad curtain of the falls where spray rose from the rapids lying between the lip of the lake and the vertical drop to the forest a kilometre below the roaring falls provided a background wash of white noise ive found your young adversary the small drone announced it extended one softly glowing blue field and plucked a nightflower from a growing vine hmm gurgeh said oh the young ah stricken player thats right mawhrinskel said evenly the young ah stricken player it folded some of the nightflowers petals back straining them on the plucked stem i heard she was here gurgeh said shes at haffliss table shall we go and meet her why not gurgeh stood the machine floated away nervous mawhrinskel asked as they headed through the crowds towards one of the raised terraces level with the lake where haffliss apartments were nervous gurgeh said of a child mawhrinskel floated silently for a moment or two as gurgeh climbed some steps gurgeh nodded and said hello to a few people then the machine came close to him and said quietly as it slowly stripped the petals from the dying blossom want me to tell you your heart rate skin receptivity level pheromone signature neuron functionstate its voice trailed off as gurgeh came to a halt halfway up the flight of broad steps he turned to face the drone looking through halfhooded eyes at the tiny machine music drifted over the lake and the air was full of the nightflowers musky scent the lighting set into the stone balustrades lit the gameplayers face from underneath people flooding down the steps from the terrace above laughing and joking parted round the man like waters round a rock and mawhrinskel noticed went oddly quiet as they did so after a few seconds as gurgeh stood there silent breathing evenly the little drone made a shuckling noise not bad it said not bad at all i cant tell just yet what youre glanding but thats a very impressive degree of control everything parametercentred near as damn except your neuron functionstate thats even less like normal than usual but then your average civilian drone probably couldnt spot that well done dont let me detain you mawhrinskel gurgeh said coldly im sure you can find something else to amuse you besides watching me play a game he continued up the broad steps nothing currently on this orbital is capable of detaining me dear mr gurgeh the drone said matteroffactly tearing the last of the petals from the nightflower it dropped the husk in the water channel which ran along the top of the balustrade gurgeh good to see you come sit down estray haffliss party of thirty or so people sat round a huge rectangular stone table set on a balcony jutting out over the falls and covered by stone arches strung with nightflower vines and softly shining paper lanterns there were musicplayers at one end sitting on the edge of the great slab with drums and strings and air instruments they were laughing and playing mostly for themselves each trying to play too fast for the others to follow set into the centre of the table was a long narrow pit full of glowing coals a kind of miniaturised bucketline trundled above the fire carrying little meat and vegetable pieces from one end of the table to the other they were skewered on to the line at one end by one of haftliss children and removed at the other end wrapped in edible paper and thrown with a fair degree of accuracy to anybody who wanted them by haffliss youngest who was only six hafflis was unusual in having had seven children normally people bore one and fathered one the culture frowned on such profligacy but hafflis just liked being pregnant he was in a male stage at the moment however having changed a few years earlier he and gurgeh exchanged pleasantries then hafflis showed the gameplayer to a seat beside professor boruelal who was grinning happily and swaying in her seat she wore a long black and white robe and when she saw gurgeh kissed him noisily on the lips she attempted to kiss mawhrinskel too but it flicked away she laughed and speared a halfdone piece of meat from the line over the centre of the table with a long fork gurgeh meet the lovely olz hap olz jernau gurgeh come on shake hands gurgeh sat down taking the small pale hand of the frightenedlooking girl on boruelals right she was wearing something dark and shapeless and was in her early teens at most he smiled with a slight frown glancing at the professor trying to share the joke of her inebria with the young blonde girl but olz hap was looking at his hand not his face she let her hand be touched but then withdrew it almost immediately she sat on her hands and stared at her plate boruelal breathed deeply seeming to gather herself together she took a drink from a tall glass in front of her well she said looking at gurgeh as though hed only just appeared how are you jernau well enough he watched mawhrinskel manoeuvre itself beside olz hap floating over the table beside her plate fields all formal blue and green friendliness good evening he heard the drone say in its most avuncular voice the girl brought her head up to look at the machine and gurgeh listened to their conversation at the same time as he and boruelal talked hello well enough to play a game of stricken mawhrinskels the name olz hap am i right i think so professor are you well enough to invigilate yes how do you do fuck me no drunk as a desert spring have to get somebody else suppose i could come down in time but naa oh ah shake fields with me eh thats very sweet of you so few people bother how nice to meet you weve all heard so much how about the young lady herself oh oh dear what whats wrong have i said something wrong is she ready to play no its just play what ah youre shy you neednt be nobodyll force you to play least of all gurgeh believe me the game boruelal well i what do you mean now i wouldnt worry if i were you really now or any time well i dont know lets ask her hey kid bor gurgeh began but the professor had already turned to the girl olz want to play this game then the young girl looked straight at gurgeh her eyes were bright in the glare of the line of fire running down the centre of the table if mr gurgeh would like to yes mawhrinskels fields glowed red with pleasure momentarily brighter than the coals oh good it said a fight hafflis had loaned his own ancient stricken set out it took a few minutes for a supply drone to bring one from a town store they set it up at one end of the balcony by the edge overlooking the roaring white falls professor boruelal fumbled with her terminal and put in a request for some adjudicating drones to oversee the match stricken was susceptible to hightech cheating and a serious game required that steps be taken to ensure nothing underhand went on a drone visiting from chiark hub volunteered as did a manufactury drone from the shipyard under the massif one of the universitys own machines would represent olz hap gurgeh turned to mawhrinskel to ask it to be his representative but it said jernau gurgeh i thought you might like chamlis amalkney to represent you is chamlis here arrived a while ago been avoiding me ill ask it gurgehs button terminal beeped yes he said chamliss voice spoke from the button the flydropping just asked me to represent you in a stricken adjudication do you want me to yes id like you to gurgeh said watching mawhrinskels fields flicker white with anger in front of him ill be there in twenty seconds chamlis said closing the channel twentyone point two mawhrinskel said acidly exactly twentyone point two seconds later as chamlis appeared over the edge of the balcony its casing dark against the cataract beyond chamlis turned its sensing band to the smaller machine thank you chamlis said warmly i had a bet on with myself that id have you counting the seconds to my arrival mawhrinskels fields blazed brightly painfully white lighting up the entire balcony for a second people stopped talking and turned the music hesitated the tiny drone seemed almost literally to shake with dumb rage fuck you it screeched at last and seemed to disappear leaving only an afterimage of sunbright blindness behind it in the night the coals blazed bright a wind whipped at clothes and hair several of the paper lanterns bucked and shook and fell from the arches overhead leaves and nightflowers drifted down from the two arches immediately over where mawhrinskel had been floating chamlis amalkney red with happiness tipped to look up into the dark sky where a small hole appeared briefly in the cloud cover oh dear it said do you think i said something to upset it gurgeh smiled and sat down at the gameset did you plan that chamlis amalkney bowed in midair to the other drones and to boruelal not exactly it turned to face olz hap sitting on the far side of the gameweb from gurgeh ah by way of contrast a fair human the girl blushed looked down boruelal made the introductions stricken is played in a threedimensional web stretched inside a metre cube the traditional materials are taken from a certain animal on the planet of origin cured tendon for the web tusk ivory for the frame the set gurgeh and olz hap used was synthetic they each put up their hinged screens took the bags of hollow globes and coloured beads nutshells and stones in the original and selected the beads they wanted locking them in the globes the adjudicating drones ensured there was no possibility of anyone seeing which beads went into which shells then the man and the girl each took a handful of the little spheres and placed them in various places inside the web the game had begun she was good gurgeh was impressed olz hap was impetuous but canny brave but not stupid she was also very lucky but there was luck and luck sometimes you could sniff it out recognise things were going well and would probably continue to go well and play to that if things did keep going right you profited extravagantly if the luck didnt persist well you just played the percentages the girl had that sort of luck that night she made the right guesses about gurgehs pieces capturing several strong beads in weak disguises she anticipated moves hed sealed in the foretell shells and she ignored the tempting traps and feints he set up somehow he struggled on coming up with desperate improvised defences against each attack but it was all too seatofthepants too extemporary and tactical he wasnt being allowed the time to develop his pieces or plan a strategy he was responding following replying he preferred to have the initiative it was some time before he realised just how audacious the girl was being she was going for a full web the simultaneous capture of every remaining point in the gamespace she wasnt just trying to win she was trying to pull off a coup which only a handful of the games greatest players had ever accomplished and which nobody in the culture to gurgehs knowledge had yet achieved gurgeh could hardly believe it but it was what she was doing she was sapping pieces but not obliterating them then falling back she was striking out through his own avenues of weakness then holding there she was inviting him to come back of course giving him a better chance of winning and indeed of achieving the same momentous result though with far less hope of doing so but the selfconfidence of it the experience and even arrogance such a course implied he looked at the slight calmfaced girl through the web of thin wires and little suspended spheres and could not help but admire her ambition her vaulting ability and selfbelief she was playing for the grand gesture and to the gallery not settling for a reasonable win despite the fact that the reasonable win would be over a famous respected gameplayer and boruelal had thought she might feel intimidated by him well good for her gurgeh sat forward rubbing his beard oblivious of the people now packing the balcony silently watching the game he struggled back into it somehow partly luck partly more skill than even he thought he possessed the game was still poised for a full web victory and she was still the most likely to achieve it but at least his position looked less hopeless somebody brought him a glass of water and something to eat he vaguely recalled being grateful the game went on people came and went around him the web held all his fortune the little spheres holding their secret treasures and threats became like discrete parcels of life and death single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged opened looked at all reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning he no longer knew what bodymade drugs washed through him nor could he guess what the girl was using he had lost all sense of self and time the game drifted for a few moves as they both lost concentration then came alive again he became aware very slowly very gradually that he held some impossibly complex model of the contest in his head unknowably dense multifariously planed he looked at that model twisted it the game changed he saw a way to win the full web remained a possibility his now it all depended another twist yes he would win almost certainly but that was no longer enough the full web beckoned tantalisingly seductively entrancingly gurgeh boruelal shook him he looked up there was a hint of dawn over the mountains boruelals face looked grey and sober gurgeh a break its been six hours do you agree a break yes he looked through the web at the pale waxen face of the young girl he gazed round in a sort of daze most of the people had gone the paper lanterns had disappeared too he fell vaguely sorry to have missed the little ritual of throwing the glowing lamps over the terrace edge and watching them drift down to the forest boruelal shook him once more gurgeh yes a break yes of course he croaked he got up stiff and sore muscles protesting and joints creaking chamlis had to stay with the gameset to ensure the adjudication grey dawn spread across the sky somebody gave him some hot soup which he sipped while he ate a few crackers and wandered through the quiet arcades for a while where a few people slept or still sat and talked or danced to quiet recorded music he leant on the balustrade above the kilometre drop sipping and munching dazed and vacant from the game still playing and replaying it somewhere inside his head the lights of the towns and villages on the miststrewn plain below beyond the semicircle of dark rain forest looked pale and uncertain distant mountain tops shone pink and naked jernau gurgeh a soft voice said he looked over the plain the drone mawhrinskel floated a metre from his face mawhrinskel he said quietly good morning good morning how goes the game fine thank you i think ill win now pretty sure in fact but theres just a chance i might win he felt himself smiling famously really mawhrinskel continued to float there over the drop in front of him it kept its voice soft though there was nobody near by its fields were off its surface was an odd mottled mixture of grey tones yes gurgeh said and briefly explained about a full web victory the drone seemed to understand so you have won but you could win the full web which no one in the culture has ever done save for exhibition purposes to prove its possibility thats right he nodded looked over the light speckled plain thats right he finished the crackers brushed his hands slowly free of crumbs he left the soup bowl balanced on the balustrade does it really mawhrinskel said thoughtfully matter who first wins a full web hmm gurgeh said mawhrinskel drifted closer does it really matter who first wins one somebody will but does it count for much who does it would appear to be a very unlikely eventuality in any given game has it really much to do with skill not beyond a certain point gurgeh admitted it requires a lucky genius but that could be you maybe gurgeh smiled across the gulf of chill morning air he drew his jacket closer about him it depends entirely on the disposition of certain coloured beads in certain metal spheres he laughed a victory that would echo round the gameplaying galaxy and it depends on where a child placed his voice trailed off he looked at the tiny drone again frowning sorry getting a bit melodramatic he shrugged leant on the stone edge it would be pleasant to win but its unlikely im afraid somebody else will do it some time but it might as well be you mawhrinskel hissed floating still closer gurgeh had to draw away to focus on the device well why leave it to chance jernau gurgeh mawhrinskel said pulling back a little why abandon it to mere stupid luck what are you talking about gurgeh said slowly eyes narrowing the drugtrance was dissipating the spell breaking he felt keen keyedup nervous and excited at once i can tell you which beads are in which globes mawhrinskel said gurgeh laughed gently nonsense the drone floated closer i can they didnt tear everything out of me when they turned me away from sc i have more senses than cretins like amalkney have even heard of it closed in let me use them let me tell you what is where in your beadgame let me help you to the full web gurgeh stood back from the balustrade shaking his head you cant the other drones are weak simpletons gurgeh mawhrinskel insisted i have the measure of them believe me trust me another sc machine definitely not a contact drone probably not but this gang of obsoletes i could find out where every bead that girl has placed is every single one you wouldnt need them all gurgeh said looking troubled waving his hand well then better yet let me do it just to prove to you to myself youre talking about cheating mawhrinskel gurgeh said looking round the plaza there was nobody near by the paper lanterns and the stone ribs they hung from were invisible from where he stood youre going to win what difference does it make its still cheating you said yourself its all luck youve won not definitely almost certainly a thousand to one you dont probably longer odds than that gurgeh conceded so the game is over the girl cant lose any more than she has already let her be part of a game that will go down in history give her that it gurgeh said slapping his hand on the stonework is another slap still slap cheating keep your voice down mawhrinskel murmured it backed away a little it spoke so low he had to lean out over the drop to hear it its luck all is luck when skills played out it was luck left me with a face that didnt fit in contact its luck thats made you a great gameplayer its luck thats put you here tonight neither of us were fully planned jernau gurgeh your genes determined you and your mothers genofixing made certain you would not be a cripple or mentally subnormal the rest is chance i was brought into being with the freedom to be myself if what that general plan and that particular luck produced is something a majority a majority mark you not all of one sc admissions board decides is not what they just happen to want is it my fault is it no gurgeh sighed looking down oh its all so wonderful in the culture isnt it gurgeh nobody starves and nobody dies of disease or natural disasters and nobody and nothings exploited but theres still luck and heartache and joy theres still chance and advantage and disadvantage the drone hung above the drop and the waking plain gurgeh watched the orbital dawn come up swinging from the edge of the world take hold of your luck gurgeh accept what im offering you just this once lets both make our own chances you already know youre one of the best in the culture im not trying to flatter you you know that but this win would seal that fame for ever if its possible gurgeh said then went silent his jaw clenched the drone sensed him trying to control himself the way he had done on the steps up to haffliss house seven hours ago if it isnt at least have the courage to know mawhrinskel said voice pitched at an extremity of pleading the man raised his eyes to the clear bluepinks of dawn the ruffled misty plain looked like a vast and tousled bed youre crazy drone you could never do it i know what i can do jernau gurgeh the drone said it pulled away again sat in the air regarding him he thought of that morning sitting on the train the rush of that delicious fear like an omen now luck simple chance he knew the drone was right he knew it was wrong but he knew it was right too it all depended on him he leant against the balustrade something in his pocket dug into his chest he felt in pulled out the hiddenpiece wafer hed taken as a memento after the disastrous possession game he turned the wafer over in his hands a few times he looked at the drone and suddenly felt very old and very childlike at the same time if he said slowly anything goes wrong if youre found out im dead ill kill myself brain death complete and utter no remains nothing is going to go wrong for me it is the simplest thing in the world to find out whats inside those shells what if you are discovered though what if there is an sc drone around here somewhere or the hub is watching the drone said nothing for a moment theyd have noticed by now it is already done gurgeh opened his mouth to speak but the drone quickly floated closer calmly continuing for my own sake gurgeh for my own peace of mind i wanted to know too i came back long ago ive been watching for the past five hours quite fascinated i couldnt resist finding out if it was possible to be honest i still dont know the game is beyond me just overcomplicated for the way my poor target tracking mind is configured but i had to try to find out i had to so you see the risk is run gurgeh the deed is done i can tell you what you need to know and i ask nothing in return thats up to you maybe you can do something for me some day but no obligation believe me please believe me no obligation at all im doing this because i want to see you somebody anybody do it gurgeh looked at the drone his mouth was dry he could hear somebody shouting in the distance the terminal button on his jacket shoulder beeped he drew breath to speak to it but then heard his own voice say yes ready to resume jernau chamlis said from the button and he heard his own voice say im on my way he stared at the drone as the terminal beeped off mawhrinskel floated closer as i said jernau gurgeh i can fool these adding machines no problem at all quickly now do you want to know or not the full web yes or no gurgeh glanced round in the direction of haffliss apartments he turned back leant out over the drop towards the drone all right he said whispering just the five prime points and the four verticals nearest topside centre no more mawhrinskel told him it was almost enough the girl struggled brilliantly to the very end and deprived him on the final move the full web fell apart and he won by thirtyone points two short of the cultures existing record one of estray hafftiss house drones was dimly confused to discover while cleaning up under the great stone table much later that morning a crushed and shattered ceramic wafer with warped and twisted numbered dials set into its crazed and distorted surface it wasnt part of the house possession set the machines nonsentient mechanistic entirely predictable brain thought about it for a while then finally decided to junk the mysterious remnant along with the rest of the debris when he woke up that afternoon it was with the memory of defeat it was some time before he recalled that he had in fact won the stricken game victory had never been so bitter he breakfasted alone on the terrace watching a fleet of sailboats cut down the narrow fjord bright sails in a fresh breeze his right hand hurt a little as he held his bowl and cup hed come close to drawing blood when hed crushed the possession wafer at the end of the stricken game he dressed in a long coat trous and short kilt and went on a long walk down to the shore of the fjord and then along it towards the sea coast and the windswept dunes where hassease lay the house hed been born in where a few of his extended family still lived he tramped along the coast path towards the house through the blasted twisted shapes of windmisshapen trees the grass made sighing noises around him and seabirds cried the breeze was cold and freshening under ragged clouds out to sea beyond hassease village where the weather was coming from he could see tall veils of rain under a dark front of stormclouds he drew his coat tighter about him and hurried towards the distant silhouette of the sprawling ramshackle house thinking he should have taken an underground car the wind whipped up sand from the distant beach and threw it inland he blinked eyes watering gurgeh the voice was quite loud louder than the sound of sighing grass and windtroubled tree branches he shielded his eyes looked to one side gurgeh the voice said again he peered into the shade of a stunted slanting tree mawhrinskel is that you the same the small drone said floating forward over the path gurgeh looked out to sea he started down the path to the house again but the drone did not follow him well he told it looking back from a few paces away i must keep going ill get wet if i no mawhrinskel said dont go i have to talk to you this is important then tell me as i walk he said suddenly annoyed he strode away the drone flashed round in front of him at face level so that he had to stop or hed have bumped into it its about the game stricken last night and this morning i believe i already said thank you he told the machine he looked beyond it the leading edge of the squall was hitting the far end of the village harbour beyond hassease the dark clouds were almost above him casting a great shadow and i believe i said you might be able to help me one day oh gurgeh said with an expression more sneer than smile and what am i supposed to be able to do for you help me mawhrinskel said quietly voice almost lost in the noise of the wind help me to get back into contact dont be absurd gurgeh said and put out one hand to swipe the machine out of his path he forced his way past it the next thing he knew hed been shoved down into the grass at the pathside as though shouldercharged by someone invisible he stared up in amazement at the tiny machine floating above him while his hands felt the damp ground under him and the grass hissed on each side you little he said trying to stand up he was shoved back down again and sat there incredulous simply unbelieving no machine had ever used force on him it was unheard of he tried to rise again a shout of anger and frustration forming in his throat he went limp the shout died in his mouth he felt himself flop back into the grass he lay there looking up into the dark clouds overhead he could move his eyes nothing else he remembered the missile shoot and the immobility the suit had imposed on him when it had been hit once too often this was worse this was paralysis he could do nothing he worried about his breathing stopping his heart stopping his tongue blocking his throat his bowels relaxing mawhrinskel floated into his field of view listen to me jernau gurgeh some cold drops of rain started to patter into the grass and on to his face listen to me you shall help me i have our entire conversation your every word and gesture from this morning recorded if you dont help me ill release that recording everyone will know you cheated in the game against olz hap the machine paused do you understand jernau gurgeh have i made myself clear do you realise what i am saying there is a name an old name for what i am doing in case you havent already guessed it is called blackmail the machine was mad anybody could make up anything they wanted sound moving pictures smell touch there were machines that did just that you could order them from a store and effectively paint whatever pictures still or moving you wanted and with sufficient time and patience you could make it look as realistic as the real thing recorded with an ordinary camera you could simply make up any film sequence you wanted some people used such machines just for fun or revenge making up stories where appalling or just funny things happened to their enemies or their friends where nothing could be authenticated blackmail became both pointless and impossible in a society like the culture where next to nothing was forbidden and both money and individual power had virtually ceased to exist it was doubly irrelevant the machine really must be mad gurgeh wondered if it intended to kill him he turned the idea over in his mind trying to believe it could happen i know whats going through your mind gurgeh the drone went on youre thinking that i cant prove it i could have made it up nobody will believe me well wrong i had a realtime link with a friend of mine an sc mind sympathetic to my cause whos always known i would have made a perfectly good operative and has worked on my appeal what passed between us this morning is recorded in perfect detail in a mind of unimpeachable moral credentials and at a level of perceived fidelity unapproachable with the sort of facilities generally available what i have on you could not have been falsified gurgeh if you dont believe me ask your friend amalkney itll confirm all i say it may be stupid and ignorant too but it ought to know where to find out the truth rain struck gurgehs helpless relaxed face his jaw was slack and his mouth open and he wondered if perhaps he would drown eventually drowned by the falling rain the drones small body splashed and dripped above him as the drops grew larger and fell harder youre wondering what i want from you the drone said he tried to move his eyes to say no just to annoy it but it didnt seem to notice help it said i need your help i need you to speak for me i need you to go to contact and add your voice to those demanding my return to active duty the machine darted down towards his face he felt his coat collar pulled his head and upper torso were lifted with a jerk from the damp ground until he stared helplessly at the greyblue casing of the small machine pocketsize he thought wishing he could blink and glad of the rain because he could not pocketsize it would fit into one of the big pockets in this coat he wanted to laugh dont you understand what theyve done to me man the machine said shaking him ive been castrated spayed paralysed how you feel now helpless knowing the limbs are there but unable to make them work like that but knowing that they arent there can you understand that can you did you know that in our history people used to lose whole limbs for ever do you remember your social history little jernau gurgeh eh it shook him he felt and heard his teeth rattle do you remember seeing cripples from before arms and legs just grew back back then humans lost limbs blown off or cut off or amputated but still thought they had them still thought they could feel them ghost limbs they called them those unreal arms and legs could itch and they could ache but they could not be used can you imagine can you imagine that culture man with your genofixed regrowth and your overdesigned heart and your doctored glands and clotfiltered brain and flawless teeth and perfect immune system can you it let him fall back to the ground his jaw jerked and he felt his teeth nip the end of his tongue a salt taste filled his mouth now he really would drown he thought in his own blood he waited for real fear the rain filled his eyes but he could not cry well imagine that times eight times more imagine what i feel all set up to be the good soldier fighting for all that we hold dear to seek out and smite the barbarians around us gone jernau gurgeh razed gone my sensory systems my weapons my very memorycapacity all reduced laid waste crippled i peek into shells in a stricken game i push you down with an eightstrength field and hold you there with an excuse for an electromagnetic effector but this is nothing jernau gurgeh nothing an echo a shadow nothing it floated higher away from him it gave him back the use of his body he struggled off the damp ground and felt his tongue with one hand the blood had stopped flowing closed off he sat up a little groggy feeling the back of his head where it had hit the ground it was not sore he looked at the small dripping body of the machine floating over the path i have nothing to lose gurgeh it said help me or ill destroy your reputation dont think i wouldnt whether it would mean almost nothing to you which i doubt id do it just for the fun of causing you even the smallest amount of embarrassment and if it means everything and you really would kill yourself which i also very much doubt then i would still ive never killed a human before its possible i might have been given the chance somewhere some time if id been allowed to join sc but id settle for causing a suicide he held up one hand to it his coat felt heavy the trous were soaked i believe you he said all right but what can i do ive told you the drone said over the noise of the wind howling in the trees and the rain beating against the swaying stalks of grass speak for me you have more influence than you realise use it but i dont i ive seen your mail gurgeh the drone said tiredly dont you know what a guestinvitation from a gsv means its the closest contact ever comes to offering a post directly didnt anybody ever teach you anything besides games contact wants you officially contact never headhunts you have to apply then once youre in its the other way round to join sc you have to wait to be invited but they want you all right gods man cant you take a hint even if youre right what am i supposed to do just go to contact and say take this drone back dont be stupid i wouldnt even know how to start going about it he didnt want to say anything about the visit from the contact drone the other evening he didnt have to havent they already been in touch with you mawhrinskel asked the night before last gurgeh got shakily to his feet he brushed some sandy earth from his coat the rain gusted on the wind the village on the coast and the sprawling house of his childhood were almost invisible under the dark sheets of driving rain yes ive been watching you jernau gurgeh mawhrinskel said i know contact are interested in you i have no idea just what it is contact might want from you but i suggest that you find out even if you dont want to play youd better make a damn good plea on my behalf ill be watching so ill know whether you do or not ill prove it to you watch a screen unfolded from the front of the drones body like a strange flat flower expanding to a square a quartermetre or so to a side it lit up in the rainy gloom to show mawhrinskel itself suddenly glowing a blinding flashing white above the stone table at haffliss house the scene was shot from above probably near one of the stone ribs over the terrace gurgeh watched again as the line of coals glowed bright and the lanterns and flowers fell he heard chamlis say oh dear do you think i said something to upset it he saw himself smile as he sat down by the stricken gameset the scene faded it was replaced by another dim scene viewed from above a bed his bed in the principal chamber at ikroh he recognised the small ringed hands of ren myglan kneading his back from beneath there was sound too ah ren my baby my child my love jernau you piece of shit he told the drone the scene faded and the sound cut off the screen collapsed sucked back inside the body of the drone just so and dont you forget it jernau gurgeh mawhrinskel said those bits were quite fakeable but you and i know they were real dont we like i said im watching you he sucked on the blood in his mouth spat you cant do this nobodys allowed to behave like this you wont get away with it well maybe not but the thing is if i dont get away with it i dont care im no worse off im still going to try it paused physically shook itself free of water then produced a spherical field about itself clearing the moisture from its casing leaving it spotless and clean and sheltering it from the rain cant you understand what theyve done to me man better i had never been brought into being than forced to wander the culture for ever knowing what ive lost they call it compassion to draw my talons and remove my eyes and cast me adrift in a paradise made for others i call it torture its obscene gurgeh its barbaric diabolic recognise that old word i see you do well try to imagine how i might feel and what i might do think about it gurgeh think about what you can do for me and what i can do to you the machine drew away from him again retreating through the pouring rain the cold drops splashed on top of its invisible globe of fields and little rivulets of water ran round the transparent surface of that sphere to dribble underneath falling in a steady stream into the grass ill be in touch goodbye gurgeh mawhrinskel said the drone flicked away tearing over the grass and into the sky in a grey cone of slipstream gurgeh lost sight of it within seconds he stood for a while brushing sand and bits of grass from his sodden clothes then turned to walk back in the direction hed come from through the falling rain and the beating wind he looked back once to gaze again upon the house where hed grown up but the squall billowing round the low summits of the rolling dunes had all but obscured the rambling chaotic structure but gurgeh what is the problem i cant tell you he walked up to the rear wall of the main room of chamliss apartment turned and paced back again before going to stand by the window he looked out over the square people walked or sat at tables under the awnings and archways of the pale greenstone galleries which lined the villages main square fountains played birds flew from tree to tree and on the tiled roof of the squares central bandstandstageholoscreen housing a jet black tzile almost the size of a fullgrown human lay sprawled one leg hanging over the edge of the tiles its trunk tail and ears all twitched as it dreamed its rings and bracelets and earrings glinted in the sunlight even as gurgeh watched the creatures thin trunk articulated lazily stretching back over its head to scratch indolently at the back of its neck near its terminal collar then the black proboscis fell back as though exhausted to swing to and fro for a few seconds laughter drifted up through the warm air from some nearby tables a redcoloured dirigible floated over distant hills like a vast blob of blood in the blue sky he turned back into the room again something about the square the whole village disgusted and angered him yay was right it was all too safe and twee and ordinary they might as well be on a planet he walked over to where chamlis floated near the long fishtank chamliss aura was tinged with grey frustration the old drone gave an exasperated shudder and picked up a little container of fishfood the tank lid lifted and chamlis sprinkled some of the food grains on to the top of the water the glittering mirrorfish moved silkily up to the surface mouths working rhythmically gurgeh chamlis said reasonably how can i help you if you wont tell me whats wrong just tell me is there any way you can find out more about what contact wanted to talk about can i get in touch with them again without everybody else knowing or he shook his head put his hands to his head no i suppose people will know but it doesnt matter he stopped at the wall stood looking at the warm sandstone blocks between the paintings the apartments had been built in an oldfashioned style the pointing between the sandstone blocks was dark inlaid with little white pearls he gazed at the richly beaded lines and tried to think tried to know what it was he could ask and what there was he could do i can get in touch with the two ships i know chamlis said the ones i contacted originally i can ask them they might know what contact was going to suggest chamlis watched the silvery fish silently feeding ill do that now if you like please yes he said and turned away from the manufactured sandstone and the cultivated pearls his shoes clacked across the patterned tiles of the room the sunlit square again the tzile still sleeping he could see its jaws moving and wondered what alien words the creature was mouthing in its sleep itll be a few hours before i hear anything chamlis said the fishtank lid closed the drone put the fishfood container into a drawer in a tiny delicate table near the tank both ships are fairly distant chamlis tapped the side of the tank with a silvered field the mirrorfish floated over to investigate but why the drone said looking at him whats changed what sort of trouble are you can you be in gurgeh please tell me i want to help the machine floated closer to the tall human who was standing staring down to the square his hands clasped and unconsciously kneading each other the old drone had never seen the man so distressed nothing gurgeh said hopelessly shaking his head not looking at the drone nothings changed theres no trouble i just need to know a few things he had gone straight back to ikroh the day before hed stood in the main room where the house had lit the fire a couple of hours earlier after hearing the weather forecast and hed taken off the wet dirty clothes and thrown them all on to the fire hed had a hot bath and a steam bath sweating and panting and trying to feel clean the plunge bath had been so cold there had been a thin covering of ice on it hed dived in half expecting his heart to stop with the shock hed sat in the main room watching the logs burn hed tried to pull himself together and once hed felt capable of thinking clearly hed raised chiark hub gurgeh makil strabey again at your service hows tricks not another visitation from contact surely no but i have a feeling they left something behind when they were here something to watch me what you mean a bug or a microsystem or something yes he said sitting back in the broad couch he wore a simple robe his skin felt scrubbed and shiny clean after his bathe somehow the friendly understanding voice of hub made him feel better it would be all right hed work something out he was probably frightened over nothing mawhrinskel was just a demented insane machine with delusions of power and grandeur it wouldnt be able to prove anything and nobody would believe it if it simply made unsubstantiated claims what makes you think youre being bugged i cant tell you gurgeh said sorry but i have seen some evidence can you send something drones or whatever to ikroh to sweep the place would you be able to find something if they did leave anything if its ordinary tech stuff yes but it depends on the soph level a warship can passivebug using its electromagnetic effector they can watch you under a hundred klicks of rockcover from the next stellar system and tell you what your last meal was hyperspace tech there are defences against it but no way of detecting its going on nothing that complicated just a bug or a camera or something should be possible well displace a drone team to you in a minute or so want us to harden this comm channel cant make it totally eavesdropproof but we can make it difficult please no problem detach the terminal speaker pip and shove it in your ear well soundfield the outside gurgeh did just that he felt better already the hub seemed to know what it was doing thanks hub he said i appreciate all this hey no thanks required gurgeh thats what were here for besides this is fun gurgeh smiled there was a distant thump somewhere above the house as the hubs drone team arrived the drones swept the house for sensory equipment and secured the buildings and grounds they polarised the windows and drew the drapes they put some sort of special mat under the couch he sat on they even installed a kind of filter or valve inside the chimney of the fire gurgeh felt grateful and cosseted and both important and foolish all at once he set to work he used his terminal to probe the hubs information banks they contained as a matter of course almost every even moderately important or significant or useful piece of information the culture had ever accumulated a near infinite ocean of fact and sensation and theory and artwork which the cultures information net was adding to at a torrential rate every second of the day you could find out most things if you knew the right questions to ask even if you didnt you could still find out a lot the culture had theoretical total freedom of information the catch was that consciousness was private and information held in a mind as opposed to an unconscious system like the hubs memorybanks was regarded as part of the minds being and so as sacrosanct as the contents of a human brain a mind could hold any set of facts and opinions it wanted without having to tell anybody what it knew or thought or why and so while hub protected his privacy gurgeh found out without having to ask chamlis that what mawhrinskel had said might be true there were indeed levels of eventrecording which could not be easily faked and which drones of aboveaverage specification were potentially capable of using such recordings especially if they had been witnessed by a mind in a realtime link would be accepted as genuine his mood of renewed optimism started to sink away from him again also there was an sc mind that of the limited offensive unit gunboat diplomat which had supported mawhrinskels appeal against the decision which had removed the drone from special circumstances the feeling of dazed sickness started to fill him again he wasnt able to find out when mawhrinskel and the lou had last been in touch that again counted as private information privacy that brought a bitter laugh to his mouth thinking of the privacy hed had over the last few days and nights but he did discover that a drone like mawhrinskel even in civilianised form was capable of sustaining a oneway realtime link with such a ship over millennia distances so long as the ship was watching out for the signal and knew where to look he could not find out there and then where the gunboat diplomat was in the galaxy sc ships routinely kept their locations secret but put in a request that the ship release its position to him from what he could tell from the information hed discovered mawhrinskels claim that the mind had recorded their conversation would not hold up if the ship was more than about twenty millennia away if it turned out say that the craft was on the other side of the galaxy then the drone had definitely lied and he would be safe he hoped the vessel was on the other side of the galaxy he hoped it was a hundred thousand light years away or more or it had gone crazy and run into a black hole or decided to head for another galaxy or stumbled across a hostile alien ship powerful enough to blow it out of the skies anything so long as it wasnt near by and able to make that realtime link otherwise everything mawhrinskel had said checked out it could be done he could be blackmailed he sat in the couch while the fire burned down and the hub drones floated through the house humming and clicking to themselves and he stared into the greying ashes wishing that it was all unreal wishing it hadnt happened cursing himself for letting the little drone talk him into cheating why he asked himself why did i do it how could i have been so stupid it had seemed a glamorous enticingly dangerous thing at the time a little crazy but then was he not different from other people was he not the great gameplayer and so allowed his eccentricities granted the freedom to make his own rules he hadnt wanted selfglorification not really and he had already won the game he just wanted somebody in the culture to have completed a full web hadnt he it wasnt like him to cheat he had never done it before he would never do it again how could mawhrinskel do this to him why had he done it why couldnt it just not have happened why didnt they have timetravel why couldnt he go back and stop it happening ships that could circumnavigate the galaxy in a few years and count every cell in your body from light years off but he wasnt able to go back one miserable day and alter one tiny stupid idiotic shameful decision he clenched his fists trying to break the terminal he held in his right hand but it wouldnt break his hand hurt again he tried to think calmly what if the worst did happen the culture was generally rather disdainful of individual fame and therefore equally uninterested in scandal there was anyway little that was scandalous but gurgeh had no doubt that if mawhrinskel did release the recordings it claimed to have made they would be propagated people would know there were plenty of news and current affairs indices and networks in the multiplicity of communications which linked every culture habitat be it ship rock orbital or planet somebody somewhere would be only too pleased to broadcast mawhrinskels recordings gurgeh knew of a couple of recently established games indices whose editors writers and correspondents regarded him and most of the other wellknown players and authorities as some sort of constricting overprivileged hierarchy they thought too much attention was paid to too few players and sought to discredit what they called the old guard which included him much to his amusement they would love what mawhrinskel had on him he could deny it all once it was out and some people would doubtless believe him despite the hardness of the evidence but the other top players and the responsible wellestablished and authoritative indices would know the truth of it and that was what he would not be able to bear he would still be able to play and he would still be allowed to publish to register his papers as open for dissemination and probably many of them would be taken up not quite so often as before perhaps but he would not be frozen out completely it would be worse than that he would be treated with compassion understanding tolerance but he would never be forgiven could he come to terms with that ever could he weather the storm of abuse and knowing looks the gloating sympathy of his rivals would it all die down enough eventually would a few years pass and it be sufficiently forgotten he thought not not for him it would always be there he could not face down mawhrinskel with that publish and be damned the drone had been right it would destroy his reputation destroy him he watched the logs in the wide grate glow duller red and then go soft and grey he told hub he was finished it quietly returned the house to normal and left him alone with his thoughts he woke the next morning and it was still the same universe it had not been a nightmare and time had not gone backwards i had all still happened he took the underground to celleck the village where chamlis amalkney lived by itself in an oldfashioned and odd approximation of human domesticity surrounded by wall paintings antique furniture inlaid walls fishtanks and insect vivaria ill find out all i can gurgeh chamlis sighed floating beside him looking out to the square but i cant guarantee that i can do it without whoever was behind your last visit from contact finding out about it they may think youre interested maybe i am gurgeh said maybe i do want to talk to them again i dont know well ive sent the message to my friends but he had a sudden paranoid idea he turned to chamlis urgently these friends of yours are ships yes chamlis said both of them what are they called the of course i still love you and the just read the instructions theyre not warships with names like that theyre gcus what else good gurgeh said relaxing a little looking out to the square again good thats all right he took a deep breath gurgeh cant you please tell me whats wrong chamliss voice was soft even sad you know itll go no further let me help it hurts me to see you like this if theres anything i can nothing gurgeh said looking at the machine again he shook his head theres nothing nothing else you can do ill let you know if there is he started across the room chamlis watched him i have to go now ill see you again chamlis he went down to the underground he sat in the car staring at the floor on about the fourth request he realised the car was talking to him asking where he wanted to go he told it he was staring at one of the wallscreens watching the steady stars when the terminal beeped gurgeh makil strabey yet again one more time once more what he snapped annoyed at the minds glib chumminess that ship just replied with the information you asked for he frowned what ship what information the gunboat diplomat our gameplayer its location his heart pounded and his throat seemed to close up yes he said struggling to get the word out and well it didnt reply direct it sent via its home gsv youthful indiscretion and got it to confirm its location yes well where is it in the altabiennorth cluster sent coordinates though theyre only accurate to never mind the coordinates gurgeh shouted where is that cluster how far away is it from here hey calm down its about two and a half millennia away he sat back closing his eyes the car started to slow down two thousand five hundred light years it was as the urbanely welltravelled people on a gsv would say a long walk but close enough by quite a long way for a warship to minutely target an effector throw a sensing field a lightsecond in diameter across the sky and pick up the weak but indisputable flicker of coherent hs light coming from a machine small enough to fit into a pocket he tried to tell himself it was still no proof that mawhrinskel might still have been lying but even as he thought that he saw something ominous in the fact the warship had not replied direct it had used its gsv an even more reliable source of information to confirm its whereabouts want the rest of the lous message hub said or are you going to bite my head off again gurgeh was puzzled what rest of the message he said the underground car swung round slowed further he could see ikrohs transit gallery hanging under the plate surface like an upsidedown building mysteriouser and mysteriouser hub said you been communicating with this ship behind my back gurgeh the message is nice to hear from you again three days passed he couldnt settle to anything he tried to read papers old books the material of his own hed been working on but on every occasion he found himself reading and rereading the same piece or page or screen time and time again trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him refusing to absorb anything going back time and time again to the same treadmill the same looping tailswallowing eternally pointless round of questioning and regret why had he done it what way out was there he tried glanding soothing drugs but it took so much to have any effect he just felt groggy he used sharp blue and edge and focal to force himself to concentrate but it gave him a jarring feeling at the back of his skull somewhere and exhausted him it wasnt worth it his brain wanted to worry and fret and there was no point in trying to frustrate it he refused all calls he called chamlis a couple of times but never found anything to say all chamlis could tell him was that the two contact ships it knew had both been in touch each said it had passed on chamliss message to a few other minds both had been surprised gurgeh had been contacted so quickly both would pass on gurgehs request to be told more neither knew anything else about what was going on he heard nothing from mawhrinskel he asked hub to find the machine just to let him know where it was but hub couldnt which obviously annoyed the orbital mind a lot he had it send the drone team down again and they swept the house once more hub left one of the machines there in the house to monitor continuously for surveillance gurgeh spent a lot of time walking in the forests and mountains around ikroh walking and hiking and scrambling twenty or thirty kilometres each day just for the natural soporific of being dead animaltired at night on the fourth day he was almost starting to feel that if he didnt do anything didnt talk to anybody or communicate or write and didnt stir from the house nothing would happen maybe mawhrinskel had disappeared for ever perhaps contact had come to take it away or said it could come back to the fold maybe it had gone totally crazy and flown off into space maybe it had taken seriously the old joke about styglian enumerators and had gone off to count all the grains of sand on a beach it was a fine day he sat in the broad lower branches of a sunbread tree in the garden at ikroh looking out through the canopy of leaves to where a small herd of feyl had emerged from the forest to crop the wineberry bushes at the bottom of the lower lawn the pale shy animals stickthin and camouflageskinned pulled nervously at the low shrubs their triangular heads jigging and bobbing jaws working gurgeh looked back to the house just visible through the gently moving leaves of the tree he saw a tiny drone small and greywhite near one of the windows of the house he froze it might not be mawhrinskel he told himself it was too far away to be certain it might be loash andalltherest whatever it was it was a good forty metres away and he must be almost invisible sitting here in the tree he couldnt be traced hed left his terminal back at the house something he had taken to doing increasingly often recently even though it was a dangerous irresponsible thing to do to be apart from the hubs information network effectively cut off from the rest of the culture he held his breath sat dead still the little machine seemed to hesitate in midair then point in his direction it came floating straight towards him it wasnt mawhrinskel or loash the verbose it wasnt even the same type it was a little larger and fatter and it had no aura at all it stopped just below the tree and said in a pleasant voice mr gurgeh he jumped out of the tree the herd of feyl started and disappeared leaping into the forest in a confusion of green shapes yes he said good afternoon my names worthil im from contact pleased to meet you hello what a lovely place did you have the house built yes gurgeh said irrelevant smalltalk a nanosecond interrogation of hubs memories would have told the machine exactly when ikroh was built and by whom quite beautiful i couldnt help noticing the roofs all slope at more or less the same mean angle as the surrounding mountain slopes your idea a private aesthetic theory gurgeh admitted a little more impressed hed never mentioned that to anybody the fieldless machine made a show of looking around hmm yes a fine house and an impressive setting but now may i come to the reason for my visit gurgeh sat down crosslegged by the tree please do the drone lowered itself to keep level with his face first of all let me apologise if we put you off earlier i think the drone who visited you previously may have taken its instructions a little too literally though to give it its due time is rather limited anyway im here to tell you all you want to know we have as you probably suspected found something we think might interest you however the drone turned away from the man to look at the house and its garden again i wouldnt blame you if you didnt want to leave your beautiful home so it does involve travelling yes for some time how long gurgeh asked the drone seemed to hesitate may i tell you what it is weve found first all right it must be in confidence im afraid the drone said apologetically what ive come to tell you has to remain restricted for the time being youll understand why once ive explained can you give me your word you wont let this go any further what would happen if i say no i leave thats all gurgeh shrugged brushed a little bark from the hem of the gatheredup robe he was wearing all right in secret then worthil floated upwards a little turning its front briefly towards ikroh itll take a little time to explain might we retire to your house of course gurgeh rose to his feet gurgeh sat in the main screenroom of ikroh the windows were blanked out and the wall holoscreen was on the contact drone was controlling the room systems it put the lights out the screen went blank then showed the main galaxy in d from a considerable distance the two clouds were nearest gurgehs point of view the larger cloud a semispiral with a long tail leading away from the galaxy and the smaller cloud vaguely yshaped the greater and lesser clouds the drone worthil said each about one hundred thousand light years away from where we are now no doubt youve admired them from ikroh in the past theyre quite visible though youre on the underedge of the main galaxy relative to them and so looking at them through it weve found what you might consider a rather interesting game here a green dot appeared near the centre of the smaller cloud gurgeh looked at the drone isnt that he said rather far away i take it youre suggesting i go there it is a long way away and we do suggest just that the journey will take nearly two years on the fastest ships due to the nature of the energy grid its more tenuous out there between the starclumps inside the galaxy such a journey would take less than a year but that means id be away four years gurgeh said staring at the screen his mouth had gone dry more like five the drone said matteroffactly thats a long time it is and ill certainly understand if you decline our invitation though we do think youll find the game itself interesting first of all however i have to explain a little about the setting which is what makes the game unique the green dot expanded became a rough circle the screen went suddenly outholo filling the room with stars the rough green circle of suns became an even rougher sphere gurgeh experienced the momentary swimming sensation he sometimes felt when surrounded by space or its impression these stars worthil said the greencoloured stars at least a couple of thousand suns flashed once are under the control of what one can only describe as an empire now the drone turned to look at him the little machine lay in space like some impossibly large ship stars in front of it as well as behind it it is unusual for us to discover an imperial powersystem in space as a rule such archaic forms of authority wither long before the relevant species drags itself off the home planet let alone cracks the lightspeed problem which of course one has to do to rule effectively over any worthwhile volume every now and again however contact disturbs some particular ball of rock and discovers something nasty underneath on every occasion there is a specific and singular reason some special circumstance which allows the general rule to go by the board in the case of the conglomerate you see before you apart from the obvious factors such as the fact that we didnt get out there until fairly recently and the lack of any other powerful influence in the lesser cloud that special circumstance is a game it took a while to sink in gurgeh looked at the machine a game he said to it that game is called azad by the natives it is important enough for the empire itself to take its name from the game you are looking at the empire of azad gurgeh did just that the drone went on the dominant species is humanoid but very unusually and certain analyses claim that this too has been a factor in the survival of the empire as a social system it is composed of three sexes three figures appeared in the centre of gurgehs field of vision as though standing in the middle of the ragged sphere of stars they were rather shorter than gurgeh if the scale was right each of them looked odd in different ways but they shared what looked to gurgeh to be rather short legs and slightly bloated flat and very pale faces the one on the left worthil said is a male carrying the testes and penis the middle one is equipped with a kind of reversible vagina and ovaries the vagina turns insideout to implant the fertilised egg in the third sex on the right which has a womb the one in the middle is the dominant sex gurgeh had to think about this the what he said the dominant sex worthil repeated empires are synonymous with centralised if occasionally schismatised hierarchical power structures in which influence is restricted to an economically privileged class retaining its advantages through usually a judicious use of oppression and skilled manipulation of both the societys information dissemination systems and its lesser as a rule nominally independent power systems in short its all about dominance the intermediate or apex sex you see standing in the middle there controls the society and the empire generally the males are used as soldiers and the females as possessions of course its a little more complicated than that but you get the idea well gurgeh shook his head i dont understand how it works but if you say it does all right he rubbed his beard i take it this means these people cant change sex correct genetechnologically its been within their grasp for hundreds of years but its forbidden illegal if you remember what that means gurgeh nodded the machine went on it looks perverse and wasteful to us but then one thing that empires are not about is the efficient use of resources and the spread of happiness both are typically accomplished despite the economic shortcircuiting corruption and favouritism mostly endemic to the system okay gurgeh said ill have a lot of questions to ask later but go on what about this game indeed here is one of the boards youre joking gurgeh said eventually he sat forward gazing at the holo still picture spread before him the starfield and the three humanoids had vanished and gurgeh and the drone called worthil were seemingly at one end of a huge room many times larger than the one they in fact occupied before them stretched a floor covered with a stunningly complicated and seemingly chaotically abstract and irregular mosaic pattern which in places rose up like hills and dipped into valleys looking closer it could be seen that the hills were not solid but rather stacked tapering levels of the same bewildering metapattern creating linked multilayered pyramids over the fantastic landscape which on still closer inspection had what looked like bizarrely sculpted gamepieces standing on its riotously coloured surface the whole construction must have measured at least twenty metres to a side that gurgeh asked is a board he swallowed he had never seen never heard about never had the least hint of a game as complicated as this one must surely be if those were individual pieces and areas one of them how many are there it couldnt be real it had to be a joke they were making fun of him no human brain could possibly cope with a game on such a scale it was impossible it had to be three all that size plus numerous minor ones played with cards as well let me give you some of the background to the game first the name azad means machine or perhaps system in the wide sense which would include any functioning entity such as an animal or a flower as well as something like myself or a waterwheel the game has been developed over several thousand years reaching its present form about eight hundred years ago around the same time as the institutionalisation of the species still extant religion since then the game has altered little it dates in its finalised form then from about the time of the hegemonisation of the empires home planet eä and the first relativistic exploration of nearby space now the view was of a planet hanging huge in the room in front of gurgeh bluewhite and brilliant and slowly slowly revolving against a background of dark space eä the drone said now the game is used as an absolutely integral part of the powersystem of the empire put in the crudest possible terms whoever wins the game becomes emperor gurgeh looked round slowly at the drone which looked back i kid you not it said dryly are you serious gurgeh said nonetheless quite entirely the drone said becoming emperor does constitute a rather unusual prize the machine said and the whole truth as you might imagine is much more complicated than that the game of azad is used not so much to determine which person will rule but which tendency within the empires ruling class will have the upper hand which branch of economic theory will be followed which creeds will be recognised within the religious apparat and which political policies will be followed the game is also used as an exam for both entry into and promotion within the empires religious educational civil administrational judicial and military establishments the idea you see is that azad is so complex so subtle so flexible and so demanding that it is as precise and comprehensive a model of life as it is possible to construct whoever succeeds at the game succeeds in life the same qualities are required in each to ensure dominance but gurgeh looked at the drone beside him and seemed to feel the presence of the planet before them as an almost physical force something he felt drawn to pulled towards is that true the planet disappeared and they were back looking at the vast gameboard again the holo was in motion now though silently and he could see the alien people moving around shifting pieces and standing around the edges of the board it doesnt have to be totally true the drone said but cause and effect are not perfectly polarised here the setup assumes that the game and life are the same thing and such is the pervasive nature of the idea of the game within the society that just by believing that they make it so it becomes true it is willed into actuality anyway they cant be too far wrong or the empire would not exist at all it is by definition a volatile and unstable system azad the game would appear to be the force that holds it together wait a moment now gurgeh said looking at the machine we both know contacts got a reputation for being devious you wouldnt be expecting me to go out there and become emperor or anything would you for the first time the drone showed an aura flashing briefly red there was a laugh in its voice too i wouldnt expect youd get very far trying that no the empire falls under the general definition of a state and the one thing states always try to do is to ensure their own existence in perpetuity the idea of anybody from outside coming in and trying to take the empire over would fill them with horror if you decide you want to go and if you are able to learn the game sufficiently well during the voyage then there might be a chance we think going on your past performance as a gameplayer of you qualifying as a clerk in the civil service or as an army lieutenant dont forget these people are surrounded by this game from birth they have antiagatic drugs and the best players are about twice your own age even they of course are still learning the point is not what you would be able to achieve in terms of the semibarbarous social conditions the game is set up to support but whether you can master the theory and practice of the game at all opinions in contact differ over whether it is possible for even a gameplayer of your stature to compete successfully just on general gameplaying principles and a crashcourse in the rules and practice gurgeh watched the silent alien figures move across the artificial landscape of the huge board he couldnt do this five years that was insane he might as well let mawhrinskel broadcast his shame in five years he might have made a new life leaving chiark finding something else to interest him besides games changing his appearance maybe changing his name he had never heard of anybody doing that but it must be possible certainly the game of azad if it really existed was quite fascinating but why had he heard nothing of it until now how could contact keep something like this secret and why he rubbed his beard still watching the silent aliens as they stalked the broad board stopping to move pieces or have others move them for them they were alien but they were people humanoid they had mastered this bizarre outrageous game theyre not superintelligent are they he asked the drone hardly retaining such a social system at this stage of technological development game or no game on average the intermediate or apex sex is probably a little less bright than the average culture human gurgeh was mystified that implies theres a difference between the sexes there is now worthil said gurgeh didnt quite see what that meant but the drone went on before he could ask any further questions in fact we are reasonably hopeful that you will be able to play an aboveaverage game of azad if you study for the two years your outward journey would take it would require continued and comprehensive use of memory and learningenhancing secretions of course and i might point out that possession of drugglands alone would disqualify you from actually gaining any post within the empire through your game performance even if you werent an alien anyway there is a strict ban on any unnatural influence being used during the game all the gamerooms are electronically shielded to prevent the use of a computer link and drug tests are carried out after every match your own body chemistry as well as your alien nature and the fact that to them you are a heathen means that you would if you did decide to go only be taking part in an honorary capacity drone worthil gurgeh said turning to face it i dont think ill be going all that way not so far for so long but id love to know more about this game i want to discuss it analyse it along with other not possible the drone said im allowed to tell you all that i am telling you but none of this can go any further you have given your word jernau gurgeh and if i break it everybody would think youd made it up theres nothing on accessible record to show any different why is it all so secret anyway what are you frightened of the truth is we dont know what to do jernau gurgeh this is a larger problem than contact usually has to deal with as a rule its possible to go by the book weve built up enough experience with every sort of barbarian society to know what does and does not work with each type we monitor we use controls we crossevaluate and mindmodel and generally take every possible precaution to make sure were doing the right thing but something like azad is unique there are no templates no reliable precedents we have to play it by ear and thats something of a responsibility dealing with an entire stellar empire which is why special circumstances has become involved were used to dealing with tricky situations and frankly with this one were sitting on it if we let everybody know about azad we may be pressured into making a decision just by the weight of public opinion which may not sound like a bad thing but might prove disastrous for whom gurgeh said sceptically the people of the empire and the culture we might be forced into a highprofile intervention against the empire it would hardly be war as such because were way ahead of them technologically but wed have to become an occupying force to control them and that would mean a huge drain on our resources as well as morale in the end such an adventure would almost certainly be seen as a mistake no matter the popular enthusiasm for it at the time the people of the empire would lose by uniting against us instead of the corrupt regime which controls them so putting the clock back a century or two and the culture would lose by emulating those we despise invaders occupiers hegemonists you seem very sure there would be a wave of popular opinion let me explain something to you jernau gurgeh the drone said the game of azad is a gambling game frequently even at the highest levels the form these wagers take is occasionally macabre i very much doubt that youd be involved on the sort of levels youd be playing at if you did agree to take part but it is quite usual for them to wager prestige honours possessions slaves favours land and even physical licence on the outcome of games gurgeh waited but eventually sighed and said all right whats physical licence the players wager tortures and mutilations against each other you mean if you lose a game you have these things done to you exactly one might bet say the loss of a finger against aggravated maletoapex rectal rape gurgeh looked levelly at the machine for a few seconds then said slowly nodding well that is barbaric actually its a later development in the game and seen as a rather liberal concession by the ruling class as in theory it allows a poor person to keep up in the bidding with a rich person before the introduction of the physical licence option the latter could always outbid the former oh gurgeh could see the logic just not the morality azad is not the sort of place its easy to think about coldly jemau gurgeh they have done things the average culture person would find unspeakable a programme of eugenic manipulation has lowered the average male and female intelligence selective birthcontrol sterilisation area starvation mass deportation and raciallybased taxation systems produced the equivalent of genocide with the result that almost everybody on the home planet is the same colour and build their treatment of alien captives their societies and works is equally look is all this serious gurgeh got up from the seat and walked into the field of the hologram gazing down at the fabulously complicated gamefloor which appeared to be under his feet but was in fact he knew a terrible gulf of space away are you telling me the truth does this empire really exist very much so jemau gurgeh if you want to confirm all ive said i can arrange for special access rights to be granted to you direct from the gsv s and other minds whove taken charge of this you can have all you want on the empire of azad from the first sniff of contact to the latest realtime news reports its all true and when did you first get that sniff of contact gurgeh said turning to the drone how long have you been sitting on this the drone hesitated not long it said eventually seventythree years you people certainly dont rush into things do you only when weve no choice the drone agreed and how does the empire feel about us gurgeh asked let me guess you havent told them all about the culture very good jemau gurgeh the drone said with what was almost a laugh in its voice no we havent told them everything thats something the drone wed be sending with you would have to keep you straight on right from the start weve misled the empire about our distribution numbers resources technological level and ultimate intentions though of course only the relative paucity of advanced societies in the relevant region of the lesser cloud has made this possible the azadians do not for example know that the culture is based in the main galaxy they believe we come from the greater cloud and that our numbers are only about twice theirs they have little inkling of the level of genofixing in culture humans or of the sophistication of our machine intelligences theyve never heard of a ship mind or seen a gsv theyve been trying to find out about us ever since first contact of course but without any success they probably think we have a home planet or something they themselves are still very much planetoriented using planetforming techniques to create usable ecospheres or more usually just taking over already occupied globes ecologically and morally theyre catastrophically bad the reason theyre trying to find out about us is they want to invade us they want to conquer the culture the problem is that as with all playgroundbully mentalities theyre quite profoundly frightened xenophobic and paranoid at once we darent let them know the extent and power of the culture yet in case the whole empire selfdestructs such things have happened before though of course that was long before contact itself was formed our techniques better these days still tempting all the same the drone said as though thinking aloud not talking to him they do gurgeh said sound fairly hed been going to say barbaric but that didnt seem strong enough animalistic hmm the drone said be careful now that is how they term the species they subjugate animals of course they are animals just as you are just as i am a machine but they are fully conscious and they have a society at least as complicated as our own more so in some ways it is pure chance that weve met them when their civilisation looks primitive to us one less ice age on eä and it could conceivably have been the other way round gurgeh nodded thoughtfully and watched the silent aliens move across the gamefloor in the reproduced light of a distant alien sun but worthil added brightly it didnt happen that way so not to worry now then it said and suddenly they were back in the room at ikroh the holoscreen off and the windows clear gurgeh blinked in the sudden wash of daylight im sure you realise theres still a vast amount left to tell you but you have our proposal now in its barest outline im not asking you to say yes unequivocally at this stage but is there any point in my going on or have you already decided that you definitely dont want to go gurgeh rubbed his beard looking out of the window towards the forest above ikroh it was too much to take in if it really was genuine then azad was the single most significant game hed ever encountered in his life possibly more significant than all the rest put together as an ultimate challenge it excited and appalled him in equal measure he felt instinctively almost sexually drawn to it even now knowing so little but he wasnt sure he possessed the selfdiscipline to study that intensely for two years solid or that he was capable of holding a mental model of a game so bewilderingly complex in his head he kept coming back to the fact that the azadians themselves managed it but as the machine said they were submerged in the game from birth perhaps it could only be mastered by somebody whod had their cognitive processes shaped by the game itself but five years all that time not just away from here but at least half probably more of that stretch spent with no time for keeping abreast of developments in other games no time to read papers or write them no time for anything except this one absurd obsessive game he would change he would be a different person at the end of it he could not help but change take on something of the game itself that would be inevitable and would he ever catch up again once he came back he would be forgotten he would be away so long the rest of the gameplaying culture would just disregard him hed be a historical figure and when he came back would he be allowed to talk about it or would contacts sevendecadelong embargo continue but if he went he might be able to buy mawhrinskel off he could make its price his price let it back in to sc or it occurred to him there and then have them silence it somehow a flock of birds flew across the sky white scraps against the dark greens of the mountain forest they landed on the garden outside the window strutting back and forth and pecking at the ground he turned to the drone again crossed his arms when would you need to know he said he still hadnt decided he had to stall find out all he could first it would have to be within the next three or four days the gsv little rascal is heading out in this direction from the middlegalaxy at the moment and will be leaving for the clouds within the next hundred days if you were to miss it your journey would last a lot longer your own ship will have to sustain maximum velocity right up to the rendezvous point even as things stand my own ship gurgeh said youll need your own craft firstly to get you to the little rascal in time and then again at the other end to travel from the gsvs closest approach to the lesser cloud into the empire itself he watched the snowwhite birds peck on the lawn for a while he wondered whether he ought to mention mawhrinskel now part of him wanted to just to get it over with just in case they would say yes immediately and he could stop worrying about the machines threat and start worrying about that insanely complicated game but he knew he mustnt wisdom is patience as the saying said keep that back if he was going to go though of course he wouldnt couldnt it was madness even to think of going then make them think he had nothing he wanted in return let it all be arranged and then make his condition clear if mawhrinskel waited that long before getting pushy all right he said to the contact drone im not saying i will go but i will think about it tell me more about azad stories set in the culture in which things went wrong tended to start with humans losing or forgetting or deliberately leaving behind their terminal it was a conventional opening the equivalent of straying off the path in the wild woods in one age or a car breaking down at night on a lonely road in another a terminal in the shape of a ring button bracelet or pen or whatever was your link with everybody and everything else in the culture with a terminal you were never more than a question or a shout away from almost anything you wanted to know or almost any help you could possibly need there were true stories of people falling off cliffs and the terminal relaying their scream in time for a hub unit to switch to that terminals camera realise what was happening and displace a drone to catch the faller in midair there were other stories about terminals recording the severing of their owners head from their body in an accident and summoning a medical drone in time to save the brain leaving the debodied person with no more a problem than finding ways to pass the months it took to grow a new body a terminal was safety so gurgeh took his on the longer walks he sat a couple of days after the drone worthils visit on a small stone bench near the treeline a few kilometres from ikroh he was breathing hard from the climb up the path it was a bright sunny day and the earth smelled sweet he used the terminal to take a few photographs of the view from the little clearing there was a rusting piece of ironware beside the bench a present from an old lover hed almost forgotten about he took a few photographs of that too then the terminal beeped house here gurgeh you said to give you the choice on yays calls she says this is moderately urgent he hadnt been accepting calls from yay shed tried to get in touch several times over the last few days he shrugged go ahead he said leaving the terminal to float in midair in front of him the screen unrolled to reveal yays smiling face ah the recluse how are you gurgeh im all right yay peered forward at her own screen what is that youre sitting beside gurgeh looked at the piece of ironware by the side of the bench thats a cannon he told her thats what i thought it was a present from a lady friend gurgeh explained she was very keen on forging and casting she graduated from pokers and fire grates to cannons she thought i might find it amusing to fire large metal spheres at the fjord i see you need a fastburning powder to make it work though and i never did get round to acquiring any just as well the thing would probably have exploded and blown your brains out that did occur to me as well good for you yays smile widened hey guess what what im going on a cruise i persuaded shuro he needs his horizons broadened you remember shuro at the shoot oh yes i remember when do you go ive gone we just undocked from tronze port the clipper screw loose this is the last chance i had to call you realtime the delayll mean letters in future ah he wished he hadnt accepted this call too now how long are you going for a month or two yays bright smiling face crinkled well see shuro might get tired of me before then kids mostly into other men but im trying to persuade him otherwise sorry i couldnt say goodbye before i left but its not for long ill s the terminal screen went blank the screen snapped back into the casing as it fell to the ground and lay silent and dead on the treeneedled ground of the clearing gurgeh stared at the terminal he leant forward and picked it up some needles and bits of grass had been caught in the screen as it rolled back into the casing he pulled them out the machine was lifeless the little telltale light on the base was off well jernau gurgeh mawhrinskel said floating in from the side of the clearing he clutched the terminal with both hands he stood up staring at the drone as it sidled through the air bright in the sunlight he made himself relax putting the terminal in a jacket pocket and sitting down legs crossed on the bench well what mawhrinskel a decision the machine floated level with his face its fields were formal blue will you speak for me what if i do and nothing happens youll just have to try harder theyll listen if youre persuasive enough but if youre wrong and they dont then id have to think about whether to release your little entertainment or not it would be fun certainly but i might save it in case you could be useful to me in some other way one never knows no indeed i saw you had a visitor the other day i thought you might have noticed looked like a contact drone it was id like to pretend i knew what it said to you but once you went into the house i had to stop eavesdropping something about travelling i believe i heard you say a cruise of sorts is that all no hmm my guess was they might want you to join contact become a referer one of their planners something like that not so gurgeh shook his head the drone wobbled from side to side in the air a gesture gurgeh was not sure he understood i see and have you mentioned me yet no i think you ought to dont you i dont know whether im going to do what they ask i havent decided yet why not what are they asking you to do can it compare to the shame ill do what i want to do he told it standing up i might as well after all drone mightnt i even if l can persuade contact to take you back you and your friend gunboat diplomat would still have the recording whats to prevent you doing all this again ah so you know its name i wondered what you and chiark hub were up to well gurgeh just ask yourself this what else could i possibly want from you this is all i want to be allowed to be what i was meant to be when i am restored to that state ill have all i could possibly desire there would be nothing else you could possibly have any control over i want to fight gurgeh thats what i was designed for to use skill and cunning and force to win battles for our dear beloved culture im not interested in controlling others or in making the strategic decisions that sort of power doesnt interest me the only destiny i want to control is my own fine words gurgeh said he took the dead terminal out of his pocket turned it over in his hands mawhrinskel plucked the terminal out of his hands from a couple of metres away held it underneath its casing and folded it neatly in half it bent it again into quarters the penshaped machine snapped and broke mawhrinskel crumpled the remains into a little jagged ball im getting impatient jernau gurgeh time goes slower the faster you think and i think very fast indeed lets say another four days shall we you have one hundred and twentyeight hours before i tell gunboat to make you even more famous than you are already it tossed the wrecked terminal back to him he caught it the little drone drifted off towards the edge of the clearing ill be waiting for your call it said better get a new terminal though and do be careful on the walk back to ikroh dangerous to be out in the wilds with no way of summoning help five years chamlis said thoughtfully well its some game i agree but wont you lose touch over that sort of period have you thought this through properly gurgeh dont let them rush you into anything you might regret later they were in the lowest cellar in ikroh gurgeh had taken chamlis down there to tell it about azad hed sworn the old drone to secrecy first theyd left hubs resident antisurveillance drone guarding the cellar entrance and chamlis had done its best to check there was nobody and nothing listening in as well as producing a reasonable impression of a quietfield around them they talked against a background of pipes and service ducts rumbling and hissing around them in the darkness the naked walls rock sweated darkly glistening gurgeh shook his head there was nowhere to sit down in the cellar and its roof was just a little too low for him to stand fully upright so he stood head bowed i think im going to do it he said not looking at chamlis i can always come back if its too difficult if i change my mind too difficult chamlis echoed surprised thats not like you i agree its a tough game but anyway i can come back he said chamlis was silent for a moment yes yes of course you can he still didnt know if he was doing the right thing he had tried to think it through to apply the same son of cold logical analysis to his own plight that he would normally bring to bear in a tricky situation in a game but he just didnt seem to be able to do so it was as though that ability could look calmly only on distant abstract problems and was incapable of focusing on anything so intricately enmeshed with his own emotional state he wanted to go to get away from mawhrinskel but he had to admit to himself he was attracted by azad not just the game that was still slightly unreal too complicated to be taken seriously yet the empire itself interested him and yet of course he wanted to stay he had enjoyed his life until that night in tronze he had never been totally satisfied but then who was looking back the life hed led seemed idyllic he might lose the occasional game feel that another gameplayer was unjustifiably lauded over himself lust after yay meristinoux and feel piqued she preferred others but these were small small hurts indeed compared both with what mawhrinskel held on him and with the five years exile which now faced him no he said nodding at the floor i think i will go all right but this just doesnt seem like you gurgeh youve always been so measured in control you make me sound like a machine gurgeh said tiredly no but more predictable than this more comprehensible he shrugged looked at the rough rock floor chamlis he said im only human that my dear old friend has never been an excuse he sat in the underground car hed been to the university to see professor boruelal hed taken with him a sealed handwritten letter for her to keep to be opened only if he died explaining all that had happened apologising to olz hap trying to make clear how hed felt what had made him do such a terrible stupid thing but in the end he hadnt handed the letter over hed been terrified at the thought of boruelal opening it accidentally perhaps and reading it while he was still alive the underground car raced across the base of the plate heading for ikroh again he used his new terminal to call the drone named worthil it had left after their last meeting to go exploring in one of the systems gasgiant planets but on receiving his call had itself displaced by chiark hub to the base underside it came in through the speeding cars lock jernau gurgeh it said condensation frosting on its casing its presence entering the cars warm interior like a cold draught youve reached a decision yes he said ill go good the drone said it placed a small container about half its own size down on one of the padded car seats gasgiant flora it explained i hope i didnt unduly curtail your expedition not at all let me offer you my congratulations i think youve made a wise even brave choice it did cross my mind that contact was only offering you this opportunity to make you more content with your present life if thats what the big minds were expecting im glad to see you confounding them well done thank you gurgeh attempted a smile your ship will be prepared immediately it should be on its way within the day what kind of ship is it an old murderer class gou left over from the idiran war been in deep storage about six decades from here for the last seven hundred years called the limiting f actor its still in battletrim at the moment but theyll strip out the weaponry and emplace a set of gameboards and a module hanger i understand the mind isnt anything special these warship forms cant afford to be sparkling wits or brilliant artists but i believe its a likeable enough device itll be your opponent during the journey if you want youre free to take somebody else along with you but well send a drone with you anyway theres a human envoy at groasnachek the capital of eä and hell be your guide as well were you thinking of taking a companion no gurgeh said in fact he had thought of asking chamlis but knew the old drone felt it had already had enough excitement and boredom in its life he didnt want to put the machine in the position of having to say no if it actually wanted to go he was sure it wouldnt be afraid to ask probably wise what about personal possessions it could be awkward if you want to take anything larger than a small module say or livestock larger than human size gurgeh shook his head nothing remotely that large a few cases of clothes perhaps one or two ornaments nothing more what sort of drone were you thinking of sending basically a diplomatcumtranslator and general gofer probably an oldtimer with some experience of the empire itll have to have a comprehensive knowledge of all the empires social mannerisms and forms of address and so on you wouldnt believe how easy it is to make gaffes in a society like that the drone will keep you clear as far as etiquette goes itll have a library too of course and probably a limited degree of offensive capability i dont want a gundrone worthil gurgeh said it is advisable for your own protection youll be under the protection of the imperial authorities of course but they arent infallible physical attack isnt unknown during a game and there are groups within the society which might want to harm you i ought to point out the limiting factor wont be able to stay near by once its dropped you on eä the empires military have insisted they will not allow a warship to be stationed over their home planet the only reason theyre letting it approach eä at all is because were removing all the armament once the ship has departed that drone will be the only totally reliable protection you have it wont make me invulnerable though will it no then ill take my chances with the empire give me a mildmannered drone positively nothing armed nothing targetoriented i really do strongly advise drone gurgeh said to play this game properly ill need to feel as much as possible like one of the locals with the same vulnerability and worries i dont want your device bodyguarding me there wont be any point in my going if i know i dont have to take the game as seriously as everybody else the drone said nothing for some time well if youre sure it said eventually sounding unhappy i am very well if you insist the drone made a sighing sound i think that settles everything the ship ought to be here in a there is a condition gurgeh said a condition the drone said its fields became briefly visible a glittering mixture of blue and brown and grey there is a drone here called mawhrinskel gurgeh said yes worthil said carefully i was briefed that that device lives here now what about it it was exiled from special circumstances thrown out weve become friends since it came here i promised if i ever had any influence with contact id do what i could to help it im afraid i can only play azad on condition that the drones returned to sc worthil said nothing for a moment that was rather a foolish promise to have made mr gurgeh i admit i didnt ever think i would be in a position to have to fulfil it but i am so i have to make that a condition you dont want to take this machine with you do you worthil sounded puzzled no he said i just promised id try to get it back into service uhhuh well im not really in a position to make that sort of deal jernau gurgeh that machine was civilianised because it was dangerous and refused to undergo reconstruction therapy its case is not something that i can decide on its a matter for the admissions board concerned all the same i have to insist worthil made a sighing noise lifted the spherical container it had placed on the seat and seemed to study its blank surface ill do what i can it said a trace of annoyance in its tone but i cant promise anything admissions and appeal boards hate being leant on they go terribly moralistic i need my obligation to mawhrinskel discharged somehow gurgeh said quietly i cant leave here with it able to claim i didnt try to help it the contact drone seemed not to hear then it said hmm well well see what we can do the underground car flew across the base of the world silent and swift to gurgeh a great gameplayer a great man hafflis stood on the parapet at one end of the terrace the kilometre drop behind him a bottle in one hand a fuming drugbowl in the other the stone table was crowded with people whod come to wish gurgeh goodbye it had been announced that he was leaving tomorrow morning to journey to the clouds on the gsv little rascal to be one of the cultures representatives at the pardethillisian games the great ludic convocation held every twentytwo years or so by the meritocracy pardethillisi in the lesser cloud gurgeh had indeed been invited to this tournament as he had been invited to the games before that just as he was to several thousand competitions and convocations of various sizes and complexions every year either within the culture or outside it hed refused that invitation as he refused them all but the story now was that hed changed his mind and would go there and play for the culture the next games were to be held in three and a half years which made the need to leave at such short notice somewhat tricky to explain but contact had done a little creative timetabling and some barefaced lying and made it appear to the casual inquirer that only the little rascal could get gurgeh there in time for the lengthy formal registration and qualifying period required cheers hafilis put his head back and the bottle to his lips everybody round the great table joined in drinking from a dozen different types of bowl glass goblet and tankard hafflis rocked further and further back on his heels as he drained the bottle a few people shouted out warnings or threw bits of food at him he just had time to put the bottle down and smack his winewet lips before he overbalanced and disappeared over the edge of the parapet oops came his muffled voice two of his younger children sitting playing threecups with a thoroughly mystified styglian enumerator went to the parapet and dragged their drunken parent back over from the safety field he tumbled on to the terrace and staggered back to his seat laughing gurgeh sat between professor boruelal and one of his old flames vossle chu the woman whose hobbies had in the past included ironfoundry she had crossed from rombree on chiarks farside from gevant to come and see gurgeh off there were at least ten of his former lovers amongst the crowd squeezed around the table he wondered fuzzily what the significance might be that out of that ten six had chosen to change sex and become and remain men over the past few years gurgeh along with everybody else was getting drunk as was traditional on such occasions hafflis had promised that they would not do to gurgeh what they had done to a mutual friend a few years earlier the young man had been accepted into contact and hafflis had held a party to celebrate at the end of the evening theyd stripped the fellow naked and thrown him over the parapet but the safety field had been turned off the new contact recruit had fallen nine hundred metres six hundred of them with empty bowels before three of haffliss prepositioned house drones rose calmly out of the forest beneath to catch him and take him back up the demilitarised general offensive unit limiting factor had arrived under ikroh that afternoon gurgeh had gone down to the transit gallery to inspect it the craft was a third of a kilometre long very sleek and simple looking a pointed nose three long blisters like vast aircraft cockpits leading to the nose and another five fat blisters circling the vessels waist its rear was blunt and flat the ship had said hello told him it was there to take him to the gsv little rascal and asked him if he had any special dietary requirements boruelal slapped him on the back were going to miss you gurgeh likewise gurgeh said swaying and felt quite emotional he wondered when it would be time to throw the paper lanterns over the parapet to float down to the rainforest theyd turned the lights on behind the waterfall all the way down the cliff and an inflatible dirigible seemingly crewed largely by gamefans had anchored above the plain level with tronze promising a firework display later gurgeh had been quite touched by such shows of respect and affection gurgeh chamlis said he turned still holding his glass to look at the old machine it put a small package into his hand a present it said gurgeh looked at the small parcel paper tied up with ribbon just an old tradition chamlis explained you open it when youre under way thank you gurgeh said nodding slowly he put the present into his jacket then did something he rarely did with drones and hugged the old machine putting his arms round its aura fields thank you very very much the night darkened a brief shower almost extinguished the coals in the centre of the table but hafflis got supply drones to bring crates of spirits and they all had fun squirting the drink on to the coals to keep them alight in pools of blue flame which burned down half the paper lanterns and scorched the nightflower vines and made many holes in clothes and singed the styglian enumerators pelt lightning flashed in the mountains above the lake the falls glowed backlit and fabulous and the dirigibles fireworks drew applause and answering fireworks and cloudlasers from all over tronze gurgeh was dumped naked into the lake but hauled out spluttering by haffliss children he woke up in boruelals bed at the university a little after dawn he sneaked away early he looked around the room early morning sunlight flooded the landscape outside ikroh and lanced through the lounge streaming in from the fjordside windows across the room and out through the windows opening on to the uphill lawns birds filled the cool still air with song there was nothing else to take nothing more to pack hed sent the house drones down with a chest of clothes the night before but now wondered why hed bothered he wouldnt need many changes on the warship and when they got to the gsv he could order anything he wanted hed packed a few personal ornaments and had the house copy his stock of still and moving pictures to the limiting factors memory the last thing hed done was burn the letter hed written to leave with boruelal and stir the ashes in the fireplace until they were fine as dust nothing more remained ready worthil said yes he said his head was clear and no longer sore but he felt tired and knew hed sleep well that night is it here yet on its way they were waiting for mawhrinskel it had been told its appeal had been reopened as a favour to gurgeh it was likely to be given a role in special circumstances it had acknowledged but not appeared it would meet them when gurgeh left gurgeh sat down to wait a few minutes before he was due to leave the tiny drone appeared floating down the chimney to hover over the empty fire grate mawhrinskel worthil said just in time i believe im being recalled to duty the smaller drone said you are indeed worthil said heartily good im sure my friend the lou gunboat diplomat will follow my future career with great interest of course worthil said i would hope it would mawhrinskels fields glowed orangered it floated over to gurgeh its grey body shining brightly fields all but extinguished in the bright sunshine thank you it said to him i wish you a good journey and much luck gurgeh sat on the couch and looked at the tiny machine he thought of several things to say but said none of them instead he stood up straightened his jacket looked at worthil and said i think im ready to go now mawhrinskel watched him leave the room but did not try to follow he boarded the limiting factor worthil showed him the three great gameboards set in three of the effector bulges round the vessels waist pointed out the module hangar housed in the fourth blister and the swimming pool which the dockyard had installed in the fifth because they couldnt think of anything else at such short notice and they didnt like to leave the blister just empty the three effectors in the nose had been left in but disconnected to be removed once the limiting factor docked with the little rascal worthil guided him round the living quarters which seemed perfectly acceptable surprisingly quickly it was time to leave and gurgeh said goodbye to the contact drone he sat in the accommodation section watching the small drone float down the corridor to the warships lock and then told the screen in front of him to switch to exterior view the temporary corridor joining the ship to ikrohs transit gallery retracted and the long tube of the ships innardhull slotted back into place from outside then with no notice or noise at all the view of the plate base withdrew shrinking as the ship pulled away the plate merged into the other three on that side of the orbital to become part of a single thick line and then that line dwindled rapidly to a point and the star of chiarks system flashed brilliantly from behind it before the star too quickly dulled and shrank and gurgeh realised he was on his way to the empire of azad imperium still with me little textual note for you here bear with me those of you unfortunate enough not to be reading or hearing this in marain may well be using a language without the requisite number or type of personal pronouns so id better explain that bit of the translation marain the cultures quintessentially wonderful language so the culture will tell you has as any schoolkid knows one personal pronoun to cover females males inbetweens neuters children drones minds other sentient machines and every lifeform capable of scraping together anything remotely resembling a nervous system and the rudiments of language or a good excuse for not having either naturally there are ways of specifying a persons sex in marain but theyre not used in everyday conversation in the archetypal languageasmoralweaponandproudofit the message is that its brains that matter kids gonads are hardly worth making a distinction over so in what follows gurgeh is quite happily thinking about the azadians just as hed think about any other see list above but what of you o unlucky possibly brutish probably ephemeral and undoubtedly disadvantaged citizen of some uncultured society especially those unfairly and the azadians would say under endowed with only the mean number of genders how shall we refer to the triumvirate of azadian sexes without resorting to funnylooking alien terms or gratingly awkward phrases notwords rest at ease i have chosen to use the natural and obvious pronouns for male and female and to represent the intermediates or apices with whatever pronominal term best indicates their place in their society relative to the existing sexual powerbalance of yours in other words the precise translation depends on whether your own civilisation for let us err on the side of terminological generosity is male or female dominated those which can fairly claim to be neither will of course have their own suitable term anyway enough of that lets see now weve finally got old gurgeh off gevant plate chiark orbital and we have him fizzing away at quite a clip in a stripped down military ship heading for a rendezvous with the cloudbound general systems vehicle little rascal points to ponder does gurgeh really understand what hes done and what might happen to him has it even begun to occur to him that he might have been tricked and does he really know what hes let himself in for of course not thats part of the fun gurgeh had been on cruises many times in his life and on that longest one thirty years earlier travelled some thousands of light years from chiark but within a few hours of his departure aboard the limiting factor he was feeling the gap of light years the still accelerating ship was putting between him and his home with an immediacy he had not anticipated he spent some time watching the screen where chiarks star shone yellowwhite and gradually diminishing but nevertheless he felt further away from it than even the screen showed he had never felt the falseness of such representations before but sitting there in the old accommodation social area looking at the rectangle of screen on the wall he couldnt help feeling like an actor or a component in the ships circuitry like part of and therefore as false as the pretendview of real space hung in front of him maybe it was the silence he had expected noise for some reason the limiting factor was tearing through something it called ultraspace with increasing acceleration the crafts velocity was hurtling towards its maximum with a rapidity which when displayed in numbers on the wallscreen numbed gurgehs brain he didnt even know what ultraspace was was it the same as hyperspace at least he had heard of that even if he didnt know much about it whatever for all its apparent speed the ship was almost perfectly silent and he experienced an enervating eerie feeling as though the ancient warship mothballed all those centuries had somehow not yet fully woken up and events within its sleek hull still moved to another slower tempo made half of dreams the ship didnt seem to want to start any conversations either which normally wouldnt have bothered gurgeh but now did he left his cabin and went for a walk going down the narrow hundred metrelong corridor which led to the waist of the craft in the bare corridor hardly a metre wide and so low he could touch the ceiling without having to stretch he thought he could hear a very faint hum coming from all around him at the end of that passage he turned down another apparently sloping at an angle of at least thirty degrees but seemingly level as soon as he stepped with a moment of dizziness into it that corridor ended at an effector blister where one of the great gameboards had been set up the board stretched out in front of him a swirl of geometric shapes and varying colours a landscape spreading out over five hundred square metres with the low pyramidranges of stacked threedimensional territory increasing even that total he walked over to the edge of the huge board wondering if he had after all taken on too much he looked around the old effector blister the board took up a little more than half the floor space lying on top of the light foam metal planking the dockyard had installed half the volume of the space was beneath gurgehs feet the crosssection of the effector housing was circular and the planking and board described a diameter across it more or less flush with the hull of the ship beyond the blister the housing roof curved gunmetal dull arcing twelve metres overhead gurgeh dropped under the planking on a floathatch into the dimly lit bowl under the foam metal floor the echoing space was even more empty than that above save for a few hatches and shallow holes on the surface of the bowl the removal of the mass of weaponry had been accomplished without leaving a trace gurgeh remembered mawhrinskel and wondered how the limiting factor felt about having its talons drawn jernau gurgeh he turned as his name was pronounced and saw a cube of skeletal components floating near him yes we have now reached our terminal aggregation point and are sustaining a velocity of approximately eight point five kilolights in ultraspace one positive really gurgeh said he looked at the halfmetre cube and wondered which bits were its eyes yes the remotedrone said we are due to rendezvous with the gsv little rascal in approximately one hundred and two days from now we are currently receiving instructions from the little rascal on how to play azad and the ship has instructed me to tell you it will shortly be able to commence playing when do you wish to start well not right now gurgeh said he touched the floathatch controls rising through the floor into the light the remotedrone drifted up above him i want to settle in first he told it i need more theoretical work before i start playing very well the drone started to drift away it stopped the ship wishes to advise you that its normal operating mode includes full internal monitoring removing the need for your terminal is this satisfactory or would you prefer the internal observation systems to be switched off and to use your terminal to contact the ship the terminal gurgeh said immediately internal monitoring has been reduced to emergencyonly status thanks gurgeh said youre welcome the drone said floating off gurgeh watched it disappear into the corridor then turned back to look at the vast board shaking his head once more over the next thirty days gurgeh didnt touch a single azad piece the whole time was spent learning the theory of the game studying its history where it was useful for a better understanding of the play memorising the moves each piece could make as well as their values handedness potential and actual moralestrength their varied intersecting timepowercurves and their specific skill harmonics as related to different areas of the boards he pored over tables and grids setting out the qualities inherent in the suits numbers levels and sets of the associated cards and puzzled over the place in the greater play the lesser boards occupied and how the elemental imagery in the later stages fitted in with the more mechanistic workings of the pieces boards and diematching in the earlier rounds while at the same time trying to find some way of linking in his mind the tactics and strategy of the game as it was usually played both in its singlegame mode one person against another and in the multiplegame versions when up to ten contestants might compete in the same match with all the potential for alliances intrigue concerted action pacts and treachery that such a gameform made possible gurgeh found the days slipping by almost unnoticed he would sleep only two or three hours each night and the rest of the time he was in front of the screen or sometimes standing in the middle of one of the gameboards as the ship talked to him drew holo diagrams in the air and moved pieces about he was glanding the whole time his bloodstream full of secreted drugs his brain pickled in their genofixed chemistry as his muchworked maingland five times the humanbasic size it had been in his primitive ancestors pumped or instructed other glands to pump the coded chemicals into his body chamlis sent a couple of messages gossip about the plate mostly mawhrinskel had disappeared hafflis was talking about changing back to a woman so he could have another child hub and the plate landscapers had set a date for the opening of tepharne the latest farside plate to be constructed which had still been undergoing its weathering when gurgeh had left it would be opened to people in a couple of years chamlis suspected yay would not be pleased she hadnt been consulted before the announcement was made chamlis wished gurgeh well and asked him how he was yays communication was barely more than a movingpicture postcard she lay sprawled in a gweb before a vast screen or a huge observation port showing a blue and red gasgiant planet and told him she was enjoying her cruise with shuro and a couple of his friends she didnt seem entirely sober she wagged one finger at him telling him he was bad for leaving so soon and for so long without waiting until she got back then she seemed to see somebody outside the terminals field of view and closed saying shed be in touch later gurgeh told the limiting factor to acknowledge the communications but did not reply directly the calls left him feeling a little alone but he threw himself back into the game each time and everything else was washed from his mind but that he talked to the ship it was more approachable than its remotedrone had been as worthil had said it was likeable but not in any way brilliant except at azad in fact it occurred to gurgeh that the old warship was getting more out of the game than he was it had learned it perfectly and seemed to enjoy teaching him as well as simply glorying in the game itself as a complex and beautiful system the ship admitted it had never fired its effectors in anger and that perhaps it was finding something in azad that it had missed in real fighting the limiting factor was murderer class general offensive unit number and as such was one of the last built constructed seven hundred and sixteen years earlier in the closing stages of the idiran war when the conflict in space was almost over in theory the craft had seen active service but at no point had it ever been in any danger after thirty days gurgeh started to handle the pieces a proportion of azad gamepieces were biotechs sculpted artefacts of genetically engineered cells which changed character from the moment they were first unwrapped and placed on the board part vegetable part animal they indicated their values and abilities by colour shape and size the limiting factor claimed the pieces it had produced were indistinguishable from the real things though gurgeh thought this was probably a little optimistic it was only when he started to try to gauge the pieces to feel and smell what they were and what they might become weaker or more powerful faster or slower shorter or longer lived that he realised just how hard the whole game was going to be he simply could not work the biotechs out they were just like lumps of carved coloured vegetables and they lay in his hands like dead things he rubbed them until his hands stained he sniffed them and stared at them but once they were on the board they did quite unexpected things changing to become cannonfodder when hed thought they were battleships altering from the equivalent of philosophical premises stationed well back in his own territories to become observation pieces best suited for the high ground or a front line after four days he was in despair and seriously thinking of demanding to be returned to chiark admitting everything to contact and just hoping they would take pity on him and either keep mawhrinskel on or keep it silenced anything rather than go on with this demoralising appallingly frustrating charade the limiting factor suggested he forgot about the biotechs for the moment and concentrated on the subsidiary games which if he won them would give him a degree of choice over the extent to which biotechs had to be used in the following stages gurgeh did as the ship suggested and got on reasonably well but he still felt depressed and pessimistic and sometimes he would find that the limiting factor had been talking to him for some minutes while he had been thinking about some quite different aspect of the game and he had to ask the ship to repeat itself the days went by and now and again the ship would suggest gurgeh handled a biotech and would advise him which secretions to build up beforehand it even suggested he take some of the more important pieces into bed with him so that he would lie asleep hands clutched or arms cradled round a biotech as though it was a tiny baby he always felt rather foolish when he woke up and he was glad there was nobody there to see him in the morning but then he wondered if that was true his experience with mawhrinskel might have made him oversensitive but he doubted he would ever be certain again that he wasnt being watched perhaps the limiting factor was spying on him perhaps contact was observing him evaluating him but he decided he no longer cared if they were or not he took every tenth day off again at the ships suggestion he explored the vessel more fully though there was little enough to see gurgeh was used to civilian craft which could be compared in density and design to ordinary humanhabitable buildings with comparatively thin walls enclosing large volumes of space but the warship was more like a single solid chunk of rock or metal like an asteroid with only a few small hollowedout tubes and tiny caves fit for humans to wander about in he walked along or clambered through or floated up and down what corridors and passageways it did have though and stood in one of the three nose blisters for a while gazing at the congealedlooking clutter of stillunremoved machinery and equipment the primary effector surrounded by its associated shielddisruptors scanners trackers illuminators displacers and secondary weaponry systems bulked large in the dim light and looked like some gigantic conelensed eyeball encrusted with gnarled metallic growths the whole massy assemblage was easily twenty metres in diameter but the ship told him he thought with some pride that when it was all connected up it could spin and stop the whole installation so fast that to a human it would appear only to flicker momentarily blink and youd miss it he inspected the empty hangar in one of the waist blisters it would eventually house a contact module which was being converted on the gsv they were on their way to meet that module would be gurgehs home when he arrived on eä hed seen holos of how the interior would look it was passably spacious if hardly up to the standards of ikroh he learned more about the empire itself its history and politics philosophy and religion its beliefs and mores and its mixtures of sub species and sexes it seemed to him to be an unbearably vivid tangle of contradictions at the same time pathologically violent and lugubriously sentimental startlingly barbaric and surprisingly sophisticated fabulously rich and grindingly poor but also undeniably unequivocally fascinating and it was true that as hed been told there was one constant in all the numbing variety of azadian life the game of azad permeated every level of society like a single steady theme nearly buried in a cacophony of noise and gurgeh started to see what the drone worthil had meant when it said contact suspected it was the game that held the empire together nothing else seemed to he swam in the pool most days the effector housing had been converted to include a holo projector and the limiting factor started out by showing a blue sky and white clouds on the inside surface of the twentyfive metre broad blister but he grew tired of looking at that and told the ship to produce the view he would see if they were travelling in real space the adjusted equivalent view as the ship called it so he swam beneath the unreal blackness of space and the hard little lightmotes of the slowly moving stars pulling himself through and diving beneath the gently underlit surface of the warm water like a soft inverted image of a ship himself by about the ninetieth day he felt he was just starting to develop a feel for the biotechs he could play a limited game against the ship on all the minor boards and one of the major boards and when he went to sleep he spent the whole three hours each night dreaming about people and his life reliving his childhood and his adolescence and his years since then in a strange mixture of memory and fantasy and unrealised desire he always meant to write to or record something for chamlis or yay or any of the other people back at chiark whod sent messages but the time never seemed quite right and the longer he delayed the harder the task became gradually people stopped sending to him which made gurgeh feel guilty and relieved at once one hundred and one days after leaving chiark and well over two thousand light years from the orbital the limiting factor made its rendezvous with the river class superlifter kiss my ass the tandemed craft now enclosed within one ellipsoid field began to increase their speed to match that of the gsv this was going to take a few hours apparently so gurgeh went to bed as normal the limiting factor woke him halfway into his sleep it switched his cabin screen on whats happening gurgeh said sleepily just starting to worry the screen which made up one wall of the cabin was inholoed so that it acted like a window before he had switched it off and gone to sleep it had shown the rear end of the superlifter against the starfield now it showed a landscape a slowly moving panorama of lakes and hills streams and forests all seen from directly overhead an aircraft flew slowly over the view like a lazy insect i thought you might like to see this the ship said wheres that gurgeh asked rubbing his eyes he didnt understand hed thought the whole idea of meeting the superlifter was so that the gsv which they were due to meet soon didnt have to slow down the superlifter was supposed to haul them along even faster so they could catch up with the giant craft instead they must have stopped over an orbital or a planet or something even bigger we have now rendezvoused with the gsv little rascal the ship told him have we where is it gurgeh said swinging his feet out of bed youre looking at its topside rear park the view which must have been magnified earlier retreated and gurgeh realised that he was looking down at a huge craft over which the limiting factor was moving slowly the park seemed to be roughly square he couldnt guess how many kilometres to a side in the hazy distance forward there was the hint of immense regular canyons ribs on that vast surface stepping down to further levels the whole sweep of air and ground and water was lit from directly above and he realised that he couldnt even see the limiting factors shadow he asked a few questions still staring at the screen although it was only four kilometres in height the plate class general systems vehicle little rascal was fully fiftythree in length and twentytwo across the beam the topside rear park covered an area of four hundred square kilometres and the crafts overall length from endtoend of its outermost field was a little over ninety kilometres it was shipconstruction rather than accommodation biased so there were only two hundred and fifty million people on it in the five hundred days it took the little rascal to cross from the main galaxy to the region of the clouds gurgeh gradually learned the game of azad and even found sufficient spare time to meet and casually befriend a few people these were contact people half of them formed the crew of the gsv itself there not so much to run the craft anyone of its triumvirate of minds was quite capable of doing that as to manage their own human society on board and to witness to study the neverending torrent of data delivered on new discoveries by distant contact units and other gsvs to learn and be the cultures human representatives amongst the systems of stars and the systems of sentient societies contact was there to discover investigate and occasionally change the other half was composed of the crews of smaller craft some were there for recreation and refit stops others were hitching a ride just as gurgeh and the limiting factor were some left en route to survey more of the clusters and clumps of stars which existed between the galaxy and the clouds while other people were waiting for their vessels to be built the ships and smaller systems vehicles they would one day crew existing only as another number on a list of craft to be built on board at some point in the future the little rascal was what contact termed a throughput gsv it acted as a kind of marshalling point for humans and material picking people up and assembling them into crews for the units lsvs msvs and smaller classes of gsvs which it constructed other types of large gsvs were accommodation biased and effectively selfsufficient in human crews for their offspring craft gurgeh spent some days in the park on top of the vessel walking through it or flying over it in one of the realwinged propellerdriven aircraft which were the fashion on the gsvat the time he even became a proficient enough flyer to enter himself in a race during which several thousand of the flimsy planes flew figuresofeight over the top of the vehicle through one of the cavernous accessways that ran the length of the craft out the other end and underneath the limiting factor housed in one of the mainbays just off a way encouraged him in this saying it provided gurgeh with much needed relaxation gurgeh accepted none of the offers to play people at games but did take up a trickle from the flood of invitations to parties events and other gatherings he spent some days and nights off the limiting factor and the old warship was in turn host to a select number of young female guests most of the time though gurgeh spent alone inside the ship poring over tables of figures and the records of past games rubbing the biotechs in his hands and striding over the three great boards gaze flickering over the lay of land and pieces his mind racing searching for patterns and opportunities strengths and weaknesses he spent twenty days or so taking a crash course in eächic the imperial language he had originally envisaged speaking marain as usual and using an interpreter but he suspected there were subtle links between the language and the game and for that reason alone learned the tongue the ship told him later it would have been desirable anyway the culture was trying to keep even the intricacies of its language secret from the empire of azad not long after hed arrived hed been sent a drone a machine even smaller than mawhrinskel it was circular in plan and composed of separate revolving sections rotating rings around a stationary core it said it was a library drone with diplomatic training and it was called trebel flereimsaho ephandra lorgin estral gurgeh said hello and made sure his terminal was switched on as soon as the machine had gone again he sent a message to chamlis amalkney along with a recording of his meeting with the tiny drone chamlis signalled back later that the device appeared to be what it claimed one of a fairly new model of library drone not the oldtimer they might have expected but probably harmless enough chamlis had never heard of an offensive version of that type the old drone closed with some gevant gossip yay meristinoux was talking about leaving chiark to pursue her landscaping career elsewhere shed developed an interest in things called volcanoes had gurgeh heard of those hafflis was changing sex again professor boruelal sent her regards but no more messages until he wrote back mawhrinskel still thankfully absent hub was piqued it appeared to have lost the ghastly machine technically the wretch was still within the orbital minds jurisdiction and it would have to account for it somehow at the next inventory and census for a few days after that first meeting with flereimsaho gurgeh wondered what it was that he found disturbing about the tiny library drone flereimsaho was almost pathetically small it could have hidden inside a pair of cupped hands but there was something about it which made gurgeh feel oddly uncomfortable in its presence he worked it out or rather he woke up knowing one morning after a nightmare in which hed been trapped inside a metal sphere and rolled around in some bizarre and cruel game flereimsaho with its spinning outer sections and its disclike white casing looked rather like a hiddenpiece wafer from a possession game gurgeh lounged in an envelopingly comfortable chair set underneath some lushly canopied trees and watched people skating in the rink below he was dressed only in a waistcoat and shorts but there was a leakfield between the observation area and the icerink itself keeping the air around gurgeh warm he divided his time between his terminal screen from which he was memorising some probability equations and the rink where a few people he knew were sweeping about the sculpted pastel surfaces good day jernau gurgeh said the drone flereimsaho in its squeaky little voice settling delicately on the plump arm of the chair as usual its aura field was yellowgreen mellow approachability hello gurgeh said glancing at it briefly and what have you been up to he touched the terminal screen to inspect another set of tables and equations oh well actually ive been studying some of the species of birds which live here within the interior of the vessel i do find birds interesting dont you hmm gurgeh nodded vaguely watching the tables change what i havent been able to work out he said is when you go for a walk in the topside park you find droppings as youd expect to but inside here everythings spotless does the gsv have drones to clean up after the birds or what i know i could just ask it but i wanted to work it out for myself there must be some answer oh thats easy the little machine said you just use birds and trees with a symbiotic relationship the birds soil only in the bolls of certain trees otherwise the fruit they depend on doesnt grow gurgeh looked down at the drone i see he said coldly well i was growing tired of the problem anyway he turned back to the equations adjusting the floating terminal so that its screen hid flereimsaho from his sight the drone stayed silent went a confused medley of contrite purple and donotdisturb silver and flew away flereimsaho kept itself to itself most of the time only calling on gurgeh once a day or so and not staying on board the limiting factor gurgeh was glad of that the young machine it said it was only thirteen could be trying at times the ship reassured gurgeh that the little drone would be up to the task of preventing social gaffes and keeping him informed on the finer linguistic points by the time they arrived at the empire and it told gurgeh later reassured flereimsaho that the man didnt really despise it there was more news from gevant gurgeh had actually written back to a few people or recorded messages for them now that he felt he was finally coming to grips with azad and could spare the time he and chamlis corresponded every fifty days or so though gurgeh found he had little to say and most of the news came from the other direction hafflis was fully changed broody but not pregnant chamlis was compiling a definitive history of some primitive planet it had once visited professor boruelal was taking a halfyear sabbatical living in a mountain retreat on osmolon plate terminalless olz hap the wunderkind had come out of her shell she was already lecturing on games at the university and had become a brilliant regular on the best party circuits she had spent some days staying at lkroh just to be better able to relate to gurgeh shed gone on record as claiming he was the best player in the culture haps analysis of the famous stricken game at haffliss that night was the bestreceived first work anybody could remember yay sent to say she was fed up with chiark she was off away shed had offers from other plate building collectives and she was going to take up at least one of them just to show what she could do she spent most of the communication explaining her theories on artificial volcanoes for plates describing in gesticulatory detail how you could lens sunlight to focus it on the undersurface of the plate melting the rock on the other side or just use generators to provide the heat she enclosed some film of eruptions on planets with explanations of the effects and notes on how they could be improved gurgeh thought the idea of sharing a world with volcanoes made floating islands look like not such a bad idea after all have you seen this flereimsaho yelped one day floating quickly up to him in the pools airstream cabinet where gurgeh was drying off behind the little machine attached to it by a thin strand of field still coloured yellowgreen but speckled with angry white there floated a large rather oldfashioned and complicatedlooking drone gurgeh squinted at it what about it ive got to wear the damn thing flereimsaho wailed the field strand joining it to the other drone flicked and the oldlooking drones casing hinged open the old bodyshell appeared to be completely empty but as gurgeh puzzled looked closer he saw that in the centre of the casing there was a little mesh cradle just the right size to hold flereimsaho oh gurgeh said and turned away rubbing the water from his armpits and grinning they didnt tell me this when they offered me the job flereimsaho protested slamming the bodyshell shut again they say its because the empire isnt supposed to know how small us drones are why couldnt they just have got a big drone then why saddle me with this this fancy dress gurgeh suggested rubbing a hand through his hair and stepping out of the airstream fancy the library drone screamed fancy dowdys what it is rags worse than that im supposed to make a humming noise and produce lots of static electricity just to convince these barbarian dingbats we cant build drones properly the small machines voice rose to a screech a humming noise i ask you perhaps you could ask for a transfer gurgeh said calmly slipping into his robe oh yes flereimsaho said bitterly with a trace of what might almost have been sarcasm and get all the shit jobs from now on because i havent been cooperative it lashed a field out and thumped the antique casing im stuck with this heap of junk drone gurgeh said i cant tell you how sorry i am the limiting factor nosed its way out of the mainbay two lifters nudged the craft round until it faced down the twenty kilometre length of corridor the ship and its little tugs eased their way forward exiting from the body of the gsv at its nose other ships and craft and pieces of equipment moved inside the shell of air surrounding the little rascal gcus and superlifters planes and hotair balloons vacuum dirigibles and gliders people floating in modules or cars or harnesses some watched the old warship go the lifter tugs dropped away the ship went up passing level upon level of bay doors blank hull hanging gardens and whole jumbled arrays of opened accommodation sections where people walked or danced or sat eating or just gazing out watching the fuss of airborne activity or played sports and games some waved gurgeh watched on the lounge screen and even recognised a few people hed known flying past in an aircraft shouting goodbye officially he was going on a solo cruising holiday before travelling to the pardethillisian games he had already dropped hints he might forgo the tournament some of the theoretical and news journals had been interested enough in his sudden departure from chiark and the equally abrupt cessation of his publications to have representatives on the little rascal interview him in a strategy hed already agreed with contact hed given the impression he was growing bored with games in general and that the journey and his entry in the great tournament were attempts to restore his flagging interest people seemed to have fallen for this the ship cleared the top of the gsv rising beside the cloudspeckled topside park it rose on into the thinner air above met with the superlifter prime mover and together they gradually dropped back and to the side of the gsvs inner atmospheric envelope they went slowly through the many layers of fields the bumpfield the insulating the sensory the signalling and receptor the energy and traction the hullfield the outer sensory and finally the horizon until they were free in hyperspace once more after a few hours of deceleration to speeds the limiting factors engines could cope with the disarmed warship was on its own and the prime mover was powering away again chasing its gsv so youd be well advised to stay celibate theyll find it difficult enough taking a male seriously even if you do look bizarre to them but if you tried to form any sexual relationships theyd almost certainly take it as a gross insult any more good news drone dont say anything about sexual alterations either they do know about drugglands even if they dont know about their precise effects but they dont know about most of the major physical improvements i mean you can mention blisterfree callousing and that sort of thing that isnt important but even the gross replumbing involved in your own genital design would cause something of a furore if they found out about it really gurgeh said he was sitting in the limiting factors main lounge flereimsaho and the ship were giving him a briefing on what he could and couldnt say and do in the empire they were a few days travel from the frontier yes theyd be jealous the tiny drone said in its high slightly grating voice and probably quite disgusted too especially jealous though the ship said through its remotedrone making a sighing noise well yes flereimsaho said but definitely disg the thing to remember gurgeh the ship interrupted quickly is that their society is based on ownership everything that you see and touch everything you come into contact with will belong to somebody or to an institution it will be theirs they will own it in the same way everyone you meet will be conscious of both their position in society and their relationship to others around them it is especially important to remember that the ownership of humans is possible too not in terms of actual slavery which they are proud to have abolished but in the sense that according to which sex and class one belongs to one may be partially owned by another or others by having to sell ones labour or talents to somebody with the means to buy them in the case of males they give themselves most totally when they become soldiers the personnel in their armed forces are like slaves with little personal freedom and under threat of death if they disobey females sell their bodies usually entering into the legal contract of marriage to intermediates who then pay them for their sexual favours by oh ship come on he laughed he had done his own research into the empire reading its own histories and watching its explanatory recordings the ships view of the empires customs and institutions sounded biased and unfair and terribly cultureprim flereimsaho and the ship remote made a show of looking at each other then the small library drone flushed grey yellow with resignation and said in its high voice all right lets go back to the beginning the limiting factor lay in space above eä the beautiful bluewhite planet gurgeh had seen for the first time almost two years earlier in the screenroom at ikroh on either side of the ship lay an imperial battlecruiser each twice the length of the culture craft the two warships had met the smaller vessel at the limits of the star clump eäs system lay in and the limiting factor already on a slow warp drive rather than its normal hyperspace propulsion something else the empire was being kept in the dark about had stopped its eight effector blisters were transparent showing the three gameboards module hangar and pool in the waist housings and the empty spaces in the three long nose emplacements the weaponry having been removed on the little rascal nevertheless the azadians sent a small craft over to the ship with three officers in it two stayed with gurgeh while the third checked each of the blisters in turn then took a general look round the entire ship those or other officers stayed on board for the five days it took to get to eä itself they were much as gurgeh had expected with flat broad faces and the shaven almost white skin they were smaller than he was he realised when they stood in front of him but somehow their uniforms made them look much larger these were the first real uniforms gurgeh had ever seen and he felt a strange dizzying sensation when he saw them a sense of displacement and foreignness as well as an odd mixture of dread and awe knowing what he did he wasnt surprised at the way they acted towards him they seemed to try to ignore him rarely speaking to him and never looking him in the eyes when they did he had never felt quite so dismissed in life the officers did appear to be interested in the ship but not in either flereimsaho which was keeping well out of their way anyway or in the ships remotedrone flereimsaho had only minutes before the officers arrived on board finally and with extreme and voluble reluctance enclosed itself in the fake carapace of the old drone casing it had fumed quietly for a few minutes while gurgeh told it how attractive and valuably antique the ancient auraless casing looked then it had floated quickly off when the officers came aboard so much thought gurgeh for its helping with awkward linguistic points and the intricacies of etiquette the ships remotedrone was no better it followed gurgeh round but it was playing dumb and made a show of bumping into things now and again twice gurgeh had turned round and almost fallen over the slow and clumsy cube he was very tempted to kick it it was left to gurgeh to try to explain that there was no bridge or flightdeck or controlroom that he knew of in the ship but he got the impression the azadian officers didnt believe him when they arrived over eä the officers contacted their battlecruiser and talked too fast for gurgeh to understand but the limiting factor broke in and started speaking too there was a heated discussion gurgeh looked round for flereimsaho to translate but it had disappeared again he listened to the jabbering exchange for some minutes with increasing frustration he decided to let them argue it out and turned to go and sit down he stumbled over the remotedrone which was floating near the floor just behind him he fell into rather than sat on the couch the officers looked round at him briefly and he felt himself blush the remotedrone drifted hesitantly away before he could aim a foot at it so much he thought for flereimsaho so much for contacts supposedly flawless planning and stupendous cunning their juvenile representative didnt even bother to hang around and do its job properly it preferred to hide nursing its pathetic selfesteem gurgeh knew enough about the way the empire worked to realise that it wouldnt let such things happen its people knew what duties and orders meant and they took their responsibilities seriously or if they didnt they suffered for it they did as they were told they had discipline eventually after the three officers had talked amongst themselves for a while and then to their ship again they left him and went to inspect the module hangar when theyd gone gurgeh used his terminal to ask the ship what theyd been arguing about they wanted to bring some more personnel and equipment over the limiting factor told him i told them they couldnt nothing to worry about youd better get your stuff together and go to the module hangar ill be heading out of imperial space within the hour gurgeh turned to head towards his cabin wouldnt it be terrible he said if you forgot to tell flereimsaho you were going and i had to visit eä all by myself he was only half joking it would be unthinkable the ship said gurgeh passed the remotedrone in the corridor spinning slowly in midair and bobbing erratically up and down and is this really necessary he asked it just doing what im told the drone replied testily just overdoing it gurgeh muttered and went to pack his things as he packed a small parcel fell out of a cloak he hadnt worn since hed left ikroh it bounced on the soft floor of the cabin he picked it up and opened the ribbontied packet wondering who it might be from anyone of several ladies on the little rascal he imagined it was a thin bracelet a model of a very broad fully completed orbital its inner surface half light and half dark bringing it up to his eyes he could see tiny barely discernible pinpricks of light on the nighttime half the daylight side showed bright blue sea and scraps of land under minute cloud systems the whole interior scene shone with its own light powered by some source inside the narrow band gurgeh slipped it over his hand it glowed against his wrist a strange present for somebody on a gsv to give he thought then he saw the note in the package picked it out and read just to remind you when youre on that planet chamlis he frowned at the name then distantly at first but with a growing and annoying sense of shame remembered the night before hed left gevant two years earlier of course chamlis had given him a present hed forgotten whats that gurgeh said he sat in the front section of the converted module the limiting factor had picked up from the gsv he and flereimsaho had boarded the little craft and said their au revoirs to the old warship which was to stand off the empire waiting to be recalled the hangar blister had rotated and the module escorted by a couple of frigates had fallen towards the planet while the limiting factor made a show of moving very slowly and hesitantly away from the gravity well with the two battlecruisers whats what flereimsaho said floating beside him disguise discarded and lying on the floor that gurgeh said pointing at the screen which displayed the view looking straight down the module was flying overland towards groasnachek eäs capital city the empire didnt like vessels entering the atmosphere directly above its cities so theyd come in over the ocean oh flereimsaho said that thats the labyrinth prison a prison gurgeh said the complex of walls and long geometrically contorted buildings slid away beneath them as the outskirts of the sprawling capital invaded the screen yes the idea is that people whove broken laws are put into the labyrinth the precise place being determined by the nature of the offence as well as being a physical maze it is constructed to be what one might call a moral and behaviouristic labyrinth as well its external appearance offers no clues to the internal layout by the way thats just for show the prisoner must make correct responses act in certain approved ways or he will get no further and may even be put further back in theory a perfectly good person can walk free of the labyrinth in a matter of days while a totally bad person will never get out to prevent overcrowding theres a timelimit which if exceeded results in the prisoner being transferred for life to a penal colony the prison had disappeared from beneath them by the time the drone finished the city swamped the screen instead its swirling patterns of streets buildings and domes like another sort of maze sounds ingenious gurgeh said does it work so theyd have us believe in fact its used as an excuse for not giving people a proper trial and anyway the rich just bribe their way out so yes as far as the rulers are concerned it works the module and the two frigates touched down at a huge shuttleport on the banks of a broad muddy much bridged river still some distance from the centre of the city but surrounded by mediumrise buildings and low geodesic domes gurgeh walked out of the craft with flereimsaho in its fake antique guise humming loudly and crackling with static at his side he found himself standing on a huge square of synthetic grass which had been unrolled up to the rear of the module standing on the grass were perhaps forty or fifty azadians in various styles of uniform and clothing gurgeh whod been trying hard to work out how to recognise the various sexes reckoned they were mostly of the intermediate or apex sex with only a smattering of males and females beyond them stood several lines of identically uniformed males carrying weapons behind them another group played rather strident and brashsounding music the guys with the guns are just the honour guard flereimsaho said through its disguise dont be alarmed im not gurgeh said he knew this was how things were done in the empire formally with official welcoming parties composed of imperial bureaucrats security guards officials from the games organisations associated wives and concubines and people representing newsagencies one of the apices strode forward towards him this one is addressed as sir in eächic flereimsaho whispered what gurgeh said he could hardly hear the machines voice over the humming noise it was making it was buzzing and crackling loud enough to all but drown the sound of the ceremonial band and the static the drone was producing made gurgehs hair stick out on one side i said hes called sir in eächic flereimsaho hissed over the hum dont touch him but when he holds up one hand you hold up two and say your bit remember dont touch him the apex stopped just in front of gurgeh held up one hand and said welcome to groasnachek eä in the empire of azad murat gurgee gurgeh controlled a grimace held up both hands to show they were empty of weapons the old books explained and said i am honoured to set foot upon the holy ground of eä in careful eächic great start muttered the drone the rest of the welcoming passed in something of a daze gurgehs head swam he sweated under the heat of the bright binary overhead while he was outside he was expected to inspect the honour guard he knew though quite what he was supposed to be looking for had never been explained and the alien smells of the shuttleport buildings once they passed inside to the reception made him feel more strongly than hed expected that he really was somewhere quite foreign he was introduced to lots of people again mostly apices and sensed they were delighted to be addressed in what was apparently quite passable eächic flereimsaho told him to do and say certain things and he heard himself mouth the correct words and felt himself perform the acceptable gestures but his overall impression was of chaotic movement and noisy unlistening people rather smelly people too though he was sure they thought the same of him he also had an odd feeling that they were laughing at him somewhere behind their faces apart from the obvious physical differences the azadians all seemed very compact and hard and determined compared to culture people more energetic and even if he was going to be critical neurotic the apices were anyway from the little he saw of the males they seemed somehow duller less fraught and more stolid as well as being physically bulkier while the females appeared to be quieter somehow deeper and more delicatelooking he wondered how he looked to them he was aware he stared a little at the oddly alien architecture and confusing interiors as well as at the people but on the other hand he found a lot of people mostly apices again staring at him on a couple of occasions flereimsaho had to repeat what it said to him before he realised it was talking to him its monotonous hum and crackling static never far away from him that afternoon seemed only to add to the air of dazed dreamlike unreality they served food and drink in his honour culture and azadian biology was close enough for a few foods and several drinks to be mutually digestible including alcohol he drank all they gave him but bypassed it they sat in a long low shuttleport building simply styled outside but ostentatiously furnished inside around a long table loaded with food and drink uniformed males served them he remembered not to speak to them he found that most of the people he spoke to either talked too fast or painstakingly slowly but struggled through several conversations nevertheless many people asked why he had come alone and after several misunderstandings he stopped trying to explain he was accompanied by the drone and simply said he liked travelling by himself some asked him how good he was at azad he replied truthfully he had no idea the ship had never told him he said he hoped he would be able to play well enough not to make his hosts regret they had invited him to take part a few seemed impressed by this but gurgeh thought only in the way that adults are impressed by a respectful child one apex sitting on his right and dressed in a tight uncomfortablelooking uniform similar to those worn by the three officers whod boarded the limiting factor kept asking him about his journey and the ship hed made it on gurgeh stuck to the agreed story the apex continually refilled gurgehs ornate crystal goblet with wine gurgeh was obliged to drink on each occasion a toast was proposed bypassing the liquor to avoid getting drunk meant he had to go to the toilet rather often for a drink of water as much as to urinate he knew this was a subject of some delicacy with the azadians but he seemed to be using the correct form of words each time nobody looked shocked and flereimsaho seemed calm eventually the apex on gurgehs left whose name was lo pequil monenine senior and who was a liaison official with the alien affairs bureau asked gurgeh if he was ready to leave for his hotel gurgeh said he thought that he was supposed to be staying on board the module pequil began to talk rather fast and seemed surprised when flereimsaho cut in talking equally quickly the resulting conversation went a little too rapidly for gurgeh to follow perfectly but the drone eventually explained that a compromise had been reached gurgeh would stay in the module but the module would be parked on the roof of the hotel guards and security would be provided for his protection and the catering services of the hotel which was one of the very best would be at his disposal gurgeh thought this all sounded reasonable he invited pequil to come along in the module to the hotel and the apex accepted gladly before you ask our friend what were passing over now flereimsaho said hovering and buzzing at gurgehs elbow thats called a shantytown and its where the city draws its surplus unskilled labour from gurgeh frowned at the bulkily disguised drone lo pequil was standing beside gurgeh on the rear ramp of the module which had opened to make a sort of balcony the city unrolled beneath them i thought we werent to use marain in front of these people gurgeh said to the machine oh were safe enough here this guys bugged but the module can neutralise that gurgeh pointed at the shantytown whats that he asked pequil that is where people who have left the countryside for the bright lights of the big city often end up unfortunately many of them are just loafers driven off the land flereimsaho added in marain by an ingeniously unfair propertytax system and the opportunistic topdown reorganisation of the agricultural production apparatus gurgeh wondered if the drones last phrase meant farms but he turned to pequil and said i see what does your machine say pequil inquired it was quoting some poetry gurgeh told the apex about a great and beautiful city ah pequil nodded a series of upward jerks of the head your people like poetry do they gurgeh paused then said well some do and some dont you know pequil nodded wisely the wind above the city drifted in over the restraining field around the balcony and brought with it a vague smell of burning gurgeh leant on the haze of field and looked down at the huge city slipping by underneath pequil seemed reluctant to come too near the edge of the balcony oh i have some good news for you pequil said with a smile rolling both lips back whats that my office pequil said seriously and slowly has succeeded in obtaining permission for you to follow the progress of the main series games all the way to echronedal ah where the last few games are played why yes it is the culmination of the full sixyear grand cycle on the fire planet itself i assure you you are most privileged to be allowed to attend guest players are rarely granted such an honour i see i am indeed honoured i offer my sincere thanks to you and your office when i return to my home i shall tell my people that the azadians are a most generous folk you have made me feel very welcome thank you i am in your debt pequil seemed satisfied with this he nodded smiled gurgeh nodded too though he thought the better of attempting the smile well well what jernau gurgeh flereimsaho said its yellowgreen fields extending from its tiny casing like the wings of some exotic insect it laid a ceremonial robe on gurgehs bed they were in the module which now rested on the roofgarden of groasnacheks grand hotel how did i do you did very well you didnt call the minister sir when i told you to and you were a bit vague at times but on the whole you did all right you havent caused any catastrophic diplomatic incidents or grievously insulted anybody id say thats not too bad for the first day would you turn round and face the reverser i want to make sure this thing fits properly gurgeh turned round and held out his arms as the drone smoothed the robe against his back he looked at himself in the reverser field its too long and it doesnt suit me he said youre right but its what you have to wear for the grand ball in the palace tonight itll do i might take the hem up the module tells me its bugged incidentally so watch what you say once youre outside the modules fields bugged gurgeh looked at the image of the drone in the reverser position monitor and mike dont worry they do this to everybody stand still yes i think that hem needs to come up turn round gurgeh turned round you like ordering me around dont you machine he said to the tiny drone dont be silly right try it on gurgeh put the robe on looked at his image in the reverser whats this blank patch on the shoulder for thats where your insignia would go if you had one gurgeh fingered the bare area on the heavily embroidered robe couldnt we have made one up it looks a bit bare i suppose we could flereimsaho said tugging at the robe to adjust it you have to be careful doing that sort of thing though our azadian friends are always rather nonplussed by our lack of a flag or a symbol and the culture rep here youll meet him tonight if he remembers to turn up thought it was a pity there was no culture anthem for bands to play when our people come here so he whistled them the first song that came into his head and theyve been playing that at receptions and ceremonies for the last eight years i thought i recognised one of the tunes they played gurgeh admitted the drone pushed his arms up and made some more adjustments yes but the first song that came into the guys head was lick me out have you heard the lyrics ah gurgeh grinned that song yes that could be awkward damn right if they find out theyll probably declare war usual contact snafu gurgeh laughed and i used to think contact was so organised and efficient he shook his head nice to know something works the drone muttered well youve kept this whole empire secret seven decades thats worked too more luck than skill flereimsaho said it floated round in front of him inspecting the robe do you really want an insignia we could rustle some up if itd make you feel happier dont bother right well use your full name when they announce you at the ball tonight sounds reasonably impressive they cant grasp we dont have any real ranks either so you may find they use morat as a kind of title the little drone dipped to fix a stray goldthread near the hem its all to the good in the end theyre a bit blind to the culture just because they cant comprehend it in their own hierarchical terms cant take us seriously what a surprise hmm ive got a feeling its all part of a plan even this delinquent rep ambassador sorry is part of it you too i think you think gurgeh said theyve built you up gurgeh the drone told him rising to head height and brushing his hair back a little gurgeh in turn brushed the meddlesome field away from his brow contacts told the empire youre one hotshot gameplayer theyve said they reckon you can get to colonelbishopjunior ministerial level what gurgeh said looking horrified thats not what they told me or me the drone said i only found out myself looking at a news roundup an hour ago theyre setting you up man they want to keep the empire happy and theyre using you to do it first they get them good and worried telling them you can beat some of their finest players then when as is probably going to happen you get knocked out in the first round they thereby reassure the empire the cultures just a joke we get things wrong were easily humiliated gurgeh looked levelly at the drone eyes narrowed first round you think do you he said calmly oh im sorry the little drone wavered back a little in the air looking embarrassed are you offended i was just assuming well ive watched you play i mean the machines voice trailed off gurgeh removed the heavy robe and dropped it on to the floor i think ill take a bath he told the drone the machine hesitated then picked up the robe and quickly left the cabin gurgeh sat on the bed and rubbed his beard in fact the drone hadnt offended him he had his own secrets he was sure he could do better in the game than contact expected for the last hundred days on the limiting factor he knew he hadnt been extending himself while he hadnt been trying to lose or make any deliberate mistakes he also hadnt been concentrating as much as he intended to in the coming games he wasnt sure himself why he was pulling his punches in this way but somehow it seemed important not to let contact know everything to keep something back it was a small victory against them a little game a gesture on a lesser board a blow against the elements and the gods the great palace of groasnachek lay by the broad and murky river which had given the city its name that night there was a grand ball for the more important people who would be playing the game of azad over the next halfyear they were taken there in a groundcar along broad treelined boulevards lit by tall floodlights gurgeh sat in the back of the vehicle with pequil whod been in the car when it arrived at the hotel a uniformed male drove the car apparently in sole control of the machine gurgeh tried not to think about crashes flereimsaho sat on the floor in its bulky disguise humming quietly and attracting small fibres from the limousines furry floor covering the palace wasnt as immense as gurgeh had expected though still impressive enough it was ornately decorated and brightly illuminated and from each of its many spires and towers long richly decorated banners waved sinuously slow brilliant waves of heraldry against the orangeblack sky in the awningcovered courtyard where the car stopped there was a huge array of gilded scaffolding on which burned twelve thousand candles of various sizes and colours one for every person entered in the games the ball itself was for over a thousand people about half of them gameplayers the rest were mostly partners of the players or officials priests officers and bureaucrats who were sufficiently content with their present position and who had earned the security of tenure which meant they could not be displaced no matter how well their underlings might do in the games not to want to compete the mentors and administrators of the azad colleges the games teaching institutions formed the remainder of the gathering and were similarly exempt from the need to take part in the tournament the night was too warm for gurgehs taste a thick heat filled with the citysmell and stagnant the robe was heavy and surprisingly uncomfortable gurgeh wondered how soon he could politely leave the ball they entered the palace through a huge doorway flanked by massive opened gates of polished jewelstudded metal the vestibules and halls they passed through glittered with sumptuous decorations standing on tables or hanging from walls and ceilings the people were as fabulous as their surroundings the females of whom there seemed to be a great number were ablaze with jewellery and extravagantly ornamented dresses gurgeh guessed that measuring from the bottom of their bellshaped gowns the women must have been as broad as they were tall they rustled as they went by and smelled strongly of heavy obtrusive perfumes many of the people he passed glanced or looked or actually stopped and stared at gurgeh and the floating humming crackling flereimsaho every few metres along the walls and on both sides of every doorway gaudilyuniformed males stood stock still their trousered legs slightly apart gloved hands clasped behind their rodstraight backs their gaze fixed firmly on the high painted ceilings what are they standing there for gurgeh whispered to the drone in eächic low enough so that pequil couldnt hear show the machine said gurgeh thought about this show yes to show that the emperor is rich and important enough to have hundreds of flunkeys standing around doing nothing doesnt everybody know that already the drone didnt answer for a moment then it sighed you havent really cracked the psychology of wealth and power yet have you jernau gurgeh gurgeh walked on smiling on the side of his face flereimsaho couldnt see the apices they passed were all dressed in the same heavy robes gurgeh was wearing ornate without being ostentatious what struck gurgeh most strongly though was that the whole place and everybody in it seemed to be stuck in another age he could see nothing in the palace or worn by the people that could not have been produced at least a thousand years earlier he had watched recordings of ancient imperial ceremonies when hed done his own research into the society and thought he had a reasonable grasp of ancient dress and forms it struck him as strange that despite the empires obvious if limited technological sophistication its formal side remained so entrenched in the past ancient customs fashions and architectural forms were all common in the culture too but they were used freely even haphazardly as only parts of a whole range of styles not adhered to rigidly and consistently to the exclusion of all else just wait here youll be announced the drone said tugging at gurgehs sleeve so that he stopped beside the smiling lo pequil at a doorway leading down a huge flight of broad steps into the main ballroom pequil handed a card to a uniformed apex standing at the top of the steps whose amplified voice rang round the vast hall the honourable lo pequil monenine aab level two main empire medal order of merit and bar with chark gavantsha gernow morat gurgee dam hazeze they walked down the grand staircase the scene below them was an order of magnitude brighter and more impressive than any social event gurgeh had ever witnessed the culture simply didnt do things on such a scale the ballroom looked like a vast and glittering pool into which somebody had thrown a thousand fabulous flowers and then stirred that announcer murdered my name gurgeh said to the drone he glanced at pequil but why does our friend look so unhappy i think because the senior in his name was missed out flereimsaho said is that important gurgeh in this society everything is important the drone said then added glumly at least you both got announced hello there a voice shouted out as they got to the bottom of the stairs a tall malelooking person pushed between a couple of azadians to get beside gurgeh he wore garish flowing robes he had a beard bunned brown hair bright staring green eyes and he looked as though he might come from the culture he stuck one longfingered manyringed hand out took gurgehs hand and clasped it shohobohaum za pleased to meet you i used to know your name too until that delinquent at the top of the stairs got his tongue round it gurgeh isnt it oh pequil you here too eh he pushed a glass into pequils hands here you drink this muck dont you hi drone hey gurgeh he put his arm round gurgehs shoulders you want a proper drink yeah jernow morat gurgee pequil began looking awkward let me introduce but shohobohaum za was already steering gurgeh away through the crowds at the bottom of the staircase hows things anyway pequil he shouted over his shoulder at the dazedlooking apex okay yeah good talk to you later just taking this other exile for a little drink a palelooking pequil waved back weakly flereimsaho hesitated then stayed with the azadian shohobohaum za turned back to gurgeh removed his arm from the other mans shoulders and in a less strident voice said boring bladder old pequil hope you didnt mind being dragged away ill cope with the remorse gurgeh said looking the other culture man up and down i take it youre the ambassador the same za said and belched this way he nodded guiding gurgeh through the crowds i spotted some grif bottles behind one of the drink tables and i want to dock with a couple before the emp and his cronies snaffle the lot they passed a low stage where a band played loudly crazy place isnt it za shouted at gurgeh as they headed for the rear of the hall gurgeh wondered exactly what the other man was referring to here we is za said coming to a stop by a long line of tables behind the tables liveried males served drinks and food to the guests above them on a huge arched wall a dark tapestry sewn with diamonds and goldthread depicted an ancient space battle za gave a whistle and leant over to whisper to the tall sternlooking male who approached gurgeh saw a piece of paper being exchanged then za slapped his hand over gurgehs wrist and breezed away from the tables hauling gurgeh over to a large circular couch set round the bottom of a fluted pillar of marble inlaid with precious metals wait till you taste this stuff za said leaning towards gurgeh and winking shohobohaum za was a little lighter in colour than gurgeh but still much darker than the average azadian it was notoriously difficult to judge the age of culture people but gurgeh guessed the man was a decade or so younger than he you do drink za said looking suddenly alarmed ive been bypassing the stuff gurgeh told him za shook his head emphatically dont do that with grif he said patting gurgehs hand would be tragic ought to be a treasonable offence in fact gland crystal fugue state instead brilliant combination blows your neurons out your ass grif is stunning stuff comes from echronedal you know shipped over for the games only make it during the oxygen season stuff were getting should be two great years old costs a fortune opened more legs than a cosmetic laser anyway za sat back clasping his hands and looking seriously at gurgeh what do you think of the empire isnt it wonderful isnt it i mean vicious but sexy right he jumped forward as a male servant carrying a tray with a couple of small stoppered jugs came up to them ahha he took the tray with its jugs in exchange for another scrap of paper he unstoppered both jugs and handed one to gurgeh he raised his jug to his lips closed his eyes and breathed deeply he muttered something under his breath that sounded like a chant finally he drank keeping his eyes tightly closed when he opened his eyes gurgeh was sitting with one elbow on his knee his chin in his hand looking quizzically at him did they recruit you like this he asked or is it an effect the empire has za laughed throatily gazing up to the ceiling where a vast painting showed ancient seaships fighting some millenniaold engagement both za said still chuckling he nodded at gurgehs jug an amused but so it seemed to gurgeh more intelligent look on his face now a look which made gurgeh revise his estimation of the other mans age upward by several decades you going to drink that stuff za said i just spent an unskilled workers yearly wage getting it for you gurgeh looked into the other mans bright green eyes for a moment then raised the jug to his lips to the unskilled workers mr za he said and drank za laughed uproariously again head back i think were going to get along just fine gameplayer gurgeh the grif was sweet scented subtle and smoky za drained his own jug holding the thin spout over his opened mouth to savour the last few drops he looked at gurgeh and smacked his lips slips down like liquid silk he said he put the jug on the floor so youre going to play the great game eh jernau gurgeh thats what im here for gurgeh sipped a little more of the heady liquor let me give you some advice za said briefly touching his arm dont bet on anything and watch the women or men or both or whatever youre into you could get into some very nasty situations if you arent careful even if you mean to stay celibate you might find some of them women especially just cant wait to see whats between your legs and they take that sort of stuff ridiculously seriously you want any bodygames tell me ive got contacts i can set it up nice and discreet utter discretion and complete secrecy totally guaranteed ask anybody he laughed then touched gurgehs arm again and looked serious im serious he said i can fix you up ill bear that in mind gurgeh said drinking thanks for the warning my pleasure no problem ive been here eight nine years now envoy before me only lasted twenty days got chucked out for consorting with a ministers wife za shook his head and chuckled i mean i like her style but shit a minister crazy bitch was lucky she was only thrown out if shed been one of their own theyd have been up her orifices with acid leeches before the prison gate had shut makes me cross my legs just thinking about it before gurgeh could reply or za could continue there was a terrific crashing noise from the top of the great staircase like the sound of thousands of breaking bottles it echoed through the ballroom damn the emperor za said standing he nodded at gurgehs jug drink up man gurgeh stood up slowly he pushed the jug into zas hands you have it i think you appreciate it more za restoppered the jug and shoved it into a fold in his robe there was a lot of activity at the top of the stairs people in the ballroom were milling about too apparently forming a sort of human corridor which led from the bottom of the staircase to a large glittering seat set on a low dais covered with goldcloth better get you into your place za said he went to grab gurgehs wrist again but gurgeh raised his hand suddenly smoothing his beard za missed gurgeh nodded forward after you he said za winked and strode off they came up behind the group of people in front of the throne heres your boy pequil za announced to the worriedlooking apex then went to stand further away gurgeh found himself standing beside pequil with flereimsaho floating behind him at waist level humming assiduously mr gurgee we were starting to worry about you pequil whispered glancing nervously up at the staircase were you gurgeh said how comforting pequil didnt look very pleased gurgeh wondered if the apex had been addressed wrongly again i have good news gurgee pequil whispered he looked up at gurgeh who tried hard to look inquisitive i have succeeded in obtaining for you a personal introduction to their royal highness the emperorregent nicosar i am greatly honoured gurgeh smiled indeed indeed a most singular and exceptional honour pequil gulped so dont fuck up flereimsaho muttered from behind gurgeh looked at the machine the crashing noise sounded again and suddenly sweeping down the staircase quickly filling its breadth a great gaudy wave of people flowed down towards the floor gurgeh assumed the one in the lead carrying a long staff was the emperor or emperorregent as pequil had called him but at the bottom of the stairs that apex stood aside and shouted their imperial highness of the college of candsev prince of space defender of the faith duke of groasnachek master of the fires of echronedal the emperorregent nicosar the first the emperor was dressed all in black a mediumsized seriouslooking apex quite unornamented he was surrounded by fabulously dressed azadians of all sexes including comparatively conservatively uniformed male and apex guards toting big swords and small guns preceding the emperor was a variety of large animals four and sixlegged variously coloured collared and muzzled and held on the end of emerald and rubychained leads by fat almost naked males whose oiled skins glowed like frosted gold in the ballroom lights the emperor stopped and talked to some people who knelt when he approached further down the line on the far side then he crossed with his entourage to the side gurgeh was on the ballroom was almost totally silent gurgeh could hear the throaty breathing of several of the tamed carnivores pequil was sweating a pulse beat quickly in the hollow of his cheek nicosar came closer gurgeh thought the emperor looked if anything a little less impressively hard and determined than the average azadian he was slightly stooped and even when he was talking to somebody only a couple of metres away gurgeh could hear only the guests side of the conversation nicosar looked a little younger than gurgeh had expected despite having been advised about his personal introduction by pequil gurgeh nevertheless felt mildly surprised when the blackclothed apex stopped in front of him kneel flereimsaho hissed gurgeh knelt on one knee the silence seemed to deepen oh shit the humming machine muttered pequil moaned the emperor looked down at gurgeh then gave a small smile sir oneknee you must be our foreign guest we wish you a good game gurgeh realised what hed done wrong and went down on the other knee too but the emperor gave a small wave with one ringed hand and said no no we admire originality you shall greet us on one knee in future thank you your highness gurgeh said with a small bow the emperor nodded and turned to walk further up the line pequil gave a quivering sigh the emperor reached the throne on the dais and music started people suddenly started talking and the twin lines of people broke up everybody chattered and gesticulated at once pequil looked as though he was about to collapse he seemed to be speechless flereimsaho floated up to gurgeh please it said dont ever do something like that again gurgeh ignored the machine at least you could talk eh pequil said suddenly taking a glass from a tray with a shaking hand at least he could talk eh machine he was talking almost too fast for gurgeh to follow he sank the drink most people freeze i think i might have many people do what does one knee matter eh what does that matter pequil looked round for the male with the drinks tray then gazed at the throne where the emperor was sitting talking to some of his retinue what a majestic presence pequil said whys he emperorregent gurgeh asked the sweating apex their royal highness had to take up the royal chain after the emperor molsce sadly died two years ago as secondbest player during the last games our worship nicosar was elevated to the throne but i have no doubt they will remain there gurgeh whod read about molsce dying but hadnt realised nicosar wasnt regarded as a full emperor in his own right nodded and looking at the extravagantly accoutred people and beasts surrounding the imperial dais wondered what additional splendours nicosar could possibly merit if he did win the games id offer to dance with you but they dont approve of men dancing together shohobohaum za said coming up to where gurgeh stood by a pillar za took a plate of paperwrapped sweetmeats from a small table and held it out to gurgeh who shook his head za popped a couple of the little pastries into his mouth while gurgeh watched the elaborate patterned dances surge in eddies of flesh and coloured cloth across the ballroom floor flereimsaho floated near by there were some bits of paper sticking to its staticcharged casing dont worry gurgeh told za i shant feel insulted good enjoying yourself za leant against the pillar thought you looked a bit lonely standing here wheres pequil hes talking to some imperial officials trying to arrange a private audience ho hell be lucky snorted za what dyou think of our wonderful emperor anyway he seems very imperious gurgeh said and made a frowning gesture at the robes he was wearing and tapped one ear za looked amused then mystified then he laughed oh the microphone he shook his head unwrapped another couple of pastries and ate them dont worry about that just say what you want you wont be assassinated or anything they dont mind diplomatic protocol we pretend the robes arent bugged and they pretend they havent heard anything its a little game we play if you say so gurgeh said looking over at the imperial dais not much to look at at the moment young nicosar za said following gurgehs gaze he gets his full regalia after the game theoretically in mourning for molsce at the moment blacks their colour for mourning something to do with space i think he looked at the emperor for a while odd setup dont you think all that power belonging to one person seems a rather potentially unstable way to run a society gurgeh agreed hmm of course its all relative isnt it really you know that old guy the emps talking to at the moment probably has more real power than nicosar himself really gurgeh looked at za yes thats hamin rector of candsev college nicosars mentor you dont mean he tells the emperor what to do not officially but za belched nicosar was brought up in the college spent sixty years child and apex learning the game from hamin hamin raised him groomed him taught him all he knew about the game and everything else so when old molsce gets his one way ticket to the land of nod not before time and nicosar takes over whos the first person hes going to turn to for advice i see gurgeh nodded he was starting to regret not having studied more on azad the political system rather than just azad the game i thought the colleges just taught people how to play thats all they do in theory but in fact theyre more like surrogate noble families where the empire gains over the usual bloodline setup is they use the game to recruit the cleverest most ruthless and manipulative apices from the whole population to run the show rather than have to marry new blood into some stagnant aristocracy and hope for the best when the genes shake out actually quite a neat system the game solves a lot i can see it lasting contact seems to think its all going to fall apart at the seams one day but i doubt it myself this lot could outlast us they are impressive dont you think come on you have to admit youre impressed arent you unspeakably gurgeh said but id like to see more before i come to any final judgement youll end up impressed youll appreciate its savage beauty no im serious you will youll probably end up wanting to stay oh and dont pay any attention to that dingbat drone theyve sent to nursemaid you theyre all the same those machines want everything to be like the culture peace and love and all that same bland crap they havent got the za belched the sensuality to appreciate the he belched again empire believe me ignore the machine gurgeh was wondering what to say to that when a brightly dressed group of apices and females came up to surround him and shohobohaum za an apex stepped out of the smiling shining group and with a bow gurgeh thought looked exaggerated said to za would our esteemed envoy amuse our wives with his eyes id be delighted za said he handed the sweetmeat tray to gurgeh and while the women giggled and the apices smirked at each other he went close to the females and flicked the nictitating membranes in his eyes up and down there he laughed dancing back one of the apices thanked him then the group of people walked away talking and laughing theyre like big kids za told gurgeh then patted him on the shoulder and wandered off a vacant look in his eyes flereimsaho floated over making a noise like rustling paper i heard what that asshole said about ignoring machines it said hmm gurgeh said i said oh it doesnt matter not feeling left out because you cant dance are you no i dont enjoy dancing just as well it would be socially demeaning for anybody here even to touch you what a way with words you have machine gurgeh said he put the plate of savouries in front of the drone and then let go and walked off flereimsaho yelped and just managed to grab the falling prate before all the paperwrapped pastries fell off gurgeh wandered around for a while feeling a little angry and more than a little uncomfortable he was consumed with the idea that he was surrounded by people who were in some way failed as though they were all the unpassed components from some highquality system which would have been polluted by their inclusion not only did those around him strike him as foolish and boorish but he felt also that he was not much different himself everybody he met seemed to feel hed come here just to make a fool of himself contact sent him out here with a geriatric warship hardly worthy of the name gave him a vain hopelessly gauche young drone forgot to tell him things which they ought to have known would make a considerable difference to the way the game was played the college system which the limiting factor had glossed over was a good example and put him at least partly in the charge of a drunken loudmouthed fool childishly infatuated with a few imperialist tricks and a resourcefully inhumane social system during the journey here the whole adventure had seemed so romantic a great and brave commitment a noble thing to do that sense of the epic had left him now all he felt at this moment was that he like shohobohaum za or flereimsaho was just another social misfit and this whole spectacularly seedy empire had been thrown to him like a scrap somewhere he was sure minds were loafing in hyperspace within the fieldfabric of some great ship laughing he looked about the ballroom reedy music sounded the paired apices and luxuriously dressed females moved about the shining marquetry floor in preset arrangements their looks of pride and humility equally distasteful while the servant males moved carefully around like machines making sure each glass was kept full each plate covered he hardly thought it mattered what their social system was it simply looked so crassly rigidly overorganised ah gurgee pequil said he came through the space between a large potted plant and a marble pillar holding a younglooking female by one elbow there you are gurgee please meet trinev dutleysdaughter the apex smiled from the girl to the man and guided her forward she bowed slowly trinev is a gameplayer too pequil told gurgeh isnt that interesting im honoured to meet you young lady gurgeh said to the girl bowing a little too she stood still in front of him her gaze directed at the floor her dress was less ornate than most of those hed seen and the woman inside it looked less glamorous well ill leave you two oddonesout to talk shall i pequil said taking a step back hands clasped miss dutleysdaughters father is over by the rear bandstand gurgee if you wouldnt mind returning the young lady when youve finished talking gurgeh watched pequil go then smiled at the top of the young womans head he cleared his throat the girl remained silent gurgeh said i ah id thought that only intermediates apices played azad the girl looked up as far as his chest no sir there are some capable female players of minor rank of course she had a soft tiredsounding voice she still did not raise her face to him so he had to address the crown of her head where he could see the white scalp through the black tied hair ah he said i thought it might have been forbidden im glad it isnt do males play too they do sir nobody is forbidden to play that is embodied in the constitution it is simply made it is only that it is more difficult for either the woman broke off and brought her head up with a sudden startling look for either of the lesser sexes to learn because all the great colleges must take only apex scholars she looked back down again of course this is to prevent the distraction of those who study gurgeh wasnt sure what to say i see was all he could come up with at first do you hope to do well in the games if i can do well if i can reach the second game in the main series then i hope to be able to join the civil service and travel well i hope you succeed thank you unfortunately it is not very likely the first game as you know is played by groups of ten and to be the only woman playing nine apices is to be regarded as a nuisance one is usually put out of the game first to clear the field hmm i was warned something similar might happen to me gurgeh said smiling at the womans head and wishing she would look up at him again oh no the woman did look up then and gurgeh found the directness of her flatfaced gaze oddly disconcerting they wont do that to you it wouldnt be polite they dont know how weak or strong you are they she looked down again they know that i am so it is no disrespect to remove me from the board so that they may get on with the game gurgeh looked round the huge noisy crowded ballroom where the people talked and danced and the music sounded loud is there nothing you can do he asked wouldnt it be possible to arrange that ten women play each other in the first round she was still looking down but something about the curve of her cheek told him she might have been smiling indeed sir but i believe there has never been an occasion in the greatgame series when two lessersexes have played in the same group the draw has never worked out that way in all these years ah gurgeh said and single games oneagainstone they do not count unless one has gone through the earlier rounds when i do practise single games i am told that im very lucky i suppose i must be but then i know i am for my father has chosen me a fine master and husband and even if i do not succeed in the game i shall marry well what more can a woman ask for sir gurgeh didnt know what to say there was a strange tingling feeling at the back of his neck he cleared his throat a couple of times in the end all he could find to say was i hope you do win i really hope you do the woman looked briefly up at him then down again she shook her head after a while gurgeh suggested that he take her back to her father and she assented she said one more thing they were walking down the great hall threading their way through the clumps of people to where her father waited and at one point they passed between a great carved pillar and a wall of battlemurals during the instant they were quite hidden from the rest of the room the woman reached out one hand and touched him on the top of his wrist with the other hand she pressed a finger over a particular point on the shoulder of his robe and with that one finger pressing and the others lightly brushing his arm in the same moment whispered you win you win then they were with her father and after repeating how welcome he felt gurgeh left the family group the woman didnt look at him again he had had no time to reply to her are you all right jernau gurgeh flereimsaho said finding the man leaning against a wall and seemingly just staring into space as though he was one of the liveried male servants gurgeh looked at the drone he put his finger to the point on the robes shoulder the girl had pressed is this where the bug is on this thing yes the machine said thats right did shohobohaum za tell you that hmm thought so gurgeh said he pushed himself away from the wall would it be polite to leave now now the drone started back a little humming loudly well i suppose so are you sure youre all right never felt better lets go gurgeh walked away you seem agitated are you really alright arent you enjoying yourself what did za give you to drink are you nervous about the game has za said something is it because nobodyll touch you gurgeh walked through the people ignoring the humming crackling drone at his shoulder as they left the great ballroom he realised that apart from remembering that she was called somebodysdaughter he had forgotten the womans name gurgeh was due to play his first game of azad two days after the ball he spent the time working out a few setpiece manoeuvres with the limiting factor he could have used the modules brain but the old warship had a more interesting gamestyle the fact that the limiting factor was several decades away by real space light meant there was a significant delay involved the ship itself always replied instantly to a move but the effect was still of playing an extraordinarily quick and gifted player gurgeh didnt take up any more invitations to formal functions hed told pequil his digestive system was taking time to adjust to the empires rich food and that appeared to be an acceptable excuse he even refused the chance to go on a sightseeing trip of the capital he saw nobody during those days except flereimsaho which spent most of its time in its disguise sitting on the hotel parapet humming quietly and watching birds which it attracted with crumbs scattered on the roofgarden lawn now and again gurgeh would walk out on to the grassed roof and stand looking out over the city the streets and the sky were both full of traffic groasnachek was like a great flattened spiky animal awash with lights at night and hazy with its own heaped breath during the day it spoke with a great garbled choir of voices an encompassing background roar of engines and machines that never ceased and the sporadic tearing sounds of passing aircraft the continual wails whoops warbles and screams of sirens and alarms were strewn across the fabric of the city like shrapnel holes architecturally gurgeh thought the place was a hopeless mix of styles and far too big some buildings soared some sprawled but each seemed to have been designed without any regard to any other and the whole effect which might have been interestingly varied was in fact gruesome he kept thinking of the little rascal holding ten times as many people as the city in a smaller area and far more elegantly even though most of the crafts volume was taken up with shipbuilding space engines and other equipment groasnachek had all the planning of a birddropping gurgeh thought and the city was its own maze when the day came for the game to start he woke feeling elated as though hed just won a game rather than being about to embark on the first real serious match of his life he ate very little for breakfast and dressed slowly in the ceremonial garments the game required rather ridiculous gatheredup clothes with soft slippers and hose beneath a bulky jacket with rolled gartered sleeves at least as a novice gurgehs robes were relatively unornamented and restrained in colour pequil arrived to take him to the game in an official groundcar the apex chattered during the journey enthusing about some recent conquest the empire had made in a distant region of space a glorious victory the car sped along the broad streets heading for the outskirts of the city where the public hall gurgeh would play in had been converted into a gameroom all over the city that morning people were going to their first game of the new series from the most optimistic young player lucky enough to win a place in the games in a state lottery right up to nicosar himself those twelve thousand people faced that day knowing that their lives might change utterly and for ever for better or worse starting from right now the whole city was alive with the gamefever which infected it every six years groasnachek was packed with the players their retinues advisors college mentors relations and friends the empires press and newsservices and visiting delegations from colonies and oominions there to watch the future course of imperial history being decided despite his earlier euphoria gurgeh discovered that his hands were shaking by the time they arrived at the hall and as he was led into the place with its high white walls and its echoing wooden floor an unpleasant sensation of churning seemed to emanate from his belly it felt quite different from the normal feeling of being keyedup which he experienced before most games this was something else keener and more thrilling and unsettling than anything hed known before all that lightened this mood of tension was discovering that flereimsaho had been refused permission to remain in the gamehall when the match was in progress it would have to stay outside its display of clicking humming crackling crudity had not been sufficient to convince the imperial authorities that it was incapable of somehow assisting gurgeh during the game it was shown to a small pavilion in the grounds of the hall to wait there with the imperial guards on security duty it complained loudly gurgeh was introduced to the other nine people in his game in theory they had all been chosen at random they greeted him cordially enough though one of them a junior imperial priest nodded rather than spoke to him they played the lesser game of strategycards first gurgeh started very cautiously surrendering cards and points to discover what the others held when it finally became obvious he began playing properly hoping he would not be made to look too silly in the rush but over the next few turns he realised the others were still unsure exactly who held what and he was the only one playing the game as though it was in its final stages thinking that perhaps hed missed something he played a couple of more exploratory cards and only then did the priest start to play for the end gurgeh resumed and when the game finished before midday he held more points than anybody else so far so good eh drone he said to flereimsaho he was sitting at the table where the players gameofficials and some of the more important spectators were at lunch if you say so the machine said grumpily i dont get to see much stuck in the outhouse with the jolly soldier boys well take it from me its looking all right early days yet jernau gurgeh you wont catch them that easily again i knew i could rely on your support in the afternoon they played on a couple of the smaller boards in a series of single games to decide order of precedence gurgeh knew he was good at both these games and easily beat the others only the priest seemed upset by this there was another break for dinner during which pequil arrived unofficially on his way home from the office he expressed his pleased surprise at how well gurgeh was doing and even patted him on the arm before he left the earlyevening session was a formality all that happened was that they were told by the gameofficials amateurs from a local club with one imperial official in charge the exact configuration and order of play for the following day on the board of origin as had now become obvious gurgeh was going to start with a considerable advantage sitting in the back of the car with only flereimsaho for company and feeling quite pleased with himself gurgeh watched the city go by in the violet light of dusk not too bad i suppose the drone said humming only a little as it lay on the seat by gurgeh id contact the ship tonight if i were you to discuss what youre going to do tomorrow would you really yes youre going to need all the help you can get theyll gang up on you tomorrow bound to this is where you lose out of course if any of them were in this situation theyd be getting in touch with one or more of the less wellplaced players and doing a deal with them to go for yes but as you never seem to tire of telling me they would all demean themselves doing anything of the sort with me on the other hand though with your encouragement and the limiting factors help how can i lose the drone was silent gurgeh got in touch with the ship that night flereimsaho had declared itself bored it had discarded its casing gone blackbody and floated off unseen into the night to visit a city park where there were some nocturnal birds gurgeh talked over his plans with the limiting factor but the time delay of almost a minute made the conversation with the distant warship a slow business the ship had some good suggestions though gurgeh was certain that at this level at least he must be getting far better advice from the ship than any of his immediate opponents were receiving from their advisors aides and mentors probably only the top hundred or so players those directly sponsored and supported by the leading colleges would have access to such informed help this thought cheered him further and he went to bed happy three days later just as play was closing after the earlyevening session gurgeh looked at the board of origin and realised he was going to be put out of the game everything had gone well at first hed been pleased with his handling of the pieces and sure hed had a more subtle appreciation of the games strategic balance with his superiority in position and forces resulting from his successes during the early stages hed been confident he was going to win and so stay in the main series to play in the second round of single games then on the third morning he realised he had been overconfident and his concentration had lapsed what had looked like a series of unconnected moves by most of the other players suddenly became a coordinated mass attack with the priest at its head hed panicked and theyd trounced him now he was a dead man the priest came up to gurgeh when the sessions play was over and gurgeh was still sitting in his high stoolseat looking down at the shambles on the board and wondering what had gone wrong the apex asked the man if he was willing to concede it was the conventional course when somebody was so far behind in pieces and territory and there was less shame attached to an honourable admission of defeat than to a stubborn refusal to face reality which only dragged the game out longer for ones opponents gurgeh looked at the priest then at flereimsaho whod been allowed into the hall once the play had ended the machine wobbled a little in front of him humming mightily and fairly buzzing with static what do you think drone he said tiredly i think the sooner you get out of those ridiculous clothes the better the machine said the priest whose own robes were a more gaudy version of gurgehs glanced angrily at the humming machine but said nothing gurgeh looked at the board again then at the priest he took a long sighing breath and opened his mouth but before he could speak flereimsaho said so i think you should go back to the hotel and get changed and relax and give yourself an opportunity to think gurgeh nodded his head slowly rubbing his beard and looking at the mess of tangled fortunes on the board of origin he told the priest hed see him tomorrow theres nothing i can do theyve won he told the drone once they were back in the module if you say so why not ask the ship gurgeh contacted the limiting factor to give it the bad news it commiserated and rather than come up with any helpful ideas told him exactly where hed gone wrong going into considerable detail gurgeh thanked it with little good grace and went to bed dispirited wishing hed resigned when the priest had asked him flereimsaho had gone off exploring the city again gurgeh lay in the darkness the module quiet around him he wondered what theyd really sent him here for what did contact actually expect him to do had he been sent to be humiliated and so reassure the empire the culture was unlikely to be any threat to it it seemed as likely as anything else he could imagine chiark hub rattling off figures about the colossal amount of energy expended in sending him all this way and even the culture even contact would think twice about doing all it had just to provide one citizen with a glorified adventure holiday the culture didnt use money as such but it also didnt want to be too conspicuously extravagant with matter and energy either so inelegant to be wasteful but to keep the empire satisfied that the culture was just a joke no threat how much was that worth he turned over in the bed switched on the floatfield adjusted its resistance tried to sleep turned this way and that adjusted the field again but still could not get comfortable and so eventually turned it off he saw the slight glow from the bracelet chamlis had given him shining by the bedside he picked the thin band up turning it over in his hands the tiny orbital was bright in the darkness lighting up his fingers and the covers on the bed he gazed at its daylight surface and the microscopic whorls of weather systems over blue sea and duncoloured land he really ought to write to chamlis say thank you it was only then he realised quite how clever the little piece of jewellery was hed assumed it was just an illuminated still picture but it wasnt he could remember how it had looked when hed first seen it and now the scene was different the island continents on the daylight side were mostly different shapes to those he remembered though he recognised a couple of them near the dawn terminator the bracelet was a moving representation of an orbital possibly even a crude clock he smiled in the darkness turned away they all expected him to lose only he knew or had known he was a better player than they thought but now hed thrown away the chance of proving he was right and they were wrong fool fool he whispered to himself in the darkness he couldnt sleep he got up switched on the modulescreen and told the machine to display his game the board of origin appeared thruholoed in front of him he sat there and stared at it then he told the module to contact the ship it was a slow dreamlike conversation during which he gazed as though transfixed at the bright gameboard seemingly stretching away from him while waiting for his words to reach the distant warship and then for its reply to come back jernau gurgeh i want to know something ship is there any way out of this stupid question he could see the answer his position was an inchoate mess the only certain thing about it was that it was hopeless out of your present situation in the game he sighed what a waste of time yes can you see a way the frozen holo on the screen in front of him his displayed position was like some trapped moment of falling the instant when the foot slips the fingers lose their last strength and the fatal accelerating descent begins he thought of satellites forever falling and the controlled stumble that bipeds call walking you are more points behind than anybody who has ever come back to win in any main series game you have already been defeated they believe gurgeh waited for more silence answer the question he told the ship you didnt answer the question answer me what was the ship playing at mess mess a total mess his position was a swirling amorphous nebulous almost barbaric welter of pieces and areas battered and crumbling and falling away why was he even bothering to ask didnt he trust his own judgement did he need a mind to tell him would only that make it real yes of course there is a way the ship said many ways in fact though they are all unlikely near impossible but it can be done there isnt nearly enough time to goodnight ship he said as the signal continued explain any of them in detail but i think i can give you a general idea what to do though of course just because it has to be such a synoptic appraisal such a sorry ship goodnight gurgeh turned the channel off it clicked once after a little while the closing chime announced the ship had signed off too gurgeh looked at the holo image of the board again then closed his eyes by morning he still had no idea what he was going to do he hadnt slept at all that night just sat in front of the screen staring at its displayed panorama of the game until the view was seemingly etched into his brain and his eyes hurt with the strain later hed eaten lightly and watched some of the broadcast entertainments the empire fed the population with it was a suitably mindless diversion pequil arrived smiling and said how well gurgeh had done to stay in contention at all and how personally pequil was sure that gurgeh would do well in the secondseries games for those knocked out of the main series if he wished to take part of course they were mostly of interest to those seeking promotion in their careers and led no further but gurgeh might do better against other ah unfortunates anyway he was still going to echronedal to see the end of the games and that was a great privilege wasnt it gurgeh hardly spoke just nodded now and again they rode out to the hall while pequil went on and on about the great victory nicosar had achieved in his first game the previous day the emperorregent was already on to the second board the board of form the priest again asked gurgeh to resign and again gurgeh said he wished to play they all sat down around the great spread of board and either dictated their moves to the club players or made them themselves gurgeh sat for a long time before placing his first piece that morning he rubbed the biotech between his hands for minutes looking down wideeyed at the board for so long the others thought hed forgotten it was his turn and asked the adjudicator to remind him gurgeh placed the piece it was as though he saw two boards one here in front of him and one engraved into his mind from the night before the other players made their moves gradually forcing gurgeh back into one small area of the board with only a couple of free pieces outside it hunted and fleeing when it came as hed known it would without wanting to admit to himself that he did know the he could only think of it as a revelation made him want to laugh in fact he did rock back in his seat head nodding the priest looked at him expectantly as though waiting for the stupid human to finally give up but gurgeh smiled over at the apex selected the strongest cards from his dwindling supply deposited them with the adjudicator and made his next move all he was banking on it turned out was the rest being too concerned with winning the game quickly it was obvious that some sort of deal had been arranged which would let the priest win and gurgeh guessed that the others wouldnt be playing at their best when they were competing for somebody else it would not be their victory they would not own it certainly they didnt have to play well sheer weight of numbers could compensate for indifferent play but the moves could become a language and gurgeh thought he could speak that language now well enough tellingly to lie in it so he made his moves and at one moment with one move seemed to be suggesting that he had given up then with his next move he appeared to indicate he was determined to take one of several players down with him or two of them or a different one the lies went on there was no single message but rather a succession of contradictory signals pulling the syntax of the game to and fro and to and fro until the common understanding the other players had reached began to fatigue and tear and split in the midst of this gurgeh made some at first sight inconsequential purposeless moves which seemingly suddenly apparently without any warning threatened first a few then several then most of the trooppieces of one player but at the cost of making gurgehs own forces more vulnerable while that player panicked the priest did what gurgeh was relying on him doing rushing into the attack over the next few moves gurgeh asked for the cards hed deposited with the game official to be revealed they acted rather like mines in a possession game the priests forces were variously destroyed demoralised randommove blinded hopelessly weakened or turned over to gurgeh or in only a few cases to some of the other players the priest was left with almost nothing forces scattering over the board like dead leaves in the confusion gurgeh watched the others devoid of their leader squabble over the scraps of power one got into serious trouble gurgeh attacked annihilated most of his forces and captured the rest and then kept on attacking without even waiting to regroup he realised later hed still been behind in points at that time but the sheer momentum of his own resurrection from oblivion carried him on spreading an unreasoning hysterical almost superstitiously intense panic amongst the others from that point on he made no more errors his progress across the board became a combination of rout and triumphal procession perfectly adequate players were made to look like idiots as gurgehs forces rampaged across their territories consuming ground and material as though nothing could be easier or more natural gurgeh finished the game on the board of origin before the evening session hed saved himself he wasnt just through to the next board he was in the lead the priest whod sat looking at the gamesurface with an expression gurgeh thought hed have recognised as stunned even without his lessons in azadian facial language walked out of the hall without the customary endofgame pleasantries while the other players either said very little or were embarrassingly effusive about his performance a crowd of people clustered round gurgeh the club members some press people and other players some observing guests gurgeh felt oddly untouched by the surrounding chattering apices crowding up to him but still trying not to touch him somehow their very numbers lent an air of unreality to the scene gurgeh was buried in questions but he couldnt answer any of them he could hardly make them out as individual inquiries anyway the apices all talked too fast flereimsaho floated in above the heads of the crowd but despite trying to shout people down to gain their attention all it succeeded in attracting was their hair with its static gurgeh saw one apex try to push the machine out of his way and receive an obviously unexpected and painful electric shock pequil shoved his way through the crowd and bustled up to gurgeh but instead of coming to rescue the man he told him hed brought another twenty reporters with him he touched gurgeh without seeming to think about it turning him to face some cameras more questions followed but gurgeh ignored them he had to ask pequil several times if he could leave before the apex had a path cleared to the door and the waiting car mr gurgee let me add my congratulations pequil said in the car i heard while i was in the office and came straight away a famous victory thank you gurgeh said slowly calming himself he sat in the cars plushly upholstered seat looking out at the sunlit city the car was airconditioned unlike the gamehall but it was only now gurgeh found himself sweating he shivered me too flereimsaho said you raised your game just in time thank you drone you were lucky as hell too mind you i trust youll let me arrange a proper pressconference mr gurgee pequil said eagerly im sure youre going to be quite famous after this no matter what happens during the rest of the match heavens youll be sharing leaders with the emperor himself tonight no thanks gurgeh said dont arrange anything he couldnt think that hed have anything useful to tell people what was there to say hed won the game hed every chance of taking the match itself he was anyway a little uncomfortable at the thought of his image and voice being broadcast all over the empire and his story undoubtedly sensationalised being told and retold and distorted by these people oh but you must pequil protested everybody will want to see you you dont seem to realise what youve done even if you lose the match youve established a new record nobody has ever come back from being so far behind it was quite brilliant all the same gurgeh said suddenly feeling very tired i dont want to be distracted i have to concentrate i have to rest well pequil said looking crestfallen i see your point but i warn you youre making a mistake people will want to hear what youve got to say and our press always gives the people what they want no matter what the difficulties theyll just make it up youd be better off saying something yourself gurgeh shook his head looked out at the traffic on the boulevard if people want to lie about me thats a matter for their consciences at least i dont have to talk to them i really could not care less what they say pequil looked at gurgeh with an expression of astonishment but said nothing flereimsaho made a chuckling noise over its constant hum gurgeh talked it over with the ship the limiting factor said that the game could probably have been won more elegantly but what gurgeh had done did represent one end of the spectrum of unlikely possibilities it had been going to sketch out the previous night it congratulated him he had played better than it had thought possible it also asked him why he hadnt listened after it had told him it could see a way out all i wanted to know was that there was a way out again the delay the weight of time while his beamed words lanced beneath the matterdimpled surface that was real space but i could have helped you said the ship i thought it was a bad sign when you refused my aid i began to think you had given up in your mind if not on the board i didnt want help ship he played with the orbital bracelet wondering absently if it portrayed any particular world and if so which i wanted hope i see the ship said eventually i wouldnt accept it the drone said you wouldnt accept what gurgeh asked looking up from a holodisplayed board zas invitation the tiny machine floated closer it had discarded its bulky disguise now they were back inside the module gurgeh looked coldly at it i didnt notice it was addressed to you too shohobohaum za had sent a message congratulating gurgeh and inviting him out for an evenings entertainment well it wasnt but im supposed to monitor everything are you really gurgeh turned back to the holospread before him well you can stay here and monitor whatever you like while i go out on the town with shohobohaum za tonight youll regret it the drone told him youve been very sensible staying in and not getting involved but youll suffer for it if you do start gallivanting gallivanting gurgeh stared at the drone realising only then how difficult it was to look something up and down when it was just a few centimetres high what are you drone my mother im just trying to be sensible about this the machine said voice rising youre in a strange society youre not the most worldlywise of people and za certainly isnt my idea of you opinionated box of junk gurgeh said loudly rising and switching off the holoscreen the drone jumped in midair it backed off hastily now now jernau gurgeh dont you now now me you patronising adding machine if i want to take an evening off i will and quite frankly the thought of some human company for a change is looking more attractive all the time he jabbed a finger at the machine dont read any more of my mail and dont bother about escorting za and me this evening he walked quickly past it heading for his cabin now im going to take a shower why dont you go watch some birds the man left the modules lounge the little drone hovered steadily in midair for a while oops it said to itself eventually then with a shruglike wobble swooped away fields vaguely rosy have some of this za said the car swept along the city streets beneath the erubescent skies of dusk gurgeh took the flask and drank not quite grif za told him but it does the job he took the flask back while gurgeh coughed a little did you let that grif get to you at the ball no gurgeh admitted i bypassed it wanted a clear head aw heck za said looking downcast you mean i could have had more he shrugged brightened tapped gurgeh on the elbow hey i never said congratulations on winning the game thanks that showed them wow did you give them a shock za shook his head in admiration his long brown hair swung across his loose tunic top like heavy smoke i had you filed as a primetime loser jg but youre some kind of showman he winked one bright green eye at gurgeh and grinned gurgeh looked uncertainly at zas beaming face for a moment then burst out laughing he took the flask from zas hand and put it to his lips to the showmen he said and drank amen to that my maestro the hole had been on the outskirts of the city once but now it was just another part of one more urban district the hole was a set of vast artificial caverns burrowed out of the chalk centuries ago to store natural gas in the gas had long since run out the city ran on other forms of energy and the set of huge linked caves had been colonised first by groasnacheks poor then by a slow process of osmosis and displacement as though gas or human nothing ever really changed by its criminals and outlaws and finally though not completely by its effectively ghettoised aliens and their supporting cast of locals gurgeh and zas car drove into what had once been a massive aboveground gasstorage cylinder it had become the housing for a pair of spiralling ramps taking cars and other vehicles down into and up out of the hole in the centre of the still mostly empty ringingly echoing cylinder a cluster of variously sized lifts slid up and down inside ramshackle frameworks of girders tubing and beams the outer and inner surfaces of the ancient gasometer sparkled slatily under rainbow lights and the flickeringly unreal grotesquely oversize images of advertising holos people milled about the surface level of the cavernous tower and the air was full of shouting screaming haggling voices and the sound of labouring engines gurgeh watched the crowds and the stalls and stands slide by as the car dipped and started its long descent a strange halfsweet halfacrid smell seeped through the cars conditioning like a sweaty breath from the place they quit the car in a long low crowded tunnel where the air was heavy with fumes and shouts the gallery was choked with multifariously shaped and sized vehicles which rumbled and hissed and edged about amongst the swarmingly varied people like massive clumsy animals wading in an insect sea za took gurgeh by the hand as their car trundled towards the ascending ramp they went bustling through the buffeting crowds of azadians and other humanoids towards a dimilyglowing tunnel mouth what dyou think so far za shouted back to gurgeh crowded isnt it you should see it on a holiday gurgeh looked round at the people he felt ghostlike invisible until now hed been the centre of attention a freak stared and gawped and peered at and kept entirely at arms length now suddenly nobody gave a damn hardly sparing him a second glance they bumped into him jostled him shoved past him brushed against him all quite careless and so varied even in this sickly seagreen tunnel light so many different types of people mixed in with the azadians he was becoming used to seeing a few aliens that looked vaguely familiar from his memory of panhuman types but mostly quite wildly different he lost count of the variations in limbs height bulk physiognomy and sensory apparatus he was confronted with during that short walk they went down the warm tunnel and into a huge brightly lit cavern at least eighty metres tall and half as broad again lengthwise its creamcoloured walls stretched away in both directions for half a kilometre or more ending in great sidelit arches leading to further galleries its flat floor was chockablock with shacklike buildings and tents partitions and covered walkways stalls and kiosks and small squares with dribbling fountains and gaily striped awnings lamps danced from wires strung on thin poles and overhead brighter lights burned high in the vaulted roof a colour between ivory and pewter structures of stepped buildings and wall or roofhung gantries lined the sides of the gallery and whole areas of grimy grey wall were punctured by the irregular holes of windows balconies terraces and doors lifts and pulleys creaked and rattled taking people to higher levels or lowering them to the bustling floor this way za said they wove their way through the narrow streets of the gallery surface until they came to the far wall climbed some broad but rickety wooden steps and approached a heavy wooden door guarded by a metal portcullis and a pair of lumberingly large figures one azadian male and another whose species gurgeh couldnt identify za waved and without either guard appearing to do anything the portcullis rose the door swung ponderously open and he and za left the echoing cave behind for the relative quietness of a dim woodlined heavily carpeted tunnel the cavern light closed off behind them a hazy cerise glow came through an arched ceiling of waferthin plaster the polished wooden walls looked thick were chardark and felt warm muffled music came from ahead another door a desk set into an alcove where two apices eyed them both sullenly then consented to smile at za who passed over a small hide pouch to them the door opened he and gurgeh went through to the light and music and noise beyond it was a jumble of a space impossible to decide whether it was one confusingly subdivided chaotically splitlevelled hall or a profusion of smaller rooms and galleries all knocked into one the place was packed and loud with highpitched atonal music it could have been on fire judging from the thick haze of smoke filling it but the fumes smelled sweet almost perfumed za guided gurgeh through crowds to a wooden cupola raised a metre off a small covered walkway and looking out from the rear on to a sort of staggered stage beneath the stage was surrounded by similar circular boxes as well as various stepped areas of seats and benches all of which were crowded mostly with azadians on the small roughly circular stage below some dwarfish alien only vaguely panhuman was wrestling or perhaps copulating with an azadian female in a quivering tub full of gently steaming red mud all seemingly held in a lowg field the spectators shouted and clapped and threw drinks oh good za said sitting down the funs started are they fucking or fighting gurgeh said leaning over the rail and peering down at the struggling heaving bodies of the alien and the female za shrugged does it matter a waitress an azadian female wearing only a little cloth around her waist took zas drink order the womans puffballed hair appeared to be on fire surrounded by a flickering hologram of yellowblue flames gurgeh turned away from the stage the audience behind him yelled appreciatively as the woman threw the alien off and jumped on top of him throwing him under the steaming mud you come here often he asked za the tall male laughed loudly no the great green eyes flashed but i leave quite a lot this where you relax za shook his head emphatically absolutely not common misconception that that fun is relaxing if it is youre not doing it right thats what the holes for fun fun and games cools down a bit during the day but it can get pretty wild too the drink festivals are usually the worst shouldnt be any trouble tonight though fairly quiet the crowd shrieked the woman was holding the dwarfish aliens face under the mud it struggled desperately gurgeh turned round to watch the aliens movements weakened slowly as the naked mudslicked woman forced its head into the bubbling red liquid gurgeh glanced at za so they were fighting za shrugged again we may never know he looked down too as the woman forced the now limp aliens body further into the ochre mud has she killed it gurgeh asked he had to raise his voice as the crowd screamed stamping feet and beating fists on tables na shohobohaum za said shaking his head the little guys a uhnyrchal za nodded down as the woman used one hand to keep the aliens head submerged and raised the other in triumph in the air glaring brighteyed at the baying audience see that little black thing sticking up gurgeh looked there was a little black bulb poking up through the surface of the red mud yes thats his dick gurgeh looked suspiciously at the other man how exactly is that going to help him the uhnyrchal can breathe through their dicks za said that guys fine hell be fighting in another club tomorrow night maybe even later this evening za watched the waitress place their drinks on the table he leant forward to whisper something to her she nodded and walked off try glanding expand with this stuff za suggested gurgeh nodded they both drank wonder why the cultures never genofixed that za said staring into his glass what being able to breathe through your dick gurgeh thought sneezing at certain moments could be messy za laughed there might be compensations the audience behind them went oooo za and gurgeh turned round to see the victorious woman pulling her opponents body up out of the mud by its penis the alien beings head and feet were still under the glutinous slowly slopping liquid ouch za muttered drinking somebody in the crowd tossed the woman a dagger she caught it stooped and sliced off the alien genitals she brandished the dripping flesh aloft while the crowd went wild with delight and the alien sank slowly beneath the cloying red liquid the womans foot on its chest the mud gradually turned black where the blood oozed and a few bubbles surfaced za sat back looking mystified must have been some subspecies i havent heard of the lowg mudtub was trundled away the woman still shaking her trophy at the baying crowd shohobohaum za rose to greet a party of four dramatically beautiful and stunningly dressed azadian females who were approaching the cupola gurgeh had glanded the bodydrug za had suggested and was just beginning to feel the effects of both that and the liquor the women looked he thought quite the equals of any hed seen the night of the welcoming ball and much more friendly the acts went on sex acts mostly acts which outside the hole gurgeh was told by za and two of the azadian females inclate and atsen sitting on either side of him would mean death for both participants death by radiation or death by chemicals gurgeh didnt pay too much attention this was his night out and the staged obscenities were the least important part of it he was away from the game that was what mattered living by another set of rules he knew why za had had the women come to the table and it amused him he felt no particular desire for the two exquisite creatures he sat between certainly nothing uncontrollable but they made good company za was no fool and the two charming females gurgeh knew they would have been males or even apices had za discovered gurgehs preferences lay in that direction were both intelligent and witty they knew a little about the culture had heard rumours about the sexual alterations culture people possessed and made discreetly roguish jokes about gurgehs proclivities and abilities compared to their own and to both the other azadian genders they were flattering enticing and friendly they drank from small glasses they sipped smoke from tiny slender pipes gurgeh had tried a pipe too but only coughed much to everyones amusement and they both had long sinuously curling blueblack hair silkily membraned with nearinvisibly fine platinum nets and beaded with minute glinting ag studs which made their hair move in slow motion and gave each graceful movement of their delicately structured heads a dizzyingly unreal quality inclates slim dress was the evershifting colour of oil on water speckled with jewels which twinkled like stars atsens was a videodress glowing fuzzy red with its own concealed power a choker round her neck acted as a small television monitor displaying a hazy distorted image of the view around her gurgeh to one side the stage behind one of zas ladies on the other side the other directly across the table gurgeh showed her the orbital bracelet but she was not especially impressed za on the other side of the table was playing small games of forfeit with his two giggling ladies handling tiny almost transparent slice jewelcards and laughing a lot one of the ladies noted the forfeits down in a little notebook with much giggling and feigned embarrassment but jernow atsen said from gurgehs left you must have a scarportrait so that we may remember you when you have gone back to the culture and its decadent manyorificed ladies inclate on his right giggled certainly not gurgeh said mockserious it sounds quite barbaric oh yes yes it is atsen and inclate laughed into their glasses atsen pulled herself together put her hand on his wrist wouldnt you like to think there was some poor person walking around on eä with your face on their skin yes but on which bit gurgeh asked they thought this hilariously funny za stood one of his ladies packed the tiny slivers of the gamecards away in a little chain purse gurgeh za said knocking back the last of his drink were off for a more private chat you three too za grinned wickedly at inclate and atsen producing gales of laughter and small shrieks atsen dipped her fingers in her drink and flicked some liquor at za who dodged yes come jernow inclate said taking hold of gurgehs arm with both hands lets all go the air is so stuffy here and the noise so loud gurgeh smiled shook his head no id only disappoint you oh no no slim fingers tugged at his sleeves curled round his arms the politely mocking argument went on for some minutes while za stood grinning ladies draped on either side looking on and inclate and atsen tried their hardest either to physically lift gurgeh to his feet or by pouting protestations persuade him to move all failed za shrugged his ladies imitated the alien gesture before dissolving into laughter and said okay just stay there all right gameplayer za looked at inclate and atsen who were temporarily subdued and petulant you two look after him right za told them dont let him talk to any strangers atsen sniffed imperiously your friend declines all strange or familiar inclate snorted despite herself or both in one she blurted whereupon she and atsen started laughing again and reaching behind gurgeh to slap and pinch each others shoulders za shook his head jemau try and control those two as well as you control yourself gurgeh ducked a few flicked drops of drink while the females squealed on either side of him ill try he told za well za said ill try not to be too long sure you wont join in could be quite an experience im sure but im fine here okay dont wander see you soon za grinned at the giggling girls on either side of him and then they turned together walked away ish za shouted back over his shoulder soonish gameplayer gurgeh waved goodbye inclate and atsen quietened fractionally and set about telling him what a naughty boy he was for not being more naughty gurgeh ordered more drinks and pipes to keep them quiet they showed him how to play the game of elements chanting blade cuts cloth cloth wraps stone stone dams water water quenches fire fire melts blade like serious schoolgirls and showing him the appropriate handshapes so that he could learn it was a truncated twodimensional version of the elemental diematching from the board of becoming minus air and life gurgeh found it amusing that even in the hole he could not escape the influence of azad he played the simple game because the ladies wanted to and he took care not to win too many hands something he realised he had never done before in his life still puzzling over this anomaly he went to the toilets of which there were four different types he used the aliens but took some time to find the right piece of equipment he was still chortling over this when he came out to find inclate standing outside the sphincterlike doorway she looked worried the oilfilm dress rippled dully whats wrong he asked her atsen she said kneading her little hands together her exmaster came took her away he wants to have her again or it will be a tenthyear since they are one and she will be free she looked up at gurgeh small face contorted distressed the blueblack hair washed round her face like a slow and fluid shadow i know shoza said you must not move but will you this is not your concern but shes my friend what can i do gurgeh said come we two may distract him i think i know where hes taken her i shall not endanger you jernow she took his hand they half walked half ran down twisting wooden corridors past many rooms and doors he was lost in a maze of sensation a welter of sounds music laughter screams sights servants erotic pictures glimpsed galleries of packed swaying bodies and smells food perfume alien sweats suddenly inclate stopped they were in a deep bowled room like a theatre where a naked human male stood on stage turning slowly this way and that in front of a giant screen showing a closeup of his skin deep booming music played inclate stood looking round the packed auditorium still holding gurgehs hand gurgeh glanced at the man on stage the lights were bright sunlight spectraed the slightly plump paleskinned male had several enormous multicoloured bruises like huge prints on his body those on his back and chest were largest and showed azadian faces the mixture of blacks blues purples greens yellows and reds combined to form portraits of uncanny accuracy and subtlety which the flexings of the mans muscles seemed to make live exactly as though those faces took on new expressions with each moment gurgeh looked and felt his breath draw in there inclate shouted over the pulsing music and tugged at his hand they set off through the crowding people towards where atsen stood near the front of the stage she was being held by an apex who was pointing at the man on the stage and shouting at her shaking her atsens head was down her shoulders quivered as if she was crying the videodress was turned off it hung on her grey and drab and lifeless the apex hit atsen across the head the slow black hair twisted languidly and shouted at her again she fell to her knees the beaded hair followed her as if she was sinking slowly under water nobody around the couple took any notice inclate strode towards them pulling gurgeh after her the apex saw them coming tried to drag atsen away inclate started to shout at the apex she held up gurgehs hand as they pushed people aside drew closer the apex looked suddenly fearful he stumbled away dragging atsen with him to an exit beneath the raised stage inclate started forward but her way was blocked by a cluster of large azadian males standing staring openmouthed at the man on the stage inclate beat at their backs with her fists gurgeh watched atsen disappear dragged through the door beneath the stage he pulled inclate to one side and used his greater mass and strength to force a way between two of the protesting males he and the girl ran to the swinging door the corridor curved sharply they followed the sounds of screams down some narrow stairs over a step where the broken monitorcollar lay snapped and dead down to a quiet corridor where the light was jade and there were many doors atsen was lying on the floor the apex above her screaming at her he saw gurgeh and inclate shook his fist at them inclate screamed incoherently at him gurgeh started forward the apex took a gun from a pocket gurgeh stopped inclate went quiet atsen whimpered on the floor the apex started talking far too fast for gurgeh to follow he pointed at the woman on the floor then gestured at the ceiling he began to cry and the gun shook in his hand and part of gurgeh sitting back calmly analysing thought am i frightened is this fear yet im looking death in the face staring at it through that little black hole the little twisted tunnel in this aliens hand like another element the hand can show and im waiting to feel fear and it hasnt happened yet im still waiting does this mean that i shant die now or that i shall life or death in a fingers twitch a single nervepulse just one perhaps not fully willed decision by some jealous irrelevant onecredit sickhead a hundred millennia from home the apex backed away gesturing imploringly pathetically to atsen and at gurgeh and inclate he came forward and kicked atsen once in the back with no great force making her cry out then turned and ran shouting incoherently and throwing the gun down to the floor gurgeh ran after him vaulting over atsen the apex disappeared down a dark spiral staircase at the far end of the curved passage gurgeh started to follow then stopped the sound of clattering footsteps died away he went back to the jadelit corridor a door was open soft citrine light spilled out there was a short hall a bathroom off then the room it was small and mirrored everywhere even the soft floor rippled with unsteady reflections the colour of honey he walked in at the centre of a vanishing army of reflected gurgehs atsen sat on a translucent bed forlorn in her wrecked grey dress head down and sobbing while inclate kneeling by her arm round the crying womans shoulders whispered gently their images proliferated about the shining walls of the room he hesitated glanced back at the door atsen looked up at him tears streaming oh jernow she held out one shaking hand he squatted by the bedside his arm round her as she quivered while both women cried he stroked atsens back she put her head on his shoulder and her lips were warm and strange on his neck inclate left the bed padded to the door and closed it then joined the man and the woman dropping the oilfilm dress to the mirrorfloor in a glistening pool of iridescence shohobohaum za arrived a minute later kicking the door in walking smartly into the middle of the mirrored room so that an infinitude of zas repeated and repeated their way across that cheating space and glared round ignoring the three people on the bed inclate and atsen froze hands at gurgehs clothingties and buttons gurgeh was momentarily shocked then tried to assume an urbane expression za looked at the wall behind gurgeh who followed his gaze he found himself looking at his own reflection face dark hair mussed clothes half undone za leapt across the bed kicking into the image the wall shattered in a chorus of screams the mirrorglass cascaded to reveal a dark and shallow room behind and a small machine on a tripod pointing into the mirrorroom inclate and atsen sprang off the bed and raced out inclate grabbed her dress on the way za took the tiny camera off its tripod and looked at it record only thank goodness no transmitter he stuffed the machine into a pocket then turned and grinned at gurgeh put it back in the holster gameplayer we got to run they ran down the jade passage towards the same spiral steps atsens abductor had taken za stooped as he ran scooping up the gun the apex had dropped and gurgeh had forgotten about it was inspected tried and discarded within a couple of seconds they got to the spiral steps and leapt up them another corridor darkly russet music boomed above za skidded to a stop as two large apices ran towards them oops za said doing an aboutturn he shoved gurgeh back to the stairs and they ran up again coming out in a dark space full of the beating pulsing music light blazed to one side footsteps hammered up the stairs za turned and kicked down into the stairwell with one foot producing an explosive yelp and a sudden clatter a thin blue beam freckled the darkness lancing from the stairwell and bursting yellow flame and orange sparks somewhere overhead za dodged away fucking artillery indeed he nodded past gurgeh towards the light exit stage centre maestro they ran out on to the stage flooded with sunlight brilliance a bulky male in the centre of the stage turned resentfully as they thundered out from the wings the audience yelled abuse then the expression on the nearnaked bruise artistes face switched from vexation to stunned surprise gurgeh almost fell he did stop dead still to gaze again at his own face it was printed twice lifesize in a bloody rainbow of contusions on the torso of the dumbstruck performer gurgeh stared expression mirroring the amazement on the tubby artistes face no time for art now jernau za pulled him away dragged him to the front of the stage and threw him off he dived after him they landed on top of a group of protesting azadian males tumbling them to the ground za hauled gurgeh to his feet then nearly fell again as a blow struck the back of his head he turned and lashed out with one foot fending off another punch with one arm gurgeh felt himself twirled round he found himself facing a large angry male with blood on his face the man drew his arm back made a fist of his hand so that gurgeh thought stone from the game of elements the man seemed to move very slowly gurgeh had time to think what to do he brought his knee up into the males groin and heelpalmed his face he shook the falling mans grip free ducked a blow from another male and saw za elbow yet another azadian in the face then they were sprinting away again za roared and waved his hands as he ran for an exit gurgeh fought a strange urge to laugh at this but the tactic seemed to work people parted for them like water round the bows of a boat they sat in a small openceilinged bar deep in the mazelike clutter of the main gallery under a solid sky of chalky pearl shohobohaum za was dismantling the camera hed discovered behind the false mirror teasing its delicate components apart with a humming toothpicksize instrument gurgeh dabbed at a graze on his cheek incurred when za had thrown him from the stage na my fault gameplayer i should have known inclates brothers in security and atsens got an expensive habit nice kids but a bad combination and not exactly what i asked for damn lucky for your ass one of my sweeties dropped a slicejewelcard and wouldnt play anything else without it ah well half a fucks better than none at all he prised another piece out of the camera body there was a crackle and a little flash za poked dubiously at the smoking casing how did you know where to find us gurgeh asked he felt like a fool but less embarrassed than hed have expected knowledge guesswork and luck gameplayer there are places in that club you go when you want to roll somebody other places where you can question them or kill them or hook them on something or take their picture i was just hoping it was lightsaction time and not something worse he shook his head peered at the camera i should have known though ought to have guessed getting too damn trusting gurgeh shrugged sipped at his hot liquor and studied the guttering candle on the counter in front of them i was the one who was suckered but who he looked at za why the state gurgeh za said prodding at the camera again because they want to have something on you just in case just in case what just in case you keep surprising them and winning games its insurance you heard of that no never mind its like gambling in reverse za held the camera with one hand straining at part of it with the thin instrument a hatch popped open za looked happy and extracted a coinsized disk from the guts of the machine he held it up to the light where it glinted nacreously your holiday snaps za told gurgeh he adjusted something at the end of the toothpick so that the little disk stuck to the instruments point as though glued there then held the tiny polychromatic coin over the candle flame until it sizzled and smoked and hissed and finally fell in dull flakes on to the wax sorry you couldnt have that as a souvenir za said gurgeh shook his head something id rather forget ah never mind ill get those two bitches though za grinned they owe me one for free several in fact za looked happy at the thought is that all gurgeh asked hey they were just playing their parts no malice involved worth a spanking at most za waggled his eyebrows lasciviously gurgeh sighed when they went back to the transit gallery to order their car za waved at some bulky severely casual males and apices waiting in the limelit tunnel and tossed one of them what was left of the camera the apex caught it and turned away along with the others the car arrived minutes later and what time do you call this do you know how long ive been waiting for you youve got a game to play tomorrow you know just look at the state of your clothes and where did you pick up that graze what have you machine gurgeh yawned throwing his jacket down on to a seat in the lounge go fuck yourself the following morning flereimsaho wasnt talking to him it joined him in the module lounge just as the call came through that pequil had arrived with the car but when gurgeh said hello it ignored him and travelled down in the hotel elevator studiously humming and crackling even louder than usual it was similarly uncommunicative in the car gurgeh decided he could live with this gurgee you have hurt yourself pequil looked with concern at the graze over gurgehs cheek yes gurgeh smiled stroking his beard i cut myself shaving it was attrition time on the board of form gurgeh was up against the other nine players from the start until it became too obvious that was what was happening hed used the advantage accrued on the previous board to set up a small dense and almost impregnable enclave he just sat in there for two days letting the others beat up against it done properly this would have broken him but his opponents were trying not to look too concerted in their actions so attacked a few at a time they were anyway each fearful of weakening themselves overmuch in case they were pounced upon by the others by the end of those two days a couple of the newsagencies were saying it was unfair and discourteous to the stranger to gang up on him flereimsaho over its huff by then and talking to him again reckoned this reaction might be genuine and unprompted but was more likely to be the result of imperial pressure certainly it thought the church which had doubtless been instructing the priest as well as financing the deals hed been making with the other players had been leant on by the imperial office whatever on the third day the massed attacks against gurgeh fell away and the game resumed a more normal course the gamehall was crowded with people there were many more paying spectators numerous invited guests had changed venue to come and see the alien play and the pressagencies had sent extra reporters and cameras the club players under the stewardship of the adjudicator succeeded in keeping the crowd quiet so gurgeh didnt find the extra people caused any great distraction during the game it was difficult to move around the hall during the breaks though people were constantly accosting him asking him questions or just wanting to look at him pequil was there most of the time but seemed more taken up with going in front of the cameras himself than shielding gurgeh from all the people wanting to talk to him at least he helped to divert the attentions of the newspeople and let gurgeh concentrate on the game over the next couple of days gurgeh noticed a subtle change in the way the priest was playing and to a lesser degree in the gamestyle of another two players gurgeh had taken three players right out of the game another three had been taken by the priest without much of a fight the remaining two apices had established their own small enclaves on the board and were taking comparatively little part in the wider game gurgeh was playing well if not at quite the pitch he had when hed won on the board of origin he ought to be defeating the priest and the other two fairly easily he was indeed gradually prevailing but very slowly the priest was playing better than he had before especially at the beginning of each session which made gurgeh think that the apex was getting some highgrade help during the breaks the same applied to the other two players though they were presumably being less extensively briefed when the end came though on the fifth day of the game it was sudden and the priests play simply collapsed the other two players resigned more adulation followed and the newsagencies began to run editorials worrying that somebody from outside could do so well some of the more sensational releases even carried stories that the alien from the culture was using some sort of supernatural sense or illegal technical device theyd found out flereimsahos name and mentioned it as the possible source of gurgehs illicit skill theyre calling me a computer the drone wailed and theyre calling me a cheat gurgeh said thoughtfully life is cruel as they keep saying here here they are correct the last game on the board of becoming the one gurgeh felt most at home on was a romp the priest had filed a special objective plan with the adjudicator before the game commenced something he was entitled to do as the player with the second largest number of points he was effectively playing for second place although he would be out of the main series he would have a chance to reenter it if he won his next two games in the second series gurgeh suspected this was a ruse and played very cautiously at first waiting for either the mass attack or some cunning individual setpiece but the others seemed to be playing almost aimlessly and even the priest seemed to be making the sort of slightly mechanical moves hed been making in the first game when gurgeh made a few light exploratory attacks he found little opposition he divided his forces in half and went on a fullscale raid into the territory of the priest just for the sheer hell of it the priest panicked and hardly made one good move after that by the end of the session he was in danger of being wiped out after the break gurgeh was attacked by all the others while the priest struggled pinned against one edge of the board gurgeh took the hint he gave the priest room to manoeuvre and let him attack two of the weaker players to regain his position on the board the game finished with gurgeh established over most of the board and the others either eradicated or confined to small strategically irrelevant areas gurgeh had no particular interest in fighting the game out to the bitter end and anyway guessed that if he tried to do so the others would form a united opposition no matter how obvious it was they were working together gurgeh was being offered victory but he would suffer if he tried to be greedy or vindictive the status quo was agreed the game ended the priest came second on points just pequil congratulated him again outside the hall hed reached the second round of the main series he was one of only twelve hundred first winners and twice that number of qualifiers he would now play against one person in the second round again the apex begged gurgeh to give a newsconference and again gurgeh refused but you must what are you trying to do if you dont say something soon youll turn them against you this enigmatic stuff wont do for ever you know youre the underdog at the moment dont lose that pequil gurgeh said fully aware he was insulting the apex by addressing him so i have no intention of speaking to anybody about my game and what they choose to say or think about me is irrelevant i am here to play the game and nothing else you are our guest pequil said coldly and you are my hosts gurgeh turned and walked away from the official and the ride back in the car was completed in silence save for flereimsahos humming which occasionally sounded to gurgeh as if it barely concealed a chuckling laugh now the trouble starts why do you say that ship it was night the rear doors of the module lay open gurgeh could hear the distant buzz of the police hoverplane stationed over the hotel to keep newsagency craft away the smell of the city warm and spicy and smoky drifted in too gurgeh was studying a setpiece problem in a single game and taking notes this seemed to be the best way of talking to the limiting factor with the timedelay talk then switch off and consider the problem while the hs light flashed to and fro then when the reply came switch back to speech mode it was almost like having a real conversation because now you have to show your moral cards its the single game so you have to define your first principles register your philosophical premises therefore youll have to give them some of the things you believe in i believe this could prove troublesome ship gurgeh said writing some notes on a scratch tablet as he studied the holo in front of him im not sure i have any beliefs i think you do jernau gurgeh and the imperial game bureau will want to know what they are for the record im afraid youll have to think of something why should i what does it matter i cant win any posts or ranks im not going to gain any power out of this so what difference does it make what i believe in i know they need to find out what people in power think but i just want to play the game yes but they will need to know for their statistics your views may not matter a jot in terms of the elective properties of the game but they do need to keep a record of what sort of player wins what sort of match besides which they will be interested in what sort of extremist politics you give credence to gurgeh looked at the screen camera extremist politics what are you talking about jernau gurgeh the machine said making a sighing noise a guilty system recognises no innocents as with any power apparatus which thinks everybodys either for it or against it were against it you would be too if you thought about it the very way you think places you amongst its enemies this might not be your fault because every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it but the point is that some societies try to maximise that effect and some try to minimise it you come from one of the latter and youre being asked to explain yourself to one of the former prevarication will be more difficult than you might imagine neutrality is probably impossible you cannot choose not to have the politics you do they are not some separate set of entities somehow detachable from the rest of your being they are a function of your existence i know that and they know that you had better accept it gurgeh thought about this can i lie i shall take it you mean would you be advised to register false premises rather than are you capable of telling untruths gurgeh shook his head this would probably be the wisest course though you may find it difficult to come up with something acceptable to them which you didnt find morally repugnant yourself gurgeh looked back to the holo display oh youd be surprised he muttered anyway if im lying about it how can i find it repugnant an interesting point if one assumes that one is not morally opposed to lying in the first place especially when it is largely or significantly what we term selfinterested rather than disinterested or compassionate lying then gurgeh stopped listening and studied the holo he really must look up some of his opponents previous games once he knew who it would be he heard the ship stop talking tell you what ship he said why dont you think about it you seem more engrossed in the whole idea than i do and im busy enough anyway so why dont you work out a compromise between truth and expediency well all be happy with hmm ill agree to whatever you suggest probably very well jernau gurgeh ill be happy to do that gurgeh bade the ship goodnight he completed his study of the singlegame problem then switched the screen off he stood and stretched yawning he strolled out of the module into the orangebrown darkness of the hotel roofgarden he almost bumped into a large uniformed male the guard saluted a gesture gurgeh never did know bow to reply to and handed him a piece of paper gurgeh took it and thanked him the guard went back to his station at the top of the roofstairs gurgeh walked back into the module trying to read the note flereimsaho he called uncertain whether the little machine was still around or not it came floating through from another part of the module in its undisguised quiet form carrying a large richly illustrated book on the avian fauna of eä yes what does this say gurgeh flourished the note the drone floated up to the piece of paper minus the imperial embroidery it says theyd like you to go to the palace tomorrow so they can add their congratulations what it means is they want to take a look at you i suppose i have to go i would say so does it mention you no but ill come along anyway they can only throw me out what were you talking to the ship about its going to register my premises for me it was also giving me a lecture on sociological conditioning it means well said the drone it just doesnt want to leave such a delicate task to someone like you just going out were you drone gurgeh said switching on the screen again and sitting down to watch it he brought up the gameplayers channel on the imperial waveband and flicked through to the draw for the single games in the second round still no decision the draw was still being decided expected any minute well flereimsaho said there is a very interesting species of nocturnal fishhunter that inhabits an estuary just a hundred kilometres from here and i was thinking dont let me keep you gurgeh said just as the draw started to come through on the imperial gamechannel the screen started to fill with numbers and names right ill say goodnight then the drone floated away gurgeh waved without looking round goodnight he said he didnt hear whether the drone replied or not he found his place in the draw his name appeared on the screen beside that of lo wescekibold ram governing director of the imperial monopolies board he was ranked as level five main which meant he was one of the sixty best gameplayers in the empire the following day was pequils day off an imperial aircraft was sent for gurgeh and landed beside the module gurgeh and flereimsaho which had been rather late returning from its estuarial expedition were taken out over the city to the palace they landed on the roof of an impressive set of office buildings overlooking one of the small parks set within the palace grounds and were led down wide richly carpeted stairs to a highceilinged office where a male servant asked gurgeh if he wanted anything to eat or drink gurgeh said no and he and the drone were left alone flereimsaho drifted over to the tall windows gurgeh looked at some portrait paintings hanging on the walls after a short while a youngish apex entered the room he was tall dressed in a relatively unfussy and businesslike version of the uniform of the imperial bureaucracy mr gurgeh good day im lo shav olos hello gurgeh said they exchanged polite nods then the apex walked quickly to a large desk in front of the windows and set a bulky sheaf of papers down on it before sitting down lo shav olos looked round at flereimsaho buzzing and hissing away near by and this must be your little machine its name is flereimsaho it helps me with your language of course the apex gestured to an ornate seat on the other side of his desk please sit down gurgeh sat and flereimsaho came to float near him the male servant returned with a crystal goblet and placed it on the desk near olos who drank before saying not that you must need much help mr gurgeh the young apex smiled your eächic is very good thank you let me add my personal congratulations to those of the imperial office mr gurgeh you have done far better than many of us expected you to do i understand you were learning the game only for about a third of one of our great years yes but i found azad so interesting i did little else during that time and it does share concepts with other games ive studied in the past nevertheless youve beaten people whove been learning the game all their lives the priest lin goforiev tounse was expected to do well in these games so i saw gurgeh smiled perhaps i was lucky the apex gave a little laugh and sat back in his chair perhaps you were mr gurgeh im sorry to see your luck didnt extend to cover the draw for the next round lo wescekibold ram is a formidable player and many expect him to better his previous performance i hope i can give him a good game so do we all the apex drank from his goblet again then got up and went to the windows behind him looking out over the park he scratched at the thick glass as though there was a speck on it while not strictly speaking my province i confess id be interested if you could tell me a little about your plans for the registration of premises he turned and looked at gurgeh i havent decided quite how to express them yet gurgeh said ill register them tomorrow probably the apex nodded thoughtfully he pulled at one sleeve of the imperial uniform i wonder if i might advise you to be somewhat circumspect mr gurgeh gurgeh asked the drone to translate circumspect olos waited then continued of course you must register with the bureau but as you know your participation in these games is in a purely honorary capacity and so exactly what you say in your premises has only statistical value shall we say gurgeh asked the drone to translate capacity garbleness gameplayeroid flereimsaho muttered darkly in marain twiddlydee you that word capacity beforely usedish eächic in placeywaceys buggywuggied stoppytoppy deez guys spladdiblledeydeyda more cluettes on da lingo offering righty gurgeh suppressed a smile olos went on as a rule contestants must be prepared to defend their views with arguments should the bureau find it necessary to challenge any of them but i hope you will understand that this will hardly be likely to happen to you the imperial bureau is not blind to the fact that the values of your society may be quite different from our own we have no wish to embarrass you by forcing you to reveal things the press and the majority of our citizens might find offensive he smiled personally off the record i would imagine that you could be quite oh one might almost say vague and nobody would be especially bothered especially gurgeh said innocently to the humming crackling drone at his side more gibberish biltrivnik ner plin ferds youre quontstipilish trying nomonomo wertsishi my zozlik zibbidik dik fucking patience gurgeh gurgeh coughed loudly excuse me he said to olos yes i see ill bear that in mind when i draw up my premises im glad mr gurgeh olos said coming back to his chair and sitting again what ive said is my personal view of course and i have no links with the imperial bureau this office is quite independent of that body nevertheless one of the great strengths of the empire is its cohesion its unity and i doubt that i could be very wide of the mark in judging what the attitude of another imperial department might be lo shav olos smiled indulgently we really do all pull together i understand gurgeh said im sure you do tell me are you looking forward to your trip to echronedal very much so especially as the honour is extended so rarely to guest players indeed olos looked amused few guests are ever allowed on to the fire planet it is a holy place as well as being itself a symbol of the everlasting nature of the empire and the game my gratitude extends beyond the limits of my capacity to express it gurgeh purred with the hint of a bow flereimsaho made a spluttering noise olos smiled broadly i feel quite certain that having established yourself as being so proficient indeed gifted at our game you will prove yourself to be more than worthy of your place in the gamecastle on echronedal now the apex said glancing at his deskscreen i see it is time for me to attend yet another doubtless insufferably tedious meeting of the trade council id far prefer to continue our own exchange mr gurgeh but unhappily it must be curtailed in the interests of the efficiently regulated exchange of goods between our many worlds i fully understand gurgeh said standing at the same time as the apex im pleased to have met you mr gurgeh olos smiled and i you let me wish you luck in your game against lo wescekibold ram the apex said as he walked to the door with gurgeh im afraid you will need it im sure it will be an interesting game i hope so gurgeh said they left the room olos offered his hand gurgeh clasped it allowing himself to look a little surprised good day mr gurgeh goodbye then gurgeh and flereimsaho were escorted back to the aircraft on the roof while lo shav olos strode off down another corridor to his meeting you asshole gurgeh the drone said in marain as soon as they were back in the module first you ask me two words you already know and then you use both of them and the gurgeh was shaking his head by this time and interrupted you really dont understand very much about gameplaying do you drone i know when people are playing the fool better than playing a household pet machine the machine made a noise like an indrawn breath then seemed to hesitate and said well anyway at least you dont have to worry about your premises now it gave a rather forcedsounding chuckle theyre as frightened of you telling the truth as you are gurgehs game against lo wescekibold ram attracted great attention the press fascinated by this odd alien who refused to speak to them sent their most acerbic reporters and the camera operators best able to catch any fleeting facial expression which would make the subject look ugly stupid or cruel and preferably all three at once gurgehs offworld physiognomy was regarded as a challenge by some camera people and as a large fish in a small barrel by others numerous paying gamefans had traded tickets for other games so they could watch this one and the guests gallery could have been filled many times over even though the venue had been changed from the original hall gurgeh had played in before to a large marquee erected in a park only a couple of kilometres from both the grand hotel and the imperial palace the marquee held three times as many people as the old hall and was still crowded pequil had arrived as usual in the alien affairs bureau car in the morning and taken gurgeh to the park the apex no longer tried to put himself in front of the cameras but busily hurried them out of the way to clear a path for gurgeh gurgeh was introduced to lo wescekibold ram he was a short bulky apex with a more rugged face than gurgeh had expected and a military bearing ram played quick incisive lesser games and they finished two on the first day ending about even gurgeh only realised how hard hed been concentrating that evening when he fell asleep watching the screen he slept for almost six hours the next day they played another two of the lesser games but the play extended by agreement into the evening session gurgeh felt the apex was testing him trying to wear him out or at least see what the limits of his endurance were they would be playing all six of the lesser games before the three main boards and gurgeh already knew he was under much more strain playing ram alone than hed been competing against nine others after a great struggle almost to midnight gurgeh finished fractionally ahead he slept seven hours and woke up just in time to get ready for the next days play he forced himself awake glanding the cultures favourite breakfast drug snap and was a little disappointed to see ram looked just as fresh and energetic as he felt that game became another war of attrition dragging through the afternoon and ram didnt suggest playing into the evening gurgeh spent a couple of hours discussing the game with the ship during the evening then to wash it from his mind watched the empires broadcast channels for a while there were adventure programmes and quizzes and comedies newsstations and documentaries he looked for reports on his own game he was mentioned but the days rather dull play didnt merit much space he could see that the agencies were becoming less and less welldisposed to him and he wondered if they now regretted standing up for him when hed been ganged up on during the first match over the next five days the newsstations became even less happy with alien gurgey eächic was phonetically less subtle than marain so his name was always going to be spelled incorrectly he finished the lesser games about level with ram then beat him on the board of origin after being well down at one stage and lost on the board of form only by the most slender of margins the newsagencies at once decided that gurgeh was a menace to the empire and the common good and began a campaign to have him thrown off eä they claimed he was in telepathic touch with the limiting factor or with the robot called flereimsaho that he used all manner of disgusting drugs which were kept in the vice den and drug emporium he lived in on the roof of the grand hotel then as though just discovering the fact that he could make the drugs inside his own body which was true using glands ripped out of little children in appalling and fatal operations which was not the effect of these drugs seemed to be to turn him into either a supercomputer or an alien sexmaniac even both in some reports one agency discovered gurgehs premises which the ship had drawn up and registered with the games bureau these were held to be typically shifty and mealymouthed culture doubletalk a recipe for anarchy and revolution the agencies adopted hushed and reverent tones as they appealed loyally to the emperor to do something about the culture and blamed the admiralty for having known about this gang of slimy perverts for decades without apparently showing them who was boss or just crushing them completely one daring agency even went so far as to claim the admiralty wasnt totally certain where the cultures home planet was they offered up prayers that lo wescekibold ram would wipe the alien gurgey off the board of becoming as decisively as the navy would one day dispose of the corrupt and socialistic culture they urged ram to use the physical option if he had to that would show what the nambypamby alien was made of perhaps literally is all this serious gurgeh said turning amused from the screen to the drone deadly serious flereimsaho told him gurgeh laughed and shook his head he thought the common people must be remarkably stupid if they believed all this nonsense ater four days of the game on the board of becoming gurgeh was poised to win he saw ram talking worriedly with some of his advisors afterwards and half expected the apex to offer his resignation then after the afternoon session but ram decided to fight on they agreed to forgo the evening session and resume the next morning the big tent ruffled slightly in a warm breeze as flereimsaho joined gurgeh at the exit pequil supervised the way being cleared through the crowds outside to where the car was waiting the crowd was composed mostly of people who just wanted to see the alien though there were a few demonstrating noisily against gurgeh and an even smaller number who were cheering him ram and his advisors left the tent first i think i see shohobohaum za in the crowd the drone said as they waited at the exit rams entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen gurgeh glanced at the machine then down the line of armlinked police he was still tensed from the game bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals as happened every now and again everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game the way people stood like pieces grouped according to who could take or affect whom the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple gridarea on the board and the poles like planted powersources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a cruxpoint in the game the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincermovement all was the game everything was seen in its light translated into the combative imagery of its language evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind za gurgeh said he looked in the direction the drones field was pointing but couldnt see the man the last of rams group cleared the pavement where the official cars waited pequil gestured for gurgeh to proceed they walked between the lines of uniformed males cameras pointed questions were shouted some ragged chanting began and gurgeh saw a banner waving over the heads of the crowd go home alien seems im not too popular he said you arent flereimsaho told him in two steps gurgeh realised in a distant gamesense way even as he was speaking and the drone was replying he was going to be adjacent to it took one more step to analyse the problem something bad something jarring and discordant there was something different wrong about the threegroup he was about to pass on his left like unplaced ghostpieces hiding in forest territory he had no idea exactly what was wrong with the group but he knew immediately as the protagonising structures of the gamesense claimed precedence in his thoughts that he wasnt going to risk putting a piece in there another halfstep to realise that the piece he didnt want to risk was himself he saw the threegroup start to move and split up he turned and ducked automatically it was the obvious replying move of a threatened piece with too much momentum to stop or bound back from such an attacking force there were several loud bangs the threegroup of people burst towards him through the arms of two policemen like a composite piece suddenly fragmenting he converted his ducking motion into a dive and roll which he realised with some delight was the almost perfect physical equivalent to a trippiece tying up a lightattacker he felt a pair of legs thud into his side not hard then there was a weight on top of him and more loud noises something else fell on top of his legs it was like waking up hed been attacked there had been flashes explosions people launching themselves at him he struggled under the warm animal weight on top of him the one hed tripped up people were shouting police moved quickly he saw pequil lying on the ground za was there too standing looking rather confused somebody was screaming no sign of flereimsaho something warm was seeping into the hose he wore on his legs he struggled out from under the body lying on top of him suddenly revolted by the thought that the person apex or male he couldnt tell might be dead shohobohaum za and a policeman helped him up there was a lot of shouting still people were moving or being moved back clearing a space around whatever had happened bodies lay on the ground some covered in bright redorange blood gurgeh got dizzily to his feet all right gameplayer za asked grinning yes i think so gurgeh nodded there was blood on his legs but it was the wrong colour to be his flereimsaho descended from the sky jernau gurgeh are you all right yes gurgeh looked around what happened he asked shohobohaum za did you see what happened the police had drawn their guns and were clustered around the area the people were moving away the presscameras were being forced back by shouting police five policemen were pinning somebody down on the grass two apices in civilian clothes lay on the path the one gurgeh had tripped was covered in blood a policeman stood over each body another two were tending to pequil those three attacked you za said eyes flicking around as he nodded at the two bodies and the figure under the pile of police gurgeh could hear somebody sobbing loudly in what was left of the crowd reporters were still shouting questions za guided gurgeh over to where pequil lay while flereimsaho fussed and hummed overhead pequil lay on his back eyes open blinking while a policeman cut away the bloodsoaked sleeve of his uniform jacket old pequil here got in the way of a bullet za said you all right pequil he shouted jovially pequil smiled weakly and nodded meanwhile za said putting his arm round gurgehs shoulders and looking round all the time gaze darting everywhere your brave and resourceful drone here exceeded the speed of sound to get about twenty metres out of the way upwards i was merely gaining height the better to ascertain wh you dropped za told gurgeh still without looking at him and rolled i thought theyd got you actually i managed to knock one of these bods on the head and i think the police burnt the other one zas gaze settled momentarily on the knot of people beyond the cordon of police where the sobbing was coming from somebody in the crowd got hit too the bullets meant for you gurgeh looked down at one of the dead apices his head lay at rightangles to his body across his shoulder it would have looked wrong on almost any humanoid yeah thats the one i hit za said glancing briefly at the apex bit too hard i think i repeat flereimsaho said moving round in front of gurgeh and za i was merely gaining height in order to yes were glad youre safe drone za said waving the buzzing bulk of the machine away like a large and cumbersome insect and guiding gurgeh forward to where an apex in police uniform was gesturing towards the cars whooping noises sounded in the sky and the surrounding streets ah heres the boys za said as a wailing noise dopplered its way over the park and a large orangered airvan rushed out of the sky to land in a storm of dust on the grass near by the marquee fabric flapped and banged and rippled in the blast of air more heavily armed police jumped out of the van there was some confusion about whether they ought to go to the cars or not finally they were taken back into the marquee and statements were taken from them and some other witnesses two cameras were confiscated from protesting newspeople outside the two dead bodies and the wounded attacker were loaded on to the airvan an airambulance arrived for pequil who was lightly wounded in the arm as gurgeh za and the drone finally left the marquee to be taken back to the hotel in a police aircraft a groundcarambulance was pulling in through the park gates to pick up the two males and a female also injured in the attack nice little module shohobohaum za said throwing himself into a formseat gurgeh sat down too the noise of the departing policecraft echoed through the interior flereimsaho went quiet as soon as they got in and disappeared through to another part of the module gurgeh ordered a drink from the module and asked za if he would like anything module za said sprawling out over the seat and looking thoughtful id like a double standard measure of staol and chilled shungusteriaung warpwing liver wine bottoming a mouth of white eflyrespin cruchenspirit in a slush of medium cascalo topped with roasted weirdberries and served in a number three strength tipprawlic osmosisbowl or your best approximation thereof male or female warpwing the module said in this place za laughed hell both it will take some minutes that is perfectly all right za rubbed his hands together and then looked at gurgeh so you survived well done gurgeh looked uncertain for an instant then said yes thanks think comparatively little of it za flapped one hand quite enjoyed myself actually just sorry i killed the guy i wish i could take such a magnanimous view gurgeh said he was trying to kill me and with bullets gurgeh found the idea of being hit by a bullet particularly horrible well za shrugged im not sure it makes much difference whether youre killed by a projectile or a crew youre just as dead anyway i still feel sorry for those guys poor bastards were probably just doing their jobs their jobs gurgeh said mystified za yawned and nodded stretching out in the folds of the accommodating formseat yeah theyll be imperial secret police or bureau nine or something like that he yawned again oh the storyll be theyre disaffected civilians though they might try to hang it on the revs but thatd be a bit unlikely za grinned shrugged na they might try it anyway just for a laugh gurgeh thought no he said finally i dont understand you said these people were police how secret police jernau but how can you have a secret policeman i thought one of the points of having a uniform for the police was so that they could be easily identified and act as a deterrent good grief za said covering his face with his hands he put them down and gazed at gurgeh he took a deep breath right well the secret police are people who go about listening to what people say when they arent being deterred by the sight of a uniform then if the person hasnt actually said anything illegal but has said something they think is dangerous to the security of the empire they kidnap them and interrogate them and as a rule kill them sometimes they send them to a penal colony but usually they incinerate them or throw them down an old mineshaft the atmosphere heres rich with revolutionary fervour jernau gurgeh and there are some rich seams of loose tongues beneath the city streets they do other things as well these secret police what happened to you today was one of those other things za sat back and made an expansive shrugging gesture or on the other hand i suppose it isnt impossible they really were revs or disaffected citizens except that they moved all wrong but thats what secret police do take it from me ah a tray approached bearing a large bowl in a holder vapour rose dramatically from the frothing multicoloured surface of the liquid za took the bowl to the empire he shouted and drained it in one go he slammed the bowl back on to the tray haaa he exclaimed sniffing and coughing and wiping his eyes with the sleeves of his tunic he blinked at gurgeh sorry if im being slow gurgeh said but if these people were imperial police mustnt they have been acting on orders whats going on does the empire want me dead because im winning the game against ram hmm za said coughing a little youre learning jernau gurgeh shit i thought a gameplayer would have a bit more natural deviousness about him youre a babe amongst the carnivores out here anyway yes somebody in a position of power wants you dead think theyll try it again za shook his head too obvious theyd have to be pretty desperate to try something like that again in the short term at least i think theyll wait and see what happens in your next ten game then if they cant ditch you in that theyll get your next single opponent to use the physical option on you and hope youll scare off if you get that far am i really such a threat to them hey gurgeh they realise now theyve made a mistake you didnt see the casts before you got here they were saying you were the best player in the whole culture and you were some sort of decadent slob a hedonist whod never worked a day in your life that you were arrogant and totally convinced you were going to win the game that you had all sorts of new glands sewn into your body that youd fucked your mother men animals for all i know that you were half computer then the bureau saw some of your games youd been playing on the way here and announced what gurgeh said sitting forward what do you mean theyd seen some of the games id been playing they asked me for some recent games youd played i got in touch with the limiting factor isnt that thing a bore and had it send me the moves in a couple of your recent games against it the bureau said on the strength of those they were more than happy to let you play using your drugglands and everything else im sorry id assumed the ship asked your permission first didnt it no gurgeh said well anyway they said you could play without restrictions i dont think they really wanted to purity of the game you know but the orders must have been handed down the empire wanted to prove that even with your unfair advantages you still werent capable of staying in the main series your first couple of days play against that priest and his squad dies must have had them rubbing their little hands with glee but then that outofthehat stuntwin dropped their chins in their soup having you drawn against ram in the single game probably seemed like a really good wheeze too but now youre about to kick his latrine boards out from under him and theyve panicked za hiccuped hence the bungled splatjob today so the draw against ram wasnt really random either gods balls gurgeh za laughed no man holy shit are you really this naive he sat shaking his head and looking at the floor and hiccupping every now and again gurgeh stood up and went to the opened module doors he looked out at the city shimmering in the late evening haze long tower shadows lay on it like widely spaced hairs on some nearbald pelt aircraft glinted sunsetred above it gurgeh didnt think hed ever felt so angry and frustrated in his life another uncomfortable feeling to add to those hed been experiencing lately feelings hed put down to the game and to really playing seriously for the first time everybody seemed to be treating him like a child they happily decided what he need and need not be told they kept things back from him that he ought to have been told and when they did tell him they acted as if he should have known all the time he looked back at za but the man was sitting rubbing his belly and looking distracted he belched loudly then smiled happily and shouted hey module put up channel ten yeah on the screen yo he got up and trotted forward to stand right in front of the screen and stood there arms folded whistling tunelessly and grinning vacantly at the moving pictures gurgeh watched from the side the news showed film of imperial troopers landing on a distant planet towns and cities burned refugee lines snaked bodies were shown there were interviews with the tearful families of slain troopers the just invaded locals hairy quadrupeds with prehensile lips were shown lying down tied up in the mud or on their knees before a portrait of nicosar one was shorn so the people back home could see what they looked like under all that fur their lips had become prized trophies the following story was about nicosar demolishing his opponent in the single game the emperor was shown walking from one pan of the board to another signing some documents in an office then from a distance standing on the board again while a commentator enthused over the way hed played the attack on gurgeh was next he was amazed when he saw the incident on film it was over in an instant a sudden leap him falling the drone disappearing upwards some flashes za springing forward out of the crowd confusion and movement then his face in closeup a shot of pequil on the ground and another of the dead attackers he was described as being dazed but unharmed thanks to the prompt action of the police pequil was not seriously wounded he was interviewed in hospital explaining how he felt the attackers were described as extremists that means they might decide to call them revs later on za said he told the screen to turn off then turned to gurgeh didnt you think i was quick there though he said grinning widely and throwing his arms wide did you see the way i moved it was beautiful he laughed and spun round then half walked half danced to the foamseat again and fell into it shit i was only there to see what sort of loonies they had out protesting against you but wow am i glad i went what speed fucking animal grace maestro gurgeh agreed za had moved very quickly lets see it again module za shouted the modulescreen obliged and shohobohaum za laughed and giggled as he watched the few seconds of action he replayed it a few more times in slow motion clapping his hands then called for another drink the frothing bowl came quicker this time the modules synthesisers having wisely kept the previous coding gurgeh sat down again seeing that za wasnt thinking of leaving just yet gurgeh ordered some snacks za snorted in derision when offered food and crunched the roasted weirdberries that came with his foaming cocktail they watched imperial broadcasts while za slurped slowly at his drink outside one sun went down and the city lights sparkled in the halflight flereimsaho appeared without its disguise za took no notice of it and announced it was on its way out making yet another foray into the avian population of the planet dont think that thing fucks birds dyou za said after it had disappeared no gurgeh said drinking his light wine za snorted hey you want to come out again some time that visit to the hole was a real hoot i really enjoyed it in a weird son of way how about it except lets go totally wild this time show these constipated bonebrains what culture guys are like when they really put their minds to it i dont think so gurgeh said not after that last time you mean you didnt enjoy it za said astonished not that much but we had a great time we got drunk we got stoned we got well one of us got laid and you nearly did we had a fight which we won dammit and then we ran away holy shit what more do you want not more less anyway i have other games to play youre crazy that was a wonderful night out wonderful he rested his head on the seatback and breathed deeply za gurgeh said sitting forward chin in hand elbow on knee why do you drink so much you dont need to youve got all the usual glands why why za said his head coming upright again he looked round as though startled to see where he was for a moment why he repeated he hiccuped you ask me why he said gurgeh nodded za scratched under one armpit shook his head and looked apologetic what was the question again why do you drink so much gurgeh smiled tolerantly why not zas arms flapped once i mean have you never done something just just because i mean its um empathy this is what the locals do yknow this is their way out this is how they escape their place in the glorious imperial machine and a fucking grand position it is to appreciate its finer points from too it all makes sense yknow gurgeh i worked it out za nodded wisely tapped the side of his head very slowly with one limp finger worked it out he repeated think about it the cultures all its the same finger made a twirling motion in the air built in glands hundreds of secretions and thousands of effects any combination you like and all for free but the empire ah ha the finger pointed upwards in the empire you got to pay escape is a commodity like anything else and its this stuff drink lowers the reaction time makes the tears come easier za put two swaying fingers to his cheeks makes the fists come easier now his hands were clenched and he pretended to box jabbing and he shrugged it eventually kills you he looked more or less at gurgeh see he spread his arms wide again and then let them fan back limply on the seat besides he said in a suddenly weary voice i dont have all the usual glands gurgeh looked up in surprise you dont nup too dangerous the empire would disappear me and do the most thorough pm you ever seen want to find out what a culturniks like inside see za closed his eyes had to have almost everything taken out and then when i got here let the empire do all sorts of tests and take all sorts of samples let them find out what they wanted without causing a diplomatic incident disappearing an ambassador i see im sorry gurgeh didnt know what else to say he honestly hadnt realised so all those drugs you were advising me to gland guesswork and memory za said eyes still shut just trying to be friendly gurgeh felt embarrassed almost ashamed zas head went back and he started to snore then suddenly his eyes opened and he jumped up well must be toddling he said making what looked like a supreme effort to pull himself together he stood swaying in front of gurgeh dyou think you could call me an air cab gurgeh did that a few minutes later after receiving clearance from gurgeh via the guards on the roof the machine arrived and took shohobohaum za away singing gurgeh sat for a little while as the evening wore on and the second sun set then he finally dictated a letter to chamlis amalkney thanking the old drone for the orbital bracelet which he still wore he copied most of the letter to yay too and told them both what had happened to him since hed arrived he didnt bother to disguise the game he was playing or the empire itself and wondered how much of this truth would actually get through to his friends then he studied some problems on the screen and talked over the next days play with the ship he picked up shohobohaum zas discarded bowl at one point discovering there were still a few mouthfuls of drink left inside he sniffed it then shook his head and told a tray to tidy the debris up gurgeh finished lo wescekibold ram off the next day with that the press described as contempt pequil was there looking little the worse for wear save for a sling bandage on his arm he said he was glad gurgeh had escaped injury gurgeh told him how sorry he was pequil had been hurt they went to and returned from the gametent in an aircraft the imperial office had decided gurgeh was at too much risk travelling on the ground when he got back to the module again gurgeh discovered he was to have no interval between that game and the next the games bureau had couriered a letter to say his next ten game would start the following morning id have preferred a break gurgeh confessed to the drone he was having a floatshower hanging in the middle of the ag chamber while the water sprayed from various directions and was sucked away through tiny holes all over the semispherical interior membrane plugs prevented the water from going into his nose but speaking was still a little spluttery no doubt you would flereimsaho said in its squeaky voice but theyre trying to wear you out and of course it means youll be playing against some of the best players the ones whove also managed to finish their games quickly that had occurred to me gurgeh said he could only just see the drone through the spray and steam he wondered what would happen if somehow the machine hadnt been made quite perfectly and some water got into it he turned lazily head over heels in the shifting currents of ai and water you could always appeal to the bureau i think its obvious youre being discriminated against so do i so do they so what it might do some good to make an appeal you make it then dont be stupid you know they ignore me gurgeh started humming to himself eyes closed one of his opponents in the ten game was the same priest hed beaten in the first one lin goforiev tounse hed won through his secondstring games to rejoin the main series gurgeh looked at the priest when the apex entered the hall of the entertainment complex where theyd be playing and smiled it was an azadian facial gesture hed found himself practising occasionally unconsciously rather like a baby attempts to imitate the expressions on the faces of the adults around it suddenly it seemed like the right time to use it he would never get it quite right he knew his face simply wasnt built quite the same as an azadians but he could imitate the signal well enough for it to be unambiguous translated or not though gurgeh knew it was a smile that said remember me ive beaten you once and im looking forward to doing it again a smile of selfsatisfaction of victory of superiority the priest tried to smile back with the same signal but it was unconvincing and soon turned to a scowl he looked away gurgehs spirits soared elation filled him burning bright inside he had to force himself to calm down the other eight players had all like gurgeh won their matches three were admiralty or navy men one was an army colonel one a judge and the other three were bureaucrats all were very good players at this third stage in the main series the contestants played a minitournament of oneagainstone lesser games and gurgeh thought this would provide his best chance of surviving the match on the main boards he was likely to face some sort of concerted action but in the single games he had a chance of building up enough of an advantage to weather such storms he found himself taking great pleasure in beating tounse the priest the apex swept his arm across the board after gurgehs winning move and stood up and started shouting and waving his fist at him raving about drugs and heathens once gurgeh was aware such a reaction would have brought him out in a cold sweat or at the very least left him dreadfully embarrassed but now he found himself just sitting back and smiling coldly still as the priest ranted at him he thought the apex might be about to hit him and his heart did beat a little faster but tounse stopped in midflow looked round the hushed shocked people in the room seemed to realise where he was and fled gurgeh let out a breath relaxed his face the imperial adjudicator came over and apologised on the priests behalf flereimsaho was still popularly thought to be providing some sort of ingame aid to gurgeh the bureau said that to allay uninformed suspicions of this sort they would like the machine to be held in the offices of an imperial computer company on the other side of the city during each session the drone had protested noisily but gurgeh readily agreed he was still attracting large crowds to his games a few came to glare and hiss until they were escorted off the premises by game officials but mostly they just wanted to see the play the entertainment complex had facilities for diagrammatic representations of the main boards so that people outside the main hall could follow the proceedings and some of gurgehs sessions were even shown in live broadcasts when they didnt clash with the emperors after the priest gurgeh played two of the bureaucrats and the colonel winning all his games though by a slender margin against the army man these games took a total of five days to play and gurgeh concentrated hard for all that time hed expected to feel wornout at the end he did feel slightly drained but the primary sensation was one of jubilation hed done well enough to have at least a chance of beating the nine people the empire had set against him and far from appreciating the rest he found he was actually impatient for the others to finish their minor games so that the contest on the main boards could begin its all very well for you but im being kept in a monitoring chamber all day a monitoring chamber i ask you these meatbrains are trying to probe me beautiful weather outside and a major migratory season just starting but im locked up with a shower of heinous sentientophiles trying to violate me sorry drone but what can i do you know theyre just looking for an excuse to throw me out if you want ill make a request youre allowed to stay here in the module instead but i doubt theyll let you i dont have to do this you know jernau gurgeh i can do what i like if i wanted to i could just refuse to go im not yours or theirs to be ordered around i know that but they dont of course you can do as you please whatever you see fit gurgeh turned away from the drone and back to the modulescreen where he was studying some classic ten games flereimsaho was grey with frustration the normal greenyellow aura it displayed when out of its disguise had been growing increasingly pale over the past few days gurgeh almost felt sorry for it well flereimsaho whined and gurgeh got the impression that had it had a real mouth it would have spluttered too its just not good enough and with that rather lame remark the drone whirled out of the lounge gurgeh wondered just how badly the drone felt about being imprisoned all day it had occurred to him recently that the machine might even have been instructed to stop him from getting too far in the games if so then refusing to be detained would be an acceptable way of doing it contact could justifiably claim that asking the drone to give up its freedom was an unreasonable request and one it had every right to turn down gurgeh shrugged to himself there was nothing he could do about it he switched to another old game ten days later it was over and gurgeh was through to the fourth round he had only one more opponent to beat and then he would be going to echronedal for the final matches not as an observer or guest but as a contestant hed built up the lead hed hoped for in the lesser games and in the main boards had not even tried to mount any great offensives hed waited for the others to come to him and they had but he was counting on them not being so willing to cooperate with each other as the players in the first match these were important people they had their own careers to think about and however loyal they might be to the empire they had to look after their own interests as well only the priest had relatively little to lose and so might be prepared to sacrifice himself for the imperial good and whatever not gamekeyed post the church could find for him in the game outside the game gurgeh thought the games bureau had made a mistake in pitching him against the first ten people to qualify it appeared to make sense because it gave him no respite but as it turned out he didnt need any and the tactic meant that his opponents were from different branches of the imperial tree and thus harder to tempt with departmental inducements as well as being less likely to know each others gamestyles hed also discovered something called interservice rivalry hed found records of some old games that didnt seem to make sense until the ship described this odd phenomenon and made special efforts to get the admiralty men and the colonel at each others throats theyd needed little prompting it was a workmanlike match uninspiring but functional and he simply played better than any of the others his winning margin wasnt great but it was a win one of the fleet viceadmirals came second tounse the priest finished last again the bureaus supposedly random scheduling gave him as little time as possible between matches but gurgeh was secretly pleased at this it meant he could keep the same high pitch of concentration going from day to day and it gave him no time to worry or stop too long to think somewhere at the back of his mind a part of him was sitting back as stunned and amazed as anybody else was at how well he was doing if that part ever came forward ever took centrestage and was allowed to say now wait a minute here he suspected his nerve would fail the spell would break and the walk that was a fall would become a plunge into defeat as the adage said falling never killed anybody it was when you stopped anyway he was awash with a bittersweet flood of new and enhanced emotions the terror of risk and possible defeat the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap the pulse of furious gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in anothers game and the sheer unbridled joy of victory and outside the additional satisfaction of knowing that he was doing so much better than anybody had expected all their predictions the cultures the empires the ships the drones had been wrong apparently strong fortifications which had fallen to him even his own expectations had been exceeded and if he worried at all he worried that some subconscious mechanism would now let him relax a little having proved so much come so far defeated so many he didnt want that he wanted to keep going he was enjoying all this he wanted to find the measure of himself through this infinitely exploitable indefinitely demanding game and he didnt want some weak frightened part of himself to let him down he didnt want the empire to use some unfair way of getting rid of him either but even that was only half a worry let them try to kill him he had a reckless feeling of invincibility now just dont let them try to disqualify him on some technicality that would hurt but there was another way they might try to stop him he knew that in the single game they would be likely to use the physical option it was how theyd think this culture man would not accept the bet hed be too frightened even if he did accept and fought on the terror of knowing what might happen to him would paralyse him devour and defeat him from inside he talked it over with the ship the limiting factor had consulted with the little rascal tens of millennia distant in the greater cloud and felt able to guarantee his survival the old warship would stay outside the empire but power up to a maximum velocity minimum radius holding circle as soon as the game started if gurgeh was forced to bet against a physical option and lost the ship would drive in at full speed for eä it was certain it could evade any imperial craft on the way get to eä within a few hours and use its heavy duty displacer to snap gurgeh and flereimsaho off the place without even slowing down whats this gurgeh looked dubiously at the tiny spherical pellet flereimsaho had produced beacon and oneoff communicator the drone told him it dropped the tiny pellet into his hand where it rolled around you put it under your tongue itll implant youll never know its there the ship homes in on that as it comes in if it cant find you any other way when you feel a series of sharp pains under your tongue four stabs in two seconds youve got two seconds to assume a foetal position before everything within a threequarter metre radius of that pellet gets slung aboard the ship so get your head between knees and dont swing your arms about gurgeh looked at the pellet it was about two millimetres across are you serious drone profoundly that shipll probably be on sprint boost it could be dragging past here at anything up to onetwenty kilolights at that speed even its heavy duty displacer will only be within range for about a fifth of a millisecond so were going to need all the help we can get this is a very dubious situation youre putting me and yourself in gurgeh i want you to know im not very happy about it dont worry drone ill make sure they dont include you in the physical bet no i mean the possibility of being displaced its risky i wasnt told about this displacement fields in hyperspace are singularities subject to the uncertainty principle yeah you might end up getting zapped into another dimension or something or smeared over the wrong bit of this one more to the point and how often does that happen well about once in eightythree million displacements but thats not so it still compares pretty favourably with the risk you take getting into one of this gangs groundcars or even an aircraft be a rascal flereimsaho risk it thats all very well for you to say but even if gurgeh let the machine witter on hed risk it the ship if it did have to come in would take a few hours to make the journey but deathbets were never carried out until the next dawn and gurgeh was perfectly capable of switching off the pain of any tortures involved the limiting factor had full medical facilities it would be able to patch him up if the worst happened he popped the pellet under his tongue there was a sensation of numbness for a second then it was gone as though dissolved he could just feel it with his finger under the floor of his mouth he woke on the morning of the first days play with an almost sexual thrill of anticipation another venue this time it was a conferencecentre near the shuttleport hed first arrived at there he faced lo prinest bermoiya a judge in the supreme court of eä and one of the most impressive apices gurgeh had yet seen he was tall silverhaired and he moved with a grace gurgeh found oddly even disturbingly familiar without at first being able to explain why then he realised the elderly judge walked like somebody from the culture there was a slow ease about the apexs movements which lately gurgeh had stopped taking for granted and so for the first time in a way seen bermoiya sat very still between moves in the lesser games staring at the board continually and only ever moving to shift a piece his cardplaying was equally studied and deliberate and gurgeh found himself reacting in the opposite manner becoming nervous and fidgety he fought back against this with bodydrugs deliberately calming himself and over the seven full days the lesser games lasted gradually got to grips with the steady considered pace of the apexs style the judge finished a little ahead after the games were totalled up there had been no mention of bets of any sort they started play on the board of origin and at first gurgeh thought the empire was going to be content to rely on bermoiyas obvious skill at azad but then an hour into the game the silverhaired apex raised his hand for the adjudicator to approach together they came to gurgeh standing at one comer of the board bermoiya bowed jernow gurgey he said the voice was deep and gurgeh seemed to hear a whole tome of authority within each bass syllable i must request that we engage in a wager of the body are you willing to consider this gurgeh looked into the large calm eyes he felt his own gaze falter he looked down he was reminded momentarily of the girl at the ball he looked back up to the same steady pressure from that wise and learned face this was someone used to sentencing his fellow creatures to execution disfigurement pain and prison an apex who dealt in torture and mutilation and the power to command their use and even that of death itself to preserve the empire and its values and i could just say no gurgeh thought ive done enough nobody would blame me why not why not accept theyre better at this than i am why put yourself through the worry and the torment psychological torment at least physical perhaps youve proved all you had to all you wanted more than they expected give in dont be a fool youre not the heroic sort apply a bit of gamesense youve won all you ever needed to back out now and show them what you think of their stupid physical option their squalid bullying threats show them how little it really means but he wasnt going to he looked levelly into the apexs eyes and he knew he was going to keep playing he suspected he was going slightly mad but he wasnt going to give this up he would take this fabulous maniacal game by the scruff of the neck jump up on to it and hold on and see how far it would take him before it threw him off or turned and consumed him im willing he said eyes wide i believe you are a male yes gurgeh said his palms started to sweat my bet is castration removal of the male member and testes against apicial gelding on this one game on the board of origin do you accept i gurgeh swallowed but his mouth stayed dry it was absurd he was in no real danger the limiting factor would rescue him or he could just go through with it he would feel no pain and genitalia were some of the faster regrowing parts of the body but still the room seemed to warp and distort in front of him and he had a sudden sickening vision of cloying red liquid slowly staining black bubbling yes he blurted forcing it out yes he said to the adjudicator the two apices bowed and retreated you could call the ship now if you want flereimsaho said gurgeh stared at the screen in fact he was going to call the limiting factor but only to discuss his present rather poor position in the game not to scream for rescue he ignored the drone it was night and the day had gone badly for him bermoiya had played brilliantly and the newsservices were full of the game it was being hailed as a classic and once again gurgeh with bermoiya was sharing newsleaders with nicosar who was still trampling all over the opposition good though it was acknowledged to be pequil his arm still pinned up approached gurgeh in a subdued almost reverent way after the evening session and told him there was a special watch being kept on the module which would last until the game was over pequil was sure gurgeh was an honourable person but those engaging in physical bets were always discreetly watched and in gurgehs case this was being done by a highatmosphere ag cruiser one of a squadron which constantly patrolled the notquitespace above groasnachek the module would not be allowed to move from its position on the hotel roofgarden gurgeh wondered how bermoiya was feeling now he had noticed that the apex had said must when he stated his intention of using the physical option gurgeh had come to respect the apexs style of play and therefore bermoiya himself he doubted the judge had any great desire to use the option but the situation had grown serious for the empire it had assumed hed be beaten by now and based its strategy of exaggerating the threat he posed to them on that assumption this supposedly winning play was turning into a small disaster rumours were that heads had already rolled in the imperial office over the affair bermoiya would have been given his orders gurgeh had to be stopped gurgeh had checked on the fate the apex would suffer in the now unlikely event it was he and not gurgeh who lost apicial gelding meant the full and permanent removal of the reversible apex vagina and ovaries thinking about that considering what would be done to the steady stately judge if he lost gurgeh realised he hadnt properly thought through the implications of the physical option even if he did win how could he let another being be mutilated if bermoiya lost it would be the end of him career family everything the empire did not allow the regeneration or replacement of any wager lost body parts the judges loss would be permanent and possibly fatal suicide was not unknown in such cases perhaps it would be best if gurgeh did lose the trouble was he didnt want to he didnt feel any personal animosity towards bermoiya but he desperately wanted to win this game and the next one and the one after that he hadnt realised how seductive azad was when played in its home environment while it was technically the same game hed played on the limiting factor the whole feeling he had about it playing it where it was meant to be played was utterly different now he realised now he knew why the empire had survived because of the game azad itself simply produced an insatiable desire for more victories more power more territory more dominance flereimsaho stayed in the module that evening gurgeh contacted the ship and discussed his forlorn position in the game the ship could as usual see some unlikely ways out but they were ways hed already seen for himself recognising they were there was one thing though following them through on the board itself in the midst of play was another matter so the ship was no great help there gurgeh gave up analysing the game and asked the limiting factor what he could do about ameliorating the bet he had with bermoiya if unlikely though it was he won and it was the judge who had to face the surgeon the answer was nothing the bet was on and that was it neither of them could do anything they had to play to a finish if they both refused to play then they would both suffer the betpenalties jernau gurgeh the ship said sounding hesitant i need to know what you would like me to do if things go badly tomorrow gurgeh looked down hed been waiting for this you mean do i want you to come in and snatch me off here or go through with it and be picked up later with my tail but not much else between my legs and wait for everything to regrow but of course having kept the culture sweet with the empire in the process he didnt try to disguise the sarcasm in his voice more or less the ship said after the delay the problem is while it would cause less of a fuss if you did go through with it ill have to displace or destroy your genitals anyway if they are removed the empire would have access to rather too much information about us if they did a full analysis gurgeh almost laughed youre saying my balls are some sort of state secret effectively so were going to annoy the empire anyway even if you do let them operate on you gurgeh was still thinking even after the delayed signal arrived he curled his tongue in his mouth feeling the tiny lump under the soft tissue ah fuck it he said eventually watch the game if ive definitely lost ill try and hold out for as long as possible somewhere anywhere when im obviously doing that come in zap us off here and make my apologies to contact if i just cave in let it happen ill see how i feel tomorrow very well the ship said while gurgeh sat stroking his beard thinking that if nothing else hed been given the choice but if they hadnt been going to remove the evidence and possibly cause a diplomatic incident anyway would contact have been so accommodating it didnt matter but he knew in his heart after that conversation hed lost the will to win the ship had more news it had just received a signal from chamlis amalkney promising a longer message soon but for the mean time just letting him know that olz hap had finally done it shed achieved a full web a culture player had at last produced the ultimate stricken result the young lady was the toast of chiark and the culture gameplayers chamlis had already congratulated her on gurgehs behalf but expected hed want to send her a signal of his own it wished him well gurgeh switched the screen off and sat back he sat and stared at the blank space for a while unsure what to know or think or remember or even be a sad smile touched one side of his face for a while flereimsaho floated over to his shoulder jernau gurgeh are you tired he turned to it eventually what yes a little he stood up stretched doubt ill sleep much though i thought that might be the case i wondered if you would like to come with me what to look at birds i dont think so drone thanks anyway i wasnt thinking of our feathered friends actually i have not always gone to watch them when ive gone out at nights sometimes i went to different parts of the city to look for whatever species of birds might be there at first but later because well because gurgeh frowned why do you want me to come with you because we might be leaving here rather quickly tomorrow and it occurred to me that youve seen very little of the city gurgeh waved one hand za showed me quite enough of that i doubt he showed you what im thinking of there are many different things to see im not interested in seeing the sights drone the sights im thinking of will interest you would they now i believe so i think i know you well enough to tell please come jernau gurgeh youll be glad i swear please come you did say you wouldnt sleep didnt you well then what do you have to lose the drones fields were their normal greenyellow colour quiet and controlled its voice was low serious the mans eyes narrowed what are you up to drone please please come with me gurgeh the drone floated off towards the nose of the module gurgeh stood watching it it stopped by the door from the lounge please jernau gurgeh i swear you wont regret this gurgeh shrugged yeah yeah all right he shook his head lets go out to play he muttered to himself he followed the drone as it moved towards the module nose there was a compartment there with a couple of ag bikes a few floater harnesses and some other pieces of equipment put on a harness please i wont be a moment the drone left gurgeh to fasten the ag harness on over his shorts and shirt it reappeared shortly afterwards holding a long black hooded cloak now put this on please gurgeh put the cloak on over the harness flereimsaho shoved the hood up over his head and tied it so that gurgehs face was hidden from the sides and in deep shadow from the front the harness didnt show beneath the thick material the lights in the compartment dimmed and went out and gurgeh heard something move overhead he looked up to see a square of dim stars directly above him ill control your harness if thats all right with you the drone whispered gurgeh nodded he was lifted quickly into the darkness he did not dip again as hed expected but kept going up into the fragrant warmth of the city night the cloak fluttered quietly around him the city was a swirl of lights a seemingly neverending plain of scattered radiance the drone was a small still shadow by his shoulder they set out over the city they overflew roads and rivers and great buildings and domes ribbons and clumps and towers of light areas of vapour drifting over darkness and fire rearing towers where reflections burned and lights soared quivering stretches of dark water and broad dark parks of grass and trees finally they started to drop they landed in an area where there were relatively few lights dropping between two darkened windowless buildings his feet touched down in the dirt of an alley excuse me the drone said and nudged its way into the hood until it was floating upended by gurgehs left ear walk down here it whispered gurgeh walked down the alley he tripped over something soft and knew before he turned it was a body he looked closer at the bundle of rags which moved a little the person was curled up under tattered blankets head on a filthy sack he couldnt tell what sex it was the rags offered no clue ssh the drone said as he opened his mouth to speak that is just one of the loafers pequil was talking about somebody shifted off the land hes been drinking thats part of the smell the rest is him it was only then that gurgeh caught the stench rising from the still sleeping male he almost gagged leave him flereimsaho said they left the alley gurgeh had to step over another two sleeping people the street they found themselves on was dim and stank of something gurgeh suspected was supposed to be food a few people were walking about stoop a little the drone said youll pass for a minan disciple dressed like this but dont let the hood fall and dont stand upright gurgeh did as he was told as he walked up the street under the dim grainy flickering light of sporadic monochrome streetlamps he passed what looked like another drunk lying against a wall there was blood between the apexs less and a dark dried stream of it leading from his head gurgeh stopped dont bother came the little voice hes dying probably been in a fight the police dont come here too often and nobodys likely to call for medical aid hes obviously been robbed so theyd have to pay for the treatment themselves gurgeh looked round but there was nobody else near by the apexs eyelids fluttered briefly as though he was trying to open them the fluttering stopped there flereimsaho said quietly gurgeh continued up the street screams came from high up in a grimy housing block on the far side of the street just some apex beating up his woman you know for millennia females were thought to have no effect on the heredity of the children they bore theyve known for five hundred years that they do a viral dna analogue which alters the genes a womans impregnated with nevertheless under the law females are simply possessions the penalty for murdering a woman is a years hard labour for an apex a female who kills an apex is tortured to death over a period of days death by chemicals said to be one of the worst keep walking they came to an intersection with a busier street a male stood on the corner shouting in a dialect gurgeh didnt understand hes selling tickets for an execution the drone said gurgeh raised his eyebrows turned his head fractionally im serious flereimsaho said gurgeh shook his head all the same filling the middle of the street was a crowd of people the traffic only about half of it powered the rest humandriven was forced to mount the pavements gurgeh went to the back of the crowd thinking that with his greater height he would be able to see what was happening but he found people making way for him anyway drawing him closer to the centre of the crowd several young apices were attacking an old male lying on the ground the apices wore some sort of strange uniform though somehow gurgeh knew it was not an official uniform they kicked the old male with a sort of poised savagery as though the attack was some kind of competitive ballet of pain and they were being evaluated on artistic impression as well as the raw torment and physical injury inflicted in case you think this is staged in any way flereimsaho whispered it isnt these people arent paying anything to watch this either this is simply an old guy getting beaten up probably just for the sake of it and these people would rather watch than do anything to stop it as the drone spoke gurgeh realised he was at the front of the crowd two of the young apices looked up at him in a detached way gurgeh wondered what would happen now the two apices shouted at him then they turned and pointed him out to the others there were six of them they all stood ignoring the whimpering male on the ground behind them and looked steadily at gurgeh one of them the tallest undid something in the tight metallically decorated trousers he wore and hooked out the halfflaccid vagina in its turnedout position and with a wide smile first held it out to gurgeh then turned round waving it at the others in the crowd nothing more the young identically clad apices grinned at the people for a while then just walked away each stepped as though accidentally on the head of the crumpled old male on the ground the crowd started to drift off the old man lay on the roadway covered in blood a sliver of grey bone poked through the arm of the tattered coat he wore and there were teeth scattered on the road surface near his head one leg lay oddly the foot turned outwards slack looking he moaned gurgeh started forward and began to stoop do not touch him the drones voice stopped gurgeh like a brick wall if any of these people see your hands or face youre dead youre the wrong colour gurgeh listen a few hundred darkskinned babies are still born each year as the genes work themselves out theyre supposed to be strangled and their bodies presented to the eugenics council for a bounty but a few people risk death and bring them up blanching their skins as they grow older if anybody thought you were one especially in a disciples cloak theyd skin you alive gurgeh backed off kept his head down and stumbled off down the road the drone pointed out prostitutes mostly females who sold their sexual favours to apices for a few minutes or hours or for the night in some parts of the city the drone said as they travelled the dark streets there were apices who had lost limbs and could not afford grafted arms and legs amputated from criminals these apices hired their bodies to males gurgeh saw many cripples they sat on street corners selling trinkets playing music on scratchy squeaky instruments or just begging some were blind some had no arms some had no legs gurgeh looked at the damaged people and felt dizzy the gritty surface of the street beneath him seemed to tip and heave for a moment it was as though the city the planet the whole empire swirled around him in a frantic spinning tangle of nightmare shapes a constellation of suffering and anguish an infernal dance of agony and mutilation they passed garish shops full of brightly coloured rubbish staterun drug and alcohol stores stalls selling religious statues books artefacts and ceremonial paraphernalia kiosks vending tickets for executions amputations tortures and staged rapes mostly lost azad bodybets and hawkers selling lottery tickets brothel introductions and unlicensed drugs a groundvan passed full of police the nightly patrol a few of the hawkers scuttled into alleyways and a couple of kiosks slammed suddenly shut as the van drove by but opened again immediately afterwards in a tiny park they found an apex with two bedraggled males and a sicklooking female on long leads he was making them attempt tricks which they kept getting wrong a crowd stood round laughing at their antics the drone told him the trio were almost certainly mad and had nobody to pay for their stay in mental hospital so theyd been decitizenised and sold to the apex they watched the pathetic bedraggled creatures trying to climb lampposts or form a pyramid for a while then gurgeh turned away the drone told him one in ten of the people he passed on the street would be treated for mental illness at some point in their lives the figure was higher for males than for apices and higher for females than either the same applied to the rates of suicide which was illegal flereimsaho directed him to a hospital it was typical the drone said like the whole area it was about average for the greater city the hospital was run by a charity and many of the people working there were unpaid the drone told him everybody would assume he was a disciple there to see one of his flock but anyway the staff were too busy to stop and quiz everybody they saw in the place gurgeh walked through the hospital in a daze there were people with limbs missing as hed seen in the streets and there were people turned odd colours or covered with scabs and sores some were stickthin grey skin stretched over bone others lay gasping for breath or retching noisily behind thin screens moaning or mumbling or screaming he saw people still covered in blood waiting to be attended to people doubledup coughing blood into little bowls and others strapped into metal cots beating their heads on the sides saliva frothing over their lips everywhere there were people on bed after bed and cot after cot and mattress after mattress and everywhere too there were the enveloping odours of corrupting flesh harsh disinfectant and bodily wastes it was an averagebad night the drone informed him the hospital was a little more crowded than usual because several ships of the empires warwounded had come back recently from famous victories also it was the night when people got paid and didnt have to work the next day and so by tradition went out to get drunk and into fights then the machine started to reel off infantmortality rates and lifeexpectancy figures sex ratios types of diseases and their prevalence in the various strata of society average incomes the incidence of unemployment per capita income as a ratio of total population in given areas birthtax and deathtax and the penalties for abortion and illegitimate birth it talked about laws governing types of sexual congress about charitable payments and religious organisations running soup kitchens and night shelters and firstaid clinics about numbers and figures and statistics and ratios all the time and gurgeh didnt think he picked up a word of it he just wandered round the building for what seemed like hours then he saw a door and left he was standing in a small garden dark and dusty and deserted at the back of the hospital hemmed in on all sides yellow light from grimy windows spilled on to the grey grass and cracked pavingstones the drone said it still had things it wanted to show him it wanted him to see a place where downandouts slept it thought it could get him into a prison as a visitor i want to go back now he shouted throwing back the hood all right the drone said tugging the hood back up they lifted off going straight up for a long time before they started to head for the hotel and the module the drone said nothing gurgeh was silent too watching the great galaxy of lights that was the city as it passed beneath his feet they got back to the module the roofdoor opened for them as they fell and the lights came on after it closed again gurgeh stood for a while as the drone took the cloak from him and unclipped the ag harness slipping down off his shoulders the removal of the harness left him with an odd sensation of nakedness ive one more thing id like to show you the drone said it moved down the corridor to the module lounge gurgeh followed it flereimsaho floated in the centre of the room the screen was on showing an apex and a male copulating background music surged the setting was plush with cushions and thick drapes this is an imperial select channel the drone said level one mildly scrambled the scene switched then switched again each time showing a slightly different mix of sexual activity from solo masturbation through to groups involving all three azadian sexes this son of thing is restricted the drone said visitors arent supposed to see it the unscrambling apparatus is available for a price on the general market however now well see some level two channels these are restricted to the empires bureaucratic military religious and commercial upper echelons the screen went briefly hazy with a swirl of random colours then cleared to show some more azadians mostly naked or very scantily clad again the emphasis was on sexuality but there was another new element in what was happening many of the people wore very strange and uncomfortablelooking clothes and some were being tied up and beaten or put into various absurd positions in which they were sexually used females dressed in uniforms ordered males and apices around gurgeh recognised some of the uniforms as those worn by imperial navy officers others looked like exaggerations of more ordinary uniforms some of the apices were dressed in male clothes some in female dress apices were made to eat their own or somebody elses excreta or drink their urine the wastes of other panhuman species seemed to be particularly prized for this practice mouths and anuses animals and aliens were penetrated by males and apices aliens and animals were persuaded to mount the various sexes and objects some everyday some apparently specially made were used as phallic substitutes in every scene there was an element of gurgeh supposed it was dominance hed been only mildly surprised that the empire wanted to hide the material shown on the first level a people so concerned with rank and protocol and clothed dignity might well want to restrict such things harmless though they might be the second level was different he thought it gave the game away a little and he could understand them being embarrassed about it it was clear that the delight being taken in level two was not the vicarious pleasure of watching people enjoying themselves and identifying with them but in seeing people being humiliated while others enjoyed themselves at their expense level one had been about sex this was about something the empire obviously thought more of but could not disentangle from that act now level three the drone said gurgeh watched the screen flereimsaho watched gurgeh the mans eyes glittered in the screenlight unused photons reflecting from the halo of iris the pupils widened at first then shrank became pinpoints the drone waited for the wide staring eyes to fill with moisture for the tiny muscles around the eyes to flinch and the eyelids to close and the man to shake his head and turn away but nothing of the sort happened the screen held his gaze as though the infinitesimal pressure of light it spent upon the room had somehow reversed and so sucked the watching man forward to hold him teetering before the fall fixed and steady and pointed at the flickering surface like some longstilled moon the screams echoed through the lounge over its foamseats and couches and low tables the screams of apices men women children sometimes they were silenced quickly but usually not each instrument and each part of the tortured people made its own noise blood knives bones lasers flesh ripsaws chemicals leeches fleshworms vibraguns even phalluses fingers and claws each made or produced their own distinctive sounds counterpoints to the theme of screams the final scene the man watched featured a psychotic male criminal previously injected with massive doses of sex hormones and hallucinogens a knife and a woman described as an enemy of the state who was pregnant and just before term the eyes closed his hands went to his ears he looked down enough he muttered flereimsaho switched the screen off the man rocked backwards on his heels as though there had indeed been some attraction some artificial gravity from the screen and now that it had ceased he almost overbalanced in reaction that one is live jernau gurgeh it is taking place now it is still happening deep in some cellar under a prison or a police barracks gurgeh looked up at the blank screen eyes still wide and staring but dry he gazed rocked backwards and forwards and breathed deeply there was sweat on his brow and he shivered level three is for the ruling elite only their strategic military signals are given the same encrypting status i think you can see why this is no special night gurgeh no festival of sadoerotica these things go out every evening there is more but youve seen a representative crosssection gurgeh nodded his mouth was dry he swallowed with some difficulty took a few more deep breaths rubbed his beard he opened his mouth to speak but the drone spoke first one other thing something else they kept from you i didnt know this myself until last night when the ship mentioned it ever since you played ram your opponents have been on various drugs as well cortexkeyed amphetamines at least but they have far more sophisticated drugs which they use too they have to inject or ingest them they dont have genofixed glands to manufacture drugs in their own bodies but they certainly use them most of the people youve been playing have had far more artificial chemicals and compounds in their bloodstream than youve had the drone made a sighing noise the man was still staring at the dead screen thats it the drone said im sorry if what ive shown you has upset you jernau gurgeh but i didnt want you to leave here thinking the empire was just a few venerable gameplayers some impressive architecture and a few glorified nightclubs what youve seen tonight is also what its about and theres plenty in between that i cant show you all the frustrations that affect the poor and the relatively welloff alike caused simply because they live in a society where one is not free to do as one chooses theres the journalist who cant write what he knows is the truth the doctor who cant treat somebody in pain because theyre the wrong sex a million things every day things that arent as melodramatic and gross as what ive shown you but which are still part of it still some of the effects the ship told you a guilty system recognises no innocents id say it does it recognises the innocence of a young child for example and you saw how they treated that in a sense it even recognises the sanctity of the body but only to violate it once again gurgeh it all boils down to ownership possession about taking and having flereimsaho paused then floated towards gurgeh came very close to him ah but im preaching again arent i the excesses of youth ive kept you up late maybe youre ready for some sleep now its been a long night hasnt it ill leave you it turned and floated away it stopped near the door again good night it said gurgeh cleared his throat good night he said looking away from the dark screen at last the drone dipped and disappeared gurgeh sat down on a formseat he stared at his feet for a while then got up and walked outside the module into the roofgarden the dawn was just coming up the city looked washedout somehow and cold the many lights burned weakly brilliance sapped by the calm blue vastness of the sky a guard at the stairwell entrance coughed and stamped his feet though gurgeh could not see him he went back into the module and lay down on his bed he lay in the darkness without closing his eyes then closed his eyes and turned over trying to sleep he could not and neither could he bring himself to secrete something that would make him sleep at last he got up and went back to the lounge where the screen was he had the module access the gamechannels and sat there looking at his own game with bermoiya for a long time without moving or speaking and without a single molecule of glanded drug in his bloodstream a prison ambulance stood outside the conferencecentre gurgeh got out of the aircraft and walked straight into the gamehall pequil had to run to keep up with the man the apex didnt understand the alien he hadnt wanted to talk during the journey from the hotel to the conferencecentre whereas usually people in such a situation couldnt stop talking and somehow he didnt seem to be frightened at all though pequil couldnt see how that could be if he hadnt known the awkward rather innocent alien better hed have thought it was anger he could read on that discoloured hairy pointed face lo prinest bermoiya sat in a stoolseat just off the board of origin gurgeh stood on the board itself he rubbed his beard with one long finger then moved a couple of pieces bermoiya made his own moves then when the action spread as the alien tried desperately to wriggle out of his predicament the judge had some amateur players make most of his moves for him the alien remained on the board making his own moves scurrying to and fro like a giant dark insect bermoiya couldnt see what the alien was playing at his play seemed to be without purpose and he made some moves which were either stupid mistakes or pointless sacrifices bermoiya mopped up some of the aliens tattered forces after a while he thought perhaps the male did have a plan of sorts but if so it must be a very obscure one perhaps there was some kind of odd facesaving point the male was trying to make while he still was a male who knew what strange precepts governed an aliens behaviour at such a moment the moves went on inchoate unreadable they broke for lunch they resumed bermoiya didnt return to the stoolseat after the break he stood at the side of the board trying to work out what slippery ungraspable plan the alien might have it was like playing a ghost now it was as though they were competing on separate boards he couldnt seem to get to grips with the male at all his pieces kept slipping away from him moving as though the man had anticipated his next move before hed even thought of it what had happened to the alien hed played quite differently yesterday was he really receiving help from outside bermoiya felt himself start to sweat there was no need for it he was still well ahead still poised for victory but suddenly he began to sweat he told himself it was nothing to worry about a sideeffect of some of the concentration boosters hed taken over lunch bermoiya made some moves which ought to settle what was going on expose the aliens real plan if he had one no result bermoiya tried some more exploratory gestures committing a little more to the attempt gurgeh attacked immediately bermoiya had spent a hundred years learning and playing azad and hed sat in courts of every level for half that time hed seen many violent outbursts by justsentenced criminals and watched and even taken part in games containing moves of great suddenness and ferocity nevertheless the aliens next few moves contrived to be on a level more barbarous and wild than anything bermoiya had witnessed in either context without the experience of the courts he felt he might have physically reeled those few moves were like a series of kicks in the belly they contained all the berserk energy the very best young players spasmodically exhibited but marshalled synchronised sequenced and unleashed with a style and a savage grace no untamed beginner could have hoped to command with the first move bermoiya saw what the aliens plan might be with the next move he saw how good the plan was with the next that the play might go on into the following day before the alien could finally be vanquished with the next that he bermoiya wasnt in quite as unassailable a position as hed thought and with the following two that he still had a lot of work to do and then that perhaps the play wouldnt last until tomorrow after all bermoiya made his own moves again trying every ploy and stratagem hed learned in a century of gameplaying the disguised observation piece the feintwithinthefeint using attackpieces and cardstock the premature use of the board of becoming element pieces making a swamp on the territories by the conjunction of earth and water but nothing worked he stood just before the break at the end of the afternoon session and he looked at the alien the hall was silent the alien male stood in the middle of the board staring impassively at some minor piece rubbing at the hair on his face he looked calm unperturbed bermoiya surveyed his own position everything was in a mess there was nothing he could do now beyond redemption it was like some badly prepared fundamentally flawed case or some piece of equipment threequarters destroyed there was no saving it better to throw it out and start again but there was no starting again he was going to be taken out of here and taken to hospital and spayed he was going to lose that which made him what he was and he would never be allowed to have it back gone for ever for ever bermoiya couldnt hear the people in the hall he couldnt see them either or see the board beneath his feet all he could see was the alien male standing tall and insectlike with his sharpfeatured face and his angular body and stroking his furred face with one long dark finger the twopart nails at its tip showing the lighter skin beneath how could he look so unconcerned bermoiya fought the urge to scream a great breath surged out of him he thought how easy this had all looked this morning how fine it had felt that not only would he be going to the fire planet for the final games but also that he would be doing the imperial office a great favour at the same time now he thought that perhaps they had always known this might happen and they wanted him humiliated and brought down for some reason he could not know because he had always been loyal and conscientious a mistake it had to be a mistake but why now he thought why now why this time of all times why this way for this bet why had they wanted him to do this thing and make this wager when he had within him the seed of a child why the alien rubbed his furry face pursed his strange lips as he looked down at some point on the board bermoiya began to stumble towards the male oblivious of the obstacles in his way trampling the biotechs and the other pieces under his feet and crashing over the raised pyramids of higher ground the male looked round at him as though seeing him for the first time bermoiya felt himself stop he gazed into the alien eyes and saw nothing no pity no compassion no spirit of kindness or sorrow he looked into those eyes and at first he thought of the look criminals had sometimes when theyd been sentenced to a quick death it was a look of indifference not despair not hatred but something flatter and more terrifying than either a look of resignation of allhopegone a flag hoisted by a soul that no longer cared yet although in that instant of recognition the doomed convict was the first image bermoiya clutched at he knew immediately it was not the fit one he did not know what the fit one was perhaps it was unknowable then he knew and suddenly for the first time in his life he understood what it was for the condemned to look into his eyes he fell to his knees at first thudding down on to the board cracking raised areas then forward on to his face eyes level with the board seeing it from the ground at last he closed his eyes the adjudicator and his helpers came over to him and gently lifted him paramedics strapped him to the stretcher sobbing quietly and carried him outside to the prison ambulance pequil stood amazed he had never thought he would see an imperial judge break down like that and in front of the alien he had to run after the dark man he was striding back out of the hall as quickly and quietly as hed arrived ignoring the hisses and shouts from the public galleries around him they were in the aircar before even the press could catch up speeding away from the gamehall gurgeh pequil realised had not said a single word the whole time theyd been in the hall flereimsaho watched the man it had expected more of a reaction but he did nothing except sit at the screen watching replays of all the games hed played since hed arrived he wouldnt talk he would be going to echronedal now along with a hundred and nineteen other fourthround singlegame winners as was usual after a bet of such severity had been honoured the family of the now mutilated bermoiya had resigned for him without moving a piece on either of the two remaining great boards gurgeh had won the match and his place on the fire planet some twenty days remained between the end of gurgehs game against bermoiya and the date when the imperial courts fleet departed for the twelveday journey to echronedal gurgeh had been invited to spend part of that time at an estate owned by hamin the rector of the ruling college of candsev and mentor to the emperor flereimsaho had advised against it but gurgeh had accepted they would leave tomorrow for the estate a few hundred kilometres distant on an island in an inland sea gurgeh was taking what the drone believed was an unhealthy even perverse interest in what the news and pressagencies were saying about him the man seemed actually to relish the calumnies and invective poured upon him following his win over bermoiya sometimes he smiled when he read or heard what they said about him especially when the newsreaders in shocked reverent tones related what the alien gurgey had caused to be done to lo prinest bermoiya a gentle lenient judge with five wives and two husbands though no children gurgeh had also started to watch the channels which showed the imperial troops crushing the savages and infidels it was civilising in distant parts of the empire he had the module unscramble the higherlevel military broadcasts which the services put out it seemed in a spirit of competition with the courts more highly encrypted entertainment channels the military broadcasts showed scenes of alien executions and tortures some showed the buildings and artworks of the recalcitrant or rebellious species being blown up or burned things only very rarely shown on the standard newschannels if for no other reason than that all aliens were depicted as a matter of course as being uncivilised monsters docile simpletons or greedy and treacherous subhumans all categories incapable of producing high art and genuine civilisation sometimes where physically possible azadian males though never apices were shown raping the savages it upset flereimsaho that gurgeh should enjoy watching such things especially as it had been instrumental in introducing him to the scrambled broadcasts in the first place but at least he didnt appear to find the sights sexually stimulating he didnt dwell on them the way the drone knew azadians tended to he looked registered then flicked away again he still spent the majority of his time staring at the games shown on the screen but the coded signals and his own bad press kept drawing him back time and again like a drug but i dont like rings it isnt a question of what you like jernau gurgeh when you go to hamins estate youll be outside this module i might not always be close by and anyway im not a specialist in toxicology youll be eating their food and drinking their drink and they have some very clever chemists and exobiologists but if you wear one of these on each hand index finger preferably you should be safe from poisoning if you feel a single jab it means a nonlethal drug such as a hallucinogen three jabs means somebodys out to waste you what do two jabs mean i dont know a malfunction probably now will you put them on they really dont suit me would a shroud they feel funny never mind if they work how about a magic amulet to ward off bullets are you serious i mean if you are there is a passivesensor impactshield jewellery set on board but theyd probably use crews gurgeh waved one ringed hand oh never mind he sat down again turning on a militaryexecution channel the drone found it difficult to talk to the man he wouldnt listen it attempted to explain that despite all the horrors he had seen in the city and on the screen there was still nothing the culture could do that wouldnt do more harm than good it tried to tell him that the contact section the whole culture in fact was like him dressed in his cloak and standing unable to help the man lying injured in the street that they had to stick to their disguise and wait until the moment was right but either its arguments werent getting through to him or that wasnt what the man was thinking about because he made no response and wouldnt enter into a discussion about it flereimsaho didnt go out much during the days between the end of the game with bermoiya and the journey to hamins estate instead it stayed in with the man worrying mr gurgeh i am pleased to meet you the old apex put out his hand gurgeh grasped it i hope you had a pleasant flight here yes we did thank you gurgeh said they stood on the roof of a low building set in luxuriant green vegetation and looking out over the calm waters of the inland sea the house was almost submerged in the burgeoning greenery only the roof was fully clear of the swaying treetops near by were paddocks full of riding animals and from the various levels of the house long sweeping gantries elegant and slim soared out through the crowding trunks above the shady forest floor giving access to the golden beaches and the pavilions and summerhouses of the estate in the sky huge sunlit clouds piled sparkling over the distant mainland you say we hamin said as they walked across the roof and liveried males took gurgehs baggage from the aircraft the drone flereimsaho and i gurgeh said nodding to the bulky buzzing machine at his shoulder ah yes the old apex laughed bald head reflecting the binary light the machine some people thought let you play so well they descended to a long balcony set with many tables where hamin introduced gurgeh and the drone to various people mostly apices plus a few elegant females there was only one person gurgeh already knew the smiling lo shav olos put down a drink and rose from his table taking gurgehs hand mr gurgeh how good to see you again your luck held out and your skill increased a formidable achievement congratulations once again the apexs gaze flicked momentarily to gurgehs ringed fingers thank you it was at a price id have willingly forgone indeed you never cease to surprise us mr gurgeh im sure i shall eventually you are too modest olos smiled and sat down gurgeh declined the offer to visit his rooms and freshen up he felt perfectly fresh already he sat at a table with hamin some other directors of candsev college and a few court officials chilled wines and spiced snacks were served flereimsaho settled relatively quietly on the floor by gurgehs feet gurgehs new rings appeared to be happy there was nothing more damaging than alcohol in the fare being served the conversation mostly avoided gurgehs last game everyone pronounced his name correctly the college directors asked him about his unique gamestyle gurgeh answered as best he could the court officials inquired politely about his home world and he told them some nonsense about living on a planet they asked him about flereimsaho and gurgeh expected the machine to answer but it didnt so he told them the truth the machine was a person by the cultures definition it could do as it liked and it did not belong to him one tall and strikingly beautiful female a companion of lo shav olos whod come over to join their table asked the drone if its master played logically or not flereimsaho replied with a trace of weariness gurgeh suspected only he could detect that gurgeh was not its master and that it supposed he thought more logically than it did when he was playing games but that anyway it knew very little about azad they all found this most amusing hamin stood then and suggested that his stomach with over two and a half centuries of experience behind it could tell it was approaching time for dinner better than any servants clock people laughed and gradually began to depart the long balcony hamin escorted gurgeh to his room personally and told him a servant would let him know when the meal was to be served i wish i knew why they invited you here flereimsaho said quickly unpacking gurgehs few cases while the man looked out of the window at the still trees and the calm sea perhaps they want to recruit me for the empire what do you think drone would i make a good general dont be facetious jernau gurgeh the drone switched to marain and not to forget random domran here bugged are we nonsense wonsense gurgeh looked concerned and said in eächic heavens drone are you developing a speech impediment gurgeh the drone hissed setting out some clothes the empire deemed suitable to be worn when eating gurgeh turned away smiling maybe they just want to kill me i wonder if they want any help gurgeh laughed and came over to the bed where the drone had laid out the formal clothing itll be all right so you say but we havent even got the protection of the module here let alone anything else but lets not worry about it gurgeh picked up a couple of the robepieces and tried them against his body holding them under his chin and looking down im not worried anyway he said the drone shouted at him in exasperation oh jernau gurgeh how many times do i have to tell you you cannot wear red and green together like that you like music mr gurgeh hamin asked leaning over to the man gurgeh nodded well a little does no harm hamin sat back apparently satisfied with this answer they had climbed to the broad roofgarden after dinner which had been a long complicated and very filling affair during which naked females had danced in the centre of the room and if gurgehs rings were to be believed nobody had tried to interfere with his food it was dusk now and the party was outside in the warm evening air listening to the wailing music produced by a group of apex musicians slender gantries led from the garden into the tall graceful trees gurgeh sat at a small table with hamin and olos flereimsaho sat near his feet lamps shone in the trees around them the roofgarden was its own island of light in the night surrounded by the cries of birds and animals calling out as though in answer to the music i wonder mr gurgeh hamin said sipping his drink and lighting a long smallbowled pipe did you find any of our dancing girls attractive he pulled on the longstemmed pipe then with the smoke wreathing around his bald head went on i only ask because one of them she with the silver streak in her hair remember did express rather an interest in you im sorry i hope im not shocking you mr gurgeh am i not in the least well i just wanted to say youre amongst friends here yes youve more than proved yourself in the game and this is a very private place outside the gaze of the press and the common people who of course have to depend on certain hard and fast rules whereas we do not not here you catch my drift you may relax in confidence im most grateful i shall certainly try to relax but i was told before i came here that i would be found ugly even disfigured by your people your kindness overwhelms me but i would prefer not to inflict myself on somebody who might not be available through choice alone too modest again jernau gurgeh olos smiled hamin nodded puffing on his pipe you know mr gurgeh i have heard that in your culture you have no laws i am sure this is an exaggeration but there must be a grain of truth in the assertion and i would guess you must find the number and strictness of our laws to be a great difference between your society and ours here we have many rules and try to live according to the laws of god game and empire but one of the advantages of having laws is the pleasure one may take in breaking them we here are not children mr gurgeh hamin waved the pipestem round the tables of people rules and laws exist only because we take pleasure in doing what they forbid but as long as most of the people obey such proscriptions most of the time they have done their job blind obedience would imply we are ha hamin chuckled and pointed at the drone with the pipe no more than robots flereimsaho buzzed a little louder but only momentarily there was silence gurgeh drank from his glass olos and hamin exchanged looks jernau gurgeh olos said at last rolling his glass round in his hands lets be frank youre an embarrassment to us youve done very much better than we expected we did not think we could be so easily fooled but somehow you did it i congratulate you on whatever ruse it was you used whether it centred on your drugglands your machine there or simply many more years playing azad than you admitted to you have bettered us and were impressed i am only sorry that innocent people such as those bystanders who were shot instead of you and lo prinest bermoiya had to be hurt as you have no doubt guessed we would like you to go no further in the game now the imperial office has nothing to do with the games bureau so there is little we can do directly we do have a suggestion though whats that gurgeh sipped his drink as ive been saying hamin pointed the stem of the pipe at gurgeh we have many laws we therefore have many crimes some of these are of a sexual nature yes gurgeh looked down at his drink i need hardly point out hamin continued that the physiology of our race makes us unusual one might almost say gifted in that respect also in our society it is possible to control people it is possible to make somebody or even several people do things they might not want to do we can offer you here the sort of experience which by your own admission would be impossible on your own world the old apex leant closer dropping his voice can you imagine what it might be like to have several females and males even apices if you like who will do your every bidding hamin knocked his pipe out on the table leg the ash drifted over the humming bulk of flereimsaho the rector of candsev college smiled in a conspiratorial way and sat back repacking his pipe from a small pouch olos leant forward this whole island is yours for as long as you want it jernau gurgeh you may have as many people of whatever sexual mix as you like for as long as you desire but i pull out of the game you retire yes olos said hamin nodded there are precedents the whole island gurgeh made a show of looking around the gently lit roofgarden a troupe of dancers appeared the lithe skimpilydressed men women and apices made their way up some steps to a small stage raised behind the musicians everything olos said the island house servants dancers everything and everyone gurgeh nodded but didnt say anything hamin relit his pipe even the band he said coughing he waved at the musicians what do you think of their instruments mr gurgeh do they not sound sweet very pleasant gurgeh drank a little watching the dancers arrange themselves on stage even there though hamin said you are missing something you see we gain a great deal of pleasure from knowing at what cost this music is bought you see the stringed instrument the one on the left with the eight strings gurgeh nodded hamin said i can tell you that each of those steel strings has strangled a man you see that white pipe at the back played by the male the pipe shaped like a bone hamlin laughed a females femur removed without anaesthetic naturally gurgeh said and took a few sweettasting nuts from a bowl on the table do they come in matched pairs or are there a lot of onelegged lady music critics hamin smiled you see he said to olos he does appreciate the old apex gestured back at the band behind whom the dancers were now arranged ready to start their performance the drums are made from human skin you can see why each set is called a family the horizontal percussion instrument is constructed from finger bones and well there are other instruments but can you understand now why that music sounds so precious to those of us who know what has gone into the making of it oh yes gurgeh said the dancers began fluid practised they impressed almost immediately some must have worn ag units floating through the air like huge diaphanously slow birds good hamin nodded you see gurgeh one can be on either side in the empire one can be the player or one can be played upon hamin smiled at what was a play on words in eächic and to some extent in marain too gurgeh watched the dancers for a moment without looking away from them he said ill play rector on echronedal he tapped one ring on the rim of his glass in time to the music hamin sighed well i have to tell you jernau gurgeh that we are worried he pulled on the pipe again studied the glowing bowl worried about the effect your getting any further in the game would have on the morale of our people so many of them are just simple folk it is our duty to shield them from the harsh realities sometimes and what harsher reality can there be than the realisation that most of ones kin are gullible cruel and foolish they would not understand that a stranger an alien can come here and do so well at the holy game we here those of us in the court and the colleges might not be so concerned but we have to keep the ordinary decent i would even go as far as to say innocent people in mind mr gurgeh and what we have to do in that respect what we sometimes have to take responsibility for does not always make us happy but we know our duty and we will do it for them and for our emperor hamin leant forward again we dont intend to kill you mr gurgeh though im told there are factions in the court whod like nothing better and they say people in the security services easily capable of doing so no nothing so gross but the old apex sucked on the thin pipe producing a gentle papping noise gurgeh waited hamin pointed the stem at him again i have to tell you gurgeh that no matter how you do in the first game on echronedal it will be announced that you have been defeated we have unequivocal control of the communications and newsservices on the fire planet and as far as the press and the public will be concerned you will be knocked out in the first round there we will do whatever has to be done to make it appear that that is exactly what has in fact happened you are free to tell people ive told you this and free to claim whatever you want after the event you will be ridiculed though and what i have described will happen anyway the truth has already been decided oloss turn so you see gurgeh you may go to echronedal but to certain defeat absolutely certain defeat go as a highclass tourist if you want or stay here and enjoy yourself as our guest but there is no longer any point in playing hmm gurgeh said the dancers were slowly losing their clothes as they stripped each other some of them still dancing were at the same time contriving to stroke and touch each other in an exaggeratedly sexual way gurgeh nodded ill think about it then he smiled at the two apices id like to see your fire planet all the same he drank from the cool glass and watched the slow buildup of erotic choreography behind the musicians other than that though i cant imagine ill be trying too terribly hard hamin was studying his pipe olos looked very serious gurgeh held out his hands in a gesture of resigned helplessness what more can i say would you be prepared to cooperate though olos said gurgeh looked inquisitive olos reached slowly over and tapped the rim of gurgehs glass something that would ring true he said softly gurgeh watched the two apices exchange glances he waited for them to make their play documentary evidence hamin said after a moment talking to his pipe film of you looking worried over a bad boardposition maybe even an interview we could arrange these things without your cooperation naturally but it would be easier less fraught for all concerned with your aid the old apex sucked on his pipe olos drank glancing at the romantic antics of the dance troupe gurgeh looked surprised you mean lie participate in the construction of your false reality our real reality gurgeh olos said quietly the official version the one that will have documentary evidence to support it the one that will be believed gurgeh grinned broadly id be delighted to help of course i shall regard it as a challenge to produce a definitively abject interview for popular consumption ill even help you work out positions so awful even i cant get out of them he raised his glass to them after all its the game that matters is it not hamin snorted his shoulders shook he sucked on the pipe again and through a veil of smoke said no true gameplayer could say more he patted gurgeh on the shoulder mr gurgeh even if you choose not to avail yourself of the facilities my house has to offer i hope youll stay with us for a while i should enjoy talking with you will you stay why not gurgeh said and he and hamin raised their glasses to each other olos sat back laughing silently together the three turned to watch the dancers who had now formed a copulatorily complicated pattern of bodies in a carnal jigsaw still keeping gurgeh was impressed to note to the beat of the music he stayed at the house for the next fifteen days he talked guardedly with the old rector during that time he still felt they didnt really know each other when he left but perhaps they knew a little more of each others societies hamin obviously found it hard to believe the culture really did do without money but what if i do want something unreasonable what my own planet hamin wheezed with laughter how can you own a planet gurgeh shook his head but supposing i wanted one i suppose if you found an unoccupied one you could land without anybody becoming annoyed perhaps that would work but how would you stop other people landing there too could i not buy a fleet of warships all our ships are sentient you could certainly try telling a ship what to do but i dont think youd get very far your ships think theyre sentient hamin chuckled a common delusion shared by some of our human citizens hamin found the cultures sexual mores even more fascinating he was at once delighted and outraged that the culture regarded homosexuality incest sexchanging hermaphrodicy and sexual characteristic alteration as just something else people did like going on a cruise or changing their hairstyle hamin thought this must take all the fun out of things didnt the culture forbid anything gurgeh attempted to explain there were no written laws but almost no crime anyway there was the occasional crime of passion as hamin chose to call it but little else it was difficult to get away with anything anyway when everybody had a terminal but there were very few motives left too but if someone kills somebody else gurgeh shrugged theyre slapdroned ah this sounds more like it what does this drone do follows you around and makes sure you never do it again is that all what more do you want social death hamin you dont get invited to too many parties ah but in your culture cant you gatecrash i suppose so gurgeh conceded but nobodyd talk to you as for what hamin told gurgeh about the empire it only made him appreciate what shohobohaum za had said that it was a gem however vicious and indiscriminate its cutting edges might be it was not so difficult to understand the warped view the azadians had of what they called human nature the phrase they used whenever they had to justify something inhuman and unnatural when they were surrounded and subsumed by the selfcreated monster that was the empire of azad and which displayed such a fierce instinct gurgeh could think of no other word for selfpreservation the empire wanted to survive it was like an animal a massive powerful body that would only let certain cells or viruses survive within it and as a matter of course killed off any and all others automatically and unthinkingly hamin himself used this analogy when he compared revolutionaries to cancer gurgeh tried to say that single cells were single cells while a conscious collection of hundreds of billions of them or a conscious device made from arrays of picocircuitry for that matter was simply incomparable but hamin refused to listen it was gurgeh not he whod missed the point the rest of the time gurgeh spent walking in the forest or swimming in the warm slack sea the slow rhythm of hamins house was built around meals and gurgeh learned to take great care in dressing for these eating them talking to the guests old and new as people came and went and relaxing afterwards bloated and spacy continuing to talk and watching the deliberate entertainment of usually erotic dances and the involuntary cabaret of changing sexual alliances amongst the guests dancers servants and house staff gurgeh was enticed many times but never tempted he found the azadian females more and more attractive all the time and not just physically but used his genofixed glands in a negative even contrary way to stay carnally sober in the midst of the subtly exhibited orgy around him a pleasant enough few days the rings did not jab him and nobody shot at him he and flereimsaho got back safely to the module on the roof of the grand hotel a couple of days before the imperial fleet was due to depart for echronedal gurgeh and the drone would have preferred to take the module which was perfectly capable of making the crossing by itself but contact had forbidden that the effect on the admiralty of discovering that something no larger than a lifeboat could outstrip their battlecruisers was not something to be contemplated and the empire had refused permission for the alien machine to be conveyed inside an imperial craft so gurgeh would have to make the journey with the fleet like everybody else you think youve got problems flereimsaho said bitterly theyll be watching us all the time on the liner during the crossing and then once were in the castle that means ive got to stay inside this ridiculous disguise all day and all night until the games are over why couldnt you have lost in the first round like you were supposed to we could have told them where to insert their fire planet and been back on a gsv by now oh shut up machine as it turned out they neednt have returned to the module there was nothing more to take or pack he stood in the small lounge fiddling with the orbital bracelet on his wrist and realising he was looking forward to the coming games on echronedal more than he had any of the others the pressure would be off he wouldnt have to face the opprobrium of the press and the empires ghastly general public he could cooperate with the empire to produce a convincing piece of fake news and the likelihood of more physical option bets had thereby been reduced almost to zero he was going to enjoy himself flereimsaho was glad to see the man was getting over the effects of seeing behind the screen the empire showed its guests he was much as hed been before and the days at hamins estate seemed to have relaxed him it could see a small change in him though something it could not quite pin down but which it knew was there they didnt see shohobohaum za again hed left on a tour upcountry wherever that was he sent his regards and a message in marain to the effect that if gurgeh could lay his mitts on some fresh grif before they left gurgeh asked the module about the girl hed met at the grand ball months earlier he couldnt remember her name but if the module could provide a list of the females whod survived the first round he was sure hed recognise hers the module got confused but flereimsaho told them both to forget it no women had made it to the second round pequil came with them to the shuttleport his arm was fully healed gurgeh and flereimsaho bade farewell to the module it climbed into the sky for a rendezvous with the distant limiting factor they said goodbye to pequil too he took gurgehs hand in both of his and then the man and the drone boarded the shuttle gurgeh watched groasnachek as it fell away beneath them the city tilted as he was thrown back into his seat the whole view swung and juddered as the shuttlecraft powered into the hazy skies gradually all the patterns and the shapes came out revealed for a while before the increasing distance the citys own vapours dust and grime and the altering angle of their climb took it all away for all the jumble it looked momentarily peaceful and ordered in its parts the distance made its individual local confusions and dislocations disappear and from a certain height where little ever dallied and almost everything just passed through it looked exactly like a great mindless spreading organism machina ex machina so far so average our gameplayers lucked out again i guess you can see hes a changed man though these humans im going to be consistent however i havent told you who i am so far and im not going to tell you now either maybe later maybe does identity matter anyway i have my doubts we are what we do not what we think only the interactions count there is no problem with free will here thats not incompatible with believing your actions define you and what is free will anyway chance the random factor if one is not ultimately predictable then of course thats all it can be i get so frustrated with people who cant see this even a human should be able to understand its obvious the result is what matters not how its achieved unless of course the process of achieving is itself a series of results what difference does it make whether a minds made up of enormous squidgy animal cells working at the speed of sound in air or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence at lightspeed lets not even think about a mind mind each is a machine each is an organism each fulfils the same task just matter switching energy of one sort or another switches memory the random element that is chance and that is called choice common denominators all i say again you is what you done dynamic misbehaviourism thats my creed gurgeh his switches are working funny hes thinking differently acting uncharacteristically he is a different person hes seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide and he just took it personally and took his revenge now hes spaceborne again head crammed full of azad rules his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling switching patterns of that seductive encompassing feral set of rules and possibilities and being carted through space towards the empires most creakily symbolic shrine echronedal the place of the standing wave of flame the fire planet but will our hero prevail can he possibly prevail and what would constitute winning anyway how much has the man still got to learn what will he make of such knowledge more to the point what will it make of him wait and see itll work itself out in time take it from there maestro echronedal was twenty light years from eä halfway there the imperial fleet left the region of dust that lay between eäs system and the direction of the main galaxy and so that vast armed spiral was spread over half the sky like a million jewels caught in a whirlpool gurgeh was impatient to get to the fire planet the journey seemed to take for ever and the liner he was making it on was hopelessly cramped he spent most of the time in his cabin the bureaucrats imperial officials and other gameplayers on the ship regarded him with undisguised dislike and apart from a couple of shuttle trips over to the battlecruiser invincible the imperial flag ship for receptions gurgeh didnt socialise the crossing was made without incident and after twelve days they arrived over echronedal a planet orbiting a yellow dwarf in a fairly ordinary system and itself a humanhabitable world with only one peculiarity it was not unusual to find distinct equatorial bulges on once fastspinning planets and echronedals was comparatively slight though sufficient to produce a single unbroken continental ribbon of land lying roughly between the planets tropics the rest of the globe lying beneath two great oceans icecapped at the poles what was unique in the experience of the culture as well as the empire was to discover a wave of fire forever moving round the planet on the continental landmass taking about half a standard year to complete its circumnavigation the fire swept over the land its fringes brushing the shores of the two oceans its wavefront a nearstraight line its flames consuming the growth of the plants which had flourished in the ashes of the previous blaze the whole landbased ecosystem had evolved around this neverending conflagration some plants could only sprout from beneath the stillwarm cinders their seeds jolted into development by the passing heat other plants blossomed just before the fire arrived bursting into rapid growth just before the flames found them and using the firefronts thermals to transport their seeds into the upper atmosphere to fall back again somewhere on to the ash the landanimals of echronedal fell into three categories some kept constantly on the move maintaining the same steady walking pace as the fire some swam round its oceanic boundaries while other species burrowed into the ground hid in caves or survived through a variety of mechanisms in lakes or rivers birds circled the world like a jetstream of feathers the blaze remained little more than a large continuous bushfire for eleven revolutions on the twelfth it changed the cinderbud was a tall skinny plant which grew quickly once its seeds had germinated it developed an armoured base and shot up to a height of ten metres or more in the two hundred days it had before the flames came round again when the fire did arrive the cinderbud didnt burn it closed its leafy head until the blaze had passed then kept on growing in the ashes after eleven of those great months eleven baptisms in the flames the cinderbuds were great trees anything up to seventy metres in height their own chemistry then produced first the oxygen season and then the incandescence and in that sudden cycle the fire didnt walk it sprinted it was no longer a wide but low and even mild bushfire it was an inferno lakes disappeared rivers dried rocks crumbled in its baking heat every animal that had evolved its own way of dodging or keeping pace with the fires of the great months had had to find another method of surviving running fast enough to build up a sufficient lead on the incandescence to still keep ahead of it swimming far out into the ocean or to the few mostly small islands off the coasts or hibernating deep in great cavesystems or on the beds of deep rivers lakes and fjords plants too switched to new survival mechanisms rooting deeper growing thicker seedcases or equipping their thermalseeds for higher longer flight and the baked ground they would encounter on landing for a great month thereafter the planet its atmosphere choked with smoke soot and ash wavered on the edge of catastrophe as smoke clouds blocked out the sun and the temperature plummeted then slowly while the diminished small fire continued on its way the atmosphere cleared the animals started to breed again the plants grew once more and the little cinderbuds started sprouting through the ashes from the old root complexes the empires castles on echronedal extravagantly sprinklered and doused had been built to survive whatever terrible heat and screaming winds the planets bizarre ecology could provide and it was in the greatest of those fortresses castle klaff that for the last three hundred standard years the final games of azad had been played timed to coincide whenever possible with the incandescence the imperial fleet arrived above echronedal in the middle of the oxygen season the flagship remained over the planet while the escorting battleships dispersed to the outskirts of the system the liners stayed until the invincibles shuttle squadron had ferried the gameplayers court officials guests and observers down to the surface then left for a nearby system the shuttles dropped through the clear air of echronedal to land at castle klaff the fortress lay on a spur of rock at the foot of a range of soft wellworn hills overlooking a broad plain normally it looked out over a horizonwide sweep of low scrub punctuated by the thin towers of cinderbuds at whatever stage theyd reached but now the cinderbuds had branched and blossomed and their canopy of rippling leaves fluttered over the plain like some rooted yellow overcast and the tallest trunks rose higher than the castles curtain wall when the incandescence arrived it would wash around the fortress like a livid wave all that ever saved the castle from incineration was a twokilometre viaduct leading from a reservoir in the low hills to klaff itself where giant cisterns and a complicated system of sprinklers ensured the secured and shuttered fortress was drenched with water as the fire passed if the dousing system ever broke down there were deep shelters in the rock far underneath the castle which would house the inhabitants until the burning was over so far the waters had always saved the fortress and it had remained an oasis of scorched yellow in a wilderness of fire the emperor whoever had won the final game was traditionally meant to be in klaff when the fire passed to rise from the fortress after the flames died ascending through the darkness of the smoke clouds to the darkness of space and thence to his empire the timing hadnt always worked out perfectly and in earlier centuries the emperor and his court had had to sit out the fire in another castle or even missed the incandescence altogether however the empire had this time calculated correctly and it looked as though the incandescence due to start only two hundred kilometres fireward of the castle where the cinderbuds changed abruptly from their normal size and shape to the huge trees that surrounded klaff would arrive more or less on time to provide a suitable backdrop for the coronation gurgeh felt uncomfortable as soon as they landed eä had been of just a little less than what the culture rather arbitrarily regarded as standard mass so its gravity had felt roughly the equivalent of the force chiark orbital had produced by rotating and the limiting factor and the little rascal had created with ag fields but echronedal was half as massive again as eä and gurgeh felt heavy the castle had long since been equipped with slowaccelerating elevators and it was unusual to see anybody other than male servants climbing upstairs but even walking on the level was uncomfortable for the first few of the planets short days gurgehs rooms overlooked one of the castles inner courtyards he settled in there with flereimsaho who gave no sign of being affected by the higher gravity and the male servant every finalist was entitled to gurgeh had voiced some uncertainty about having a servant at all yeah the drone had said who needs two but it had been explained it was traditional and a great honour for the male so hed acquiesced there was a rather desultory party on the night of their arrival everybody sat around talking tired after the long journey and drained by the fierce gravity the conversation was mostly about swollen ankles gurgeh went briefly to show his face it was the first time hed met nicosar since the grand ball at the start of the games the receptions on the invincible during the journey had not been graced by the imperial presence this time get it right flereimsaho told him as they entered the main hall of the castle the emperor sat on a throne welcoming the people as they arrived gurgeh was about to kneel like everybody else but nicosar saw him shook one ringed finger and pointed at his own knee our onekneed friend you have not forgotten gurgeh knelt on one knee bowing his head nicosar laughed thinly hamin sitting on the emperors right smiled gurgeh sat alone in a chair by a wall near a large suit of antique armour he looked unenthusiastically round the room and ended up gazing with a frown at an apex standing in one corner of the hall talking to a group of uniformed apices perched on stoolseats around him the apex was unusual not just because he was standing but because he seemed to be encased in a set of gunmetal bones worn outside his navy uniform whos that gurgeh asked flereimsaho humming and crackling unenthusiastically between his chair and the suit of armour by the wall whos who that apex with the exoskeleton is that what you call it him that is star marshal yomonul in the last games he made a personal bet with nicosars blessing that he would go to prison for a great year if he lost he lost but he expected that nicosar would use the imperial veto which he can do on wagers which arent bodybets because the emperor wouldnt want to lose the services of one of his best commanders for six years nicosar did use the veto but only to have yomonul incarcerated in that device hes wearing rather than shut away in a prison cell the portable prison is protosentient it has various independent sensors as well as conventional exoskeleton features such as a micropile and powered limbs its job is to leave yomonul free to carry out his military duties but otherwise to impose prison discipline on him it will only let him eat a little of the simplest food allows him no alcohol keeps him to a strict regimen of exercise will not allow him to take part in social activities his presence here this evening must mark some sort of special dispensation by the emperor and wont let him copulate in addition he has to listen to sermons by a prison chaplain who visits him for two hours every ten days poor guy i see he has to stand as well well one shouldnt try to outsmart the emperor i guess flereimsaho said but his sentence is almost over no time off for good behaviour the imperial penal service does not deal in discounts they do add time on if you behave badly though gurgeh shook his head looking at the distant prisoner in his private prison its a mean old empire isnt it drone mean enough but if it ever tries to fuck with the culture itll find out what mean really is gurgeh looked round in surprise at the machine it floated buzzing there its bulky grey and brown casing looking hard and even sinister against the dull gleam of the empty suit of armour my were in a combative mood this evening i am youd better be for the games im ready are you really going to take part in this piece of propaganda what piece of propaganda you know damn well helping the bureau to fake your own defeat pretending youve lost giving interviews and lying yes why not it lets me play the game they might try to stop me otherwise kill you gurgeh shrugged disqualify me is it worth so much to keep playing no gurgeh lied but telling a few white lies isnt much of a price either huh the machine said gurgeh waited for it to say more but it didnt they left a little later gurgeh got up out of the chair and walked to the door only remembering to turn and bow towards nicosar after the drone prompted him his first game on echronedal the one he was officially to lose no matter what happened was another ten game this time there was no suggestion of anybody ganging up on him and he was approached by four of the other players to form a side which would oppose the rest this was the traditional way of playing ten games though it was the first time gurgeh had been directly involved apart from being on the sharp end of other peoples alliances so he found himself discussing strategy and tactics with a pair of fleet admirals a star general and an imperial minister in what the bureau guaranteed was an electronically and optically sterile room in one wing of the castle they spent three days talking over how they would play the game then they swore before god and gurgeh gave his word they would not break the agreement until the other five players had been defeated or they themselves were brought down the lesser games ended with the sides about even gurgeh found there were advantages and disadvantages in playing as part of an ensemble he did his best to adapt and play accordingly more talks followed then they joined battle on the board of origin gurgeh enjoyed it it added a lot to the game to play as part of a team he felt genuinely warm towards the apices he played alongside they came to each others aid when they were in trouble they trusted one another during massed attacks and generally played as though their individual forces were really a single side as people he didnt find his comrades desperately engaging but as playing partners he could not deny the emotion he felt for them and experienced a growing sense of sadness as the game progressed and they gradually beat back their opponents that they would soon all be fighting each other when it came to it and the last of the opposition had surrendered much of what gurgeh had felt before disappeared hed been at least partially tricked hed stuck to what he saw as the spirit of their agreement while the others stuck to the letter nobody actually attacked until the last of the other teams pieces had been captured or taken over but there was some subtle manoeuvring when it became clear they were going to win playing for positions that would become more important when the teamagreement ended gurgeh missed this until it was almost too late and when the second part of the game began he was by far the weakest of the five it also became obvious that the two admirals were not surprisingly cooperating unofficially against the others jointly the pair were stronger than the other three in a way gurgehs very weakness saved him he played so that it was not worth taking him for a long time letting the other four fight it out later he attacked the two admirals when they had grown strong enough to threaten a complete takeover but were more vulnerable to his small force than to the greater powers of the general and the minister the game toed and froed for a long time but gurgeh was gaining steadily and eventually though he was put out first of the five hed accumulated sufficient points to ensure hed play on the next board three of the other original fiveside had done so badly they had to resign from the match gurgeh never really fully recovered from his mistake on the first board and did badly on the board of form it was starting to look as though the empire would not need to lie about him being thrown out of the first game he still talked to the limiting factor using flereimsaho as a relay and the gamescreen in his own room for the display he felt hed adjusted to the higher gravity flereimsaho had to remind him it was a genofixed response his bones were rapidly thickening and his musculature had expanded without waiting to be otherwise exercised hadnt you noticed you were getting more thickset the drone said in exasperation while gurgeh studied his body in the room mirror gurgeh shook his head i did think i was eating rather a lot very observant i wonder what else you can do you dont know about didnt they teach you anything about your own biology the man shrugged i forgot he adjusted too to the planets short daynight cycle adapting faster than anybody else if the numerous complaints were anything to go by most people the drone told him were using drugs to bring themselves into line with the threequarters standard day genofixing again gurgeh asked at breakfast one morning yes of course i didnt know we could do all this obviously not the drone said good grief man the cultures been a spacefaring species for eleven thousand years just because youve mostly settled down in idealised tailormade conditions doesnt mean youve lost the capacity for rapid adaptation strength in depth redundancy overdesign you know the cultures philosophy gurgeh frowned at the machine he gestured to the walls and then to his ear flereimsaho wobbled from side to side drone shrug gurgeh came fifth out of seven on the board of form he started play on the board of becoming with no hope of winning but a remote chance of getting through as the qualifier he played an inspired game towards the end he was starting to feel quite thoroughly at home on the last of the three great boards and enjoyed using the elemental symbolism the play incorporated instead of the diematching used in the rest of each match the board of becoming was the least wellplayed of the three great boards gurgeh felt and one the empire seemed to understand imperfectly and pay too little attention to he made it one of the admirals won and he scraped in as qualifier the margin between him and the other admiral was one point against only a draw and playoff could have been closer but when he thought about it later he realised he hadnt for one moment entertained the slightest doubt hed get through to the next round youre coming perilously close to talking about destiny jernau gurgeh flereimsaho said when he tried to explain this he was sitting in his room hand on the table in front of him while the drone removed the orbital bracelet from his wrist he couldnt get it over his hand any more and it was becoming too tight thanks to his expanding muscles destiny gurgeh said looking thoughtful he nodded thats what it feels like i suppose what next exclaimed the machine using a field to cut the bracelet gurgeh had expected the bright little image to disappear but it didnt god ghosts timetravel the drone drew the bracelet off his wrist and reconnected the tiny orbital so that it was a circle again gurgeh smiled the empire he took the bracelet from the machine got up easily and walked to the window turning the orbital over in his hands and looking out into the stony courtyard the empire thought flereimsaho it got gurgeh to let it store the bracelet inside its casing no sense in leaving it around somebody might guess what it represented i do hope hes joking with his own game over gurgeh found time to watch nicosars match the emperor was playing in the prowhall of the fortress a great bowled room ribbed in grey stone and capable of seating over a thousand people it was here the last game would be played the game which would decide who became emperor the prowhall lay at the far end of the castle facing the direction the fire would come from high windows still unshuttered looked out over the sea of yellow cinderbud heads outside gurgeh sat in one of the observation galleries watching the emperor play nicosar played cautiously gradually building up advantages playing the game in a percentagewary way setting up profitable exchanges on the board of becoming and orchestrating the moves of the other four players on his side gurgeh was impressed nicosar played a deceptive game the slow steady style he evinced here was only one side of him every now and again there would come just when it was needed exactly when it would have the most devastating effect a move of startling brilliance and audacity equally the occasional fine move by an opponent was always at least matched and usually bettered by the emperor gurgeh felt some sympathy for those playing against nicosar even playing badly was less demoralising than playing sporadically excellently but always being crushed youre smiling jernau gurgeh gurgeh had been absorbed in the game and hadnt seen hamin approach the old apex sat down carefully beside him bulges under his robe showed he wore an ag harness to partially counteract echronedals gravity good evening hamin i have heard you qualified well done thank you only unofficially of course ah yes officially you came fourth how unexpectedly generous we took into account your willingness to cooperate you will still help us of course just show me the camera perhaps tomorrow hamin nodded looking down to where nicosar stood surveying his commanding position on the board of becoming your opponent for the single game will be lo tenyos krowo an excellent player i warn you are you quite sure you dont want to drop out now quite would you have me cause bermoiyas mutilation only to give up now because the strains getting too much i see your point gurgeh hamin sighed still watching the emperor he nodded yes i see your point and anyway you only qualified by the narrowest of margins and lo tenyos krowo is very very good he nodded again yes perhaps you have found your level eh the wizened face turned to gurgeh very possibly rector hamin nodded absently and looked away again at his emperor on the following morning gurgeh recorded some faked gameboard shots the game hed just played was set up again and gurgeh made some believable but uninspired moves and one outright mistake the part of his opponents was taken by hamin and a couple of other senior candsev college professors gurgeh was impressed by how well they were able to mimic the gamestyles of the apices hed been playing against as had in effect been foretold gurgeh finished fourth he recorded an interview with the imperial news service expressing his sorrow at being knocked out of the main series and saying how grateful he was for having had the chance to play the game of azad the experience of a lifetime he was eternally in the debt of the azadian people his respect for the emperorregents genius had increased immeasurably from its already high starting point he looked forward to observing the rest of the games he wished the emperor his empire and all its people and subjects the very best for what would undoubtedly be a bright and prosperous future the newsteam and hamin seemed well pleased you should have been an actor jernau gurgeh hamin told him gurgeh assumed this was intended as a compliment he sat looking out over the forest of cinderbuds the trees were sixty metres high or more at their peak rate the drone had told him they grew at nearly a quartermetre per day sucking such vast quantities of water and matter from the ground that the soil dropped all around them subsiding far enough to reveal the uppermost levels of their roots which would burn in the incandescence and take the full great year to regrow it was dusk the short time in a short day when the rapidly spinning planet left the bright yellow dwarf dropping beyond the horizon gurgeh breathed deeply there was no smell of burning the air seemed quite clear and a couple of planets in the echronedal system shone in the sky nevertheless gurgeh knew there was sufficient dust in the atmosphere to forever block out most of the stars in the sky and leave the huge wheel that was the main galaxy blurred and indistinct not remotely as breathtaking as it was when viewed from beyond the planets hazed covering of gas he sat in a tiny garden near the top of the fortress so that he could see over the summits of most of the cinderbuds he was level with the fruitbearing heads of the tallest trees the fruit pods each about the size of a curledup child were full of what was basically ethylalcohol when the incandescence arrived some would drop and some would stay hanging there all would burn a shiver ran through gurgeh when he thought about it approximately seventy days to go they said anybody sitting where he was now when the firefront arrived would be roasted alive watersprays or not radiated heat alone would cook you the garden he was sitting in would go the wooden bench he was sitting on would be taken inside behind the thick stone and the metal and fireglass shutters gardens in the deeper courtyards would survive though they would have to be dug out from some of the windblown ash the people would be safe in the drenched castle or the deep shelters unless they had been very foolish and were caught outside it had happened hed been told he saw flereimsaho flying over the trees towards him the machine had been given permission to fly off by itself as long as it told the authorities where it was going and agreed to be fitted with a position monitor obviously there wasnt anything on echronedal the empire considered especially militarily sensitive the drone hadnt been too happy with the conditions but reckoned it would go mad cooped up in the castle so had agreed this had been its first expedition jernau gurgeh hello drone birdwatching flying fish thought id start with the oceans going to take a look at the fire not yet i hear youre playing lo tenyos krowo next in four days they say hes very good he is hes also one of the people who know all about the culture gurgeh glared at the machine what there are never fewer than eight people in the empire who know where the culture comes from roughly what size it is and our level of technological development really gurgeh said through his teeth for the last two hundred years the emperor the chief of naval intelligence and the six star marshals have been appraised of the power and extent of the culture they dont want anybody else to know their choice not ours theyre frightened its understandable drone gurgeh said loudly has it occurred to you i might be getting a little sick of being treated like a child all the time why the hell couldnt you just tell me that jernau we only wanted to make things easier for you why complicate things by telling you that a few people did know when there was no real likelihood of your ever coming into any but the most fleeting contact with any of them frankly youd never have been told at all if you hadnt got to the stage of playing against one of these people no need for you to know were just trying to help you really i thought id tell you in case krowo said something during the course of the game which puzzled you and upset your concentration well i wish you cared as much about my temper as you do about my concentration gurgeh said getting up and going to lean on the parapet at the end of the garden im very sorry the drone said without a trace of contrition gurgeb waved one band never mind i take it krowos in naval intelligence then not the office of cultural exchange correct officially his post does not exist but everybody in court knows the highest placed player whos the least bit devious is offered the job i thought cultural exchange was a funny place for somebody that good well krowos had the intelligence job for three great years and some people reckon he could have been emperor if hed really wanted but he prefers to stay where he is hell be a difficult opponent so everybody keeps telling me gurgeh said then frowned and looked towards the fading light on the horizon whats that he said did you hear that it came again a long haunting plaintive cry from far away almost drowned by the quiet rustling of the cinderbud canopy the faint sound rose in a still quiet but chilling crescendo a scream that died away slowly gurgeh shivered for the second time that evening what is that he whispered the drone sidled closer what those calls it said yes gurgeh said listening to the faint sound as it came and went on the soft warm wind wavering out of the darkness over the rustling heads of the giant cinderbuds animals flereimsaho said dimly silhouetted against the last fractions of light in the western sky big carnivores called troshae mostly sixlegged you saw some from the emperors personal menagerie on the night of the ball remember gurgeh nodded still listening fascinated to the cries of the distant beasts how do they escape the incandescence troshae run ahead almost up to the fireline during the previous great month the ones youre listening to couldnt run fast enough to escape even if they started now theyve been trapped and penned so they can be hunted for sport thats why theyre howling like that they know the fires coming and they want to get away gurgeh said nothing head turned to catch the faint sound of the doomed animals flereimsaho waited for a minute or so but the man did not move or ask anything else the machine backed off to return to gurgehs rooms just before it went through the door into the casue it looked back at the man standing clutching the stone parapet at the far end of the little garden he was crouched a little head forward motionless it was quite dark now and ordinary human eyes could not have picked out the quiet figure the drone hesitated then disappeared into the fortress gurgeh hadnt thought azad was the sort of game you could have an offday in certainly not an offtwentydays discovering that it was came as a great disappointment hed studied many of lo tenyos krowos past games and had looked forward to playing the intelligence chief the apexs style was exciting far more flamboyant if occasionally more erratic than that of any of the other topflight players it ought to have been a challenging enjoyable match but it wasnt it was hateful embarrassing ignominious gurgeh annihilated krowo the burly at first rather jovial and unconcernedseeming apex made some awful simple errors and some that resulted from genuinely inspired even brilliant play but which in the end were just as disastrous sometimes gurgeh knew you came up against somebody who just by the way they played caused you a lot more problems than they ought to and sometimes too you found a game in which everything went badly no matter how hard you tried and regardless of your most piercing insights and incisive moves the chief of naval intelligence seemed to have both problems at once gurgehs gamestyle might have been designed to cause krowo problems and the apexs luck was almost nonexistent gurgeh felt real sympathy for krowo who was obviously more upset at the manner than the fact of the defeat they were both glad when it was over flereimsaho watched the man play during the closing stages of the match it read each move as they appeared on the screen and what it saw was something less like a game and more like an operation gurgeh the gameplayer the morat was taking his opponent apart the apex was playing badly true but gurgeh was offhandedly brilliant anyway there was a callousness in his play that was new too something the drone had been half expecting but was still surprised to see so soon and so completely it read the signs the man s body and face held annoyance pity anger sorrow and it read the play too and saw nothing remotely similar all it read was the ordered fury of a player working the boards and the pieces the cards and the rules like the familiar controls of some omnipotent machine another change it thought the man had altered slipped deeper into the game and the society it had been warned this might happen one reason was that gurgeh was speaking eächic all the time flereimsaho was always a little dubious about trying to be so precise about human behaviour but it had been briefed that when culture people didnt speak marain for a long time and did speak another language they were liable to change they acted differently they started to think in that other language they lost the carefully balanced interpretative structure of the culture language left its subtle shifts of cadence tone and rhythm behind for in virtually every case something much cruder marain was a synthetic language designed to be phonetically and philosophically as expressive as the panhuman speech apparatus and the panhuman brain would allow flereimsaho suspected it was overrated but smarter minds than it had dreamt marain up and ten millennia later even the most rarefied and superior minds still thought highly of the language so it supposed it had to defer to their superior understanding one of the minds whod briefed it had even compared marain to azad that really was fanciful but flereimsaho had taken the point behind the hyperbole eächic was an ordinary evolved language with rooted assumptions which substituted sentimentality for compassion and aggression for cooperation a comparatively innocent and sensitive soul like gurgeh was bound to pick up some of its underlying ethical framework if he spoke it all the time so now the man played like one of those carnivores hed been listening to stalking across the board setting up traps and diversions and killing grounds pouncing pursuing bringing down consuming absorbing flereimsaho shifted inside its disguise as though uncomfortable then switched the screen off the day after gurgehs game with krowo ended he received a long letter from chamlis amalkney he sat in his room and watched the old drone it showed him views of chiark while it gave him the latest news professor boruelal still in retreat hafflis pregnant olz hap away on a cruise with her first love but coming back within the year to continue at the university chamlis still working on its history book gurgeh sat watching and listening contact had censored the communication blanking out bits which gurgeh assumed showed that the landscape of chiark was orbital not planetary it annoyed him less than hed have expected he didnt enjoy the letter much it all seemed so far away so irrelevant the ancient drone sounded hackneyed rather than wise or even friendly and the people on the screen looked soft and stupid amalkney showed him ikroh and gurgeh found himself angered at the fact that people came and stayed there every now and again who did they think they were yay meristinoux didnt appear in the letter shed finally grown fed up with blask and the preashipleyl machine and left to pursue her landscaping career in deleted she sent her love when she left shed started the viral change to become a man there was one odd section right at the end of the communication apparently added after the main signal had been recorded chamlis was shown in the main lounge at ikroh gurgeh it said this arrived today general delivery unspecified sender care of special circumstances the view began to pan across to where if no interfering interloper had changed the furniture around there ought to have been a table the screen blanked out chamlis said our little friend but quite lifeless ive scanned it and i had cut send down its bugging team to take a look too its dead just a casing with no mind like an intact human body with the brain neatly scooped out theres a small cavity in the centre where its mind must have been the visuals returned the view panned round to chamlis again i can only assume the thing finally agreed to be restructured and they made it a new body odd they should send the old one here though let me know what you want done with it write soon hope this finds you well and successful in whatever it is youre up to kindest re gurgeh switched the screen off he got up quickly went to the window and looked out at the courtyard beneath frowning a smile spread slowly across his face he laughed silently after a moment then went over to the intercom and told his servant to bring some wine he was just raising the glass to his lips when flereimsaho floated in through the window returning from another wildlife safari its casing pale with dust you look pleased with yourself it said whats the toast gurgeh gazed into the wines amber depths and smiled absent friends he said and drank the next match was a three game gurgeh was to face yomonul lu rahsp the star marshal imprisoned in the exoskeleton and a youngish colonel lo frag traff he knew that going on form they were both supposed to be inferior to krowo but the intelligence chief had done so badly he was unlikely to hold on to his post now gurgeh didnt think this was any indication he was going to have an easier game against his next two opponents than hed had against the last one on the contrary it would be only natural for the two military men to gang up on him nicosar was to play the old star marshal vechesteder and the defence minister jhilno gurgeh passed the days studying flereimsaho continued to explore it told gurgeh it had watched a whole region of the advancing firefront being extinguished by a torrential rainstorm it had revisited the area a couple of days later to find tinderplants reigniting the dried vegetation as an example of how integral the fire and the rest of the planets ecology had become the drone said it was an impressive display the court amused itself with hunts in the forest during the daylight hours and live or holo shows at night gurgeh found the entertainments predictable and tedious the only faintly interesting ones were duels usually males fighting each other held in pits surrounded by banked circles of shouting betting imperial officials and players the duels were only occasionally to the death gurgeh suspected that things went on in the castle at night entertainments of a different sort which were inevitably fatal for at least one of the participants and which he would not be welcome to attend or expected to hear about however the thought no longer worried him lo frag traff was a young apex with a very obvious scar running from one brow down his cheek almost to his mouth he played quick fierce games and his career in the imperial star army bore the same hallmarks his most famous exploit had been the sacking of the urutypaig library traff had been in command of a small ground force in a war against a humanoid species the war in space had been fought to a temporary stalemate but through a combination of great military talent and a little luck traff found himself in a position to threaten the species capital city from the ground the enemy had sued for peace making it a condition of the treaty that their great library famous throughout the civilised species of the lesser cloud be left untouched traff knew that if he refused this condition the fight would go on so he gave his word that not a letter not a pixel on the ancient microfiles would be destroyed and they would be left in situ traff had orders from his star marshal that the library had to be destroyed nicosar himself had commanded this as one of his first edicts after coming to power subject races had to understand that once they displeased the emperor nothing could prevent their punishment while nobody in the empire cared in the least about one of its loyal soldiers breaking an agreement with some bunch of aliens traff knew that giving your word was a sacred thing nobody would ever trust him again if he went back on it traff already knew what he was going to do he solved the problem by shuffling the library sorting every word in it into alphabetical order and every pixel of every illustration into order of colour shade and intensity the original microfiles were wiped and rerecorded with volumes upon volumes of thes its and ands the illustrations were fields of pure colour there were riots of course but traff was in control by then and as he explained to the incensed and as it turned out literally suicidal guardians of the library and to the empires supreme court he had kept his word about not actually destroying or taking as booty a single word image or file halfway through the game on the board of origin gurgeh realised something remarkable yomonul and traff were playing each other not him they played as if they expected him to win anyway and were battling for second place gurgeh had known there was little love lost between the two yomonul represented the old guard of the military and traff the new wave of brash young adventurers yomonul was an exponent of negotiation and minimumforce traff of the moves that smite yomonul had a liberal view of other species traff was a xenophobe the two came from traditionally opposed colleges and all their differences were displayed quite overtly in their gamestyles yomonuls was studied careful and detached traffs was aggressive to the point of recklessness their attitude to the emperor was different too yomonul took a cool practical view of the throne while traff was utterly loyal to nicosar himself rather than the position he held each detested the beliefs of the other nevertheless gurgeh hadnt expected them to more or less disregard him and go straight for each others throats once again he felt slightly cheated that he wasnt getting a proper game the only compensation was that the amount of venom in the play of the two warring military men was something to behold undeniably impressive if distressingly selfdefeating and wasteful gurgeh cruised through the game quietly picking up points while the two soldiers fought he was winning but he couldnt help feeling the other two were getting much more out of the game than he was hed have expected they would use the physical option but nicosar himself had ordered that there be no betting during the match he knew the two players were pathologically opposed and didnt want to risk losing the military services of either gurgeh sat watching a tablescreen during lunch on his third day on the board of origin there were still a few minutes before play resumed and gurgeh sat alone watching the newsreports showing how well lo tenyos krowo was doing in his game against yomonul and traff whoever had faked the apexs play not krowo himself whod refused to have anything to do with the subterfuge was making a good job of impersonating the intelligence chiefs style gurgeh smiled a little contemplating your coming victory jernau gurgeh hamin said easing himself into the seat across the table gurgeh turned the screen round its a little early for that dont you think the old bald apex peered at the screen smiling thinly hmm you think so he reached out turned the screen off things change hamin indeed they do gurgeh but i think the course of this game will not yomonul and traff will continue to ignore you and attack each other you will win well then gurgeh said looking at the dead screen krowo will get to play nicosar krowo may we can devise a game to cover that you must not must not gurgeh said i thought id done all you wanted what else can i do refuse to play the emperor gurgeh looked into the old apexs pale grey eyes each set in a web of fine lines they gazed just as calmly back whats the problem hamin im not a threat any more hamin smoothed the fine material at the cuff of his robe you know jernau gurgeh i do hate obsessions theyre so blinding yes he smiled i am becoming worried for my emperor gurgeh i know how much he wants to prove he is rightfully on the throne that he is worthy of the post hes held the last two years i believe he will do just that but i know that what he really wants what he always did want is to play molsce and win that of course isnt possible any more the emperor is dead long live the emperor he rises from the flames but i think he sees old molsce in you jernau gurgeh and it is you he feels he must play you he must beat the alien the man from the culture the morat playerofgames i am not sure that would be a good idea it is not necessary you will lose anyway i feel certain but as i say obsessions disturb me it would be best for all concerned if you let it be known as soon as possible you will retire after this game and deprive nicosar of the chance to beat me gurgeh looked surprised and amused yes better he still feels theres something still to prove it will do him no harm ill think about it gurgeh said hamin studied him for a moment i hope you understand how frank ive been with you jernau gurgeh it would be unfortunate if such honesty went unacknowledged and unrewarded gurgeh nodded yes i dont doubt it would a male servant at the door announced the game was about to recommence excuse me rector gurgeh said rising the old apexs gaze followed him duty calls obey hamin said gurgeh stopped looking down at the wizened old creature on the far side of the table then he turned and left hamin gazed at the blank tablescreen in front of him as if absorbed in some fascinating invisible game that only he could see gurgeh won on the board of origin and the board of form the ferocious struggle between traff and yomonul continued first one edged ahead then the other traff went into the board of becoming with a very slight lead over the older apex gurgeh was so far ahead he was almost invulnerable able to relax in his strongholds and spectate upon the total war around him before heading out to mop up whatever was left of the exhausted victors forces it seemed the only fair not to mention expedient thing to do let the lads have their fun then impose order later and tidy the toys back in the box still no substitute for a real game though are you pleased or displeased mr gurgeh star marshal yomonul came up to gurgeh and asked him the question during a pause in the game while traff consulted with the adjudicator on a point of order gurgeh had been standing thinking staring at the board and hadnt noticed the imprisoned apex approach he looked up in surprise to see the star marshal in front of him his lined face looking out faintly amused from its titanium and carbon cage neither soldier had paid him any attention until now at being left out gurgeh said the apex moved one rodbraced arm to indicate the board yes to be winning so easily do you seek the victory or the challenge the apexs skeletal mask moved with each action of the jaw id prefer both gurgeh admitted i have thought of joining in as a third force or on one side or the other but this looks too much like a personal war the elderly apex grinned the headcage nodded easily it is he said youre doing very well as you are i wouldnt change now if i were you what about you gurgeh asked you seem to be getting the worst of it at the moment yomonul smiled the face mask flexed even for that small gesture im having the time of my life and i still have a few surprises lined up for the youngster and a few tricks but i feel a little guilty at letting you through so easily youll embarrass us all if you play nicosar and win gurgeh expressed surprise you think i could no the apexs gesture was the more emphatic for being contained and amplified in its dark cage nicosar plays at his best when he has to and at his best he will beat you so long as he isnt too ambitious no hell beat you because youll threaten him and he will respect that but ah the star marshal turned as traff strode across the board moved a couple of pieces and then bowed with exaggerated courtesy to yomonul the star marshal looked back at gurgeh i see it is my turn excuse me he returned to the fray perhaps one of the tricks yomonul had mentioned was making traff think his conversation with gurgeh had been to enlist the culture mans aid for some time afterwards the younger soldier acted as though he was expecting to have to fight on two fronts it gave yomonul an edge he scraped in ahead of traff gurgeh won the match and the chance to play nicosar hamin tried to talk to him in the corridor outside the gamehall immediately after his victory but gurgeh just smiled and walked past cinderbuds swayed all around them the light wind made shushing noises in the golden canopy the court the gameplayers and their retinues sat on a high steeply raked wooden structure itself almost the size of a small castle before the stand in a large clearing in the cinderbud forest was a long narrow run a double fence of stout timbers five metres or more high this formed the central section of a sort of open corral shaped like an hourglass and open to the forest at both ends nicosar and the higherplaced players sat at the front of the high wooden platform with a good view of the wooden funnel at the back of the stand there were awninged areas where food was being prepared smells of roasting meat drifted over the stand and out into the forest thatll have them frothing at the mouth star marshal yomonul said leaning over to gurgeh with a whirring of servoes they were sitting side by side on the front rank of the platform a little along from the emperor both held a large projectile rifle fastened to a supporting tripod in front of them what will gurgeh asked the smell yomonul grinned gesturing behind them to the fires and grills roasted meat winds carrying it their way itll drive them crazy oh great muttered flereimsaho from near gurgehs feet it had already tried to persuade gurgeh not to take part in the hunt gurgeh ignored the machine and nodded of course he said he hefted the rifle stock the ancient weapon was single shot a sliding bolt had to be operated to reload it each gun had slightly different rifling patterns so that when the bullets were removed from the bodies of the animals the marks on them would allow a score to be kept and heads and pelts to be allocated you sure youve used one of these before yomonul asked grinning at him the apex was in a good mood in a few tens of days he would be released from the exoskeleton meanwhile the emperor had allowed the prison regimen to be relaxed yomonul could socialise drink and eat whatever he liked gurgeh nodded ive shot guns he said hed never used a projectile gun but there had been that day years ago now with yay in the desert bet youve never shot anything live before the drone said yomonul tapped the machines casing with one carbonshod foot quiet thing he said flereimsaho tipped slowly up so that its bevelled brown front pointed up at gurgeh thing it said indignantly in a sort of whispered screech gurgeh winked and put his finger to his lips he and yomonul grinned at each other the hunt as it was called started with a blare of trumpets and the distant howling of the troshae a line of males appeared from the forest and ran alongside the wooden funnel beating the timbers with rods the first troshae appeared shadows striping along its flanks as it entered the clearing and ran into the wooden funnel the people around gurgeh murmured in anticipation a big one yomonul said appreciatively as the goldenblack striped beast loped sixlegged down the run clicks all around the platform announced people preparing to fire gurgeh lifted the stock of the rifle fastened to its tripod the rifle was easier to handle in the harsh gravity than it would have been otherwise as well as being limited in its field of fire something the emperors ever watchful guards no doubt found reassuring the troshae sprinted down the run paws blurring on the dusty ground people fired at it filling the air with muffled cracking noises and puffs of grey smoke white wood splinters spun off the runs timbers puffs of dust burst from the ground yomonul sighted and fired a chorus of shots burst out around gurgeh the guns were silenced but all the same gurgeh felt his ears close up a little deadening the racket he fired the recoil took him by surprise his bullet must have gone way over the animals head he looked down into the run the animal was screaming it tried to leap up the fence on the far side of the run but was brought down in a hail of fire it limped on a little further dragging three legs and leaving a trail of blood behind it gurgeh heard another muffled report by his side and the carnivores head jerked suddenly to one side it collapsed a great cheer went up a gate in the run was opened and some males scurried in to drag the body away yomonul was on his feet beside gurgeh acknowledging the cheers he sat down again quickly exoskeleton motors whirring as the next animal appeared out of the forest and raced between the wooden walls after the fourth troshae several came at once and in the confusion one scrambled up the timbers of the run and over the top it started to chase some of the males waiting outside the run a guard on the ground at the foot of the stand brought the animal down with a single lasershot in the midmorning when a great pile of the striped bodies had accumulated in the middle of the run and there was a danger some animals would climb out over the bodies of their predecessors the hunt was stopped while males used hooks and hawsers and a couple of small tractors to clear the warm bloodspattered debris somebody on the far side of the emperor shot one of the males while they were working there were some tuts and a few drunken cheers the emperor fined the offender and told them if they did it again theyd find themselves running with the troshae everybody laughed youre not firing gurgeh yomonul said he reckoned hed killed another three animals by then gurgeh had begun to find the hunt a little pointless and almost stopped firing he kept missing anyway im not very good at this he said practice yomonul laughed slapping him on the back the servoamplified blow from the elated star marshal almost knocked the wind out of gurgeh yomonul claimed another kill he gave an excited shout and kicked flereimsaho fetch he laughed the drone rose slowly and with dignity from the floor jernau gurgeh it said im not putting up with any more of this im going back to the castle do you mind not at all thank you enjoy your marksmanship it floated down and to the side disappearing round the edge of the stand yomonul had it in his sights most of the way you just let it go he asked gurgeh laughing glad to be rid of it gurgeh told him they broke for lunch nicosar congratulated yomonul saying how well hed shot gurgeh sat with yomonul at lunch too and went down on one knee as nicosars palanquin was brought up to their part of the table yomonul told the emperor the exoskeleton helped steady his aim nicosar said it was the emperors pleasure that the device be removed soon after the formal end of the games nicosar glanced at gurgeh but said nothing else the ag palanquin lifted itself the imperial guards nudged it further down the line of waiting people after lunch people returned to their seats and the hunt went on there were other animals to hunt and the first part of the short afternoon was spent shooting them but the troshae came back later on so far only seven of the two hundred or so troshae released from the forest pens into the run had made it all the way through the wooden funnel and out the far end to escape into the forest even they were wounded and would anyway be caught by the incandescence the earth in the wooden funnel in front of the shooting platform was dark with auburn blood gurgeh shot as the animals pounded down the sodden run but aimed to just miss them watching for the spatter of muddy ground in front of their noses as they tore wounded and howling and panting in front of him he found the whole hunt somewhat distasteful but could not deny that the infectious excitement of the azadians had some effect on him yomonul was obviously enjoying himself the apex leant over as a large female troshae came running out of the forest with two small cubs you need more practice gurgey he said dont you do any hunting at home the female and her cubs ran towards the wooden funnel not much gurgeh admitted yomonul grunted aimed at long range and fired one of the cubs dropped the female skidded stopped went back to it the other cub ran on hesitantly it mewled as bullets hit it yomonul reloaded i was surprised to see you here at all he said the female stung by a bullet in a rear leg swung growling away from the dead cub and charged forward again roaring at the tottering wounded cub i wanted to show i wasnt squeamish gurgeh said watching the second cubs head jerk up and the beast fall at the feet of its mother and i have hunted he was going to use the word azad which meant machine and animal any organism or system and he turned to yomonul with a small smile to say this but when he looked at the apex he could see there was something wrong yomonul was shaking he sat clutching his gun turned half towards gurgeh face quivering in its dark cage skin white and covered in sweat eyes bulging gurgeh went to put his hand on the strut of the star marshals forearm instinctively offering support it was as though something broke inside the apex yomonuls gun swung right round snapping the supporting tripod the bulky silencer pointed straight at gurgehs forehead gurgeh had a fleeting vivid impression of yomonuls face jaw clamped shut blood trickling over his chin eyes staring a tic working furiously on the side of his face gurgeh ducked the gun fired somewhere over his head and he heard a scream as he fell out of his seat rolling past his own guns tripod before he could get up gurgeh was kicked in the back he turned over to see yomonul above him swaying crazily against the background of shocked pale faces behind him he was struggling with the rifle bolt reloading one foot lashed out again thudding into gurgehs ribs he jerked back trying to absorb the blow and fell over the front of the platform he saw wooden slats whirling cinderbuds revolving then he struck crashing into a male animal handler standing just before the run they each thudded to the ground winded gurgeh looked up and saw yomonul on the platform exoskeleton glinting dully in the sunlight raising the rifle and sighting on him two apices came up behind yomonul arms out to grasp him without even glancing back yomonul swung his arms flashing round behind him a hand smashed into the chest of one apex the rifle slammed into the face of the other both collapsed the carbonribbed arms darted back and yomonul steadied the gun again aiming at gurgeh gurgeh was on his feet diving away the shot hit the still winded male lying behind him gurgeh stumbled for the wooden doors leading under the high platform shouts came from the platform as yomonul jumped down landing between gurgeh and the doors the star marshal reloaded the gun as he hit the ground on his feet the exoskeleton easily absorbing the shock of landing gurgeh almost fell as he turned feet skidding on the bloodspattered earth he pushed himself off the ground to run between the edge of the wooden fence and the platform edge a uniformed guard with a crew rifle stood in his way looking uncertainly up at the platform gurgeh went to run past him ducking as he did so still a few metres in front of gurgeh the guard started to put one hand out and unhitch the laser from his shoulder a look of almost comic surprise appeared on his flat face an instant before one side of his chest burst open and he spun round into gurgehs path knocking him over gurgeh rolled again clattering over the dead guard he sat up yomonul was ten metres away running awkwardly towards him reloading the guards rifle was at gurgehs feet he reached out grabbed it aimed at yomonul and fired the star marshal ducked but gurgeh was still allowing for recoil after a morning shooting the projectile rifle the lasershot slammed into yomonuls face the apexs head blew apart yomonul didnt stop he didnt even slow down the running figure headcage almost empty trailing strips of flesh and splintered bone behind it like pennants neck spouting blood speeded up it ran faster towards him and less awkwardly it aimed the rifle straight at gurgehs head gurgeh froze stunned too late he started to sight the crew gun again and began struggling to get up the headless exoskeleton was three metres away he stared into the silencers black mouth and he knew he was dead but the bizarre figure hesitated empty headshell jerking upwards and the gun wavered something crashed into gurgeh from the back he realised surprised as everything went dark from the back not from the front and then came nothing his back hurt he opened his eyes a bulky brown drone hummed between him and a white ceiling gurgeh the machine said he swallowed licked his lips what he said he didnt know where he was or who the drone was he had only a very vague idea who he was gurgeh its me flereimsaho how do you feel flear imsahho the name meant something back hurts a bit he said hoping not to be found out gurgi gurgey must be his name im not surprised a very large troshae hit you in the back a what never mind go back to sleep sleep his eyelids felt very heavy and the drone looked blurred his back hurt he opened his eyes and saw a white ceiling he looked around for flereimsaho dark wooden walls window flereimsaho there it was it floated over to him hello gurgeh hello do you remember who i am still asking stupid questions flereimsaho am i going to be all right youre bruised youve got a cracked rib and youre mildly concussed you ought to be able to get up in a day or two do i remember you saying a troshae hit me did i dream that you didnt dream it i did tell you thats what happened how much do you remember falling off the stand platform he said slowly trying to think he was in bed and his back was sore it was his own room in the castle and the lights were on so it was probably night his eyes widened yomonul kicked me off he said suddenly why it doesnt matter now go back to sleep gurgeh started to say something else but he felt tired again as the drone buzzed closer and he closed his eyes for a second just to rest them gurgeh stood by the window looking down into the courtyard the male servant took the tray out glasses clinking go on he said to the drone the troshae climbed the fence while everybody was watching you and yomonul it came up behind you and sprang it hit you and then bowled over the exoskeleton before it had time to do much about it guards shot the troshae as it tried to gore yomonul and by the time they dragged it off the exoskeleton it had deactivated gurgeh shook his head slowly all i remember is being kicked off the stand he sat down in a chair by the window the far edge of the courtyard was golden in the hazy light of late afternoon and where were you while this was happening back here watching the hunt on an imperial broadcast im sorry i left jernau gurgeh but that appalling apex was kicking me and the whole obscene spectacle was just too gory and disgusting for words gurgeh waved one hand it doesnt matter im alive he put his face in his hands youre sure it was i who shot yomonul oh yes its all recorded do you want to wa no gurgeh held up one hand to the drone eyes still closed no i dont want to watch i didnt see that bit live flereimsaho said i was on my way back to the hunt as soon as yomonul fired his first shot and killed the person on the other side of you but ive watched the recording yes you killed him with the guards crew but of course that just meant whoever had taken control of the exoskeleton didnt have to fight against yomonul inside it as soon as yomonul was dead the thing moved a lot faster and less erratically he must have been using all his strength to try and stop it gurgeh stared at the floor youre certain about all this absolutely the drone drifted over to the wallscreen look why not watch it on your no gurgeh shouted standing and then swaying he sat down again no he said quieter by the time i got there whoever was jamming the exoskeleton controls had gone i got a brief reading on my microwave sensors while i was between here and the hunt but it switched off before i could get an accurate fix some kind of phasedpulse maser the imperial guards picked up something too theyd started a search in the forest by the time we took you away i persuaded them i knew what i was doing and had you brought here they sent a doctor in to look at you a couple of times but thats all lucky i got there when i did or they might have taken you to the infirmary and started doing all sorts of nasty tests on you the drone sounded perplexed thats why i have a feeling this wasnt a straight securityservice job theyd have tried other less public ways to kill you and theyd have been all set up to get you into the hospital if it hadnt quite worked all too disorganised theres something funny going on im sure gurgeh put his hands to his back carefully tracing the extent of the bruising again i wish i could remember everything i wish i could remember whether i meant to kill yomonul he said his chest ached he felt sick as you did and youre such a bad shot id assume the answer is no gurgeh looked at the machine dont you have something else you could be doing drone not really oh by the way the emperor wants to see you when youre feeling well ill go now gurgeh said standing slowly are you sure i dont think you should you dont look well id lie down if i were you please sit down youre not ready what if hes angry because you killed yomonul oh i suppose id better come the with you nicosar sat in a small throne in front of a great bank of slanting multicoloured windows the imperial apartments were submerged in the deep polychromatic light huge wall tapestries sewn with precious metal threads glittered like treasures in an underwater cave guards stood impassively around the walls and behind the throne courtiers and officials shuffled to and fro with papers and flatscreens an officer of the imperial household brought gurgeh to the throne leaving flereimsaho at the other end of the room under the watchful eyes of two guards please sit nicosar motioned gurgeh to a small stool on the dais in front of him gurgeh sat down gratefully jernau gurgeh the emperor said his voice quiet and controlled almost flat we offer you our sincere apologies for what happened yesterday we are glad to see you have made such a rapid recovery though we understand you are still in pain is there anything you wish thank you your highness no we are glad nicosar nodded slowly he was still dressed in unrelieved black his sober dress small frame and plain face contrasted with the fabulous splashes of colour from the raked windows overhead and the sumptuous clothing of the courtiers the emperor put small ringed hands on the arms of the throne we are of course deeply sorry to lose the regard and the services of our star marshal yomonul lu rahsp especially in such tragic circumstances but we understand that you had no choice but to defend yourself it is our will that no action be taken against you thank you your highness nicosar waved one hand in the matter of who plotted against you the person who took control of our star marshals imprisoning device was discovered and put to the question we were deeply hurt to discover that the leading conspirator was our lifelong mentor and guide the rector of candsev college ham gurgeh began but stopped nicosars face was a study in displeasure the old apexs name died in gurgehs throat i gurgeh started again nicosar held up one hand we wish to tell you that the rector of candsev college hamin li srilist has been sentenced to death for his part in the conspiracy against you we understand that this may not have been the only attempt on your life if this is so then all relevant circumstances will be investigated and the wrongdoers brought to justice certain persons in the court nicosar said looking at the rings on his hands have desired to protect their emperor through misguided actions the emperor needs no such protection from a gameopponent even if that opponent uses aids we deny ourselves it has been necessary to deceive our subjects in the matter of your progress in these final games but this is for their good not ours we have no need to be protected from unpleasant truths the emperor knows no fear only discretion we shall be happy to postpone the game between the emperorregent and the man jernau morat gurgeh until he feels fit to play gurgeh found himself waiting for more of the quiet slow halfsung words but nicosar sat impassively silent i thank your highness gurgeh said but i would prefer there be no postponement i feel almost well enough to play now and there are still three days before the match is due to start im sure there is no need to delay further nicosar nodded slowly we are pleased we hope though that if jernau gurgeh desires to change his mind on this matter before the match is due to start he will not hesitate to inform the imperial office which will gladly put back the starting date of the final match until jernau gurgeh feels fit to play the game of azad to the very best of his ability i thank your highness again we are pleased that jernau gurgeh was not badly injured and has been able to attend this audience nicosar said he nodded briefly to gurgeh and then looked to a courtier waiting impatiently to one side gurgeh stood bowed and backed away you only have to take four backward steps before you turn your back on him flereimsaho told him otherwise very good they were back in gurgehs room ill try and remember next time he said anyway sounds like youre in the clear i did a bit of overhearing while you had your têteàtête courtiers usually know whats going on seems they found an apex trying to escape through the forest from the maser and the exocontrols hed dropped the gun they gave him to defend himself with which was just as well because it was a bomb not a gun so they got him alive he broke under torture and implicated one of hamins cronies who tried to bargain with a confession so they started on hamin you mean they tortured him only a little hes old and they had to keep him alive for whatever punishment the emperor decided on the apex exocontroller and some other henchman have been impaled the pleabargaining cronys getting caged in the forest to await the incandescence and hamins being deprived of age drugs hell be dead in forty or fifty days gurgeh shook his head hamin i didnt think he was that frightened of me well hes old they have funny ideas sometimes do you think im safe now yes the emperor wants you alive so he can destroy you on the azad boards nobody else would dare harm you you can concentrate on the game anyway ill look after you gurgeh looked disbelievingly at the buzzing drone he could detect no trace of irony in its voice gurgeh and nicosar started the first of the lesser games three days later there was a curious atmosphere about the final match a sense of anticlimax pervaded castle klaff normally this last contest was the culmination of six years work and preparation in the empire the very apotheosis of all that azad was and stood for this time the imperial continuance was already settled nicosar had ensured his next great year of rule when hed beaten vechesteder and jhilno though as far as the rest of the empire knew the emperor still had to play krowo to decide who wore the imperial crown even if gurgeh did win the game it would make no difference save for some wounded imperial pride the court and the bureau would put it down to experience and make sure they didnt invite any more decadent but sneaky aliens to take part in the holy game gurgeh suspected that many of the people still in the fortress would as soon have left echronedal to head back to eä but the coronation ceremony and the religious confirmation still had to be witnessed and nobody would be allowed to leave echronedal until the fire had passed and the emperor had risen from its embers probably only gurgeh and nicosar were really looking forward to the match even the observing gameplayers and analysts were disheartened at the prospect of witnessing a game they were already barred from discussing even amongst themselves all gurgehs games past the point he had supposedly been knocked out were taboo subjects they did not exist the imperial games bureau was already hard at work concocting an official final match between nicosar and krowo judging by their previous efforts gurgeh expected it to be entirely convincing it might lack the ultimate spark of genius but it would pass so everything was already settled the empire had new star marshals though a little shuffling would be required to replace yomonul new generals and admirals archbishops ministers and judges the course of the empire was set and with very little change from the previous bearing nicosar would continue with his present policies the premises of the various winners indicated little discontent or new thinking the courtiers and officials could therefore breathe easily again knowing nothing would alter too much and their positions were as secure as theyd ever be so instead of the usual tension surrounding the final game there was an atmosphere more like that of an exhibition match only the two contestants were treating it as a real contest gurgeh was immediately impressed by nicosars play the emperor didnt stop rising in gurgehs estimation the more he studied the apexs play the more he realised just how powerful and complete an opponent he was facing he would need to be more than lucky to beat nicosar he would need to be somebody else from the beginning he tried to concentrate on not being trounced rather than actually defeating the emperor nicosar played cautiously most of the time then suddenly hed strike out with some brilliant flowing series of moves that looked at first as though theyd been made by some gifted madman before revealing themselves as the masterstrokes they were perfect answers to the impossible questions they themselves posed gurgeh did his best to anticipate these devastating fusions of guile and power and to find replies to them once theyd begun but by the time the minor games were over thirty days or so before the fire was due nicosar had a considerable advantage in pieces and cards to carry over to the first of the three great boards gurgeh suspected his only chance was to hold out as best he could on the first two boards and hope that he might pull something back on the final one the cinderbuds towered around the castle rising like a slow tide of gold about the walls gurgeh sat in the same small garden hed visited before then hed been able to look out over the cinderbuds to the distant horizon now the view ended twenty metres away at the first of the great yellow leafheads late sunlight spread the castles shadow across the canopy behind gurgeh the fortress lights were coming on gurgeh looked out to the tan trunks of the great trees and shook his head hed lost the game on the board of origin and now he was losing on the board of form he was missing something some facet of the way nicosar was playing was escaping him he knew it he was certain but he couldnt work out what that facet was he had a nagging suspicion it was something very simple however complex its articulation on the boards might be he ought to have spotted it analysed and evaluated it long ago and turned it to his advantage but for some reason some reason intrinsic to his very understanding of the game he felt sure he could not an aspect of his play seemed to have disappeared and he was starting to think the knock to the head hed taken during the hunt had affected him more than hed first assumed but then the ship didnt seem to have any better idea what he was doing wrong either its advice always seemed to make sense at the time but when gurgeh got to the board he found he could never apply the ships ideas if he went against his instincts and forced himself to do as the limiting factor had suggested he ended up in even more trouble nothing was more guaranteed to cause you problems on an azad board than trying to play in a way you didnt really believe in he rose slowly straightening his back which was hardly sore now and returned to his room flereimsaho was in front of the screen watching a holodisplay of an odd diagram what are you doing gurgeh said lowering himself into a soft chair the drone turned addressing him in marain i worked out a way to disable the bugs we can talk in marain now isnt that good i suppose so gurgeh said still in eächic he picked up a small flatscreen to see what was happening in the empire well you might at least use the language after i went to the trouble of jamming their bugs it wasnt easy you know im not designed for that sort of thing i had to learn a lot of stuff from some of my own files about electronics and optics and listening fields and all that sort of technical stuff i thought youd be pleased utterly and profoundly ecstatic gurgeh said carefully in marain he looked at the small screen it told him of the new appointments the crushing of an insurrection in a distant system the progress of the game between nicosar and krowo krowo wasnt as far behind as gurgeh was the victory won by imperial troops against a race of monsters and higher rates of pay for males who volunteered to join the army what is that youre looking at he said looking briefly at the wallscreen where flereimsahos strange torus turned slowly dont you recognise it the drone said voice pitched to express surprise i thought you would its a model of the reality the oh yes gurgeh nodded and went back to the small screen where a group of asteroids was being bombarded by imperial battleships to quell the insurrection four dimensions and all that he flicked through the subchannels to the game programmes a few of the secondseries matches were still being played on eä well seven relevant dimensions actually in the case of the reality itself one of those lines are you listening hmm oh yes the games on eä were all in their last stages the secondary games from echronedal were still being analysed one of those lines on the reality represents our entire universe surely you were taught all this mm gurgeh nodded he had never been especially interested in spacial theory or hyperspace or hyperspheres or the like none of it seemed to make any difference to how he lived so what did it matter there were some games that were best understood in four dimensions but gurgeh only cared about their own particular rules and the general theories only meant anything to him as they applied specifically to those games he pressed for another page on the small screen to be confronted with a picture of himself once more expressing his sadness at being knocked out of the games wishing the people and empire of azad well and thanking everybody for having him an announcer talked over his faded voice to say that gurgeh had pulled out of the secondseries games on echronedal gurgeh smiled thinly watching the official reality hed agreed to be part of as it gradually built up and became accepted fact he looked up briefly at the torus on the screen and remembered something hed puzzled over years ago now whats the difference between hyperspace and ultraspace he asked the drone the ship mentioned ultraspace once and i never could work out what the hell it was talking about the drone tried to explain using the holomodel of the reality to illustrate as ever it overexplained but gurgeh got the idea for what it was worth flereimsaho annoyed him that evening chattering away in marain all the time about anything and everything after initially finding it rather needlessly complex gurgeh enjoyed hearing the language again and discovered some pleasure in speaking it but the drones high squeaky voice became tiring after a while it only shut up while he had his customary rather negative and depressing gameanalysis with the ship that evening still in marain he had his best nights sleep since the day of the hunt and woke feeling for no good reason he could think of that there might yet be a chance of turning the game around it took gurgeh most of the mornings play to gradually work out what nicosar was up to when eventually he did it took his breath away the emperor had set out to beat not just gurgeh but the whole culture there was no other way to describe his use of pieces territory and cards he had set up his whole side of the game as an empire the very image of azad another revelation struck gurgeh with a force almost as great one reading perhaps the best of the way hed always played was that he played as the culture hed habitually set up something like the society itself when he constructed his positions and deployed his pieces a net a grid of forces and relationships without any obvious hierarchy or entrenched leadership and initially quite profoundly peaceful in all the games hed played the fight had always come to gurgeh initially hed thought of the period before as preparing for battle but now he saw that if hed been alone on the board hed have done roughly the same spreading slowly across the territories consolidating gradually calmly economically of course it had never happened he always was attacked and once the battle was joined he developed that conflict as assiduously and totally as before hed tried to develop the patterns and potential of unthreatened pieces and undisputed territory every other player hed competed against had unwittingly tried to adjust to this novel style in its own terms and comprehensively failed nicosar was trying no such thing hed gone the other way and made the board his empire complete and exact in every structural detail to the limits of definition the games scale imposed it stunned gurgeh the realisation burst on him like some slow sunrise turning nova like a trickle of understanding becoming stream river tide tsunami his next few moves were automatic reactionmoves not properly thoughtout parts of his strategy limited and inadequate though it had been shown to be his mouth had gone dry his hands shook of course this was what hed been missing this was the hidden facet so open and blatant and there for all to see it was effectively invisible too obvious for words or understanding it was so simple so elegant so staggeringly ambitious but so fundamentally practical and so much what nicosar obviously thought the whole game to be about no wonder hed been so desperate to play this man from the culture if this was what hed planned all along even the details nicosar and only a handful of others in the empire knew about the culture and its true size and scope were there included and displayed on the board but probably utterly indecipherable to those who did not already know the style of nicosars board empire was of a complete thing fully shown the assumptions about his opponents forces were couched in terms of fractions of something greater there was too a ruthlessness about the way the emperor treated his own and his opponents pieces which gurgeh thought was almost a taunt a tactic designed to disturb him the emperor sent pieces to their destruction with a sort of joyous callousness where gurgeh would have hung back attempting to prepare and build up where gurgeh would have accepted surrender and conversion nicosar laid waste the difference was slight in some ways no good player simply squandered pieces or massacred purely for the sake of it but the implication of applied brutality was there like a flavour like a stench like a silent mist hanging over the board he saw then that hed been fighting back much as nicosar might have expected him to trying to save pieces to make reasonable considered conservative moves and in a sense to ignore the way nicosar was kicking and slinging his pieces into battle and tearing strips of territory from his opponent like ribbons of tattered flesh in a way gurgeh had been trying desperately not to play nicosar the emperor was playing a rough harsh dictatorial and frequently inelegant game and had rightly assumed something in the culture man would simply not want to be a part of it gurgeh started to take stock sizing up the possibilities while he played a few more inconsequential blocking moves to give himself time to think the point of the game was to win hed been forgetting that nothing else mattered nothing else hung on the outcome of the game either the game was irrelevant therefore it could be allowed to mean everything and the only barrier he had to negotiate was that put up by his own feelings he had to reply but how become the culture another empire he was already playing the part of the culture and it wasnt working and how do you match an emperor as an imperialist he stood there on the board wearing his faintly ridiculous gatheredup clothes and was only distantly aware of everything else around him he tried to tear his thoughts away from the game for a moment looking round the great ribbed prowhall of the castle at the tall open windows and the yellow cinderbud canopy outside at the halffull banks of seats at the imperial guards and the adjudicating officials at the great black hornshapes of the electronic screening equipment directly overhead at the many people in their various clothes and guises all translated into gamethought all viewed as though through some powerful drug which distorted everything he saw into twisted analogs of its latching hold on his brain he thought of mirrors and of reverser fields which gave the more technically artificial but perceivably more real impression mirrorwriting was what it said reversed writing was ordinary writing he saw the closed torus of flereimsahos unreal reality remembered chamlis amalkney and its warning about deviousness things which meant nothing and something harmonics of his thought click switch offswitch on as though he was a machine fall off the edge of the catastrophe curve and never mind he forgot everything and made the first move he saw he looked at the move hed made nothing like what nicosar would have done an archetypally culture move he felt his heart sink hed been hoping for something different something better he looked again well it was a culture move but at least it was an attacking culture move followed through it would wreck his whole cautious strategy so far but it was all he could do if he was to have even the glimmer of a chance of resisting nicosar pretend there really was a lot at stake pretend he was fighting for the whole culture set out to win regardless no matter at least hed found a way to play finally he knew he was going to lose but it would not be a rout he gradually remodelled his whole gameplan to reflect the ethos of the culture militant trashing and abandoning whole areas of the board where the switch would not work pulling back and regrouping and restructuring where it would sacrificing where necessary razing and scorching the ground where he had to he didnt try to mimic nicosars crude but devastating attackescape returninvade strategy but made his positions and his pieces in the image of a power that could eventually cope with such bludgeoning if not now then later when it was ready he began to win a few points at last the game was still lost but there was still the board of becoming where at last he might give nicosar a fight once or twice he caught a certain look on nicosars face when he was close enough to read the apexs expression that convinced him hed done the right thing even if it was something the emperor had somehow expected there was a recognition there now in the apexs expression and on the board and even a kind of respect in those moves an acknowledgement that they were fighting on even terms gurgeh was overcome by the sensation that he was like a wire with some terrible energy streaming through him he was a great cloud poised to strike lightning over the board a colossal wave tearing across the ocean towards the sleeping shore a great pulse of molten energy from a planetary heart a god with the power to destroy and create at will he had lost control of his own drugglands the mix of chemicals in his bloodstream had taken over and his brain felt saturated with the one encompassing idea like a fever win dominate control a set of angles defining one desire the single absolute determination the breaks and the times when he slept were irrelevant just the intervals between the real life of the board and the game he functioned talking to the drone or the ship or other people eating and sleeping and walking around but it was all nothing irrelevant everything outside was just a setting and a background for the game he watched the rival forces surge and tide across the great board and they spoke a strange language sang a strange song that was at once a perfect set of harmonies and a battle to control the writing of the themes what he saw in front of him was like a single huge organism the pieces seemed to move as though with a will that was neither his nor the emperors but something dictated finally by the game itself an ultimate expression of its essence he saw it he knew nicosar saw it but he doubted anybody else could they were like a pair of secret lovers secure and safe in their huge nest of a room locked together before hundreds of people who looked on and who saw but who could not read and who would never guess what it was they were witnessing the game on the board of form came to an end gurgeh lost but he had pulled back from the brink and the advantage nicosar would take to the board of becoming was far from decisive the two opponents separated that act over the final one yet to commence gurgeh left the prowhall exhausted and drained and gloriously happy and slept for two days the drone woke him gurgeh are you awake have you stopped being vague what are you talking about you the game whats going on even the ship couldnt work out what was happening on that board the drone floated above him brown and grey humming quietly gurgeh rubbed his eyes blinked it was morning there were about ten days to go before the fire was due gurgeh felt as though he was waking from a dream more vivid and real than reality he yawned sitting up have i been vague does pain hurt is a supernova bright gurgeh stretched smirking nicosars taking it impersonally he said getting up and padding to the window he stepped out on to the balcony flereimsaho tutted and threw a robe around him if youre going to start talking in riddles again what riddles gurgeh drank in the mild air he flexed his arms and shoulders again isnt this a fine old castle drone he said leaning on the stone rail and taking another deep breath they know how to build castles dont they i suppose they do but klaff wasnt built by the empire they took it off another humanoid species who used to hold a ceremony similar to the one the empire holds to crown the emperor but dont change the subject i asked you a question what is that style youve been very vague and strange the past few days i could see you were concentrating so i didnt press the point but i and the ship would like to be told nicosars taken on the part of the empire hence his style ive had no choice but to become the culture hence mine its that simple it doesnt look it tough think of it as a sort of mutual rape i think you should straighten out jernau gurgeh im gurgeh started to say then stopped to check he frowned in exasperation im perfectly straight you idiot now why dont you do something useful and order me some breakfast yes master flereimsaho said sullenly and dipped back inside the room gurgeh looked up into the empty board of blue sky his mind already racing with plans for the game on the board of becoming flereimsaho watched the man grow even more intense and absorbed in the days between the second and final games he hardly seemed to hear anything that was said to him he had to be reminded to eat and sleep the drone wouldnt have believed it but twice it saw the man sitting with an expression of pain on his face staring at nothing doing a remote ultrasound scan the drone had discovered the mans bladder was full to bursting he had to be told when to pee he spent all day every day gazing intently at nothing or feverishly studying replays of old games and though he might have been briefly undrugged after his long sleep immediately thereafter he started glanding again and didnt stop the drone used its effector to monitor the mans brainwaves and found that even when he appeared to sleep it wasnt really sleep controlled lucid dreaming was what it seemed to be his drugglands were obviously working furiously all the time and for the first time there were more telltale signs of intense druguse on gurgehs body than there were on his opponents how could he play in such a state had it been up to flereimsaho it would have stopped the man playing there and then but it had its orders it had a part to play and it had played it and all it could do now was wait and see what happened more people attended the start of the game on the board of becoming than had attended the previous two the other gameplayers were still trying to work out what was going on in this strange complicated unfathomable game and wanted to see what would happen on this final board where the emperor started with a considerable advantage but on which the alien was known to be especially good gurgeh dived back into the game an amphibian into welcoming water for a few moves he just gloried in the feeling of returning home to his element and the sheer joy of the contest taking delight in a flexing of his strengths and powers the readying tension of the pieces and places then he curved out from that playing to the serious business of the building and the hunting the making and linking and the destroying and cutting the searching and destroying the board became both culture and empire again the setting was made by them both a glorious beautiful deadly killing field unsurpassably fine and sweet and predatory and carved from nicosars beliefs and his together image of their minds a hologram of pure coherence burning like a standing wave of fire across the board a perfect map of the landscapes of thought and faith within their heads he began the slow move that was defeat and victory together before he even knew it himself nothing so subtle so complex so beautiful had ever been seen on an azad board he believed that he knew that he would make it the truth the game went on breaks days evenings conversations meals they came and went in another dimension a monochrome thing a flat grainy image he was somewhere else entirely another dimension another image his skull was a blister with a board inside it his outside self just another piece to be shuffled here and there he didnt talk to nicosar but they conversed they carried out the most exquisitely textured exchange of mood and feeling through those pieces which they moved and were moved by a song a dance a perfect poem people filled the gameroom every day now engrossed in the fabulously perplexing work taking shape before them trying to read that poem see deeper into this moving picture listen to this symphony touch this living sculpture and so understand it it goes on until it ends gurgeh thought to himself one day and at the same time as the banality of the thought struck him he saw that it was over the climax had been reached it was done destroyed could be no more it was not finished but it was over a terrible sadness swamped him took hold of him like a piece and made him sway and nearly fall so that he had to walk to his stoolseat and pull himself on to it like an old man oh he heard himself say he looked at nicosar but the emperor hadnt seen it yet he was looking at elementcards trying to work out a way to alter the terrain ahead of his next advance gurgeh couldnt believe it the game was over couldnt anybody see that he looked despairingly around the faces of the officials the spectators the observers and adjudicators what was wrong with them all he looked back at the board hoping desperately that he might have missed something made some mistake that meant there was still something nicosar could do that the perfect dance might last a little longer he could see nothing it was done he looked at the time shown on the pointboard it was nearly time to break for the day it was a dark evening outside he tried to remember what day it was the fire was due very soon wasnt it perhaps tonight or tomorrow perhaps it had already been no even he would have noticed the great high windows of the prowhall were still unshuttered looking out into the darkness where the huge cinderbuds waited heavy with fruit over over over his their beautiful game over dead what had he done he put his clenched hands over his mouth nicosar you fool the emperor had fallen for it taken the bait entered the run and followed it to be torn apart near the high stand storms of splinters before the fire empires had fallen to barbarians before and no doubt would again gurgeh knew all this from his childhood culture children were taught such things the barbarians invade and are taken over not always some empires dissolve and cease but many absorb many take the barbarians in and end up conquering them they make them live like the people they set out to take over the architecture of the system channels them beguiles them seduces and transforms them demanding from them what they could not before have given but slowly grow to offer the empire survives the barbarians survive but the empire is no more and the barbarians are nowhere to be found the culture had become the empire the empire the barbarians nicosar looked triumphant pieces everywhere adapting and taking and changing and moving in for the kill but it would be their own deathchange they could not survive as they were wasnt that obvious they would become gurgehs or neutrals their rebirth his to deliver over a prickling sensation began behind his nose and he sat back overcome by the sadness of the games ending and waiting for tears none came a suitable reprimand from his body for using the elements so well and water so much he would drown nicosars attacks the emperor played with fire and would be extinguished no tears for him something left gurgeh just ebbed away burned out relaxing its grip on him the room was cool filled with a spirit fragrance and the rustling sound of the cinderbud canopy outside beyond the tall wide windows people talked quietly in the galleries he looked around and saw hamin sitting in the college seats the old apex looked shrunken and dolllike a tiny withered husk of what hed been face lined and body misshapen gurgeh stared at him was this one of their ghosts had he been there all the time was he still alive the unbearably old apex seemed to be staring fixedly at the centre of the board and for one absurd instant gurgeh thought the old creature was already dead and theyd brought his desiccated body into the prowhall as some sort of trophy a final ignominy then the horn sounded for the end of the evenings play and two imperial guards came and wheeled the dying apex away the shrunken grizzled head looked briefly in his direction gurgeh felt as though hed been somewhere far away on a great journey hed just returned from he looked at nicosar consulting with a couple of his advisors as the adjudicators noted the closing positions and the people in the galleries stood up and started chattering did he imagine that nicosar looked concerned even worried perhaps so he felt suddenly very sorry for the emperor for all of them for everybody he sighed and it was like the last breath of some great storm that had passed through him he stretched his arms and legs stood again he looked at the board yes over hed done it there was much left to do a lot still to happen but nicosar would lose he could choose how he lost fall forward and be absorbed fall back and be taken over go berserk and raze everything but his boardempire was finished he met the emperors gaze for a moment he could see from the expression there that nicosar hadnt fully realised yet but he knew the apex was reading him in return and could probably see the change in the man sense the sense of victory gurgeh lowered his gaze from that hard sight and turned away and walked out of the hall there was no acclaim there were no congratulations nobody else could see flereimsaho was its usual concerned annoying self but it too hadnt spotted anything and still inquired how he thought the game was going he lied the limiting factor thought things were building up to a head he didnt bother to tell it hed expected more of the ship though he ate alone mind blank he spent the evening swimming in a pool deep inside the castle carved out of the rock spur the fortress had been built upon he was alone everybody else had gone to the castle towers and the higher battlements or had taken to aircars watching the distant glow in the sky to the west where the incandescence had begun gurgeh swam until he felt tired then dried dressed in trous shirt and a light jacket and went for a walk round the castles curtain wall the night was dark under a covering of cloud the great cinderbuds higher than the outer walls closed off the distant light of the approaching incandescence imperial guards were out ensuring that nobody started the fire early gurgeh had to prove to them he wasnt carrying anything which could produce a spark or flame before they would let him out of the castle where shutters were being readied and the walkways were damp from tests of the sprinkler systems the cinderbuds creaked and rustled in the windless gloom exposing new tinderdry surfaces to the rich air barklayers unpeeling from the great bulbs of flammable liquid that hung beneath their topmost branches the night air was saturated by the heady stench of their sap a hushed feeling layover the ancient fortress a religious mood of awed anticipation which even gurgeh would experience as a tangible change in the place the swooshings of returning aircars coming in over a dampeddown swathe of forest to the castle reminded gurgeh that everybody was supposed to be in the castle by midnight and he went back slowly drinking in the atmosphere of still expectation like something precious that could not last for long or perhaps ever be again still he wasnt tired the pleasant fatigue from his swim had become just a sort of background tingle in his body and so when he climbed the stairs to the level of his room he didnt stop but kept going up even as the horn sounded to announce midnight gurgeh came out at last on to a high battlement beneath a stubby tower the circular walkway was damp and dark he looked to the west where a dim fuzzy red glow lit up the edge of the sky the incandescence was still far away below the horizon its glare reflecting off the overcast like some livid artificial sunset despite that light gurgeh was conscious of the depth and stillness of the night as it settled round the castle quieting it he found a door in the tower and climbed to its machicolated summit he leant on the stonework and looked out into the north where the low hills lay he listened to the dripping of a leaking sprinkler somewhere beneath him and the barely audible rustlings of the cinderbuds as they prepared for their own destruction the hills were quite invisible he gave up trying to make them out and turned again to that barelycurved band of dark red in the west a horn sounded somewhere in the castle then another and another there were other noises too distant shouting and running footsteps as though the castle was waking up again he wondered what was going on he pulled the thin jacket closed suddenly feeling the coolness of the night as a light easterly breeze started up the sadness hed felt during the day had not fully left him rather it had sunk in become something less obvious but more integral how beautiful that game had been how much he had enjoyed it exulted in it but only by trying to bring about its cessation only by ensuring that that joy would be shortlived he wondered if nicosar had realised yet he must have had a suspicion at least he sat down on a small stone bench gurgeh realised suddenly that he would miss nicosar he felt closer to the emperor in some ways than he had ever felt to anybody that game had been a deep intimacy a sharing of experience and sensation gurgeh doubted any other relationship could match he sighed eventually got up from the bench and went to the parapet again looking down to the paved walk at the foot of the tower there were two imperial guards standing there dimly visible by the light spilling from the towers open door their pale faces were tipped up looking at him he wasnt sure whether to wave or not one of them lifted his arm a bright light shone up at gurgeh who shielded his eyes a third smaller darker figure gurgeh hadnt noticed before moved towards the tower and entered it through the lit doorway the torch beam switched off the two guards took up positions on either side of the tower door steps sounded within the tower gurgeh sat on the stone bench again and waited morat gurgeh good evening it was nicosar the dark slightly stooped figure of the emperor of azad climbed up out of the tower your highness sit down gurgeh the quiet voice said nicosar joined gurgeh on the bench his face like an indistinct white moon in front of him lit only by the faint glow from the towers stairwell gurgeh wondered if nicosar could see him at all the moonface turned away from him looking towards the horizonwide smudge of carmine there has been an attempt on my life gurgeh the emperor said quietly an gurgeh began appalled are you all right your highness the moonface swung back i am unharmed the apex held up one hand please no your highness now were alone there is no breach of protocol i wanted to explain to you personally why the castle is under martial law the imperial guard have taken over all commands i do not anticipate another attack but one must take care but who would do this who would attack you nicosar looked to the north and the unseen hills we believe the culprits may have tried to escape along the viaduct to the reservoir lakes so ive sent some guards there too he turned slowly back to the man and his voice was soft thats an interesting situation youve got me in morat gurgeh i gurgeh sighed looked at his feet yes he glanced at the circle of white face in front of him im sorry i mean that its almost over he heard his voice drop and could not bear to look at nicosar well the emperor said quietly we shall see i may have a surprise for you in the morning gurgeh was startled the hazily pale face in front of him was too vague for the expression to be read but could nicosar be serious surely the apex could see his position was hopeless had he seen something gurgeh hadnt at once he started to worry had he been too certain nobody else had noticed anything not even the ship what if he was wrong he wanted to see the board again but even the imperfectly detailed image of it he still carried in his mind was accurate enough to show how their respective fortunes stood nicosars defeat was implicit but certain he was sure there was no way out for the emperor the game must be over tell me something gurgeh nicosar said evenly the white circle faced him again how long were you really learning the game for we told you the truth two years intensively but dont lie to me gurgeh theres no point any more nicosar i wouldnt lie to you the moonface shook slowly whatever you want the emperor was silent for a few moments you must be very proud of your culture he pronounced the last word with a distaste gurgeh might have found comical if it hadnt been so obviously sincere pride he said i dont know i didnt make it i just happened to be born into it i dont be simple gurgeh i mean the pride of being part of something the pride of representing your people are you going to tell me you dont feel that i some perhaps yes but im not here as a champion nicosar im not representing anything except myself im here to play the game thats all thats all nicosar repeated quietly well i suppose we must say that youve played it well gurgeh wished he could see the apexs face had his voice quivered was that a tremor in his voice thank you but half the credit for this game is yours more than half because you set i dont want your praise nicosar lashed out with one hand striking gurgeh across the mouth the heavy rings raked the mans cheek and lips gurgeh rocked back stunned dizzy with shock nicosar jumped up and went to the parapet hands like claws on the dark stone gurgeh touched his blooded face his hand was trembling you disgust me morat gurgeh nicosar said to the red glow in the west your blind insipid morality cant even account for your own success here and you treat this battlegame like some filthy dance it is there to be fought and struggled against and youve attempted to seduce it youve perverted it replaced our holy witnessing with your own foul pornography youve soiled it male gurgeh dabbed at the blood on his lips he felt dizzy head swimming that that may be how you see it nicosar he swallowed some of the thick salty blood i dont think youre being entirely fair to fair the emperor shouted coming to stand over gurgeh blocking the view of the distant fire why does anything have to be fair is life fair he reached down and took gurgeh by the hair shaking his head is it is it gurgeh let the apex shake him the emperor let go of his hair after a moment holding his hand as though hed touched something dirty gurgeh cleared his throat no life is not fair not intrinsically the apex turned away in exasperation clutching again at the curled stone top of the battlements its something we can try to make it though gurgeh continued a goal we can aim for you can choose to do so or not we have im sorry you find us so repulsive for that repulsive is barely adequate for what i feel for your precious culture gurgeh im not sure i possess the words to explain to you what i feel for your culture you know no glory no pride no worship you have power ive seen that i know what you can do but youre still impotent you always will be the meek the pathetic the frightened and cowed they can only last so long no matter how terrible and awesome the machines they crawl around within in the end you will fall all your glittering machinery wont save you the strong survive thats what life teaches us gurgeh thats what the game shows us struggle to prevail fight to prove worth these are no hollow phrases they are truth gurgeh watched the pale hands grasping the dark stone what could he say to this apex were they to argue metaphysics here now with the imperfect tool of language when theyd spent the last ten days devising the most perfect image of their competing philosophies they were capable of expressing probably in any form what anyway was he to say that intelligence could surpass and excel the blind force of evolution with its emphasis on mutation struggle and death that conscious cooperation was more efficient than feral competition that azad could be so much more than a mere battle if it was used to articulate to communicate to define hed done all that said all that and said it better than he ever could now you have not won gurgeh nicosar said quietly voice harsh almost croaking your kind will never win he turned back looking down at him you poor pathetic male you play but you dont understand any of this do you gurgeh heard what sounded like genuine pity in the apexs voice i think youve already decided that i dont he told nicosar the emperor laughed turning back to the distant reflection of the continentwide fire still below the horizon the sound died in a sort of cough he waved one hand at gurgeh your sort never will understand youll only be used he shook his head in the darkness go back to your room morat ill see you in the morning the moonface stared towards the horizon and the ruddy glare rubbed on the undersurface of the clouds the fire should be here by then gurgeh waited a moment it was as though hed already gone he felt dismissed forgotten even nicosars last words had sounded as if they werent really meant for gurgeh at all the man rose quietly and went back down through the dimly lit tower the two guards stood impassively outside the door at the towers foot gurgeh looked up to the top of the tower and saw nicosar there on the battlements flat pale face looking out towards the approaching fire white hands clutching at cold stone the man watched for a few seconds then turned and left going down through the corridors and halls where the imperial guards prowled sending everybody to their rooms and locking the doors watching all the stairs and elevators and turning on all the lights so that the silent castle burned in the night like some great stone ship on a darkly golden sea flereimsaho was flicking through the broadcast channels when gurgeh got back to his room it asked him what all the fuss was about in the castle he told it cant be that bad the drone said with a wobbleshrug it looked back at the screen they arent playing martial music no outgoing communications possible though what happened to your mouth i fell mmhmm can we contact the ship of course tell it to power up we might need it my youre getting cautious all right he went to bed but lay awake listening to the swelling roar of the wind at the top of the high tower the apex watched the horizon for several hours seemingly locked into the stone like a pale statue or a small tree born of an errant seed the wind from the east freshened tugging at the stationary figures dark clothes and howling round the darkbright castle tearing through the canopy of swaying cinderbuds with a noise like the sea the dawn came up it lit the clouds first then touched the edge of clear horizon in the east with gold at the same time in the black fastness of the west where the edge of the land glowed red a sudden glint of bright burning orangeyellow appeared to waver and hesitate and disappear then return and brighten and spread the figure on the tower drew back from that widening breach in the redblack sky and glancing briefly behind him at the dawn swayed uncertainly for a moment as though caught between the rival currents of light flowing from each bright horizon two guards came to the room they unlocked the door and told gurgeh he and the machine were required in the prowhall gurgeh was dressed in his azad robes the guards told him it was the emperors pleasure that they abandon the statutory robes for this mornings play gurgeh looked at flereimsaho and went to change he put on a fresh shirt and the trous and light jacket hed worn the previous night so im getting a chance to spectate at last what a treat flereimsaho said as they headed for the gamehall gurgeh said nothing guards were escorting groups of people from various parts of the castle outside beyond already shuttered doors and windows the wind howled gurgeh hadnt felt like breakfast the ship had been in contact that morning to congratulate him it had finally seen in fact it thought there was a way out for nicosar but only to a draw and no human brain could handle the play required it had resumed its highspeed holding pattern ready to come in the moment it sensed anything wrong it watched through flereimsahos eyes when they got to the castles prowhall and the board of becoming nicosar was already there the apex wore the uniform of the commanderinchief of the imperial guard a severe subtly menacing set of clothes complete with ceremonial sword gurgeh felt quite dowdy in his old jacket the prowhall was almost full people escorted by the ubiquitous guards were still filing into the tiered seats nicosar ignored gurgeh the apex was talking to an officer of the guard hamin gurgeh said going over to where the old apex sat in the front row of seats his tiny twisted body crumpled and hopeless between two burly guards his face was shrivelled and yellow one of the guards put out his hand to stop gurgeh coming any closer he stood in front of the bench squatting to look into the old rectors wrinkled face hamin can you hear me he thought again absurdly that the apex was dead then the small eyes flickered and one opened yellowred and sticky with crystalline secretions the shrunkenlooking head moved a little gurgeh the eye closed the head nodded gurgeh felt a hand on his sleeve and he was led to his seat at the edge of the board the prowhalls balcony windows were closed the panes rattling in their metal frames but the fire shutters had not been lowered outside beneath a leaden sky the tall cinderbuds shook in the gale and the noise of the wind formed a bass background to the subdued conversations of the shuffling people still finding their places in the great hall shouldnt they have put the shutters down gurgeh asked the drone he sat in the stoolseat flereimsaho floated buzzing and crackling behind him the adjudicator and his helpers were checking the positions of the pieces yes flereimsaho said the fires less than two hours away they can drop the shutters in the last few minutes if they have to but they dont usually wait that long id watch it gurgeh legally the emperor isnt allowed to call on the physical option at this stage but theres something funny going on i can sense it gurgeh wanted to say something cutting about the drones senses but his stomach was churning and he felt something was wrong too he looked over at the bench where hamin sat the withered apex hadnt moved his eyes were still closed something else flereimsaho said what theres some sort of extra gear up there on the ceiling gurgeh glanced up without making it too obvious the jumble of ecm and screening equipment looked much as it always had but then hed never inspected it very closely what sort of gear he asked gear that is worryingly opaque to my senses which it shouldnt be and that guards colonels wired with an opticremote mike the officer talking to nicosar yes isnt that against the rules supposed to be want to raise it with the adjudicator the adjudicator was standing at the edge of the board between two burly guards he looked frightened and grim when his gaze fell on gurgeh it seemed to go straight through him i have a feeling gurgeh whispered it wouldnt do any good me too want me to get the ship to come in can it get here before the fire just gurgeh didnt have to think too long do it he said signal sent you remember the drill with the implant vividly great flereimsaho said sourly a highspeed displace from a hostile environment with some greyarea effector gear around just what i need the hall was full the doors were closed the adjudicator glanced resentfully over at the guards colonel standing near nicosar the officer gave the briefest of nods the adjudicator announced the recommencement of the game nicosar made a couple of inconsequential moves gurgeh couldnt see what the emperor was aiming at he must be trying to do something but what it didnt appear to have anything to do with winning the game he tried to catch nicosars eye but the apex refused to look at him gurgeh rubbed his cut lip and cheek im invisible he thought the cinderbuds swayed and shook in the storm outside their leaves had spread to their maximum extent and whipped by the gale they looked indistinct and merged like one huge dull yellow organism quivering and poised beyond the castle walls gurgeh could sense people in the hall moving restlessly muttering to each other glancing at the still unshuttered windows the guards stayed at the halls exits guns ready nicosar made certain moves placing elementcards in particular positions gurgeh still couldnt see what the point of all this was the noise of the storm beyond the shaking windows was enough to all but drown the voices of the people in the hall the smell of the cinderbuds volatile saps and juices pervaded the air and some dry shreds of their leaves had found their way in to the hall somehow to soar and float and curl on currents of air inside the great hall high in the stonedark sky beyond the windows a burning orange glow lit up the clouds gurgeh began to sweat he walked over the board made some replying moves attempting to draw nicosar out he heard somebody in the observers gallery crying out and then being quieted the guards stood silently watchfully at the doors and around the board the guards colonel nicosar had been talking to earlier stood near the emperor as he went back to his stoolseat gurgeh thought he saw tears on the officers cheeks nicosar had been sitting now he stood and taking four elementcards strode to the centre of the patterned terrain gurgeh wanted to shout out or leap up something anything but he felt rooted transfixed the guards in the room had tensed the emperors hands were visibly shaking the storm outside whipped the cinderbuds like something conscious and spiteful a spear of orange leapt ponderously above the tops of the plants writhed briefly against the wall of darkness behind it then sank slowly out of sight oh dear holy shit flereimsaho whispered thats only five minutes away what gurgeh glanced at the machine five minutes the drone said with a realistic gulp it ought to be nearly an hour off it cant have got here this quick theyve started a new firefront gurgeh closed his eyes he felt the tiny lump under his paperdry tongue the ship he said opening his eyes again the drone was silent for seconds no chance it said voice flat resigned nicosar stooped he placed a firecard on a watersymbol already on the board in a fold in the high terrain the guards colonel turned his head fractionally to one side mouth moving as though blowing some speck of dust off his uniforms high collar nicosar stood up looking around appeared to listen for something but heard only the howling noise of the storm i just registered an infrasound pulse flereimsaho said that was an explosion a klick to north the viaduct gurgeh watched helplessly as nicosar walked slowly to another position on the board and placed one card on another fire on air the colonel talked into the mike near his shoulder again the castle shook a series of concussions shuddered through the hall the pieces on the board juddered people stood up started shouting the glass panes cracked in their frames crashing to the flagstones letting the shrieking voice of the burning gale into the hall in a hail of fluttering leaves a line of flames burst out over the tops of the trees filling the base of the boiling black horizon with fire the next firecard was placed on earth the castle seemed to shift under gurgeh the wind tore in through windows rolling lighter pieces across the board like some absurd and unstoppable invasion it whipped at the robes of the adjudicator and his officials people were piling out of the galleries falling over each other to get to the exits where the guards had drawn their guns the sky was full of fire nicosar looked at gurgeh as he placed the final firecard on the ghostelement life this is looking worse and worse all grrreeeeee flereimsaho said voice breaking screeching gurgeh whirled round to see the bulky machine trembling in midair surrounded by a bright aura of green fire the guards started shooting the doors from the hall were thrown open and the people piled through but in the hall the guards were suddenly all over the board itself firing up into the galleries and benches blasting laserfire amongst the escaping crowds felling the screaming struggling apices females and males in a storm of flickering light and shattering detonations grrraaaaak flereimsaho screamed its casing glowed dull red and started to smoke gurgeh watched transfixed nicosar stood near the centre of the boards surrounded by his guards smiling at gurgeh the fire raged above the cinderbuds the hall emptied as a last few wounded people staggered through the doors flereimsaho hung in the air it glowed orange yellow white it started to rise dripping blobs of molten material on to the board as it went enveloped suddenly in flames and smoke suddenly it accelerated across the hall as if pulled by some huge invisible hand it slammed into a far wall and exploded in a blinding flash and a blast that almost blew gurgeh off his stoolseat the guards around the emperor left the board and climbed over the benches and galleries killing the wounded they ignored gurgeh the sound of firing echoed through the doors leading to the rest of the castle where the dead lay in their bright clothes like some obscene carpet nicosar strolled slowly over to gurgeh stopping to tap a few azad pieces out of his way with his boots as he advanced he stamped on a little guttering pool of fire left from the molten debris flereimsaho had trailed behind it he drew his sword almost casually gurgeh clutched the arms of the seat the inferno shrieked in the skies outside leaves swirled through the hall like dry endless rain nicosar stopped in front of gurgeh the emperor was smiling he shouted above the gale surprised gurgeh could hardly speak what have you done why he croaked nicosar shrugged made the game real gurgeh he looked round the hall surveying the carnage they were alone now the guards were spreading through the rest of the castle killing the fallen were everywhere scattered over the floor and the galleries draped over benches crumpled in corners spread like xs on the flagstones their robes spotted with the dark buroholes of laserburns smoke rose from the splintered woodwork and smouldering clothes a sweetsick smell of bummed flesh filled the hall nicosar weighed the heavy doubleedged sword in his gloved hand smiling sadly at it gurgeh felt his bowels ache and his hands shake there was a strange metallic taste in his mouth and at first he thought it was the implant rejecting surfacing for some reason reappearing but then he knew that it wasnt and realised for the first time in his life that fear really did have a taste nicosar gave an inaudible sigh drew himself up in front of gurgeh so that he seemed to fill the view in front of the man and brought the sword slowly towards gurgeh drone he thought but it was just a sooty scar on the far wall ship but the implant under his tongue lay silent and the limiting factor was still light years away the tip of the sword was a few centimetres from gurgehs belly it started to rise passing slowly over gurgehs chest towards his neck nicosar opened his mouth as though he was about to say something but then he shook his head as though in exasperation and lunged forward gurgeh kicked out slamming both feet into the emperors belly nicosar doubled up gurgeh was thrown backwards off the seat the sword hissed over his head gurgeh kept on rolling as the stoolseat crashed to the ground he jumped to his feet nicosar was half doubledup but still clutched the sword he staggered towards the man hacking the sword about him as though at invisible enemies between them gurgeh ran to the side at first then across the board heading for the hall doors behind him outside the windows the fire above the thrashing cinderbuds obliterated the black clouds of smoke the heat was something physical a pressure on the skin and eyes one of gurgehs feet came down on a gamepiece rolled across the board by the gale he slipped and fell nicosar stumbled after him the screening equipment whined then hummed smoke gouted from it blue lightning played furiously around the hanging machinery nicosar didnt notice he plunged forward at gurgeh who pushed himself away the sword crashed into the board centimetres from the mans head gurgeh picked himself up and leapt over a raised section of board nicosar came tearing and trampling after him the screening gear exploded it crashed from the ceiling to the board in a shower of sparks and smashed into the centre of the multicoloured terrain a few metres in front of gurgeh who was forced to stop and turn he faced nicosar something white blurred through the air nicosar raised the sword over his head the blade snapped clipped off by a flickering yellowgreen field nicosar felt the weight of the sword change and looked up in disbelief the blade dangled uselessly in midair suspended from the little white disk that was flereimsaho ha ha ha it boomed above the noise of the screaming wind nicosar threw the swordhandle at gurgeh a greenyellow field caught it propelled it back at nicosar the emperor ducked he staggered across the board in a storm of smoke and swirling leaves the cinderbuds thrashed flashes of white and yellow burst from between their trunks as the wall of flames above them beat towards the castle gurgeh flereimsaho said suddenly in front of his face crouch down and curl up now gurgeh did as he was told getting down on his haunches arms wrapped around his shins the drone floated above him and gurgeh saw the haze of a field all around him the wall of cinderbuds was breaking the streaks and bursts of flame clawing through from behind them shaking them tearing them the heat seemed to shrivel his face on the bones of his skull a figure appeared against the flames it was nicosar holding one of the big laserpistols the guards had been armed with he stood just within and to the side of the windows holding the gun in both hands and sighting carefully at gurgeh gurgeh looked at the black muzzle of the gun into the thumbwide barrel then his gaze moved up to nicosars face as the apex pulled the trigger then he was looking at himself he stared into his own distorted face just long enough to see that jernau morat gurgeh at the very instant that might have been his death looked only rather surprised and not a little stupid then the mirrorfield disappeared and he was looking at nicosar again the apex stood in exactly the same place swaying slightly now there was something wrong though something had changed it was very obvious but gurgeh couldnt see what it was the emperor went back on his heels eyes staring blankly up at the smokestained ceiling where the screening gear had fallen from then the furnace gust from the windows caught him and he tipped slowly forwards again tipping towards the board the weight of the handcannon in his gloved hands unbalancing him gurgeh saw it then the neat slightly smoking black hole about wide enough to fit a thumb into in the centre of the apexs forehead nicosars body hit the board with a crash scattering pieces the fire broke through the cinderbud dam gave way before the flames and was replaced by a vast wave of blinding light and a blast of heat like a hammer blow then the field around gurgeh went dark and the room and all the fire went dim and far away at the back of his head there was a strange buzzing noise and he felt drained and empty and exhausted after that everything went away from him and there was only darkness gurgeh opened his eyes he was lying on a balcony under a jutting overhang of stone the area around him had been swept clear but everywhere else there was a centimetrethick covering of dark grey ash it was dull the stones beneath him were warm the air was cool and smoky he felt all right no drowsiness no sore head he sat up something fell from his chest and rolled across the swept stones falling into the grey dust he picked it up it was the orbital bracelet bright and undamaged and still keeping its own microscopic daynight cycle he put it into his jacket pocket he checked his hair his eyebrows his jacket nothing singed at all the sky was dark grey black at the horizon away to one side there was a small vaguely purple disk in the sky which he realised was the sun he stood up the grey ash was being covered up with inky soot falling from the dark overcast like negative snow he walked across the heatwarped flaking flagstones towards the edge of the balcony the parapet had fallen away here he kept back from the very edge the landscape had changed instead of the golden yellow wall of cinderbuds crowding the view beyond the curtain wall there was just earth black and brown and bakedlooking covered in great cracks and fissures the thin grey ash and the sootrain had not yet filled the barren waste stretched to the distant horizon faint wisps of smoke still climbed from fissures in the ground climbing like the ghosts of trees until the wind took them the curtain wall was blackened and scorched and breached in places the castle itself looked battered as though after a long siege towers had collapsed and many of the apartments office buildings and extra halls had fallen in on themselves their flamescarred windows showing only emptiness behind columns of smoke rose lazily like sinuous flagpoles to the summit of the crumbling fortress where the wind caught them and made them pennants gurgeh walked round the balcony through the soft black snow of soot to the prowhall windows his feet made no noise the specks of soot made him sneeze and his eyes itched he entered the hall the stones still held their dry heat it was like walking into a vast dark oven inside the great gameroom amongst the dim shambles of twisted girders and fallen stonework the board lay warped and buckled and torn its rainbow of colours reduced to greys and blacks its carefully balanced topography of high ground and low made a nonsense of by the random heavings and saggings induced by the fire buckled annealed girders and holes in the floor and walls marked where the observation galleries had been the screening gear which had fallen from the ceiling of the hall lay halfmelted and congealed in the centre of the azad board like some blistered travesty of a mountain he turned to look at the window where nicosar had stood and walked over the creaking surface of the ruined board he crouched down grunting as his knees sent stabs of pain through him he put his hand out to where an eddy in the firestorm had collected a little conical pile of dust in the angle of an internal buttress right at the edge of the gameboard near where a fused lshaped lump of blackened metal might have been the remains of a gun the greywhite ash was soft and warm and mixed in with it he found a small cshaped piece of metal the halfmelted ring still contained the setting for a jewel like a tiny rough crater on its rim but the stone was gone he looked at the ring for a while blowing the ash off it and turning it over and over in his hands after a while he put the ring back into the pile of dust he hesitated then he took the orbital bracelet out of his jacket pocket and added it to the shallow grey cone pulled the two poisonwarning rings off his fingers and put them there too he scooped a handful of the warm ash into one palm gazing at it thoughtfully jernau gurgeh good morning he turned and rose quickly stuffing his hand into his jacket pocket as though ashamed of something the little white body of flereimsaho floated in through the window very tiny and clean and exact in that shattered melted place a tiny grey thing the size of a babys finger floated up to the drone from the ground near gurgehs feet a hatch opened in flereimsahos immaculate body the micromissile entered the drone a section of the machines body revolved then was still hello gurgeh said walking over to it he looked round the ruined hall then back at the drone i hope youre going to tell me what happened sit down gurgeh ill tell you he sat on a block of stone fallen from above the windows he looked dubiously upwards at where it must have fallen from dont worry flereimsaho said youre safe ive checked the roof gurgeh rested his hands on his knees so he said first things first flereimsaho said allow me to introduce myself properly my name is sprant flereimsaho wuhandrahen xato trabiti and i am not a library drone gurgeh nodded he recognised some of the nomenclature chiark hub had been so impressed with long ago he didnt say anything if i had been a library drone youd be dead even if youd escaped nicosar youd have been incinerated a few minutes later i appreciate that gurgeh said thank you his voice sounded flat wrung out and not especially grateful i thought theyd got you killed you damn nearly did the drone said that firework display was for real nicosar must have got his hands on some equivtech effector gear which means or meant the empire has had some sort of contact with another advanced civilisation ive scanned whats left of the equipment could be homomda stuff anyway the shipll load it for further analysis where is the ship i thought wed be on it not still down here it came barrelling through half an hour after the fire hit could have snapped us both off but i reckoned we were safer staying where we were i had no trouble insulating you from the fire and keeping you under with my effector was easy enough too the ship popped us a couple of spare drones and kept on going braking and turning its on its way back now should be overhead in five minutes we can go safely back up in the module like i said displacement can be risky gurgeh gave a sort of halflaugh through his nose he looked around the dim hall again im still waiting he told the machine the imperial guards went crazy on nicosars orders they blew up the aqueduct cisterns and shelters and killed everybody they could find they tried to take over the invincible from the navy too in the resulting onboard firefight the ship crashed came down somewhere in the northern ocean biggish splash tsaunamis swept away rather a lot of mature cinderbuds but i dare say the firell cope there was no attempt to kill nicosar the other night that was just a ruse to get the whole castle and the game under the control of guards whod do anything the emperor told them why though gurgeh said tiredly kicking at a blister of board metal why did nicosar order them to do all that he told them it was the only way to defeat the culture and save him they didnt know he was doomed too they thought he had some way of saving himself maybe theyd have done it regardless even knowing that they were very highly trained anyway they obeyed their orders the machine made a chuckling noise most of them anyway a few left the shelter they were supposed to blow up intact and got some people into it with them so youre not unique there are some other survivors mostly servants nicosar made sure an the important people were in here the ships drones are with the survivors were keeping them locked up until youre safely away theyll have enough rations to last until theyre rescued go on you sure you can handle an this stuff right now just tell me why gurgeh said sighing youve been used jernau gurgeh the drone said matteroffactly the truth is you were playing for the culture and nicosar was playing for the empire i personally told the emperor the night before the start of the last match that you really were our champion if you won we were coming in wed smash the empire and impose our own order if he won wed keep out for as long as he was emperor and for the next ten great years anyway thats why nicosar did all he did he wasnt just a sore loser hed lost his empire he had nothing else to live for so why not go in a blaze of glory was all that true gurgeh asked would we really have taken over gurgeh flereimsaho said i have no idea not in my brief no need to know it doesnt matter he believed it was true slightly unfair pressure gurgeh said smiling without any humour at the machine telling somebody theyre playing for such high stakes just the night before the game gamespersonship so why didnt he tell me what we were playing for guess the bet would have been off and we came in all guns blazing anyway correct gurgeh shook his head brushed a little soot off one jacket sleeve smudging it you really thought id win he asked the drone against nicosar you thought that even before i got here before you left chiark gurgeh as soon as you showed any interest in leaving scs been looking for somebody like you for quite a while the empires been ripe to fall for decades it needed a big push but it could always go coming in all guns blazing as you put it is almost never the right approach azad the game itself had to be discredited it was what had held the empire together all these years the linchpin but that made it the most vulnerable point too the drone made a show of looking around at the mangled debris of the hall everything worked out a little more dramatically than wed expected i must admit but it looks like all the analyses of your abilities and nicosars weaknesses were just about right my respect for those great minds which use the likes of you and me like gamepieces increases all the time those are very smart machines they knew id win gurgeh asked disconsolately chin in hand you cant know something like that gurgeh but they must have thought you stood a good chance i had some of it explained to me in my briefing they thought you were just about the best gameplayer in the culture and if you got interested and involved then there wasnt much any azad player could do to stop you no matter how long theyd spent playing the game youve spent all your life learning games there cant be a rule move concept or idea in azad you havent encountered ten times before in other games it just brought them all together these guys never stood a chance all you needed was somebody to keep an eye on you and give you the occasional nudge in the right direction at the appropriate times the drone dipped briefly a little bow yours truly all my life gurgeh said quietly looking past the drone to the dull dead landscape outside the tall windows sixty years and how long has the culture known about the empire about ah youre thinking we shaped you somehow not so if we did that sort of thing we wouldnt need outsider mercenaries like shohobohaum za to do the really dirty work za gurgeh said not his real name not cultureborn at all yes hes what youd call a mercenary just as well too or the secret police would have shot you outside that tent remember timid little me nipping out the way id just shot one of your assailants with my crew on high xray so it wouldnt register on the cameras za broke the neck of another one hed heard there might be some trouble hell probably be leading a guerrilla army on eä in a couple of days from now i imagine the drone gave a little wobble in the air lets see what else can i tell you oh yes the limiting factor isnt as innocent as it looks either while we were on the little rascal we did take out the old effectors but only so we could put in new ones just two in two of the three nose blisters we put the empty one on clear and holos of empty blisters in the other two but i was in all three gurgeh protested no you were in the same one three times the ship just rotated the corridors housing fiddled with the ag and had a couple of drones change things round a bit while you were going from one to the other or rather down one corridor up another and back to the same blister all for nothing mind you but if we had needed some heavy weaponry it would have been there its forward planning that makes one feel safe dont you think oh yes gurgeh said sighing he got to his feet and went back out on to the balcony where the black sootsnow fell steadily and quietly talking about the limiting factor flereimsaho said cheerily the old reprobate is overhead now modules on its way well have you aboard in a minute or two you can have a nice wash and change out of those dirty clothes are you ready to leave gurgeh looked down at his feet scuffed some of the soot and ash across the flagstones what is there to pack not a lot indeed i was too busy keeping you from baking to go in search of your belongings anyway the only thing you seem to be fond of is that tatty old jacket did you get that bracelet thing i left it on your chest when i went exploring yes thanks gurgeh said gazing out at the flat black desolation stretching to the dark horizon he looked up the module burst through the deep brown overcast trailing strands of vapour thanks gurgeh said again as the module swooped dropping almost to ground level then racing across the scorched desert towards the castle drawing a plume of ash and soot off the ground in its wake as it slowed and started to turn and the noise of its supersonic plummet cracked round the forlorn fortress like toolate thunder thanks for everything the craft swung its rear towards the castle floating up until it was level with the edge of the balcony parapet its rear door opened made a flat ramp the man walked across the balcony stepped up on to the parapet and into the cool interior of the machine the drone followed and the door closed the module blasted suddenly away sucking a great swirling fountain of ash and soot after it as it climbed flashing through the dark clouds above the castle like some solid lightning bolt while its thunder broke across the plain and the castle and the low hills behind ash settled again the soot continued its soft and gentle fall the module returned a few minutes later to pick up the ships drones and the remains of the alien effector equipment then left the castle for the last time and rose again to its waiting ship a little while later the small band of dazed survivors released by the two ships drones and mostly servants soldiers concubines and clerks stumbled into the daytime night and the sootlikesnow to take stock of their temporary exile in the once great fortress and claim their vanished land the passed pawn lazymatching dullsiding the ship went slowly through one end of a tensor field three million kilometres long over a wall of monocrystal then started to float down through the gradually thickening atmosphere of the plate from five hundred kilometres up the two slabs of land and sea the one beyond them of raw rock under deep cloud and the one beyond that of still forming land showed clear in the night air beyond its crystal wall the farthest plate was very new dark and void to normal sight the ship could see on it the illuminating radars of the landscaping machines as they moved their cargoes of rock in from space even as the vessel watched a huge asteroid was detonated in the darkness producing a slow fountain of redglowing molten rock which fell slowly to the new surface or was caught and held moulded in the vacuum before it was allowed to settle the plate beside it was dark too and near the bottom of its squared off funnel a blanket of clouds covered it completely as its rawness was weathered the other two plates were much older and twinkled with lights chiark was at aphelion gevant and osmolon were white on black islands of snow on dark seas the old warship slowly submerged itself in the atmosphere floating down the bladeflat slope of the plate wall to where the real air began then set out over the ocean for the land a seaship a liner on that ocean and bright with lights blasted its horns and set off fireworks as the limiting factor went over a kilometre up the ship saluted too using its effectors to produce artificial auroras roaring shifting folds of light in the clear still air above it then the two ships sailed on into the night it had been an uneventful journey back the man gurgeh had wanted to be stored at once saying he didnt want to be awake during the journey back he wanted sleep rest a period of oblivion the ship had insisted he think it over first even though it had the equipment ready after ten days it had relented and the man whod become increasingly morose during that time went thankfully into a dreamless low metabolism sleep he hadnt played a single game of any description during those ten days hardly said a word couldnt even bother to get dressed and spent most of his time just sitting staring at walls the drone had agreed that putting him to sleep for the journey was probably the kindest thing they could do theyd crossed the lesser cloud and met with the range class gsv so much for subtlety which was heading back for the main galaxy the inward journey had taken longer than the outward but thered been no hurry the ship had left the gsv near the higher reaches of a galactic limb and cut down and across past stars dustfields and nebulae where the hydrogen migrated and the suns formed and in the ships domain of unreal space the holes were pillars of energy from fabric to grid it had woken the man up slowly two days out from his home he still sat and stared at the walls he didnt play any games catch up on any news or even deal with his mail at his request it hadnt signalled ahead to any of his friends just sent one permissiontoapproach burst to chiark hub it dropped a few hundred metres and followed the line of the fjord slipping silently between the snowcovered mountains its sleek hull reflecting a little bluegrey light as it floated over the dark still water a few people on yachts or in nearby houses saw the big craft as it cruised quietly by and watched it manoeuvre its bulk delicately between bank and bank water and patchy cloud ikroh was dark and unlit caught in the starshadow of the three hundred and fifty metre length of silent craft above it gurgeh took a last look round the cabin hed been sleeping in fitfully for the last couple of ship nights then walked slowly down the corridor to the module blister flereimsaho followed him with one small bag wishing the man would change out of that horrible jacket it saw him into the module and came down with him the lawn in front of the dark house was pure white and untouched the module lowered to within a centimetre of it then opened its rear door gurgeh stepped out and down the air was fragrant and sharp a tangible clarity his feet made cramping creaking noises in the snow he turned back to the lit interior of the module flereimsaho gave him his bag he looked at the small machine goodbye he said goodbye jernau gurgeh i dont expect we shall ever meet again i suppose not he stepped back as the door started to swing closed and the craft began to rise very slowly then he took a couple of quick steps backwards until he could just see the drone over the rising lip of the door and shouted one thing when nicosar fired that gun and the ray came off the mirrorfield and hit him was that coincidence or did you aim it he thought it wasnt going to answer him but just before the door closed and the wedge of light thrown over it disappeared with the rising craft he heard the drone say i am not going to tell you he stood and watched the module float back to the waiting ship it was taken inside the blister closed and the limiting factor went black its hull a perfect shadow darker than the night a pattern of lights came on along its length spelling farewell in marain then it started to move rising noiselessly upwards gurgeh watched it until the stillshown lights were just a set of moving stars and fast receding in a sky of ghostly clouds then he looked down at the faintly bluegrey snow when he looked up again the ship had gone he stood for a while as though waiting after a time he turned and tramped across the white lawn to the house he went in through the windows the house was warm and he shivered suddenly in his cool clothes for a second then suddenly the lights went on boo yay meristinoux leapt out from behind a couch by the fire chamlis amalkney appeared from the kitchen with a tray hello jernau i hope you dont mind gurgehs pale pinched face broke into a smile he put his bag down and looked at them both yay freshfaced and grinning leaping over the couch and chamlis fields orangered setting the tray down on the table before the banked fire yay thudded into him arms round him hugging him laughing she drew back gurgeh yay hello he said dropping his bag and hugging her how are you she asked squeezing him are you all right we annoyed hub until it told us you were definitely coming but youve been asleep all this time havent you you didnt even read my letters gurgeh looked away no ive got them but i havent he shook his head looked down im sorry never mind yay patted his shoulder she kept one arm round him and took him to the couch he sat looking at them both chamlis broke up the damp sawdust banking on the fire releasing the flames beneath yay spread her arms showing off short skirt and waistcoat changed havent i gurgeh nodded yay looked as well and handsome as ever and androgynous just changing back she said another few months and ill be back where i started ah gurgeh you should have seen me as a man i was dashing he was unbearable chamlis said pouring some mulled wine from a potbellied jug yay threw herself on to the couch beside gurgeh hugging him again and making a growling noise in her throat chamlis handed them gently steaming goblets of wine gurgeh drank gratefully i didnt expect to see you he told yay i thought youd gone away i went away yay nodded gulping her wine i came back last summer chiarks getting another platepair i put in some plans and now im team coordinator for farside congratulations floating islands yay looked blank for a second then laughed into her goblet no floating islands gurgeh plenty of volcanoes though chamlis said sniffily sucking a thread of wine from a thimblesized container perhaps one little one yay nodded her hair was longer than he remembered blueblack still as curly she punched him gently on the shoulder its good to see you again gurgeh he squeezed her hand looked at chamlis good to be back he said then fell silent staring at the burning logs in the fireplace were all glad youre back gurgeh chamlis said after a while but if you dont mind my saying so you dont look too good we heard you were in storage for the last couple of years but theres something else what happened out there weve heard all sorts of reports do you want to talk about it gurgeh hesitated gazing at the leaping flames consuming the jumbled logs in the fire he put his glass down and started to explain he told them all that happened from the first few days aboard the limiting factor to the last few days again on the ship as it powered out of the disintegrating empire of azad chamlis was quiet and its fields changed slowly through many colours yay grew slowly more concernedlooking she shook her head frequently gasped several times and looked ill twice in between she kept the fire stocked with logs gurgeh sipped his lukewarm wine so i slept all the way back until two days out and now it all seems i dont know deepfrozen not fresh but not decayed yet not gone he swilled the wine around in his goblet his shoulders shook with a halfhearted laugh oh well he drained his glass chamlis lifted the jug from the ashes at the front of the fire and refilled gurgehs goblet with the hot wine jernau i cant tell you how sorry i am this was all my fault if i hadnt no gurgeh said not your fault i got myself into it you did warn me dont ever say that dont ever think it was anybodys responsibility but mine he got up suddenly and walked to the fjordside windows looking down the slope of snowcovered lawn to the trees and the black water and over it to the mountains and the scattered lights of the houses on the far shore you know he said as though talking to his own reflection in the glass i asked the ship yesterday exactly what they did do about the empire in the end how they went in to sort it out it said they didnt even bother fell apart all on its own he thought of hamin and monenine and inclate and atsen and bermoiya and za and olos and krowo and the girl whose name hed forgotten he shook his head at his image in the glass anyway its over he turned back to yay and chamlis and the warm room whats the gossip here so they told him about haffliss twins both talking now and boruelal leaving to go gsving for a few years and olz hap breaker of not a few young hearts being more or less acclaimedembarrassedforced into boruelals old post and yay fathering a child a year back hed get to meet mother and child next year probably when they came for an extended visit and one of shuros pals being killed in a combat game two years back and ren myglan becoming a man and chamlis still hard at work on the reference text for its pet planet and tronze festival the year before last ending in disaster and chaos after some fireworks blew up in the lake and swamped half the cliffside terraces two people dead brains splattered over lumps of stonework hundreds injured last years hadnt been half so exciting gurgeh was listening to all this as he wandered round the room reacquainting himself with it nothing much seemed to have changed what a lot ive miss he began then noticed the little wooden plaque on the wall and the object mounted on it he reached out touched it took it down from the wall ah chamlis said making what was almost a coughing noise i hope you dont mind i mean i hope you dont think thats too irreverent or tasteless i just thought gurgeh smiled sadly touching the lifeless surfaces of the body that had once been mawhrinskel he turned back to yay and chamlis walking over to the old drone not at all but i dont want it do you yes please gurgeh presented the heavy little trophy to chamlis who went red with pleasure you vindictive old horror yay snorted this means a great deal to me chamlis said primly holding the plaque close to its casing gurgeh put his glass back on the tray a log collapsed in the fire showering sparks up gurgeh crouched and poked at the remaining logs he yawned yay and the drone exchanged looks then yay reached out and tapped gurgeh with one foot come on jernau youre tired chamlis has to head back home and make sure its new fishes havent eaten each other is it all right if i stay here gurgeh looked surprised at her smiling face and nodded when chamlis left yay put her head on gurgehs shoulder and said shed missed him a lot and five years was a long time and he looked a lot more cuddleable than when hed gone away and if he wanted if he wasnt too tired she used her mouth and on her forming body gurgeh traced slow movements rediscovering sensations hed almost forgotten stroking her golddark skin caressing the odd almost comic unbuddings of her now concaving genitals making her laugh laughing with her and in the long moment of climax with her then too still one their every tactile cell surging to a single pulse as though alight still he didnt sleep and in the night got up out of the tousled bed he went to the windows and opened them the cold night air spilled in he shivered pulled on the trous jacket and shoes yay moved and made a small noise he closed the windows and went back to the bed crouching down in the darkness beside her he pulled the covers over her exposed back and shoulder and moved his hand very gently through her curls she snored once and stirred then breathed quietly on he crossed to the windows and went quickly outside closing them silently behind him he stood on the snowcovered balcony gazing at the dark trees descending in uneven rows to the glittering black fjord the mountains on the far side shone faintly and above them in the crisp night dim areas of light moved on the darkness occluding starfields and the farside plates the clouds drifted slowly and down at lkroh there was no wind gurgeh looked up and saw amongst the clouds the clouds their ancient light hardly wavering in the cold calm air he watched his breath go out before him like a damp smoke between him and those distant stars and shoved his chilled hands into the jacket pockets for warmth one touched something softer than the snow and he brought it out a little dust he looked up from it at the stars again and the view was warped and distorted by something in his eyes which at first he thought was rain no not quite the end theres still me i know ive been naughty not revealing my identity but then maybe youve guessed and who am i to deprive you of the satisfaction of working it out for yourself who am i indeed yes i was there all the time well more or less all the time i watched i listened i thought and sensed and waited and did as i was told or asked to maintain the proprieties i was there all right in person or in the shape of one of my representatives my little spies to be honest i dont know whether id have liked old gurgeh to have found out the truth or not still undecided on that one i must confess i we left it to chance in the end for example just supposing chiark hub had told our hero the exact shape of the cavity in the husk that had been mawhrinskel or gurgeh had somehow opened that lifeless casing and seen for himself would he have thought that little diskshaped hole a mere coincidence or would he have started to suspect well never know if youre reading this hes long dead had his appointment with the displacement drone and been zapped to the very livid heart of the system corpse blasted to plasma in the vast erupting core of chiarks sun his sundered atoms rising and falling in the raging fluid thermals of the mighty star each pulverised particle migrating over the millennia to that planetswallowing surface of blinding stormswept fire to boil off there and so add their own little parcels of meaningless illumination to the encompassing night ah well getting a bit flowery there still an old drone should be allowed such indulgences now and again dont you think let me recapitulate this is a true story i was there when i wasnt and when i didnt know exactly what was going on inside gurgehs mind for example i admit that i have not hesitated to make it up but its still a true story would i lie to you as ever sprant flereimsaho wuhandrahen xato trabiti mawhrinskel end
