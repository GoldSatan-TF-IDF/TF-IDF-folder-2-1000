chapter one when phileas fogg meets passepartout london let me begin by introducing a mysterious english gentleman called phileas fogg most people dont know very much about him but because he does the same thing every day some people think they know everything about him he is very handsome and he is a true gentleman he is certainly rich but no one knows how he made his money has he ever been to another country he can name a lot of countries on a world map and he knows the most incredible things about them he probably travelled at one time but some people insist that he has not left london for many years maybe he only travels in his head he is a very private man and he does not have many friends the only time he speaks to other people is at the reform club where he goes to read newspapers and play cards he does not play to win he plays for the enjoyment of the game he often wins but he does not keep the money he gives it to charity he likes to see his games as a challenge a challenge that does not require any physical effort he has lunch at the reform club every day in the same room at the same table he goes home at midnight he lives in his house in savile row a good address in central london no one ever goes there except his manservant who must always be on time and be completely loyal to phileas fogg in fact this very morning his manservant lost his job because the water he brought phileas fogg was too hot to shave with and this is where our story begins phileas fogg was sitting in his armchair waiting for his new manservant at some time between eleven and half past eleven at exactly half past eleven mr fogg goes to the reform club he looked up at the hands of the large clock by the wall that counted every second with a loud tick there was a knock at the door and a young man of about thirty came in you say that you are french but your name is john asked phileas fogg looking at him carefully jean sir not john said the young man jean passepartout i am an honest man sir and i must tell you that i havent been a manservant all my life i was a physical education teacher and a music teacher then i became a singer i once rode a horse in a circus and for a time i worked for the fire brigade in paris i found out that a certain mr fogg was looking for a manservant he is a very clever careful man they told me you wont find a quieter man in all of england he does the same thing every day and so i came here to ask about the job in the hope of finally being able to live a quiet life yes someone at the reform club told you this i believe probably the same person who told me about you do you understand what type of person im looking for yes sir i do and i think im perfect for the job well then what time is it now eleven twentytwo mr fogg passepartout replied taking his pocketwatch out of a small side pocket exactly four minutes late noted phileas fogg looking at his own watch so lets say you started working for me as from eleven twentysix phileas fogg stood up from his armchair picked up his hat and went out of the door without saying another word from this brief introduction passepartout was able to make note of his employer he was about forty years old an elegant man with an attractive gentle face he was tall with blond hair and a moustache he was the sort of person who remained incredibly calm even under pressure he had gentle eyes that fixed you with a firm stare he never seemed upset or worried he was a typical englishman it was always difficult to guess an englishmans true feelings and our frenchman passepartout had an attractive face and he was incredibly strong he had blue eyes and untidy curly brown hair he was a sweet person who understood the meaning of true friendship and loyalty it was just after half past eleven and passepartout who was now alone in his new home decided to look around after looking in all the different rooms he finally came to his own bedroom above the fireplace there was an electric clock it was the same electric clock that phileas fogg had in his room the two clocks ticked at the exact same second below the clock there was a piece of paper listing the details of mr foggs day not bad at all thought passepartout a man who is as regular as clockwork this is just what i was looking for chapter two when phileas fogg makes a bet october every day phileas fogg left his house at half past eleven he put his right foot in front of his left foot times he knew the exact length of every step and he put his left foot in front of his right foot times before arriving at the steps of the reform club he usually waited a little before having lunch at thirteen minutes to one then he went to the lounge room where he spent the afternoon reading the newspapers at five oclock he had afternoon tea and at twenty to six it was time to go to the games room to play cards with other wealthy and respected members of the club like sir ralph gautier and andrew stuart on this particular day andrew stuart started to read a story to them from the evening newspaper about a robbery at the bank of england the robbery took place on september the thief stole fiftyfive thousand pounds while the head cashier was busy writing a receipt for just a few pence englands best detectives were looking for the thief after hearing that the bank of england was offering a reward of two thousand pounds to the person who was able to catch the thief from the first investigations into the robbery they knew only one thing for certain he was an elegant wellspoken gentleman while the other members of the club sat at the table ready to play their game of cards andrew stuart continued to talk about the robbery where do you think the thief is hiding he could be anywhere the world is so big it isnt so big anymore replied phileas fogg what do you mean said andrew stuart with a laugh the earth doesnt get any smaller ah but the earth is smaller said sir ralph gautier if you think that we can now go around it ten times quicker than we could one hundred years ago did you know that today a man can travel around the world in only three months eighty days to be exact phileas fogg corrected him eighty days asked a surprised man at the table well maybe thats true but only if you dont consider bad weather storms shipwrecks and other things said another in eighty days considering all possible events continued phileas fogg ah you think so do you mr fogg laughed sir ralph well ill bet four thousand pounds that a journey like that is impossible in such a short time i repeat that it is possible to do the journey in that time said phileas fogg his eyes fixed on sir ralphs smile well if you are so certain then do it yourself i will replied phileas fogg when immediately and ill bet not four but twenty thousand pounds that i can go around the world in eighty days i will return here in hours or if you prefer minutes do you agree to the bet they all looked at one another they could not decide if he was serious we agree they said good ill take the train for dover at a quarter to nine this evening the bet starts as from phileas fogg took a small notebook and pencil from his pocket and made a note october pm and i will return here to the reform club at eight fortyfive on saturday december if i am not here by that time this cheque for twenty thousand pounds is yours gentlemen and with these words he left the cheque for twenty thousand pounds on the table picked up his hat and went out of the door at ten to eight his manservant was surprised to see his new employer come through the door passepartout were leaving in ten minutes were taking a train to dover he said from there a boat leaves for calais at eleven oclock tonight were going to go around the world in eighty days we havent another second to lose his employer did not seem to be in a hurry the opposite in fact he spoke a little quicker but he behaved in the same calm way around the world said passepartout to himself well really he thought shaking his head just when he finally thought he had the perfect job he wanted to work for phileas fogg because he was a gentleman who lived a quiet life who always did the same things and now how could this be a quiet life pack a small bag with just my night things in it please and pack one for yourself we can buy everything else when we need it added phileas fogg and with these orders he left the room passepartout continued to feel a little confused but he followed his masters orders he quickly packed their bags and at eight oclock they were ready to leave the house phileas fogg opened passepartouts bag and put twenty thousand pounds into it he closed it tightly twenty minutes later they were at the station it must be the money for the journey thought passepartout as he sat on the train thinking nervously about the money in his bag he did not want to lose the bag after being in the newspapers phileas foggs journey wasnt a secret soon everybody in london was talking about phileas foggs departure and his plan to go around the world in eighty days some people thought he was mad others said he was a genius but a few days later the front pages had another story a certain inspector fix a detective for scotland yard said he knew the identity of the thief all the evidence pointed in one direction to a wellknown and respectable member of the reform club mr phileas fogg chapter three when gentlemen are thieves october inspector fix was one of the detectives investigating the robbery at the bank of england in his years as a detective he knew only one thing for certain all the biggest criminals looked like respectable gentlemen the money the quick departure it all made sense phileas fogg was a respectable gentleman and he inspector fix wanted to get the reward for catching him he soon discovered that phileas fogg was on the mongolia a ship that sailed from brindisi in italy to bombay in india our detective decided to look carefully at all the people getting on and off the mongolia on wednesday october inspector fix saw phileas fogg and his manservant as they arrived in the suez canal so theres our thief he whispered all i need to do now is to tell scotland yard and wait for a warrant for his arrest and then the reward is mine fix decided to speak to foggs manservant egypt is a beautiful country began the inspector yes thats true but we are travelling so quickly replied passepartout why are you travelling so quickly surely you cant see egypt in only a few days my master wants to travel around the world in eighty days he said looking at the detectives confused face i know its complete madness well your master is an unusual man but i imagine he must be very rich to try to do a journey like that in such a short time to tell you the truth he has the money he needs but i really must leave we have a boat to catch good day mr fix my name is ins mr fix and i believe that we are possibly going the same way are you also going to bombay yes we are sorry not to introduce myself my names jean passepartout im sure well see each other again passepartout touched his hat and waved goodbye his conversation with passepartout made inspector fix feel even more certain that phileas fogg was the thief i must stop him he thought but how without the warrant for his arrest it was impossible and he could escape again he was worried phileas fogg on the other hand was carefully planning his journey he kept detailed notes of the date the length of each part of the journey the time and the places they stopped in on october the ship left suez for the next stop bombay the sea was rough but phileas fogg was not worried and soon found people on the ship to play cards with on october they arrived in bombay phileas fogg and his manservant left the ship and went to the station to catch the train to calcutta on their way there passepartout began to think about his masters bet he felt worried yes it was true they were two days early but anything could still happen the train left bombay on time three days later the train stopped at a small village passepartout heard the train driver shout everyone must get off the railway line ends here the railway line from bombay to calcutta was not yet finished the passengers had to travel to the next station allahabad on their own people who often travelled between the two towns were quick to find a way to continue their journey among the different types of transport there were little carts pulled by cows and ponies and rickshaws pulled by bicycles or the men from the village passepartout was worried about how to get to the next station but phileas fogg immediately found a man with an elephant and after a short discussion the man sold him the elephant for a very high price and the two travellers were soon on their way to the next station with a guide and the elephant called kiouni at about nine oclock that night our adventurers came to a big forest of palm trees where they had to stop to let kiouni rest and eat the leaves from the trees for a few days they slept in huts in the middle of the jungle sometimes they heard the cries of the monkeys and the sound of the tigers their journey was going well until the elephant suddenly stopped chapter four when our adventurers rescue a woman from certain death october they stopped near a village where they heard the sound of strange musical instruments their guide went to discover what was happening and he was soon back with the news the people of the village their guide said were celebrating a local tradition called suttee our travellers immediately wanted to know more about it the guide told them that when a womans husband dies his wife must die with him and they burn her alive in a big fire the name of the woman is mrs aouda he told them and shes very beautiful everyone knows her she is from a rich family her father was a businessman in a town near bombay her parents sent her to a european school in bombay she learnt european languages there and she has european ways her parents died and she had to marry an old prince she became a widow after only three months they are taking her to the pagoda tonight they are going to burn her alive tomorrow at sunrise my goodness how terrible do such traditions still exist asked phileas fogg he seemed surprised but his voice sounded curious poor woman whispered passepartout we can still save her said phileas fogg we are a few hours ahead of time yes but sir if we save this woman theyll try and kill us said their guide i can only speak for myself but i am prepared to take that risk replied phileas fogg me too said passepartout when they arrived they started to plan the rescue unfortunately there were guards all around the pagoda and so they decided that it was too dangerous to do anything they were about to leave when passepartout said that maybe he had an idea when the sun came up the next day the crowd arrived to see the bonfire ready for the sacrifice our travellers disappeared among the people they saw the dead prince and his young wife through the smoke phileas fogg prepared himself to run towards the fire in a final effort to save mrs aouda when suddenly a terrified cry came from the crowd her husband was not dead he stood up in the flames took his wife in his hands and ran in the opposite direction to the crowd it was not difficult to imagine phileas foggs surprise when he later discovered that the womans husband was passepartout a few moments later our heroes disappeared into the forest with their new travelling companion followed by the angry guards mrs aouda slowly started to wake up when they reached the station at allahabad phileas fogg thanked his guide for his loyalty and gave him the elephant for a young guide an elephant like kiouni was a big present he could make a lot more money now that he had his own elephant he was very happy and continued to thank mr fogg and the others until they left on the train to calcutta phileas fogg and passepartout told mrs aouda all about their adventure mrs aouda couldnt believe it these men risked their lives for her at seven oclock they arrived in calcutta the ship for hong kong did not leave until twelve oclock midday fortunately they were still on time inspector fix was also on his way to hong kong how did he know they were there how did he get there that remains a mystery but one thing was sure inspector fix was determined to arrest phileas fogg and he had a plan he just had to wait a little longer after the ship stopped for a short time in singapore it continued on its way to hong kong where on the morning of november a boat going to yokohama in japan was waiting for them unfortunately they arrived a day later than planned because of a bad storm oh no thought passepartout the boat will leave without us and my master wont win his bet when they were at the port phileas fogg and passepartout walked towards the captain of a small boat when does the next boat to yokohama leave fogg asked tomorrow morning he replied didnt it leave this morning no they had to repair it so its not leaving until tomorrow passepartout was very happy to hear this good news and shook the captains hand the captain was a little surprised phileas fogg simply wrote how late they were in his diary november minus hours chapter five when passepartout becomes an acrobat november hong kong was the last country they travelled to under british law this was the inspectors final opportunity to get an arrest warrant for phileas fogg it was not difficult to imagine his anger when he discovered that the british officials in hong kong knew nothing about the warrant and told him he had to wait for it his only chance to arrest phileas fogg was to keep him in hong kong but how while he was thinking about this fix recognised passepartout walking down the steps of the carnatic the ship which was taking them to yokohama an excited inspector fix ran towards him nice to meet you again mr fix we met in egypt in the suez he shook his hand he was a little out of breath im sorry mr fix but i really dont have time to talk said passepartout and he continued walking of course i wont stop you but tell me do you always go everywhere so quickly i need to go back to the hotel to tell my master that the carnatic isnt leaving tomorrow morning the repairs are complete and the ship is going to leave tonight oh i understand but let me walk with you on the way to your hotel said inspector fix the two men talked about hong kong and their journey suddenly fix had an idea maybe i can stop passepartout from telling phileas fogg about the ship and then the ship will leave without him he thought to himself its still early inspector fix began why dont we have a drink monsieur passepartout i know a nice place near the hotel im sure we can stop for a drink its difficult to find a good friend to talk to after such a long journey away from home well just one drink said passepartout who was enjoying his conversation with inspector fix when they were inside the bar the detectives plan was complete he ordered the drinks and asked the barman to make a very strong drink for passepartout less than an hour later passepartout was drunk and fell asleep at the table ah phileas fogg will never know about the ship now he said to himself and now mr fogg i just need to wait until i have the warrant for your arrest and it wont be long now you can be certain of that the next day when phileas fogg woke up he was a little surprised to see that passepartout was not there he packed the suitcases himself and paid the hotel bill then he went straight to the port with mrs aouda but passepartout was not there how strange thought phileas fogg but he showed no surprise to find that the carnatic was not at the port in fact he did not seem worried about the departure of the ship or his manservant instead he went to speak to the captains of the different boats in the port inspector fix who was waiting for phileas fogg followed behind the carnatic was on its way to yokohama what was phileas foggs new plan fix saw him pay the captain of a small ship who agreed to leave immediately oh no thought inspector fix he always thinks of something that thief he cant escape not now fix was very angry and upset he walked up and down near the ship until phileas fogg noticed the poor man are you looking for a ship too my good man he asked were going to japan if thats the direction youre going in youre welcome to come with us thank you sir thats very kind of you my ship left early and i am in a terrible situation in fact i was just thinking about how i could find another ship to take me to yokohama replied inspector fix he was amazed at his good luck but he was worried that things were not going exactly as he planned he was determined to catch his thief ill have to follow fogg around the world if thats the only way i can catch him he thought but where was our friend passepartout passepartout woke up in the bar a few hours later his head hurt and he could not remember anything except that he came into a bar with someone he met and that he talked to a man about the ship the carnatic was leaving that evening he looked at his watch oh no he thought im late mr fogg will be at the port now he ran to the boat and got on he looked everywhere for mr fogg and mrs aouda but he could not see them it was then that he started to remember his afternoon with the man he met at the port but of course he thought mr fogg doesnt know how could he i was still in that bar with mr fix and then i it was too late the ship was already sailing towards yokohama he felt very bad this was terrible his master was losing his bet because of him and he did not have a penny in his pocket when he arrived in yokohama he walked around the streets trying to decide what to do soon he felt hungry and he decided to sell his elegant european jacket and buy an old japanese one but the money was not enough he needed money to eat and to sleep and above all to return home just when he thought the situation was hopeless he saw an advertisement for a circus dont miss batulcars circus the last show before the circus moves to america acrobats clowns lions tigers and much more what luck thought passepartout ill go to the circus owner if he lets me go with them i can go to america and from there to england so you say youre from paris said mr batulcar a big man with a bald head and a moustache he looked at passepartout carefully yes a true parisian from paris replied passepartout well you know how to make funny faces then said mr batulcar smiling from the corners of his moustache passepartout did not understand what he meant err yes he said uncertainly good then you can start as a clown said mr batulcar and then you can do other jobs if we need an extra man you can look after the tigers for example passepartout was not very happy about this offer but he needed the job that night an acrobat was ill and passepartout had to take his place as part of a human pyramid passepartout was at the bottom of the pyramid and he had to carry the weight of several men on his shoulders the audience shouted out loudly the drums sounded like a thunderstorm and then the people in the pyramid fell to the floor like a pack of cards what happened passepartout was running towards someone in the audience someone he was very happy to see it was his old employer phileas fogg but how did he get there when fogg and mrs aouda arrived in yokohama a week later they spoke to the captain of the carnatic and found passepartouts name among the list of passengers but his ticket only took him to yokohama phileas fogg and mrs aouda wanted to find passepartout before the ship left for its next destination san francisco inspector fix on the other hand had no choice he went with them and became their friend they looked all over the city but they could not find him anywhere in the end phileas fogg decided he wanted to go and see the circus we havent much time left in the city lets go and see the circus i believe its very good he told the others mr fix and mrs aouda agreed phileas fogg did not see his manservant among the acrobats but his manservant certainly saw him and he left everyone else in the human pyramid in a big group of arms and legs on the floor they had no time to say sorry to a very angry mr batulcar the carnatic was leaving for america chapter six when our friends risk their lives november they were now sailing across the pacific on the carnatic in the direction of san francisco on the journey passepartout started to remember more details about his evening with mr fix and he began to ask questions why did the man try and keep him in the bar for so long why was he doing the exact same journey as them it wasnt an unusual route but why did he also want to do it so quickly was he following them im going for a walk i believe mrs aouda will join me ill see you in the morning at sevenfifteen said phileas fogg interrupting his manservants thoughts his master certainly did not look worried and passepartout decided that he had to think about just one thing his master had to win his bet in the next few days it became clear that mrs aouda was very close to phileas fogg he on the other hand did not seem to notice the beautiful lady by his side when they arrived in san francisco he made a note in his diary tuesday hours ahead wednesday hours behind thursday arrived in san francisco on time the same evening at exactly six oclock our adventurers left san francisco to travel to new york the journey that once took six months to complete now took seven days on the new union pacific railroad that took the passengers from san francisco in the west to omaha in the central state of nebraska from there phileas fogg hoped to continue to new york for the final part of their journey crossing the atlantic to england on december on the train passepartout sat next to inspector fix but he did not want to talk to him he was still confused by his behaviour in the bar and he did not like him after just one hour it started to snow fortunately the snow did not slow down the train however about nine oclock the next morning the train stopped to their amazement it was not because of the snow but because hundreds of buffalos were crossing the tracks in front of the train passepartout became very impatient i cant believe this he shouted this country has a modern railway and the train must stop for a group of animals the train driver told them he had no choice the buffalos were not moving and they could damage the engine they had to wait until the buffalos moved across the tracks three hours later as they went through the mountains in wyoming phileas fogg taught mrs aouda how to play cards mrs aouda was a very patient learner and they were soon so occupied with their games that they did not even seem to notice the deep ravines below them passepartout was looking out of the window thinking about the bet when he almost hit the seat in front of him the train stopped suddenly and gave several loud whistles he got up to see what the problem was he saw the driver talking to a man from the next station a place called medicine bow the station guard sent me to tell you that you cant go any further he said the bridge across the ravine is not safe and it cant take the weight of the train we have sent a telegram to omaha but it will be six hours before another train arrives we cant stay here all night well die of cold in this snow shouted one of the passengers hearing their conversation yes but it will take six hours to go on foot to the next station said the train drivers assistant i think i have an idea said the train driver we can get our train across the bridge if we go fast enough passepartout was interested to hear more if the train moves at its top speed the train wont be as heavy on the bridge he continued and we can get across before the bridge breaks passepartout was worried for himself and the other passengers the bridge could break before the train reached the other side he could not understand why the other passengers seemed to think this was a good idea isnt there a simpler solution perhaps he began to ask the driver the driver was not listening no no this is the best solution we have he said yes but maybe not the safest passepartout tried to explain that he had another idea maybe the passengers can go across the bridge on foot then the train could follow afterwards he said to the train drivers assistant no the driver is right if we go at top speed we can get across the bridge the trains leaving cried his assistant the train driver blew the whistle and the train went back along the tracks about two kilometres then he blew the whistle again the train moved faster and faster as it came closer to the bridge in what seemed like minutes or maybe it was only a few seconds they were over on the other side just in time to see the bridge fall into the deep ravine behind them chapter seven when phileas fogg comes to the rescue december their journey continued across the mountains of colorado with no other surprises at least for now in three days and three nights they travelled more than kilometres the passengers were soon familiar with the delays these only seemed to worry passepartout phileas fogg continued to play cards with mrs aouda while inspector fix slept like a baby his head going up and down with the gentle movement of the train passepartout correctly predicted more problems he was right a few days later a group of sioux indians attacked their train the sioux rode their horses along both sides of the train the passengers heard their battle cries before they arrived many of them knew what was happening the horses of the sioux moved faster than the train and several arrows flew towards the train carriages until finally the train slowed down some of the passengers prepared to defend themselves the sioux jumped on the train their leader tied up the train driver and his assistant together and threw them off the train then they went towards the other carriages theyre coming towards our carriage shouted mrs aouda passepartout bravely hit one of the men over the head with the back of his gun then he left the others to see what he could do to stop the train and ask for help we need to stop the train passepartout told another passenger maybe we can ask for help from a nearby town there are soldiers at fort kearney a few miles away replied the man good said passepartout well stop the train and someone can go and look for help he knew that there was only one way to stop the train to climb under it he opened the door and went under their carriage then with his great strength he pulled himself along the bottom of the other carriages until he finally found the engine above his head he separated the engine from the carriages and the train stopped they were almost at fort kearney the soldiers at fort kearney heard the cries of the sioux and the sound of the guns coming from the train they quickly got on their horses and went to see what was happening the sioux were surprised to see the soldiers who were already shooting at them from the distance lets go said their leader but first take that man who is giving us so much trouble the group rode away on their horses taking two passengers with them and the brave young french man who was trying to save them when the battle was over phileas fogg could not find passepartout the indians took him away said a passenger poor man theyll kill him for sure ill find him and bring him back dead or alive replied phileas fogg mrs aouda looked into his eyes he was her hero he truly was a wonderful person we can save these people but i need help phileas fogg said to the soldiers he left the fort with thirty soldiers and their horses and followed the direction of the sioux mrs aouda and mr fix waited for him at fort kearney it was incredibly cold and the wind was blowing hard inspector fix and mrs aouda sat in the uncomfortable station waiting room trying to keep warm from time to time they looked outside at the snow the darkness of the night started to become morning but she still could not see phileas fogg not long after the sun came up they heard the sound of guns in the distance they stood up worried and looked out of the windows but there was no battle just the sound of celebrations a group of people with phileas fogg in front were coming on horses towards them passepartout and the two other passengers were sitting on the horses behind they looked safe and well mrs aouda ran to meet them inspector fix waited outside the station maybe hes not so clever after all he decided but we must return to england soon and then i can arrest him youre all back safe this is wonderful mrs aouda cried everyone except passepartout looked happy yes were safe but mr fogg will probably lose his bet because of me said passepartout he left them to their celebrations and went to the station to find out about trains to new york whens the next train to new york he asked the next one leaves tonight was the reply but were already over twentyfour hours late if the train leaves tonight well be too late to get the boat passepartout felt very bad he wanted to be a hero and phileas fogg came to rescue him at that moment inspector fix returned with a man he was talking to outside the station this man says he can take us to the station in omaha in his sledge he said we can take a train to new york from there the man had a strange sledge with sails he explained to them that he often took passengers from one station to another in the winter when the snow stopped the trains and that with a good wind behind them they could go a lot faster than the train phileas fogg agreed they had no choice they all climbed onto the sledge the sledge travelled very quickly across the icy flat lands of the central states the passengers were very cold and with an icy wind blowing in their ears they did not speak for most of the journey they were in omaha in less than five hours when they arrived they thanked the man and phileas fogg paid him well fortunately they found a train to chicago and then to new york immediately they arrived in new york two days later at eleven oclock on december they quickly went to the port but the china the ship taking them to liverpool was not there fogg did not look surprised he looked at his watch they were forty five minutes late chapter eight when phileas fogg becomes the captain of a ship december none of the boats in the port of new york were leaving before december too late to arrive at the reform club before eight fortyfive on december passepartout was very upset they were only fortyfive minutes late and he was certain it was his fault phileas fogg did not want passepartout to feel responsible and he simply said well see what happens tomorrow the next day at midday on december with just nine days thirteen hours and fortyfive minutes to return to london phileas fogg went to look for a ship large or small to take them across the atlantic after trying several ships with no success he spoke to the captain of a cargo ship the henrietta when is the ship leaving he asked the captain in an hour he replied where is the ship going to phileas fogg asked to france bordeaux will you take myself and three other passengers to liverpool to liverpool certainly not said the captain looking at him like he was mad this ship must arrive in bordeaux by december phileas fogg thought for a moment ill give you two thousand dollars for each passenger if you take us to bordeaux then he said two thousand dollars each he repeated amazed at such a generous offer he scratched his head why was this man offering him so much money did he have something to hide it was a lot of money he agreed the ship leaves at nine he said two hours later our four travellers were on the henrietta and they were leaving the port of new york on their way to bordeaux the next day on december phileas fogg was the new captain of the ship and the henrietta was going to bordeaux however phileas fogg gave the sailors some money and they agreed to go to liverpool instead the crew locked the captain in his cabin and he was now in there shouting and trying to free himself unsuccessfully his companions were surprised to find that phileas fogg was a good sailor passepartout tried to ask him about this but phileas fogg did not want to talk he had to try and cross the atlantic in stormy weather and his mind was concentrating on arriving in england on time he also did not want to lose the ship and all its crew fix decided that phileas fogg was not just a thief he was a pirate hes not taking the ship to liverpool he thought but to some unknown place where its safe for him to escape if i dont get help from the police there all is lost they were halfway across the atlantic with only five days to go they were going at top speed and everything was going well until one of the men came to speak to phileas fogg if we continue at this speed we wont have enough coal to get the ship to liverpool he said we must slow down we cant replied phileas fogg well burn all the wood on the ship if we have to he told the worried crew member when they came close to ireland only the outside metal of the body of the ship remained the ship could not get to liverpool so they stopped in ireland phileas fogg took the ship to a port called queenstown from there they took a train to dublin and then a ship to liverpool inspector fix did not understand the man what was in liverpool what was in london that he wanted to return for this voyage seemed endless at twenty to midnight on december they finally arrived in liverpool they were exactly six hours away from london enough time to get to the reform club to win the bet inspector fix put his hand on phileas foggs shoulder you are mr phileas fogg is that correct he said yes said phileas fogg slowly he was a little confused by the question phileas fogg i am arresting you in the name of the law he said in a moment two policemen stood next to phileas fogg phileas fogg was very angry you he began i dont like men who have no loyalty to people who help them like his own friends how could you do this when i thought you were an honest person you are worse than a criminal for the first time inspector fix felt bad he did not know what to do now that he did not have to follow phileas fogg around the world he could see that he was not really a bad man but he was a thief and he wanted the reward for his efforts he went out of the room a policeman took phileas fogg away and mrs aouda started crying loudly she put her head on passepartouts shoulder and they left phileas fogg looked at the walls he had no money all his hopes were gone he was in a police station because they thought he was a thief he was losing a lot of money he could only hope for one more amazing event to rescue him it came sooner than he thought passepartout ran back to the police station with mrs aouda then inspector fix arrived too his hair was untidy and he could not breathe mr fogg he cried when he could finally speak mr fogg you are free to go they caught the thief three days ago chapter nine when it is better to travel east december phileas fogg was free and he knew exactly what to do he looked at inspector fix and then he hit him first with one hand then with the other fix fell to the floor passepartout was very happy good he told his master then he turned to inspector fix thats what happens to people who behave like you he shouted at the confused detective they left the police station and went towards the railway station immediately they were in time for the train but the train was late and when they arrived in london they looked up at the clock in euston station to see that it was ten to nine phileas fogg lost his bet by five minutes phileas fogg accepted this in his usual way without showing any particular emotion mrs aouda on the other hand was very emotional she continued to cry she did not know what to do passepartout was also worried for his master and his job it was his masters choice to spend all his money on the bet but he was such a good honest person it was not good to see him like this he still could not stop thinking that it was his fault the next day passepartout followed the same routine except for one thing when they heard the sound of big ben at half past eleven the next day phileas fogg did not go to the reform club the house felt strange it was like no one lived there at about half past seven that evening phileas fogg asked mrs aouda if he could come to her room to speak to her madam he began sadly i wanted to take you back to england with me because i thought i could offer you a good life here now i am a poor man and i have nothing to offer you it was the first time mrs aouda saw phileas fogg looking really sad i know mr fogg and im so sorry you saved my life you took time to rescue me and you lost your bet because of me madam i couldnt let you die that terrible death but now you are here and you need a way to live i have my house and my possessions but what about you i dont need anything maybe your friends could i have no friends he said sadly well what about your relatives i have no relatives it is easier to live in poverty when there are two of us to share it said mrs aouda taking his arm i want to be your wife mr fogg got up mrs aouda saw that there was a small tear in his eye i love you he said and i want to spend my life with you oh said mrs aouda with a surprised cry she was so happy that she put her hand to her heart passepartout came into the room and saw his master standing close to mrs aouda he understood immediately this is wonderful news he said we all need some good news yes said phileas fogg if you agree mrs aouda we can get married immediately passepartout do you know where reverend wilson lives passepartout ran to reverend wilsons house but five minutes later at
