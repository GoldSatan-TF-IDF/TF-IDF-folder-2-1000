jilly cooper the man who made husbands jealous to emily with love and gratitude for so much happiness acknowledgements one of the delights of writing the man who made husbands jealous has been the kindness and enthusiasm of the people who helped me these include in particular john lodge managing director of lodge securities who initiated me into the mysteries of highly sophisticated security systems trainer nigel twistondavies and his wife cathy who took me racing and allowed me to spend several days at their yard emily gardiner and alicia winter who advised me on the pop music front and ian maclay the former managing director of the royal philharmonic orchestra and the orchestra themselves who provided me with much joy and enlightenment both at rehearsal and concerts i should also like to thank martin stephen for telling me about headmasters composer geoffrey burgon and master cellist bobby kok for talking to me about music andrew parkerbowles and john oaksey for being brilliant about racing shirley bevan for advising me on the illnesses of horses simon cowley for walking the cheltenham course with me in a deluge and raymond and jenny mould for inviting me into their box to see tipping tim win gloriously at cheltenham peter and alexandra hunter and sally reygate also told me wonderful stories about their horses esperanta and regal both now sadly departed many other people helped me like those referred to above they are all skilled in their own fields but as i was writing fiction i only followed their advice as far as it fitted my own story and their expertise is in no way reflected by the accuracy of this book they include anthony and mary abrahams richard bell sebastian birkhead john boweslyon charlie brooks peter cadbury edith and jack clarkson peter clarkson father damian of prinknash abbey jim davidson herbert despard fiona feeley dennis foot miriam francombe susannah and william franklyn judy gaselee e w gillespie managing director

minchin sharon morgan lana myers peter norman managing director parfums givenchy rosemary nunneley guy ralls henry sallitt lottie sjögren edward smith pauline stanbury diane stevens harry turner barry watts madeline and malcolm white kate whitehouse and francis willey i should also like to thank the national canine defence league and in particular mrs clarissa baldwin for allowing me to use their slogan a dog is for life not just for christmas the subconscious mind works in strange ways almost from conception the man who made husbands jealous was set in paradise a mythical village in the mythical county of rutshire paradise village in the book has a population of around eight hundred an anglosaxon church a pub a restaurant a handful of shops and lies on a river at the bottom of a beautiful valley surrounded by steeply sloping woodland studded with beautiful houses during a driving lesson when the book was well under way i told my instructor peter clarkson about my fictional village did i know there was a paradise in gloucestershire he asked and promptly drove me to a tiny hamlet which looked down into a valley even more beautiful than the one of my imagination charles ii is alleged to have named the place paradise arriving by night while escaping from the roundheads he gazed out of the window the following morning and asked in rapture if he had arrived in paradise as i had written so much of the book by then and because the two paradises are totally different except in their rare beauty i decided to keep the name but would stress that noone living nor any of the locations in paradise rutshire bear any resemblance or are based on anyone living or any of the places in paradise gloucestershire i must also reiterate that the man who made husbands jealous is a work of fiction and none of the characters is based on anyone any resemblance to any living person is purely coincidental and wholly unintended an author is only as good as her publishers mine have been magnificent i would like to say a massive thank you to paul scherer mark bartyking patrick jansonsmith of transworld publishers ltd and all their staff for their continued encouragement and advice while i was writing the book once it was delivered i had marvellous editorial advice from diane pearson broo doherty and tom hartman nor could anyone have a more charming merry or skilful agent than desmond elliott i also owe a special debt of gratitude to my son felix who in january restored the gazebo at the bottom of the garden so i was able to write in blissful seclusion uninterrupted by doorbells or telephones finishing a big book is tremendously exciting and consequently i owe a further huge debt of gratitude to my friends annette xuerebbrennan annalise dobson anna gibbskennet and marjorie williams for entering into the spirit by working late into the night typing huge chunks of the manuscript and often correcting factual mistakes and fearful spelling ann mills was equally marvellous at clearing up after us all without throwing away any vital scribbling nor could the book have been written without the wonderfully soothing presence of my pa jane watts who listened when i was in despair provided numerous funny lines and spent hours collating and photostating the manuscript finally i would most of all like to thank my family leo felix emily barbara and hero all provided

highly expensive gay interior designer known as the ideal homo because hes always being asked as a spare man for deserted wives at paradise dinner parties elmer winterton american security billionaire chief executive of safus houses inc and a philandering palm beach polo patron martha winterton his ravishing neglected second wife lysander hawkley appeared to have everything at twentytwo he was tall broadshouldered heartstoppingly handsome wildly affectionate with a walltowall smile that withered women in january at the finals of a palm beach polo tournament this hero of our time was lying slumped on a prussianblue rug in the pony lines sleeping off the excesses of the night before the higher the standard of polo the better looking tend to be both grooms and ponies on this punishingly hot muggy day all around lysander beautiful girls in prussianblue shirts and baseball caps were engaged in the frantic activity of getting twentyfour ponies ready for the match but trying not to wake him they swore under their breaths as they bandaged and tackedup charges driven demented by an invasion of mosquitoes and if they could these beautiful girls would have hushed the thunder that grumbled irritably along the flat palmtree fringed horizon but lysander didnt stir not even when an argentine groom working for the opposition jumped a pony clean over him on the way to the warmup area nor when two of his team mates the carlisle twins sebastian and dominic roared up in a dark green aston martin yelling in rage and relief that theyd finally tracked him down people loved doing things for lysander the grooms had kept their voices down in the same way seb and dommie both england polo internationals had persuaded elmer winterton the security billionaire who employed them for the palm beach season to fly lysander out as a substitute when the fourth member of the team had broken his shoulder in the semifinals the little fucker howled seb leaping out of the car after all the trouble we took getting him the job he rewards us by getting ratassed said dommie together they gazed indignantly down at lysander sprawled leanhipped and looselimbed as a lurcher puppy lazily he stretched out and raked a mosquito bite in his sleep noone looking at that angelic inertia went on dommie grimly could imagine his ability for wanton destruction when hes awake well if he channels some of that ability against the opposition well be ok said seb and picking up a prussianblue bucket he dashed the contents into lysanders face come on mr hawkley this is your wakeup call what the fuck leaping as though hed been electrocuted frantically wiping dirty water out of his eyes lysander slowly and painfully focused on two round ruffian faces and four dissipated blue eyes glaring down at him from under thick blond fringes oh its you two he groaned for a terrible moment i thought i was seeing double what the hell are you trying to do to me nothing to what youre doing to yourself said seb briskly game starts in half an hour get your ass into gear did you pull that blonde asked dommie unbuttoning his greystriped shirt and selecting a prussianblue polo shirt from the back of the aston martin im not sure lysanders wonderfully smooth wide forehead wrinkled for a second i went back to her place certainly but ive got a terrible feeling i fell asleep on the job id better ring and apologize later seb chucked him a polo shirt i bloody cant complained lysander taking a sodden piece of paper from his shirt pocket she gave me her number but the inks run id like a tan like that he added admiring dommies solidly muscled conkerbrown back well you wont get one unless you play bloody well this afternoon said seb stepping out of his jeans elmers threatening to send you home on the next plane the fax in the barn is for business use only elmer is desperate for details of some massive jap deal and all morning the machine has been spewing out the racing pages of every english newspaper oh great theyve arrived leaping to his feet lysander tore off his shirt without bothering to undo any buttons if i get changed quickly i can have a bet if elmer wont let me use the telephone in the barn can i borrow yours no you cannot grabbing lysanders arm seb yanked him back bloody get dressed and warmed up we didnt bring you all the way from fulham to make fools of us foolham said lysander for a moment his head went back and his big mouth stretched in a roar of laughter showing off wonderfully even teeth then he looked perplexed now where did i leave my polo gear the opposition team who were called mr beefy consisted of a fastfood tycoon butch murdoch a good consistent player and his three argentine professionals one of whom juan obrien was the greatest player in the world wearing red shirts they were already hitting balls across a field which rippled beneath its heat haze like a vast green lake a red mobile canteen was handing out free hamburgers to mr beefy supporters inhaling a waft of frying onions as he and the twins rode onto the field lysander retched and clamped his mouth shut unable to find his kit he was wearing boots that wouldnt zip up borrowed kneepads and a toolarge hat which kept falling over his perfect nose and which did nothing to deflect a whitehot sun from his murderous headache an utterly instinctive horseman lysanders polo career had been held back in the past by his ability to be distracted during matches oh wow oh wow he was now muttering as he took in the glamorous goldlimbed female supporters crowding the stands and lolling on the burning bonnets of the cadillacs and lincolns lining the field god ive got a hangover this horse is so over the top he grumbled trying to stop a madly excited chestnut mare taking off as butch murdochs private ambulance manned by an army of paramedics stormed past to take up position at midfield kerrist lysander nearly lost his hat as he swung round look at the legs on that brunette in the pink skirt more to the point seb lowered his voice see that man in the panama in the second row of the stands hes an england selector flown specially over to watch you really lysanders bluegreen eyes widened in wonder so get your finger out you bet squeezing the chestnut lysander galloped off in a cloud of dust tapping a practice ball effortlessly ahead of him thats not true said dommie who had slightly more principles than seb of course its not said seb but it might take his mind off fieldside crumpet the twins were basically amused by lysanders antics in their youth when they had made more money ripping off rich patrons than by their polo skills their own wildness had been legendary but the chill hand of the recession was making patrons more parsimonious and hot horse deals less easy and as elmer winterton paid them a long salary and picked up their expenses it was very much in their interest that lysander distinguished himself that afternoon and here at last trailing security guards and perennially late because he liked to give the impression of being delayed by matters of state came elmer winterton he was followed by a private ambulance even larger than mr beefys and manned by more paramedics elmers company safus not only produced the safus house which was allegedly so well secured that no intruder could break in but also specialized in screening highrisk computers for the american government and industry elmer could frequently be heard boasting that only he knew the passwords to the nations most crucial secrets having flown several senators and their wives down from washington by private jet to watch him play he was desperate that his team should win the cup under the prussianblue safus colours dark swarthy squat with eyebrows that without ferocious plucking would have met in the middle elmer had mean small eyes and a long nose that jerked up at the end like a white rhinoceros he also displayed the rhinos erratic belligerence and was so unable to control his overbred ponies that he was as likely to crash into his own side as the opposition it would be hard to have been uglier or a worse rider than elmer as he lumbered on to the field intolerably pounding the kidneys of his delicate dapplegrey pony but such were his power and riches that the goldlimbed girl groupies licked their lips and rolled their shorts up an inch or two higher as he passed the heat was stifling to the west sinister black clouds advanced like a procession of benedictine monks shaggy palm trees quivered with stillness above the mushroombrown houses that flanked the outfield as sweating ponies lined up and the umpire chucked the ball into a shifting forest of legs lysander could be heard saying i wonder if elmers paramedics have got any fernetbranca by halftime safus was trailing and lysander was dying of shame not having played since last summer he was scuppered by hangover and the cauldron heat of palm beach after a freezing english winter unused to such fast wellbred ponies or such hard dry ground he had had a terrible three chukkas mr beefys three argentine hired assassins hadnt allowed him near the ball nor were matters helped by elmer barging around like some geriatric in an ancient mini who keeps pulling in front of faster drivers on the motorway of the eight goals scored by mr beefy six had been penalties awarded against elmer elmer was also aware that a photographer hired by the safus pr department was videoing the entire game to show at the sales conference next month and he hadnt touched the ball once i pay for this fucking team he was now yelling at seb and dommie in the pony lines and im going to fucking well hit the fucking ball as much as i fucking well like and as for him he stabbed a stubby finger at a cringing lysander hired assassin indeed hired asshole more likely that son of a bitch couldnt assassinate a fly matching elmers mood the black clouds now hovered above the pony lines like a vast impenetrable yew hedge lysanders eyes and throat were lined with dust hed towelled off a bucket of sweat as he came off the field and now he was wringing wet again comfort however was at hand from a honeyblond groom called astrid dont listen to elmer she told lysander and dont be fooled by this mare she doesnt have brakes but she sure is fast she added as she pulled down the stirrups of a meanlooking yellow pony whose coat quivered irritably against the flies whats she called lysander asked listlessly as he put his foot in the stirrup mrs ex after elmers exwife said astrid jumping to avoid the mares darting teeth because shes always bombing around causing trouble surprised he got anyone to marry him shuddered lysander gathering up his reins and his stick in defence of her master mrs ex put in a terrific buck next moment lysander was sitting on the ground see what i mean bellowed elmer that asshole cant even stay on a fucking horse get the paramedic hell certify the guy injured and we can put in a sub but the fall had sobered lysander vaulting on to mrs ex he galloped back into the fray in the fourth chukka dommie and seb both scored twice and lysander once then mr beefys argentines rallied and lysander was so transfixed with admiration for juan obriens forehand pass that he completely forgot to mark the number two player to whom juan was passing take the bloody man lysander screamed dommie but he was too late the number two had scored three minutes later to placate elmer who was bellyaching about being the only member of the safus team not to have scored dommie dropped a ball a foot in front of him and bang in front of the goal take your time elmer he shouted galloping upfield in support elmer winterton is looking awful good said the commentator elmer took a swipe missed and losing his temper started to beat his pony hi yelled lysander thundering across the field that is absolutely not on it absolutely isnt on is it you little fuckwit elmer mimicked lysanders english accent i can hit anything i want and raising his stick he took a furious swipe at lysander who promptly lifted his stick in retaliation stop it roared seb fortunately like a bucket of water over a dogfight the dense black cloud keeled over in a tidal wave like cats the spectators shot into their cars most of the players particularly the argentines who detested rain would have followed suit but lysander felt only blessed relief for the first time in fortyeight hours he was cool and he was utterly used to playing in the rain lysander hawkley is looking awful good crackled the loudspeaker a minute later hes got the line and hes really motoring on elmer wintertons yellow pony oh where are you going lysander shying at one of mr beefys whiteandred paper napkins which had blown on to the field mrs ex had taken off through the downpour carting lysander who was whooping with laughter past elmers and mr beefys ambulances beyond the goal posts and goal judge off into the everglades three minutes later he cantered back still roaring his head off when a horse takes off theres not much you can do the only thing that stopped mrs ex was a huge croc on the river bank i thought it was one of your security guards sir he added hastily seeing the sudden fury in elmers beady little eyes fortunately mrs exs turn of speed proved more effective going the other way hanging on lysanders hands like an express train she whisked him past three outraged argentines which enabled him to lean right out of the saddle and flick the ball between the redandwhite posts with a glorious offside cut shot as the bell went for the end of the fifth chukka the crowd hooted approval from the inside of their cars riding back to the pony lines through the deluge lysander noticed a lone spectator huddling in the stands beneath the totally inadequate protection of a prussianblue safus umbrella catching a glimpse of long brown legs lysander recognized the brunette in the pink skirt hed admired earlier returning for the last chukka he carried a spare blue rug which had kept dry in elmers trailer oh how darling of you said the brunette as he jumped off and spread it over her legs her hair the rich brown of soy sauce fell in dripping rats tails the rain intensified the dark freckles that polkadotted her thin face and arms she was shivering like a dog in a vets waiting room you should be inside your car reproved lysander my husband likes to know where i am in case he breaks a mallet the girl pointed to three spare polo sticks propped against the low white fence in front of her lucky bloke sighed lysander lysander called seb sharply glancing round lysander saw the other players were already lined up for the throwin and galloped over to join them dont chat up girls in the middle of a game said seb in a furious undertone particularly when theyre the patrons wife shes married to elmer asked lysander appalled yup and unless we win hell take it out on her afterwards in the last chukka with mr beefy only one goal ahead the tension got to both sides then juan obrien swore so badly at the umpire for ignoring one of elmers more blatant fouls that the umpire retaliated by awarding a penalty against juan as seb took the hit for safus lysander belted back to the pony lines to change horses and have another look at elmers wife the way her white silk shirt was clinging to her body was nothing short of spectacular how could she have married such an ape while seb circled his pony then clouted the ball between the posts juan obrien came off the back line and blocked the shot with his ponys shoulder lysander winced hed seen players stop goals with their ponys heads enraged he galloped upfield picked up the ball played cat and mouse with it hit it in the air before slamming it between the posts the spectators honked their horns in ecstasy the storm had passed ponies steamed bits stirrups and the huge silver cup on its red tablecloth glittered in the returning sun i guess safus is going to stage a comeback situation said the commentator juan obrien guessed otherwise in the closing seconds of the game he roared downfield black curls streaming under his hat swinging his stick driving the ball gloriously before him then unmarked and overconfident just in front of goal he hit wide pouncing lysander backed the ball upfield to seb who passed to dommie who carried on through the puddles until he encountered a wall of argentine resistance and hastily cut the ball to a furiously racingup lysander who met it gloriously with twenty seconds on the clock lysander was perfectly poised to score the winning goal but seeing elmer scowling redfaced in front of the posts and remembering elmers drenched wife who would get hell after the game he passed instead to elmer the twins groaned in disbelief but by some miracle on the bell elmer managed to coax the ball between the posts all elmers senators flown down by private jet whod been wondering what the hell to say to him after the game cheered with deafening relief the company cameraman decided not to shoot himself after all at last he had a clip he could show at the sales conference and later he was able to film elmer brandishing the huge silver cup while his beautiful wife clapped so enthusiastically that she spilled champagne down her pink skirt back at elmers barn lysander having drunk a great deal of moët from the cup hazily checked the legs of his ponies thanking them profusely as he plied them with polo mints he then thanked the grooms with equal enthusiasm and passed round the individual magnum of moët hed been given as a member of the winning team youre certainly flavour of the month said astrid elmer reckons youre the best brit hes ever played with he wants you to stay on for the rolex next month in moments of excitement lysander could do little more than open and shut his mouth really he gasped finally really pretending to buckle under the weight astrid handed him a sheaf of faxes here are your racing pages id forgotten those lysander gave a whoop of joy now i can have a bet no you cant seb marched in already changed with his hair slicked back from the shower its nearly midnight in england and the only thing racing at the moment is the very unblue blood through elmers veins in between copies of sporting life the fax managed to spew out confirmation of his jap deal elmer is several million bucks richer now and he wants to party so move it but i want to get pissed with this lot lysander gazed wistfully at astrid lysander said seb wearily you want to play polo for a living if youre prepared to be charming and diplomatic you can brownnose your way into riding some of the most fabulous horses in the world but for a start lay off elmers wife and his grooms he sure is the cutest guy sighed astrid as lysander was dragged protesting away the party was held in one of the soft brown houses clustering round the polo field male guests ranged from lithe bronzed professional polo players of all nationalities to rich businessmen some of them patrons some of who merely liked to be part of the polo scene the women included glamorous groupies of all ages wearing everything from tshirts and jeans to strapless dresses showing off massive jewels the feeling of jungle warfare was intensified by the forest of glossy green tropical plants in every room and by the fact that all the professionals were on the prowl for rich patrons and the patrons despite having wives present were stalking the prettiest groupies who were in turn hunting anything in trousers loud cheers greeted the arrival of the safus team if you have oats prepare to sow them now murmured seb as the cheering died away and a hush fell over the room talk about elmers angels drawled a predatory blonde in a fireenginered dress licking her scarlet lips elmer mean little eyes flickering with rage was the only person who didnt laugh hed kept on his brown boots and white breeches which the game had hardly marked so that everyone should know he was a polo player but had changed into a clean blue safus polo shirt as groupies started edging through the vegetation towards the rest of his team elmer competitive as ever was determined to annex the prettiest soon he was bosom to pectorals with a mettlesome brunette called bonny whose bottom lip protruded more than any of the scented orchids massed in the centre of the living room and whose buttocks swelled out of the briefest white shorts like an inverted nell gwyn refusing to admit how blind he was without glasses elmer had to peer very closely to see the logo on her jutting orange tshirt if you can read this he spelled out slowly then peering even closer youre a dirty old man bonny shrieked with laughter reluctantly elmer decided to join in thats kinda neat yours is neater said bonny that deep blue is just great with your eyes has anyone told you how like richard gere you are id give anything for a safus tshirt swappyer then said elmer hed never have stripped off in public muttered seb if he hadnt got a barbados suntan and just lost ten pounds none of it admittedly off his ego on a preseason crash diet jeeesus he choked on his drink as bonnys head disappeared into the orange tshirt and her upstretched wriggling arms showed off a pair of magnificent brown breasts elmers eyes were popping like a garrotted pekinese the orange tshirt once he had wriggled into it clashed with his portwine face but in no way doused his lust i see your picture every time i pick up the wall street journal bonny was now telling him but you are so much cuter in the flesh the flesh is weak where lovely young women like you are concerned said elmer thickly the logo on lysanders faded grey tshirt read sex is evil evil is sin sins forgiven so get stuck in he was getting drunker by the minute and had now been cornered by two stunning but interchangeable suntanned blondes did you fly commercial asked the first lysander looked blank shes trying to figure if you came over by private jet preferably your own explained the second oh right said lysander no i flew virgin the air hostesses were really sweet surprised they were still intacta with you on board said the first glancing round for a waitress with a bottle lysander caught sight of martha winterton shaded by a vast yucca she was chatting mindlessly to a senators wife and trying not to watch elmer her desolation was tangible youre not really a good friend of george bush bonny was growing more raucous i would just love to meet him it could be arranged elmers pudgy right hand was surreptitiously stroking her left buttock as they leant side by side against a dragged yellow wall the senators wife had drifted off to talk to butch murdoch martha was gazing despairingly into her empty glass oblivious of sebs stern warning that trespassers would be put on the next plane lysander crossed the room have you dried off martha jumped her huge eyes the clear brown of tio pepe held up to the light were swimming with tears it was a second before she recognized him oh sure it was so dear of you to bring me that blanket she had a husky hesitant voice her creased white shirt still clung to her body her dark hair which had dried all fluffy was pulled back in a bandeau making her freckled face look even thinner you needed a lifeboat said lysander i could use one now have a drink first as lysander grabbed a bottle from a passing waitress martha noticed a badge saying birthday boy pinned to his grey tshirt clutching her glass of champagne as though it was boiling tea and she a shipwreck victim she took a great gulp theres a nice fire in the garden said lysander seeing the gooseflesh on her thin freckled arms outside the dull aquamarine of the swimmingpool reflected a few faint stars rain had bowed down the hibiscus and the oleander bushes but their flowers pink red amethyst and yellow glistened jewellike in the floodlighting great drenched pelts of purple and magenta bougainvillaea clung to the house and the garden fences to an almost overpowering scent of orange and lemon blossom was added a tempting smell of roast pork garlic and rosemary as half a dozen sucking pigs jerked above the glowing coals of the barbecue apart from an inscrutable mexican houseboy who occasionally plunged a skewer into their shining gold sides the place was deserted caressed by the warm night air lysander gave a sigh of pure joy such bliss to go outside and not shiver but i expect its cold for you solicitously he edged her towards the fire poor little things martha looked sadly at the sucking pigs then pulling herself together youre kind a tanned for someone just arrived from england its fake confessed lysander lifting the light brown hair flopping over his forehead look how its streaked on the hairline and turned my eyebrows orange i borrowed the stuff from dolly my girlfriend shes a model and always having to turn herself strange colours i wanted to terrorize everyone into thinking id got brown playing in argentina all winter but i was pissed when i put it on last night shes so sweet when she smiles he thought to hell with seb and dommie and its your birthday she asked no lysander glanced down at his birthdayboy badge but it gets me lots of free drinks he opened his bluegreen eyes very wide and then roared with such infectious laughter that people standing in doorways and sitting in windows and even the inscrutable mexican houseboy looked up and smiled when is your birthday asked martha february i shall be twentythree youre a pisces lysander nodded friendly warm considerate easygoing but cross me and youll see how tough i can be my father whos a classical scholar pronounces it pissces what does your daddy do hes a headmaster supposed to be a great teacher but he spends most of his time raising funds and wowing mothers does your mother wow the fathers for a second an expression of utter anguish spilled over the boys sunny innocent charming face shutting his eyes he took a couple of deep breaths as though trying to survive some horrific torture without crying out she just died he mumbled last october ohmigod martha put a hand on his arm which was clenched like cast iron whatever happened she had a fall on the road the horse went up she wasnt wearing a hard hat as the mexican plunged in another skewer the boiling fat dripped on to the red coals which hissed and flared up lighting lysanders face like a soul in hell you poor little guy said martha were you very close lysander nodded she was more like my sister all my friends were in love with her your father must have been devastated lysanders face hardened dad doesnt show his feelings basically we dont talk he prefers my brothers hector and alexander theyre better at things from inside the house the band struck up i get no kick from champagne crooned a mellow tenor i do said lysander emptying the bottle into marthas glass what dyou do asked martha estate agent not much fun with the recession best thing that ever happened to him gliding up seb carlisle topped up both their glasses recession enables ripoff van winkle here to sleep and sober up all day in the office when hes not ringing ladbrokes or sloping off home to watch neighbours he couldnt do any of that if he had to sell houses oh shut up seb said lysander now guard martha for a minute turning he was nearly sent flying by the predatory blonde in the fireenginered dress if youve finished with your toy boy she said pointedly to martha id love to dance with him youre sweet said lysander but i must have a slash hes just adorable martha watched lysander drifting gracefully as smoke across the lawn isnt he agreed seb unfortunately his boss put him on commission only and as hes not selling any houses hes running up terrible debts betting and going out clubbing every night he ought to do something else hes about to go to a new job working in the city for some merchant bank which specializes in pretty personable young men but hell never last hes not cut out for the city he ought to be a jump jockey or a polo player you saw what a beautiful horseman he was this afternoon but it took him four chukkas to get his act together hes very upset about his mother devastated agreed seb completely lost his base drinking himself stupid cant settle to anything unlike his pompous achieving brothers hes pretty dyslexic and he left school without an o level his mother spoilt him rotten the worse the prank the more she laughed but she always bailed him out when he ran out of money pity elmer cant sign him up for the whole season pedro cavanali broke his leg falling on the boards this afternoon he plays medium goal with elmer ill see what i can do said martha the mexican had carved two of the sucking pigs maids were carrying bowls of salad and baked potatoes through to the dining room as lysander bounded through the french windows brandishing another bottle clear the lawn for ballet he shouted then standing on one leg executed a pirouette spilling a lot of champagne and only just avoided collapsing on the grass you need an early night said seb pointedly inside the house lysander could see elmer bending over bonny playing with the ends of her hair no doubt boasting that mrs exs equine ancestors had come over in the mayflower ill stick around said lysander well at least behave yourself warned seb some hope said dommie who wandered over tearing the flesh off the leg of a sucking pig with very white teeth grubs up its very good although he dropped his voice so only seb could hear our patron seems to have started already hes eating that slag alive going towards the house martha caught sight of elmer and went into reverse that bonnys a bucket said lysander in outrage youre much much prettier shes newer martha took out a cigarette with a trembling hand have you got a light lysander hadnt but before martha could stop him hed plunged a twentydollar bill into the coals of the barbecue youre crazy but awful sweet reproached martha as he almost burnt his fingers getting the charred paper to her cigarette in time but she was too immersed in her own misery its my fault she confessed my last husband was faithful and dull and i was bored out of my skull so i ran off with elmer who had a roving eye and i havent slept since elmers a shit said lysander with such disapproval that martha looked up dad was a shit to my mother and hes already found someone else a mrs colman an army widow shes got veiny ankles and wears shirts with piefrill collars he went on in disgust the boys call her mustard because shes so keen on dad she helps him fundraise theyre turning the stables where mum kept her horses into a new music school the speed with which mrs ex carted you this afternoon said martha bitterly is only equalled by the haste with which men shack up if theyre divorced or widowed or bored with their wives oh god no following her gaze lysander saw bonny run off shrieking excitedly into the wet depths of the shrubbery followed by elmer could you bear to take me home oh wow thats like offering me a ride in the national said lysander could i bear i certainly could then seeing seb beadily advancing on them with two platefuls of food look i dont want the twins getting heavy lets escape through the garden the full moon was rising rosecoloured like the inside of a pink grapefruit marthas limo was apple green open and very long with the number plate martha elmer gave it me for my thirtieth birthday that was when he was doing everything to prise me away from my ex hardly the ideal gift to hide under ones mattress in her distress martha grazed an incoming cadillac as she stormed out of the carpark lysander slumped beside her gazing at the stars which seemed to be shooting around a lot tunelessly singing a groovy kind of love elmers house in the heart of smart palm beach was surrounded by a thick impenetrable ficus hedge two scowling security guards restraining snarling dobermanns gave lysander a malevolent onceover as they opened massive electric gates friendly fellows observed lysander as they glided through a huge shadowy garden filled with darkly dipping trees what are those dishes on those big black poles microwave units to pick up on any intruder there are also sensors under the lawn not a rabbit or a racoon goes undetected inside the ficus hedge is hidden a chainlink fence topped with razor wire and an electronic intrusion detector id guard someone like you said lysander not me himself said martha flatly safus screens highrisk computers elmers sewn up most of the government contracts as only he holds the password to all the computer installations he needs protection twentyfour hours a day noone breaks in here ahead ghostly in the moonlight rose elmers pale pink fortress so like nougat that lysander felt he ought to take a large bite out of it to sober himself up amazing place was said martha bitterly one of the oldest houses in palm beach stood on this site elmer razed it and built another hes not into longevity going into the living room lysander found himself gazing into the mouth of a cannon and ducked that thing was fired in the civil war said martha nearly as old as elmer why the hell did you marry him i was called in to redecorate his office underneath a big desk you dont see a guys clay feet only marred by too many photographs of elmer fraternizing with the famous the room was charmingly decorated in pale golds as though midas had idly trailed his fingers over sofas carpets walls and huge bunches of deeply scented yellow roses on an easel was a halffinished portrait of elmer looking virile the two ponies he was riding and leading were only roughly sketched in god youve flattered him grumbled lysander its not finished he cant decide which pony he wants to ride cut out holes then he can ride a different one each day did you do that lysander turned to the waving corn field above the fireplace no thats by van gogh yours is better and much better than that one thats paul klee said martha in gentle reproof it cost several million dollars really astounded lysander peered at it again perhaps i should take up painting they were interrupted by another huge dobermann hurtling into the room fangs bared growling horribly stay tyson screamed martha dont touch him but lysander went straight up to the dog hand outstretched hallo boy arent you beautiful disarmed by such genuine admiration tyson after a few dubious growls started wagging his stubby tail and writhing his shiny solid black body against lysander that dog is a serial killer said martha in amazement elmer and nancy his ex have endless legal tussles over him nancy has custody and elmer visitation rights on weekends but hes always playing polo so the dog goes crazy now nancys threatening to take it to a dog shrink in new york so thats another two thousand dollars a month she should pay you instead she added as tyson collapsed in an ecstatic heap at lysanders feet after a very disapproving butler had opened a bottle of dom perignon for them martha who was still shivering uncontrollably went off to change leaving lysander with the telephone instinctively he started to dial the number at home then stopped with a moan of pain remembering that the only person in the world he really wanted to talk to would never pick up a telephone again the only changing martha had done when she returned twenty minutes later was to put on an old olivegreen cardigan with the buttons done up all wrong lysander was encouraged that she smelled of toothpaste but her eyes were very red did you get through she asked i did i rang ferdie my flatmate in fulham to see if my dog jack was ok he is and dolly my girlfriend is modelling in paris lysander looked cast down neither of them was remotely pleased hardly surprising its four oclock in the morning in europe that must be it said lysander cheering up anyway ferdie did read out mystic meg she does the horoscopes in the news of the world and shes seriously on the crystal ball she says pisces will find happiness with someone with freckles martha didnt register chainsmoking she jumped every time the telephone rang then because the butler answered bit her lip when it wasnt elmer and slumped back on the yellow and crimson striped sofa all husbands have mistresses these days like they have faxes and mobiles and they cant think how they ever existed without them the drink was really getting to her now her soft husky voice was shrill with the words rattling out like machinegun fire dyou know whats really causing the recession she demanded pandemic adultery tom wolfes tidal wave of concupiscence a guy is so busy deceiving his wife and his pa whos probably another mistress anyway he cant concentrate how can you put your back into work when youre sticking your dick into some bimbo all the time although his hands were busy stroking an ecstatic tyson lysander found his knees edging towards marthas id never have taken up with elmer she went on hysterically if he hadnt painted such a dire picture of his marriage how nancy neglected him and never slept with him then after elmer and i were married nancy dumped in vanity fair and i realized shed adored him and been absolutely wiped out she called me one evening when she was drunk to tell me he was a clinical narcissist and id never satisfy him all her friends were there this evening theyll be on to her first thing you held him for twentyfive years nancy martha couldnt hold him for as many weeks she gave a sob whats pandemic asked lysander but martha had beaten the butler to the telephone oh hi she was poised between tears and a screaming match i didnt want to spoil your fun no no she was apologetic now i wasnt implying anything lysander could now hear elmer yelling martha seemed to slump ok right sleep well slowly she replaced the receiver elmers over the limit hes spending the night at the barn yippee lysander hugged tyson lets have another bottle and hes got a dozen guards who could drive him home if he wanted hes only drunk with lust i guess he and that tramp were bouncing around in the jacuzzi when he called me that would have given him a charge she burst into tears lysander was a shining example of the continued existence of the age of chivalry he hadnt read endless articles in the womens pages about the caddish chauvinism of his sex he had never heard of new man or sexual harassment his heart entirely ruled his head anything in distress moved him and just as he had gathered up poor miserably disturbed aggressively insecure tyson now he bounded over to martha dont cry youre so beautiful and hes such a toad folding her into his warm tender embrace he tried to still her trembling body smoothing away tears and mascara with his thumbs then when she still sobbed comforting her in the only way he understood by kissing her smudged quivering mouth for a second she fought him off then desperate for reassurance she gradually responded to his wonderful enthusiasm her skin was as smooth and silken as her shirt but as he started undoing her buttons she jumped away im too skinny elmer says im like an ironing board with two buttons sewn on to tell you which the front is lysander winced then drew her back into his arms all the better to press my suit on then as martha smiled im going to kiss every freckle youll be here for a thousand years wouldnt be long enough lets go upstairs we shouldnt we cant fight mystic meg tyson however in true dobermann fashion refused to let lysander out of the room until his basket had been carried up to the bedroom and hed been settled in with strokes and bonios which gave martha time to undress and hide herself under the ivygreen silk sheets of the vast emerald and white striped fourposter books were piled high on her bedside table on the other side there stood only a digital clock and a silverframed photograph of elmer and george bush elmer only reads balance sheets and the messages on tshirts said martha with a sob hush dont think about him still in his clothes lysander waded through a pampasgrass of long white carpet and gently drew back the sheets instantly marthas thin arms flew to her tiny breasts but like aladdin stumbling on his cave and touching each gold bar precious stone and rope of pearls with amazed joy and excitement lysander slowly examined her body stroking her nipples and her concave belly and breathing in the remains of diorella behind her ears and inside her wrists christ youre gorgeous he ran his hands up the inside of her long slender legs i freaked when i first saw these in the stands dropping his clothes on the floor he stripped off with total unselfconsciousness and rightly so because he was glorious with a body as white firmly curved and inviting on those emeraldgreen sheets as early morning mushrooms in a dewdrenched field his welldeveloped chest with a slight down of light brown hair narrowed to the flattest stomach and more downy hair from which his cock reared up as jaunty and as confident of bringing joy as a conductors baton raised for action ive only been married five months mumbled martha we really shouldnt we should too wouldnt dolly be upset probably but basically i cant help myself his fake tan was turning orange his blueygreen eyes were crossing with drink but as the big laughing mouth came down on hers martha was reduced to the same slobbering ecstasy as tyson wriggling down the bed lysander kissed the arch of her instep each coralpainted toe then slowly slowly up the velvet thighs feeling the increasing tension as his hands grazed her breasts and shaven armpits never stopping caressing we really shouldnt said martha faintly reaching out lysander turned the photograph of elmer and george bush to the wall we dont need an audience then plunging his face into her pubic hair snuffling as appreciatively as a truffle pig he mumbled as i was saying to marthas bush feeling him helpless with laughter she had to join in but soon her laughter turned to gasps only when he knew shed come did he keep her pleasure on the boil with half a minute of slowly stabbing fingers come inside me urged martha just wait a sec while i slip into something tight murmured lysander reaching for a condom from the back pocket of his jeans then as joyously as an otter diving into a summer stream he plunged his cock inside her oh wow that was terrific said martha as they lay back afterwards sharing a cigarette i didnt get a christmas bonus because i didnt sell any houses so its been worth waiting till january you are so lovely lysander kissed her hand how come you are such an incredible lover basically dolly taught me a lot one of the advantages of having an older woman how old is she martha snuggled against his chest twentyfour ouch but she started at fourteen so theres a lot of mileage look i just adored sleeping with you me too martha found she couldnt keep her hands off him noticing polo bruises darkening his ribs arms and thighs like the purple markings on a white violet she wanted to kiss them all better and explore in return his wonderful body youre a really sweet guy with the softest heart and the hardest cock better than the other way round lysander dropped ash on the pampasgrass i wish i was someone who could go on for hours but i get so excited particularly when its someone like you dolly always makes me stay awake afterwards and stroke her for ages i find that the most difficult part his voice was slurring his eyelids drooping lets do it again in a minute will you come with me to disneyland tomorrow i want to get donald ducks autograph martha removed the cigarette as he fell asleep elmer wintertons evening had deteriorated bonny having consumed too much champagne and sucking pig had suddenly lurched out of the jacuzzi and for want of a bowl had thrown up in elmers fishtank whereupon his piranhas had swarmed up to the surface and eaten the lot which had turned elmers stomach feeling a longing for his shy slender wife he had been prevented from going straight home by bonny passing out not trusting his guards at the barn not to blab he was reduced to driving her thirty miles home himself none of his guards in the gate house felt like telling elmer he had a houseguest it was only after he had noticed a tshirt warning him sex is evil on his bedroom carpet that he glanced up and found his number one player and his wife as enchantingly entwined as cupid and psyche for the second time in twentyfour hours lysander was roused from sleep but elmer red and roaring was a considerably less attractive alarm clock than the twins i dont employ you on my team to hump my wife he howled didnt secure her very well you fat ape howled back lysander how can you chase disgusting slags like that when youve got something so beautiful at home that lysander was right didnt improve elmers temper gathering up a bowl from a table by the door he was about to hurl it at lysander not the ming elmer wailed martha elmer paused which gave lysander time to wriggle over martha scoop up her pale pink silk knickers as a fig leaf and shoot round the bed out of the room just as a glass bottle of jolie madame missing him by inches smashed against the dragged green wall not out squealed lysander belting across the landing and down the stairs three steps at a time to find the front door quadrupally locked whichever way he pulled and tugged it for an agonizing second he was reminded how his father used to bolt the great oak door at home and his mother used to steal down the back stairs to let him in through the kitchen then he jumped out of his totally unprotected skin as shots rang out shattering the chandelier in the hall grabbing a bronze of elmer astride a polo pony from the hall table like a weightlifter on a second surge of strength he hurled it at the window but the bulletproof glass didnt even dent instead like a mass castration of howler monkeys an earsplitting alarm blasted the house oh shut up lysander clutched his head then jumped as steel shutters clanged like guillotines across the windows and the outside doors frantically checking the ground floor he found every exit blocked and himself back in the hall try and escape you son of a bitch bellowed elmer reappearing on the landing as lysander ducked behind a large fern bullets buried themselves in the panelling behind him diving for a side door he raced up some stairs behind him he could hear shouting and dogs baying he was going to be ripped apart bolting round the circular landing deterring an approaching dobermann by hurling a cheese plant he shot into marthas bedroom dum di di dum di dum di dum di giggling hysterically gasping out the james bond tune lysander snaked under the green silk sheet pulling a pillow over his head gemme out of here in answer halfcrying halflaughing martha ripped off the sheet shoved a swipe card into his hands then sliding open a wardrobe dived through a dense forest of dresses to a secret door at the back through here she hissed at the bottom of the stairs turn right at the end of the passage next to the samuel palmer of hay making by a full moon youll find a little door put my swipe card in the slot then dial this number thirty for my age remember fortynine for elmers hurry for gods sake elmer wont take any prisoners thanks for everything leaning back through the forests of scented taffetas and silks for a last kiss lysander raced down the stairs and found the painting the full moon was honey gold not grapefruit pink this time and there was the little door his hands were trembling so badly it took three goes to slot in the swipe card now what was the number his brain froze marthas age he punched up a three then a nought but what was elmers about a hundred the frenzied growling grew closer any second theyd realize hed escaped this way elmer elmer would the thirty be still working or would it run out like a halfrung telephone number that was it he punched a four and a nine nothing happened perhaps hed put the card in back to front or upside down oh please god he moaned im sorry i screwed martha but youd have done the same god she was so beautiful as he hurled himself against the door it caved in and he was out in the dripping garden darker now because the moon had vanished behind a big black cloud the smell of orange blossom was suffocating venus blazed above the ficus rampart as lysander bolted white and leggy as a unicorn across the perfect lawn he triggered off the underground sensors suddenly watt lamps lit up the garden brighter than day and closedcircuit television cameras swung round to trap him on a dozen monitors in the house and at the gate elmers guards had simply to pick him off hearing the bloodcurdling barking as the pack of dogs was unleashed lysander ducked behind a travellers palm to avoid a hail of bullets the ficus hedge topped by razor wire was twenty yards away streaming as he was with rain and sweat it would electrocute him instantly ahead loomed a vast individual ficus tree falstaffian in girth and so old that its lower branches rested their elbows on the ground scuttling up the nearest branch like a squirrel lysander managed to wriggle round the trunk just as the dogs began leaping for his feet with gnashing teeth swinging out on to another branch he dropped into the street heart hammering legs trembling and giving way sobbing with terror lysander collapsed against the huge hedge wondering what the hell to do next the practical answer was to put as much distance between himself and elmer as possible but bollocknaked with no identification except bruises hed probably get arrested and slapped into a loony bin and get his brains sawn open like one flew over the cuckoos nest the streets were deserted but the sky was lightening loping eastwards he was overtaken by yet another open stretch and as he cringed into the nearest hedge feeling the clipped twigs scraping his bare back the driver stopped and reversed a blonde in a black strapless dress with huge sapphires hanging from her ears and circling her neck and wrists she was a good deal older than martha but almost as stunning what happened to you she asked looking him up and down in amusement the husband came home well at least youre not armed youd better get in lysander shot into the car seeing the wall street journal lying on the back seat lysander covered himself with the front page like a car rug phew its really kind of you i figured i heard shots or was that elmer winterton cracking his knee joints he tried to kill me said lysander perking up the guys an animal no animal is that nasty christ glancing down at the wall street journal lysander saw elmers photograph glaring up at him hes following me i could tear him out then my cock would stick through feel free said the blonde martha said he was a clinical nazi i thought he was dutch good thing that tree i shinned up didnt have dutch elmer disease or the branch would have given way having started giggling lysander found he couldnt stop im sorry its nervous hysteria have you got a cigarette sure in my purse the names sherry by the way sherry macarthy protected back and front by more pages of the wall street journal lysander slid into sherrys house which was bigger and more lushly decorated than elmers with a back garden falling straight into the ocean i guess youd like some breakfast and a pair of my husbands shorts you got a husband lysander shot into reverse hes in san francisco said sherry soothingly lysander crept back could i possibly have a shower after all that sex and fear i must stink like a polecat upstairs he admired another vast fourposter this time swathed in primroseyellow silk and topped at its four corners by gilded cherubs none of whom was protected by the wall street journal amazing room its francos my husbands said sherry who was turning on the gold taps of a vast marble bath next door help yourself the doors of a fitted cupboard which took up a whole wall and which had been lavishly handpainted with pale yellow and coralpink roses slid back to reveal hundreds of shirts there were more scent bottles massed on the bathroom shelves than a dutyfree shop franco also must have the snakiest of hips lysander had the greatest difficulty finding a pair of shorts he could zip up god this is great i havent eaten for fortyeight hours having downed three glasses of orange juice lysander was tucking into a huge plate of bacon eggs tomatoes mushrooms and hashbrowns while sherry filled yellowandwhite cups with very black coffee they were sitting beside a beautiful blue pool guarded by four big blue china dragons white geraniums spilled over the faded terracotta pots and little waves gambolled idly on the pale sand below them above the palm trees rattled in their diffident fashion sherry had also showered and had swapped her black taffeta and her sapphires for a flamingopink sarong which left bare her almost too brown shoulders her stillwet short blond hair was slicked back rudolph valentino style but was softened by a pink hibiscus behind her left ear there were crows feet round her warmly smiling eyes and the skin was beginning to crêpe on her breast bones and her arms but she was in great shape and a terrific listener you can kiss goodbye to that job with elmer she said when lysander had finished his account of the nights escapades i wouldnt mind if i hadnt got jack arthur and tiny to support sighed lysander as he spread blackcherry jam on a croissant youve got three kids jacks my jack russell original name the irony was lost on lysander arthurs my horse hes a steeplechaser he won a lot of races but hes having a year off with leg trouble im hoping to ride him next season hes such a character tinys a shetland shes arthurs stablemate they must miss you sherry edged nearer lysander not as much as i miss them ive got another job to go to he went on gloomily with ballensteins the merchant bank but that doesnt start till the first of march playing polo for elmer would have paid off my overdraft and a few bills and i wanted a suntan to wow the ballenstein typing pool on the first day youll wow them anyway murmured sherry the boy was positively edible at least you can get brown round the pool today i wont be in the way have you looked in the mirror recently but you mustnt burn the climbing sun had already given a pink glow to his white shoulders surreptitiously he undid the top button of francos shorts theyd castrate him in a minute having cleared away breakfast the maid returned with bottles of champagne and ambre solaire sherry patted the blueandwhite poollounger after such a disturbed night you must be pooped lie down and ill oil you sherry had been trained as a masseuse and her provocative smiling eyes made lysander even hotter than the sun as she kneeded and stroked his body as her braceleted hands moved downwards her sarong seemed to work loose so he could see straight down her deep brown cleavage and feel her bare thighs against his hip bone only the constricting tightness of francos shorts had hidden a large erection do my back embarrassed he rolled over sherry laughed softly the maids going shopping in a minute then you can get brown all over sticky with oil her hand slid down his backbone and disappeared under francos shorts lysander moaned god her fingers were going everywhere she was doing such magical things any moment his cock would lift him into the air like a onehanded pressup then as the sarong fell apart he felt soft fur caressing his thighs and realized she was wearing no knickers lysander never got a suntan he and sherry spent a lazy boozy day making love watching racing on satellite having outlandish bets and feeding each other spoonfuls of caviar and strawberries dipped in dom perignon around five oclock lysander had given himself enough dutch courage to go back to elmers barn and collect his luggage and polo sticks hopefully elmer would be safely in washington drinking vodka and electronics with george and barbara as lysander could only pull up francos jeans midthigh sherry drove him to worth avenue and despite his protests kitted him out in boxer shorts lacoste polo shirts chinos several pairs of loafers and a dark blue baseball cap with saints on the front she tried to buy him half a dozen suits you shouldnt ive had a really good time he told her as she drove him back to elmers me too francos gay as you probably gathered said sherry hed die of jealousy if he knew who id spent the day with lysander whod drunk a lot of dom perignon had tears in his eyes but thats awful a beautiful woman like you wasted on some shirtlifter why dont you leave him sherry shook her head guys are like gold dust after youre forty she said drawing up outside elmers barn at least francos a husband and as a couple you get asked out so you get the chance to meet new guys the wages of single life is social death i promise you flinging his arms round her bare neck lysander collapsed on her warm gold scented breasts as soon as ive sorted out things here ill get a taxi back to your place if she hadnt dropped him at the bottom of the long white rose colonnade leading up to elmers barn he would have bolted straight back into her car reluctant to admit hed been cuckolded and that his impregnable security system had been violated elmer had tried to hush up last nights escapade but hed reckoned without the press particularly when one of the maids seeing such a stunning streaker had leaked the story as lysander weaved into the yard a dozen camera lenses were turned on him and an immigration officer grabbed him pinning his arms behind his back youre going back to the uk lover boy i cant protested lysander im going to disneyland tomorrow ive got to get donald ducks autograph hallo mrs ex he waved at the long yellow face peering out of a nearby box youre not going anywhere now walk ill run if you like said lysander as a gun jabbed his spine dont smart ass me pretty boy what about my polo sticks all your gears packed but i havent said goodbye to martha or sherry talk about coming down to earth without a bang oh mr deporter whatever shall i do sang lysander tunelessly as he danced a few steps i wanted to go to disneyland and you sent me back to walk howled the immigration officer and all elmers security guards in the end they locked him up for the night to sober up in order to smuggle him on to the first plane the next morning just as he was leaving the twins came racing up with a large envelope inside was a silver pen from tiffanys with a clip in the shape of a polo stick ten thousand dollars and a scrawled note from martha darling lysander im sorry its all over the papers but at least elmers been all over me since you left you sure know how to make husbands jealous ill call you when im coming to the uk probably for ascot love martha feeling like a billionaire with hundreddollar bills spilling out of his pockets lysander boarded first class he tried to concentrate on the air hostesss peptalk about exits and lifejackets if the plane crashed he wouldnt have marthas swipe card to help him then glancing down at the paper another hostess had handed him with a distinct smirk only his seatbelt stopped him hitting the plane roof for there was martha smiling up at him the photograph had been taken before she lost weight she looked gorgeous and there was elmer looking absolutely repulsive and there was elmers pink palace with a large caption fort knocksup and there oh christ was lysander himself surrounded by immigration officers and giggling and waving like the village idiot being dyslexic it took him some time to wade through the copy there was a lot of guff about safus security system being violated and national secrets being in jeopardy elmer was quoted as saying it was just a lovers tiff martha and i are now reconciled lysander shook his head in bewilderment then as the plane started taxiing down the runway jumped out of his skin again for across the gangway a glamorous blonde was reading another newspaper with a frontpage headline marthas toy boy deported at gunpoint and a huge picture of him looking mercifully less asinine what the hell were dolly and his father going to say perhaps the story wouldnt reach england noone knew elmer over there he did hope the bastard wasnt being beastly to martha the only answer when the champagne started to flow after takeoff was to get drunk again one of the freebies handed out by the airline was a pack of cards getting into conversation with a foxy smiling irishman beside him lysander discovered a fellow drinker and poker player by the time they reached heathrow lysander had managed to lose the tiffany pen and most of marthas ten thousand dollars but he had enough left to buy a slab of toblerone for jack the dog fracas for dolly and a bottle of whisky for ferdie his flatmate before landing the blonde across the gangway vanished into the lavatory for ages and emerged looking even more stunning obviously tarting herself up for someone meeting her then as she passed lysanders pleasure turned to pain for a second he couldnt locate it then he recognized her scent diorissimo his mother had never worn anything else when hed first gone away to prep school he was so distraught she had drenched a handkerchief with it to comfort him at night now he leant back in his seat trying to handle the appalling feeling of desolation instinctively on landing he would have nipped into a telephone box to reassure her he was safe im only happy when all my children are back in england she used to say but hed always known that his return made her happiest of all the postchampagne downer plus a dank dark cold january evening did nothing to improve his spirits as he slid through customs out into the airport there was a firework display of camera bulbs exploding and cries of thats him over here sandy fortunately lysander was fitter than any of the paparazzi escaping them was a doddle compared to shaking off elmers guarddogs can you drive like hell to fountain street in fulham he gasped to a taxi driver and can i possibly borrow your evening standard only when hed finished the racing pages did lysander turn to the front of the paper to find another vast picture of himself and the headline mystery streaker a brit senate call for public inquiry digesting the details lysander had to leave the backseat light on all the way into london you better charge me extra for electricity he said handing back the standard worf it for a fantastic bird like that said the driver as the taxi jolted over discarded vegetables littering the north end road thank christ dolly was still in paris london was at its most tatty most of the shops had sales on the bitter east wind was rattling frozen litter along pavements and gutters fink weve lost them said the driver as he turned into fountain street fountain street was a charming victorian terrace lined with cherry trees number had been taken by ferdie for a low rent because it was on the market and would sell better if lived in ferdie had repainted the bottlegreen door and tied back the red rose which swarmed up the pinkwashed front of the house ignoring the empty dustbins by the gate and the frantic waving of the two gays opposite lysander let himself in among the leaflets for decorators window cleaners and minicabs was a postcard from dolly saying she missed him and would be home tomorrow there was also a mountain of brown envelopes which he didnt open thank goodness he was starting his new job with ballensteins in march his father had fiddled it for him as a quid pro quo for taking rodney ballensteins son into his smart public school the goodluck cards from all lysanders old office cronies were still up in the drawing room the house looked awfully tidy and it wasnt even the filipino cleaners day lysander switched on the simulated log fire which sent shadows flickering over the dark red wallpaper in the fridge next door he found bio yoghurt and pink grapefruit juice ferdie must be on one of his endless diets ham scotch eggs and a bottle of moët hed just helped himself to most of the ham and the last of ferdies whisky when a white envelope thudded through the letterbox addressed to him it was marked urgent and confidential dear hawkley read lysander with a giggle again it took him several seconds to take in the fact that ballensteins was an oldestablished firm who prided themselves on their utter discretion in view of lysanders recent very unfortunate publicity the job was no longer open the truth was that rodney ballenstein was not only a business friend of elmers but also had a new bimbo wife whom he didnt entirely trust and an equally glamorous pa on whom he had longrange designs there was no way rodney was going to have lysander lounging round his office causing havoc fucking hell lysander screwed up the letter and threw it on the gas logs at that moment the front door opened there was a frantic scampering of paws and jack the jack russell hurtled in like a bullet yapping and jumping with all four feet off the ground to greet his master jack was followed by ferdie bringing in the emptied dustbins hi he said chucking the evening standard on the hall table i was expecting you ferdinand fitzgerald was a fixer as fly and commercially orientated as lysander was ingenuous and unmaterialistic a schoolfriend of lysanders he was also an estate agent who despite the recession was doing very well in addition to selling houses he charged for dinner parties and for friends to stay the night in fountain street and let out properties on his firms books by the afternoon for chums visiting london to bonk in ferdies achilles heel was lysander whom he adored and had protected both from the bullying and the advances of older boys at school and beyond and whom he let get away with murder very plump with a double chin and pink cheeks hiding an excellent bone structure ferdie looked like a cleanshaven laughing cavalier whod slicked back his hair in an attempt to pass as a roundhead cheerfulness however kept breaking in he and lysander were known to their friends as mr fixit and mr fucksit today as he hung up his long navyblue coat in the hall the roundhead mood predominated particularly when lysander who always poured out everything at once immediately told him he had lost both the palm beach and the ballenstein jobs pretty stinking getting fired before ive even got there grumbled lysander feeding scotch eggs to a slavering jack you should have signed the contract before you left reproved ferdie its still on the kitchen table there must be some party to go to said lysander i feel very depressed how am i going to support jack and the horses as ferdie read the ballenstein letter looking for loopholes lysander opened the bottle of champagne from the fridge and threw the cork on to the floor ferdie picked it up you live in a corklined room lysander sadly you lack prousts application this house has been tidy since youve been away annunciata took two days to muck out your room no selfrespecting pig would have dossed down in it and youll have to sleep on the sofa tonight ive rented it to matt gibson and thats his moët and his scotch eggs youre feeding to that seriously spoilt dog look at the way hes scratched every door and that is disgusting ferdie removed two strips of ham fat from the gas logs with a shudder how many times do i have to tell you this is not a real fire dont you want to hear about palm beach not particularly ive read most of it in the standard look weve got to talk about dosh ive just got in lysander was now feeding jack toblerone and trying to read ferdies evening standard which was a later edition upside down eastenders is on in a minute he got up to turn on the television then lets go clubbing later ferd my overdrafts so big i might as well make it bigger i must just check my horoscope he added switching over to ceefax and patric walker itll tell you the debtors prison is looming said ferdie turning off the television he sat lysander down and made him open the brown envelopes the bills were horrific barclaycard ladbrokes foxtrot oscar tramps british telecom intoned ferdie christ your telephone bills longer than your telephone number its not all me the longdistance calls are itemized and all to dolly and how in hell did you spend seven hundred pounds at janet reger that was dollys christmas present not to mention bills for bootmakers saddlers vets feed bills livery fees blacksmith interflora and heres a letter from the offlicence complaining your cheque bounced how did you manage to run up a bill for five hundred pounds at an offlicence the girl with the big boobs lets me have it on tick its useful when we have parties having filled up his glass lysander filled up jacks waterbowl i watched satellite in palm beach you can watch racing twentyfour hours a day turn on the telly itll be the bill in a minute you are not going to watch anything snapped ferdie stacking the bills tidily and chucking the brown envelopes in the wastepaper basket you owe me four months rent and you can at least sign on tomorrow lysander shuddered they might find me a job basically i need a holiday matt gibson saved his dole money for six months and went skiing said ferdie sternly ive never saved anything in my life ok ill go and tap dad tomorrow knowing how lysander loathed going to see his father ferdie relented ringing a headhunting friend called roger westwood he arranged for lysander to see him the following day theres a pr job going said ferdie switching off the telephone the firms got two bloodstock agencies and a polo club at least you know something about horses but turning round he found lysander had fallen asleep with jack clutched in his arms like a teddy bear he looked about twelve he could sleep anywhere curling up in patches of sunlight like a cat sighing ferdie removed his shoes and covered him with his own duvet ferdie had a rotten morning taking some arabs who had no idea what they were looking for and who hardly spoke any english round a big block of luxury flats in chelsea harbour the weather was even meaner than yesterday there were no meters and ferdie had to put his bmw convertible in a carpark forcing the arabs to walk two hundred yards with a bitter east wind whipping up their robes they were then so picky that ferdies good nature ran out shoving them into a taxi instead of driving them back to claridges he returned to bung the porter who often tipped him off if people were moving out about new flats coming on to the market ringing the office from his car he learnt that a greek couple had ratted on a deal on a half a million pound radnor walk house twelve thousand pounds the poorer ferdie abandoned his perennial diet and mindlessly devoured two bacon rolls ringing lysander to check he was on course for the interview with roger westwood he got no answer ferdie cursed roger was a vital contact because people he placed in jobs were often moving and needed to sell houses and buy new ones ferdie was putting his own reputation on the line sending lysander to see him hed better go back to fountain street to see what was going on lysander appeared compliant but ended up doing exactly what he chose ferdie was reminded of an english setter his family had once owned who was beautiful sweet natured thick but also cunning with a nose on elastic for bitches and virtually untrainable he found the place in chaos lysander shed possessions like leaves in autumn records tapes telephone books glasses the remains of breakfast overflowing ashtrays the racing pages of the sun and several discarded ties littered the sitting room lysander already dressed for the interview was ringing ladbrokes why the hell cant you shut my bedroom door ferdie retrieved a gucci loafer from jacks ravening jaws and what do you look like lysander glanced down at the crumpled grey suit and the blue and white striped shirt basically i put on the thing that least needed ironing he said apologetically hed have pinched one of my shirts if they hadnt been too big thought ferdie darkly then caught sight of an empty bottle of moët in the wastepaper basket youve been drinking only half the bottle you cant fucking afford champagne i didnt said lysander smugly an incredibly nice girl turned up with it from the scorpion she left me her card examining it ferdie gave a groan beattie johnson are you crazy shes the most bent journalist in england well she was sweet to me said shed read all the palm beach stuff and wanted me to have the chance to tell my side of the story and if i told her all about martha and sherry the scorpion might give me a ferrari ferdie went white you didnt course not lysander assumed an air of great virtue i couldnt do that to martha besides dolly would do her nut off the record i did tell her how funny it was escaping from elmers and being picked up by sherry she took some pictures she said she could get me some modelling work christ when will you learn ferdie was in despair but there was no time for reproaches sighing he straightened lysanders tie gave his shoes a last polish and brushed jacks white hairs off his suit he then put a couple of roger westwoods cards in both lysanders breast and inside pockets and turned down the a z with the relevant road ringed finally he gave lysander an extra strong mint to hide the champagne fumes and his last twentypound note in case he needed some cash now dont forget to steer roger on to racing thats the only thing you know anything about and try and look interested no you havent got time to watch neighbours move it an insanely fast driver lysander reached rogers office near holborn ten minutes early and pulled up his battered dark green golf outside a television shop to watch the end of neighbours and the runners going down to the start for the hed been right to back that dark brown mare she looked really well neighbours ended on a clinch which reminded lysander that dolly was due back this evening worried about the sideeffects of being on the pill since she was fourteen dolly had recently come off it so he had better nip into the next door chemists shop to buy some condoms he was just waiting at the counter wondering if rainbow ones would improve his performance dolly was very demanding when a girl swept into the shop sending a rack of bath caps flying she was very tall and thin with fine pale hair drawn back from a long beautiful unmadeup face into a tortoiseshell clip very inadequately dressed in a grey wool mididress she had the gangling panicky air of a giraffe whod escaped from the zoo into rushhour traffic i want some eyegel she announced in a high trembling voice no not that one its tested on animals in fact i want three tubes im going to be doing a lot of crying in the next few days my husbands just left me and she burst into tears the pharmacist forced to serve her because his assistant was late back from lunch was totally thrown his scrubbed face turned dark crimson as his little eyes darted round looking for a way of escape lysander showed no such reticence leaping forwards knocking over a rack of tweezers he put an arm round the girls shuddering shoulders gently steering her towards the chair kept for pensioners awaiting prescriptions he broke into a nearby box of pale blue kleenex and started to blot up the tears unlike martha there was no mascara to run you poor thing what a bastard hell come back never never gulped the girl go and make a cup of tea diane snapped the chemist to his assistant who buckling beneath carrier bags had tried to sidle in undetected and was now gazing at lysander in wonder gradually between sobs and sniffs lysander elicited the information that the distressed beautys name was rachel and that her husband boris was a russian dissident and an assistant conductor of the london metropolitan orchestra but he never gets to conduct in public because that bastard rannaldini hes the london mets musical director never gives him the chance boriss compositions are wonderful too but noone will programme them because theyre rather difficult dropped saucepan sort of stuff asked lysander helpfully if you mean atonal said the girl bridling slightly yes it is rannaldini could help but hes jealous of boriss genius he actually told boris boriss compositions emptied concert halls thank you she added as diane the assistant now in a white coat returned newly madeup and reeking of scent and handed her a cup of pallid tea youre all being so kind boris is kind really she went on despairingly but being russian he gets frustrated trying to communicate and weve got young children and they get on his nerves in a small flat thats no reason to walk out said lysander indignantly have a slug of that tea although you really need something stronger lifting the cup rachels shaking hand spilled so much she put it down again boris is in love with a mezzo called chloe she announced miserably the london mets recording otello at the moment shes singing emilia so he sees her all the time and rannaldinis positively encouraging it what a shit lysander tugged out another wadge of blue kleenex i was so desperate continued rachel with a sob i went to see rannaldini this morning just barged past his secretary rannaldini had the temerity to offer me a gin and tonic saying he couldnt understand why i was making a fuss he feels the affaire rachel choked on the word has added a new depth to boriss compositions and chloe has never sung so well hes a fiend rannaldini he corrupts everyone she broke into noisier sobs having exhausted one box of kleenex lysander broke into another due to the slow service of diane who was not the only one transfixed with interest by this beautiful couple a long queue had formed many of whom were beginning to chunter the pharmacist also noticed that several regulars who were too embarrassed to ask so publicly for cures for piles or chronic constipation had sidled out again he cleared his throat then when lysander took no notice told him and rachel they couldnt stay indefinitely no of course not rachel rubbed her forehead in bewilderment my god i should have picked up the children where are they asked lysander whod been squatting down beside her rising stiffly to his feet with a girlfriend well well find a pub and ring her then ill run you over there ferdies afternoon had been no more rewarding than his morning a megarich german for whom hed been searching for months had suddenly been found a two million pound property by a rival agent and an appalling survey had scuppered a deal that looked certain returning home that evening frozen and exhausted ferdie caught the telephone on its last ring it was roger westwood in a rage hed lunched with the chief executive of the pr firm and asked him back to the office to meet lysander and the little fucker never showed didnt even bother to call christ what kind of idiot did that make me look ferdie had to crawl he left here at halfpast one roger i dont see how he could have lost the address well hes lost the fucking job after all the business ive put your way ferdie you could have come up with someone better look im really sorry but roger had hung up i am too young to have a coronary thought ferdie how the hell could lysander do this to me fumbling to turn on the lamp by the fire he once more surveyed the chaos jack fed up with being alone had chewed several tapes ferdie put the rest back in their box in the kitchen nothing had been returned to the fridge the milk had gone off the pink grapefruit juice was tepid lysander had polished off his whisky last night in a fury ferdie ate quarter of a pound of cheese and the last of the scotch eggs his brooding was interrupted by jack leaping on to the sofa bristling with rage and wagging his stumpy tail as he peered out of the window wearily joining him ferdie swore in disbelief there staggering down the street was lysander arm in arm with a blind man both of them being led by a resignedlooking guidedog ferdie threw up the window we are two little lambs that have gone astray baa baa baa sang the blind man and lysander tunelessly as they tottered across the road windows were going up all along the street the gays opposite were nearly falling off their balcony passersby stopped and stared as lysander paused swaying outside the front door breaking a bar of chocolate into pieces he gave it to the drooling guidedog then handed ferdies last fiver to the blind man he took so long getting his key into the latch that ferdie let him in lysanders hair was flopping all over his face the faded orange tan had a blue tinge christ its cold bending down to gather up an ecstatically yapping jack lysander had great difficulty getting up again where the fuck have you been yelled ferdie in the goat and boots said lysander with a hiccup why didnt you go to that interview ohmigod lysanders palm smote his wideopen mouth i completely forgot im really sorry ill ring and explain basically i just nipped into the chemist to get some condoms when this poor poor girl rushed in to buy some eyegel can you beat it her husband had just left her oh no moaned ferdie well i had to look after her gently putting jack down lysander wandered into the kitchen fretfully upending the empty whisky bottle honestly she was so sad and so beautiful and she had adorable children god i love kids and her husbands a russian diffident we went back to the flat we got a bottle on the way and she was just telling me all about this bastard rannaldini whos led her husband astray she said he was legendary legendarily difficult snapped ferdie with mounting anger he watched lysander get a tin of pedigree chum out of the fridge fork it into a blue bowl of bristol glass which normally lived in the sitting room and scatter dog biscuits all over the floor who is he asked lysander rannaldini about the greatest conductor in the world jesus youre a philistine well hes boriss boss rachel played some of boriss music it sounded quite awful like a lot of buffaloes in a labour ward but it reminded her of him so she started crying and i was comforting her when boris walked in hed decided not to leave her he wasnt at all diffident when he saw me and hes a big bugger so i legged it before he blacked my eye then you could have used the eyegel said ferdie sourly sweeping up dog biscuits well you screwed up that bloodstock account job im desperately sorry ferd i couldnt just leave her the other problem is basically my cars been nicked when i came out of her flat in drake street it had gone probably towed away ferdie was furiously crashing plates and mugs into the dishwasher it wasnt i stopped off at a champagne tasting at oddbins on the way home they let me use their telephone then i went to the goat and boots thats where i met syd that blind bloke his guidedog was incredible she was called bessie youd have loved her jacko as he opened the kitchen door jack rushed out and an icy blast rushed in wed better call the police about your car said ferdie rachel was so pretty in a leggy sort of way lysander glanced at his watch hell ive missed coronation street going into the sitting room he switched on the television i must find out who won the wheres the remote control but as he upended a box of tapes on to the floor in an attempt to find it ferdie flipped just shut up for once he howled and go to fucking bed next morning ferdie had to relent because lysander woke up as he so often did crying for his mother oh ferd i dreamt she was alive the fog came down and i couldnt find her dripping with sweat reddened eyes rolling in terror bedclothes thrown all over the sitting room lysander reached for a cigarette with a shaking hand slumped in despair he let the bubbles subside in the alka seltzer ferdie brought him the cartoons on tv am which usually produced whoops of joy failed to raise a smile he was too low even to switch over to ceefax for the days runners and his horoscope whats the point of russell grant rabbiting on about a romantic day for pisces when ive got to go and tap dad he started to shake again ferdie sighed as lysanders car hadnt been found and hed promised to be at fleetley the public school in gloucestershire where his father was headmaster by eleventhirty ferdie agreed to drive him down for a fee not that hed ever get it and hed have to pretend to the office that he was out viewing properties you ought to get something inside you he chided lysander you havent eaten since yesterday morning i feel sick lysander jumped at the telephone always hoping it might be his mother and her whole death a terrible dream picking up the receiver ferdie listened for a minute before snapping hes not here and if he were he wouldnt have anything to say and crashed it down again youre going to feel even sicker that was the sun beattie johnsons dumped in the scorpion theyll all be baying at the door in a second we better move it on top of the financial times and the estate agents gazette the newsagent on the corner placed a copy of the scorpion lover boys in trouble again he told ferdie with a smirk remind him he owes me sixty quid for mags and fags im first in the queue said ferdie grabbing a packet of toffees oh my god on the front of the scorpion was a ludicrously wantonly glamorous photograph of lysander surrounded by foliage and wearing nothing but a flannel who could blame martha winterton said the huge headline what the hell possessed you to pose virtually naked for beattie johnson asked ferdie as he got back into the car i was having a bath when she arrived said lysander sulkily lysander whom ferdie described as the geoffrey boycott of reading was still digesting the full horrors when the bmw shook off the remnants of rushhour traffic and reached the m drop dead handsome he read out laboriously and he nearly did when the bullets of elmers guards rang out frozen in his tracks lysander could have passed for a statue of adonis whos he in that moonlit garden i aim to be a jump jockey says twentytwoyearold lysander who should have no trouble with bechers if he can clear elmers twentyfoot electric fence without a horse oh christ it goes on about me being the youngest son of david hatchet hawkley headmaster of fleetley one of englands snootiest public schools fees a year perhaps hatchet will give cheeky lysander six of the best when they meet jesus beattie is a bitch said lysander furiously she promised she wouldnt print any of the things i told her off the record id have taken that ferrari if id known wed better step on it before some dogooder shows dad the scorpion thank goodness its banned at fleetley dollys going to be livid too i feel seriously sick he groped for a cigarette and was soon coughing his lungs out and dropping ash and toffee papers all over ferdies very clean car that is the ultimate obscenity he said disapprovingly as they got stuck in the fast lane behind a blonde in a porsche going just below the speed limit so ferdie was forced to overtake on the inside ought to be driving funeral cars lysander swung round to glare at her then changed his mind quite pretty though perhaps shes just passed her test looks like that girl in the house next door did you ever bonk her ferdie nodded gloomily we had a bloody good four days while you were in palm beach i even took her to san lorenzo then she announced she was flying back to australia to get married and shed only been practising on me ferdie told it as a big joke but lysander sensed the hurt he longed for ferdie to attract girls as effortlessly as he did stupid cow he said crossly then to cheer ferdie up as they came off the motorway god you shift this car ive never done it this fast even at night as they approached fleetley through the bleak winter landscape with its patches of snow and icy wind flattening the pale grass on the verges jack started to snuffle at the window at familiar territory and lysander grew lower and lower i cant believe she wont be here he muttered pulling sherrys blue baseball cap further over his nose he could never understand why his mother had stayed married to his stiffupperlipped rigidly conventional father but as a gesture of conciliation he stopped in fleetley village to buy him a bottle of port and a packet of swoop for his parrot simonides fleetley school had once been inhabited by dukes now only the iron gates flanked by rampant stone lions and the avenue of towering flatbottomed horsechestnuts and the great house itself square yellowygrey and georgian remained all round like mushrooms had sprung up classrooms science labs gyms and houses for masters and boys the great lake had been turned into a swimming pool nowhere for arthur and tiny to graze now thought lysander gazing at the silverygreen stretches of playing field oh no he gave a whimper the stables where he and his mother had kept their horses had already been flattened to make way for the new music school towards which mrs colman his fathers secretary had helped raise you coming in he asked ferdie ferdie shook his head ive got some calls to make although ferdie had got straight as in four a levels and david hawkley had privately admitted he would be the first old boy to make a million david had never forgiven his sons best friend for flogging booze cigarettes and condoms on the black market to other boys ill leave jack with you then said lysander simonides always gives him a nervous breakdown imitating his bark christ i hope dads in a good mood david hawkley ran one of the best schools in the country nicknamed hatchet by the boys for the sharpness of his tongue he was as brilliant a teacher as administrator but tended ruthlessly to suppress the romantic intuition which had made him the finest classical scholar of his generation extremely goodlooking pale patrician tightlipped like the first duke of wellington with black regency curls brushed flat and streaked with grey he gave an impression of banked fires under colossal control as though the battles of the peninsula and waterloo were being fought internally against despair and the powers of darkness inflexible by nature he had been particularly tough with his youngest son because pippa his late wife had adored the boy so much and lysander was so agonizingly like pippa with his wideapart bluegreen eyes which always opened wider when he was thinking what to say the thick glossy brown hair falling over his forehead and the sweet sleepy smile that totally transformed his face like pippa he had the same air of helplessness of not being responsible for his actions of retreating into a dream world and laughing at all the wrong moments lysander was so different from davids older sons alexander and hector who like their father had got firsts at cambridge and were now doing brilliantly in the bbc and the foreign office both had made suitable marriages and unlike their father hugged their children cooked sunday lunch knew the difference between puff and shortcrust pastry and changed nappies without any loss of masculinity like their father however they had endless discussions on what to do for and about lysander awaiting his son that morning david hawkley was in a particularly savage mood normally in january he would have been basking in the glow of getting half the sixth form into oxbridge but such was the bias against public schools that this year only ten boys had scraped in and none of them with scholarships resulting in endless recriminatory telephone calls from parents having been up most of the night ruthlessly marking down mocks papers he didnt think next years lot would fare any better his mood was even worse because a fox had killed his beloved parrot simonides that morning simonides had barked at dogs chattered away in greek and latin and shouted fuck off probably taught to him by lysander at parents who wouldnt leave he had also perched on davids shoulders as he worked hopped on to his bed snuggling into his neck at dawn and been his only solace since pippa died david was also livid because stories of lysanders palm beach exploits were plastered all over the scorpion which had been slyly left around by the boys even on his pew in chapel worst of all lysander in his vagueness had put the two letters hed laboriously written in palm beach in the wrong envelopes thus instead of receiving a cheery note saying his son was getting on well and would visit him next month david opened the letter lysander had written to his highly dubious girlfriend dolly this not only told her of the disgusting things lysander was intending to do to her sexually when they met up again but also how he would probably be forced to tap his battleaxe of a father and that he was sure his father in turn was keen on his secretary mustard and what a dog she was david hawkley was almost more outraged by the deterioration in lysanders spelling and grammar but he was not prepared to hand the letter back with sps in the margin nor tell his son that the word lick did not have two ks and that swuzzontnerve certainly wasnt spelt like that nor ask what the hell was growler guzzling icy with rage david watched his youngest son getting out of a flash car driven by that fat deeply unsuitable friend who should surely have been at work in some office he then wandered up the path wincing at the cacophony of the eleventhirty bell and stopped to stroke hesiod the school cat whod been shut out yet again by mrs colman who didnt approve of pets in the office it was mrs colman who had drawn davids attention to the scorpion first thing that morning i never read that beastly rag but my mrs mop brought it in im so sorry david never david except when they were alone now orgasmic with disapproval mrs colman was ushering lysander into the study handsome big nosed high complexioned and hearty she got quite skittish when alexander or hector visited their father mr hawkley mr hector hawkley to see you but lysander was too hauntingly like his mother of whom mrs colman had been inordinately jealous lysander noticed that mustard was very glammed up in cherryred lambswool with matching colour on what could be seen of her pursed lips catching a discreet waft of chanel he afforded her equal coolness hi dad he dumped the carrier bag on his fathers vast greenleather desk beside the neatly stacked mocks papers the swoops for simonides timeo danaos thought david peering into the bag unable to trust his voice not to quiver he didnt tell lysander about simonides and merely said thank you youd better sit down for a man outwardly as bleak as the day his study was an unexpectedly charming and welcoming room most of the wallspace was covered with books well worn and thumbed in faded crimsons blues dark greens and browns mostly in the original greek and latin with their gold lettering glinting in the flames that glowed from the apple logs in the grate within reach were aristotles ethics and the seven volumes of gibbons decline and fall and because david hawkley was not a vain man tucked away on a top shelf were his own muchadmired translations of plato ovid and euripides he had been translating catullus when pippa died and had done no work on it since on the remaining walls were some good english watercolours exquisite french engravings of aesops fables a photograph of the headmasters conference last year in aberdeen and yet another far more faded photograph of himself winning his blue at cambridge breast against the tape dark head thrown back over the fireplace was the poussin of rioting nymphs and shepherds left to him by aunt amy who had also left twenty thousand pounds to lysander rather than his elder brothers because she felt the boy needed a helping hand lysander to his fathers fury had instantly blued the lot on a steeplechaser called king arthur who had promptly gone lame and not run since unlike elmer winterton david hawkley believed in longevity so the holes in the carpet were mostly covered by good rugs the springs had completely gone in the ancient sofa upholstered in a dark green liberty print to match the wallpaper mrs colman kept urging him to replace the sofa with something modern and relaxing but david didnt want parents to linger particularly the beautiful divorced or separated mothers god there were enough of them who came to talk about their sons and ended up talking about themselves their eyes pleading for a chance to find comfort in comforting him and now lysander was sprawled on the same low sofa huddled in ferdies long dark blue overcoat readjusting his long legs yet as seductive in his drooping passivity as narcissus or balder the beautiful but modest like his father he always seemed unaware of his miraculous looks david didnt offer lysander a glass of the mediumdry sherry he kept for parents although he could have done with one himself because he didnt want any conviviality to creep in lysander who always had difficulty meeting his fathers cold penetrating grey eyes noticed he was wearing a new hawkes tie and that his black scholars gown now green with age was no longer full of holes where it had kept catching on door handles his mother had only used needles to remove rose thorns so the invisible stitches must be mustards work as was the posy of mauve and blue freesias on his fathers desk whose sweet delicate scent fought with the blasts of lunchtime curry drifting from the school kitchens there was a long awkward pause lysander tried not to yawn noticing how the lines had deepened round his fathers mouth and how the dark rings beneath his eyes nearly joined his arched black brows as though he was wearing glasses lysander felt a wave of compassion how are you dad coping snapped david then a pigeon landed on the windowsill and for a blissful second david thought it was simonides then as reality reasserted itself he channelled his misery into a furious attack on lysander for sending the wrong letter how dare you refer to mrs colman in those offensive terms he said finally after all shes done for the school quite by chance recognizing your illiterate scrawl i opened the letter imagine the hurt it would have caused mrs colman if shed seen it crossing the room he threw the vile document on the fire putting a log on top to bury it what the hell have you got to say for yourself and take off that ridiculous baseball cap flushing like a girl lysander opened his eyes wide and launched into a flurry of apology im really really sorry dad i honestly am basically its very expensive living in london and i honestly didnt mean to upset you and mustard i mean mrs colman but basically my cars been nicked and id no idea arthurs vets bills were going to be so high and i honestly promise to do better and basically my attitude towards money is he got to his feet to let in the school cat who was mewing piteously on the windowledge sit down thundered his father but its freezing hesiod always came in when mum then seeing his fathers face he sat down he desperately needed some money as i was saying basically my attitude thats enough david interrupted him you have used the words basically and honestly about twenty times in the last five minutes there is absolutely nothing honest about your promises to do better nor basic about your attitude to money you roll up here plainly hungover to the teeth you bring disrepute on the family getting your exploits plastered all over the papers i hoped you would have learnt that no gentleman ever discusses the women with whom hes been to bed with a shudder lysander wondered if his father had bonked mustard yet the fumes of curry were really awful he hoped the bursar had ordered a consignment of threeply bogpaper to deal with it poor hesiod was still mewing what is worse went on his father is that in order to secure that job in the city which i gather roddy ballenstein has already withdrawn cant say i blame him i have been forced to admit the stupidest boy i have ever come across stupider than me said lysander in amazement it is not funny im really sorry dad lysander noticed with a stab of pain that his father had removed his mothers photograph from the mantelpiece probably mustards doing dragging his mind back to the present he heard his father saying i realize from your letter that you only came down to tap me well im not helping you youve got to learn to stand on your own feet i suggest you send that horse on which youre always squandering money to the knackers and get yourself a decent job now if youll excuse me i have a governors meeting lysander went quietly outside but when he saw a gloating mustard peering round the net curtains something snapped raising two fingers at her he scooped up hesiod who was now weaving and mewing round his feet and bolting down the garden path shoved the cat into ferdies car and jumped in after it in the ensuing pandemonium with jack nearly getting his eyes clawed out as he tried to swallow hesiod whole and lysander trying to separate them and mustard running down the drive in her medium high heels crying stop thief hesiod started shitting with terror and was forcibly ejected by ferdie outside the science lab i expect theyll start experimenting on him as soon as theyve cut his vocal chords said ferdie as he stormed down the drive then seeing lysanders stricken face im only winding you up quite resourceful of jacko though trying to eat that mog obviously knows hes going to have to fend for himself from now on what you talking about hatchet didnt cough up he didnt lysander rubbed his bloody lacerated hands on his jeans can i borrow another fiver i must put some flowers on mums grave unclothed as yet by any lichen or the grime of age pippa hawkleys headstone looked poignantly white and defenceless beside all the other gravestones lurching higgledypiggledy in fleetley village churchyard almost as white and defenceless as her son thought ferdie as he watched lysander chuck out some dead chrysanthemums which had blown over and refill their vase with four bunches of snowdrops philippa hawkley requiescat in pace read ferdie and tears stung his eyes as he wondered how anyone so vivid and vital as his exheadmasters wife could ever rest peacefully worried that lysander who was now swaying beside him was going to black out he urged him back into the car and turned up the heat he ought to belt straight back to london yesterdays arabs had rung his boss and complained about being bundled into a taxi instead he decided to take lysander for a drive the sun an even later riser than lysander at last put in an appearance lighting up frostbleached fields yellow stone walls and striping the drying road ahead with tree shadows as the countryside grew more hilly and deeply wooded ferdie drove past a beautiful house on the side of the valley with smooth grey trunks of beeches like the albert hall organ pipes soaring behind it lysander was temporarily roused out of his gloom when ferdie said the estate belonged to rupert campbellblack exworld showjumping champion and now one of the most successful ownertrainers in the country look at those fences god i wish rupertd give me a job lysander craned his neck to gaze into the yard i could ride all his horses and hed know how to get arthur sound again sometimes i think arthurs enjoying retirement and doesnt want to get sound at all i cant work in london any more ferdie im having a midlife crisis at twentytwo i realize that said ferdie ive got plans for you driving on another ten miles through tree tunnels and woods carpeted with fading beech leaves and lit by the occasional sulphuryellow cloud of hazel catkins they passed a tiny hamlet on the right called paradise five minutes later ferdie crossed over into the county of rutshire and pulled up on the top of a steep hill climbing out almost swept away into a dance of death by the violence of the wind they found themselves looking down into a most beautiful valley from the top vast trees descended the steep sides like passengers on a moving staircase over the trees were flung great silken waterfalls of travellers joy these seemed to flow directly into a hundred little streams which flashed like sword blades in the sunshine as they hurtled through rich brown ploughed fields or bright green water meadows into the river fleet which ran along the bottom of the valley ahead a mile downriver a little village of pale gold cotswold cottages gathered round an early english church like parishioners respectfully listening to a sermon below you shouted ferdie over the wind lies rutshires valley of paradise much larger and more ostentatious than its gloucestershire namesake but where everyone wants to live and where house prices go up rather than down here ferdie indicated several splendid houses peeping like lions out of the woods on either side you will find the most desreses in england because of the magnificent views and the money thats been spent on them rupert campbellblack refers to the area as nonutopia because so many nouveaux have moved in its also been nicknamed the rift valley because so many marriages break up so what grumbled lysander who was cold and having to hang on to his baseball cap and to poor jack whose ears were getting blown inside out i did a bit of research while you were unsuccessfully tapping your father yelled ferdie who being fat felt the cold less you know your friend rachel well this is the empire of her husbands conductorboss rannaldini his is the biggest house up on the right its called valhalla the gardens sensational in summer you can see the maze and there deep in the woods you can see a little gazebo rannaldinis outofcontrol tower where he has total privacy to edit tapes study scores and bonk ladies who approach unseen from the other side of the wood rannaldini only spends a few weeks a year here explained ferdie because hes always jetting round the world avoiding tax and outraged mistresses when hes not terrifying the london met into submission rumour has it he added knowingly that if things get too hot in england rannaldinis got his sights on the new york or berlin philharmonics i get it said lysander shoving jack inside his coat rannaldinis house might go on the market and youd get it on your books first and make a killing exactly said ferdie getting back into the car its always worth watching this area driving down the hill he turned off at a signpost saying paradise miles you make a killing he went on selling a house here to a couple then when the marriage breaks up in a few years you make another killing finding them two separate houses and if youre lucky flogging the old one for them paradise which had been voted bestkept village in rutshire for the last ten years lived up to its name even on the bleakest day it was sheltered by the towering treecovered hills the churchyard and the gardens that lined the main street were already crowded with aconites snowdrops and early crocuses winter jasmine and evergreen honeysuckle climbed to the roofs of the cottages from whose chimneys opalblue smoke rose straight up hardly ruffled by the wind although the duck pond was frozen there were fat ruby buds on the black spiky branches of the lime trees which framed the village green next to the church behind ancient stone walls hung with tuffets of mauve aubrietia lurked a charming rectory as well as an excellent village shop called the apple tree which stocked everything from videos to vine leaves paradise boasted a garden centre called adams pleasure which sold petrol and a restaurant called the heavenly host with its duckeggblue shutters drawn which opened only in the evenings ferdie and lysander however shot with indecent haste into the saloon bar of the pearly gates public house morning ferdie said the landlord who had tipped him off about local houses on several previous visits sustained by a couple of large whiskies and a plate of very hot steakandkidney pie and chips in front of a roaring fire lysander began to feel slightly more cheerful apart from a couple of pensioners gazing at halfpints of beer the place was deserted except for the vicar who in between drinking large glasses of red wine and writing sundays sermon gazed surreptitiously at lysander they ought to invent a killer cocktail called the holy spirit murmured ferdie whose pink cheeks had turned bright scarlet in the warmth on the walls dominating the coaching scenes village cricket elevens and gleaming horse brasses were two framed photographs one was of a haughtylooking greyhaired man with his eyes shut waving a stick the other of a strikingly handsome woman with dark curly hair and her mouth so wide open that lysander was tempted to toss her the piece of the pastry he was feeding to jack who are they he asked ferdie rannaldini conducting mahler and hermione harefield his mistress singing it thats her house on the left out of the window lysander could see tall yellow chimneys beckoning like fingers between two great black yew trees shes a worldfamous diva continued ferdie mopping up gravy with a third piece of bread she met rannaldini when he was conducting rigoletto in milan ten years ago its been a staggeringly successful partnership in and out of bed you must have heard of harefield and rannaldini no perhaps not he shook his head they almost outsell nigel kennedy hermiones incredibly beautiful and a pain in the ass which rannaldini probably enjoys because hes rumoured to go both ways hermiones husband bob is the orchestra manager of the london met hes a seriously nice guy with the flattest stomach in rutshire he should have the narrowest shoulders shrunk by so many musicians sobbing on them as a result of rannaldinis tantrums ignoring lysanders reproachful glances at his empty glass ferdie picked up the car keys come on i havent finished the tour outside the sun had gone in the cottages along the high street huddled together for warmth as they drove out of the village up the south side of the valley they passed a cottage with a waterfall and a swing hanging from a bent apple tree thats jasmine cottage said ferdie slowing down which also belongs to hermione and bob harefield last year they rented it out to your pianist friend rachel and her russian husband boris then rachel went abroad on a concert tour and boris was left behind babysitting and writing incomprehensible music noone wanted so he started looking around sexually in the autumn they moved back to london hoping it might be easier to find work but it doesnt seem to have helped the marriage if yesterdays eyegel incident is anything to go by and that ravishing house hidden in the willows on the left belongs to valentine hardman hes a top lawyer with a mistress up in london so his wife annabel threatens daily to throw herself into the river fleet and that vulgar pile up on the left ferdie nearly ran over a pheasant as he peered through vast electric gates up a long drive is paradise grange it belongs to larry lockton chief executive of catchitune records who make a fortune out of rannaldini and harefield larry keeps buying companies but i suspect hes hopelessly overleveraged and riding for a fall now larrys another bloke rannaldinis led astray added ferdie driving on larry used to be a fat little man who never smiled because he had bad teeth but he was so jealous of all rannaldinis mistresses he wanted one too so he had his teeth fixed lost three stone and got a new haircut like mel gibson and started bonking his secretary hes even bought her a bonkerie in pelham crescent i sold it to him explained ferdie not without complacency ground floor with a nice garden and fitted cupboards for all the skeletons larrys wife marigold used to be very pretty she was his childhood sweetheart but once he started to make his pile and began climbing socially she got weybridged and dressed like the queen eating too many white chocolates and throwing herself into charity work like a rugger ball with a difficult bounce why are you telling me all this hang on there is a reason driving on up the hill ferdie pulled into a gap through the trees across the valley half a mile to the right of valhalla they could see a georgian house smaller than fleetley but exquisitely proportioned with soaring stone angels on each corner of the roof that house angels reach was totally unmodernized with a fantastic wild garden said ferdie its been bought by georgie maguire and her husband guy seymour who are spending an absolute fortune on it lysander opened a bloodshot eye even ive heard of her wasnt she a pop singer in the sixties mum had all her records thats right now she writes songs as well ive always thought she was seriously attractive said lysander georgie and guy paid a million five ferdie edged the car on until they could see a long lake glinting gold in the falling sun below the house my guess is they cant afford it but theyre gambling on her new album which is produced by larry lockton and catchitune being a massive hit arent georgie and guy supposed to be the happiest couple in show business sighed lysander enviously which probably means theyre both screwing around said ferdie cynically lysander shook his head in bewilderment its quite awful whats the point of getting married if you spend your time bonking other people this monstrous regiment of womanizers said ferdie with a shrug paradise husbands ring up from london on thursdays to remind the housekeepers to get their wives out of the freezer so theyll be unfrosted by the time the master returns on friday night why the hell do the wives put up with it asked lysander with a shudder at least dad didnt bonk other women when your husbands as rich as croesus you get used to a certain lifestyle and you cant bear to give it up ive got croesus in my face said lysander peering gloomily in the driving mirror lets go home ferd i want to see dolly and explain about the scorpion before she goes into orbit this place is seriously depressing it is said ferdie swinging the car round particularly for someone like marigold lockton she loves that shit larry to distraction and thats where you come in youre going to be her toy boy how old is she about thirtyeight i cant bonk an old wrinkly like that said lysander in outrage youre not going to bonk her just hang about and rattle her husband and make him so jealous hell come roaring back it worked with boris levitsky and elmer winterton this time youre going to get paid dont be ridiculous snapped lysander i cant get a husband back if the marriage is dead you cant reheat baked potatoes first youve got to look at the wife said ferdie if shes gone to seed you unseed her and make her look like a mistress put back the gleam in her eye let her taunt her husband with a scented body thats quivering with lust for someone else ferdie rubbed the windscreen which was steaming up get the weight off get her some decent clothes i bet theres a raver lurking beneath marigolds polyester vnecks above all make her stop nagging and act detached no more flying leaps to catch the telephone on the first ring youve really studied this lysander looked at ferdie with new respect as they drew up outside the big electric gates of paradise grange we are about to repackage and remarket a product said ferdie lets go see marigold up a long drive through splendid parkland dotted with noble trees paradise grange reared up a sprawling bulk of grey stone topped by turrets and battlements on the perfect lawns stillfrozen patches merged with great sheets of snowdrops and on the roof a flag flying the famous yellowandpurple catchitune colours was fretted by the bitter wind although it was still early afternoon carriage lamps blazed on either side of the great oak front door there was no answer when ferdie rang the bell which played the hallelujah chorus but as he pushed open the door he bumped into marigold lockton deliriously excited that he might be a returning larry and followed by an overweight furiously barking spaniel theres no way im going to get larry lockton back for that thought lysander marigold looked absolutely dreadful rather like a beryl cook lady masquerading as mrs thatcher she was twenty pounds overweight with red eyes and red veins crisscrossing her unhealthily white cheeks an alice band on her mousy permed hair emphasized a corrugated forehead a vnecked polyester dress in overcookedsproutsgreen showed off a neck and arms as opaque and pudgy as the white chocolates with which she constantly stuffed herself she had clearly also been stuck into the vodka for several hours her first carefully elocuted words to ferdie were that he could forget about the house he was finding her in tregunter road even if larrys plannin to put paradise grange on the market aym not movin the kiddies love their ome whay should they lose it and whay should ay after all the work ayve put into redecoratin it she pointed to the oak panelling in the hall which had been painted a rather startling flamingo pink larry wanted the kiddies brought up in the country her voice rattled like a sliver of bone in the hoover as she led them into a vast drawing room so he stuck me down ere mayles away from the shops now hes packed them off to boardin school to get a posh accent and some smart friends and hes given may daily help and mr and mrs brimscombe our couple what live at the bottom of the drayve a months notice to force me out poor mr bs tended this garden for nearly forty years look at the poor old chap marigold pointed out of the window at an ancient gardener morosely clipping a yew hedge ay cant lay him off itd break his eart even more than mines broke marigold interrupted ferdie this is lysander hawkley pleased to meet you said marigold unenthusiastically then pulling herself together i suppose you want a noggin please said ferdie then seeing lysanders appalled face whispered hang about i promise you its worth it shes gross hissed lysander id need serious beer goggles to get within a hundred yards lovely view enthused ferdie loudly squeezing between a large harp and a windup gramophone to look out of the huge window stretching the length of the room you can see valhalla and angels reach from here and rachels cottage behind those wellingtonias i dont care grumbled lysander i want to go home despite several bright persian rugs tossed over a pink walltowall carpet a matching pink dog basket a superabundance of silk cushions on their points like a kirov lineup and enough tartan chairs and sofas to do the highland fling the room was as cosy as the furniture department of an oxford street store there were too many dark cumbersome pieces too many chandeliers too much gilt on the mirrors and too few logs bravely burning in the vast stone cave of a fireplace on the walls equally disparate were several gold discs won by catchitune a lugubrious stubbs spaniel a hogarth etching of a musical evening a framed manuscript of the first page of a beethoven sonata and a picasso of grapes and a violin the grand piano was weighed down with various recording awards and photographs of larry lockton fratting with the famous mostly mrs thatcher all round the room busts of the great composers looked dourly down from their pedestals at such a visual mishmash poor marigold was in a frightful state first she forgot the water for the whisky then going back to fetch it she forgot what she wanted it for and proceeded to water a bowl of lurid pink hyacinths not even noticing when it overflowed at least youve got lots of flowers said lysander looking around at the massed bunches of salmonpink gladioli ay sent them to myself confessed marigold and burst into tears while ferdie shot off to refill the jug and collect some kitchen roll lysander who was beginning to feel really sorry for marigold asked her how she had found out about larrys bimbo it was at the office party in december ay always used to be the prettiest girl at office parties grabbing a piece of kitchen roll she thrust it into her eyes all the bosses chased after me when we were first married now aym the old trout what everyone has to suck up to because aym the bosss waife she blew her nose noisily and took a slug of the replenished vodka and tonic may word thats strong ferdie anyway i was chattin to the company secretarys wife when i looked across the room and there was nikki shes larrys pa sitting on a leather sofa larry was standin besaide her chattin to the financial director and she was rubbin his er the front of his trousers perhaps she was brushing off a bit of fluff said lysander shes the bit of fluff said marigold disdainfully then larry saw ay was looking and kicked her on the shins when ay tackled him he shouted that ay was imaginin things and should get some glasses next day ay was so distraught ayd just set off to the distressed gentlefolks agm coals to newcastle thought ferdie lady chisleden was in the chair i recall went on marigold and i got all the way to rutminster before i realized id forgotten the minutes i always type them i used to be a secretary so i rushed home patch came running down the stairs which is unusual she always stays in her basket in the kitchen if we go out so i ran upstairs id just had the guest bedroom redecorated in peach draylon with peach damask curtains and ay thought ayd take another peek it looked so lovely and ay caught them at it how awful said lysander appalled what did you do ay was so shocked ay said ive just had this room redecorated and nikki asked why didnt ay have the walls dragged ay said ay dont care for draggin it always looks as though it should have another coat then ay said how long have you been sleepin with may husband she said ay must just look it up in may faylofax the cheeky cow whats she like asked lysander seeing marigold was shivering he got up and put more logs on the fire nikki spelt with a double k for kleptomania only she lifts husbands rather than shops marigold sniffed she looks like one of those girls who guides folk towards wheels of fortune in game shows very very pretty in fact shes so pretty ay never suspected shed be interested in may larry ay thought the only woman larry admired was margaret thatcher nikki asked me why ay didnt have the walls dragged you told us that said ferdie who was anxious to get down to business aym sorry i keep repeatin myself i trayed so hard to be a good wife i got lonely in the country but i kept busy with may committees and ay always washed may hair on frayday and had a candlelit dinner waitin for larry when he got back from town she started to cry again i wish someone would do that for me lysander reached for more kitchen roll i worked so hard in the early years darnin his socks studying cheap cuts and going without lunch we were so happy then can we see your wedding photographs interrupted ferdie briskly and some when you were first married collapsing heavily between him and lysander on the sofa marigold opened a red photograph album you look terrific said lysander gazing in amazement at a sixties snapshot of marigold in hyde park great legs and that chain belts very sexy i gave up lunch for a whole fortnight to pay for that dress sighed marigold i had a handspan waist then well you better give up a few more lunches reproved ferdie youve hardly got a legspan waist now and your skins awful lysander winced and wished he could go next door and watch the outside a gaudy pheasant with a red face and staring eyes trailing awkwardly round the frozen lawn looking for refuge reminded him of marigold its nothing personal said ferdie kindly its exactly like getting a horse fit for a big race you need a month on the road and two on the gallops lysanderll take you jogging and when it gets lighter in the evenings and youre frantic for that forbidden first drink of the day you can both play tennis itll never work moaned marigold if it werent for patch id kill myself patch stared balefully at them through the strings of the harp when ferdie started to discuss money lysander was so embarrassed ferdie had to take him off to larrys den where he was very excited to find a bar in the corner with every drink known to man hanging upside down with rightwayup labels oh can i play with it of course and watch the end of lingfield on the big screen if you get bored with that larrys got all donald ducks cartoons up on the right said ferdie shutting the door firmly its going to cost you he told marigold going back into the sitting room ay havent got any money larrys keepin me so short well youll have to pawn a few rings hes charmin lysander charming agreed ferdie but very expensive well have to find a cottage for him to rent down here not too near paradise to preserve his air of mystery he needs a couple of paddocks and stabling for his horses and a really sharp fuckoff car a porsche or better still a red ferrari then ignoring marigolds gasp of horror and access to a helicopter we cant have larry thinking hes some tinpot gigolo and some decent clothes a few suits and gucci shoes he needs decent shoes because he has a tendency to ingrowing toenails and you must arrange an account at the apple tree and the nearest offlicence and install satellite television so he doesnt get bored down here then theres the little matter of his debts how much are they said marigold faintly ten grand should cover it said ferdie airily hell need pocket money of course to send you flowers and take you out on the tiles if larry comes back to you thats a further ten grand and a retainer for the next year to keep larry on his toes but ay havent got that kind of money whimpered marigold ay shall be destitute no you wont ferdie topped up her glass insist larry buys you that house in tregunter and ill pretend it cost one hundred and fifty thousand pounds more than it does which gives us lots of leeway marigold was so distraught and by this time so awash with vodka that she accepted all ferdies conditions life is about taking chances said ferdie cosily pocketing a vast advance cheque its going to be a lark i promise you you ave terrific control over lysander said marigold shaking her head im his mind and his minder ferdie reassured her ill be overseeing things all the way watching the on larrys tenfoot screen made the race ten times more exciting but lysander felt ten times more depressed when the horse hed backed fell at the last fence he thought of arthur in his last race donkey ears flapping big feet splaying out in all directions but with so much heart in his great grey girth that he ran on and on just tipping the last fence in his tiredness hed got to get arthur sound again he had no job no money no prospects no mother the snowdrops outside like the ones on her grave reminded him hed never see her again the fishponds under the trees were turning ruby red in the setting sun he was roused from his black gloom by ferdie quite unable to keep the smirk off his broad pink face well you got the job what job being marigolds toy boy dont be an asshole i cant bonk for money you only get paid if you dont bonk her we dont want you involved in a messy divorce case what about arthur and tiny they can move in too all lysanders scruples were overcome when he saw his first pay cheque on the way back to london he and ferdie stopped to order a red ferrari arriving at fountain street they found the telephone ringing it was the police i think weve found your golf gti mr hawkley does it have a ncdl sticker in the back saying a dog is for life not just for christmas thats the one it wasnt in drake street where you thought youd left it but in kempton street thanks awfully said lysander thats really really kind of you but basically i dont need it any more because ive just got another one lysander ferdie grabbed the telephone in exasperation well be over to pick it up at once he told the policeman lysander arthur tiny jack and a red ferrari with a top speed of mph moved into a charming cottage seven miles from paradise and lysander lost no time in getting marigold into training as they both jogged in track suits along punishingly steep footpaths watching the first celandine and coltsfoot pushing their way through the leaf mould and the winter barley slowly turning the brown fields pale green lysander wished it was arthur he was getting fit for the rutminster gold cup rather than marigold but they made terrific progress marigold was still desperately low and lysander got bored as she endlessly bent his ear about larry but he began to realize the extent of her hurt and desolation and how hard she had supported larry in his rocketlike rise to the top ay really trayed to be a social asset she told lysander one morning as they pounded up paradise hill for years ay struggled with those dreadful elocution lessons pink from her exertions marigold went even pinker ay was taught by a disgustin old lezzie who kept touchin may bosom to make me project from the chest how dreadful lysander shuddered lets stop and look at the vista gasped marigold who was panting more from nonstop chatter than the oneinfive gradient across the valley softened by a pale sun morning mist and the thickening buds of its army of trees paradise grange rose like a fairytale castle ay cant bear to leave it she sighed you should see it in summer when the paradise pearl is out thats a pinkywhaite wisteria mr brimscombe planted thirty years ago we floodlaight it in the evenings and thats lady chisledens home to the left ay trayed so hard to dress laike lady chisleden i dont think thats wise said lysander in alarm the old trout was blocking paradise high street this morning with her bentley bawling out adams pleasure for delivering manure that was more straw than shit perhaps she could give arthur a job marigold smiled but as they started off down the hill she returned to the subject of larry talkin of horses ay always thought we had a good love laife her voice trembled but one of the things nikki screamed at me was that larry told her ay made love laike a dead horse because ay never moved although marigold had told him this a dozen times lysander put his arm round her alive horses dont move very much he said consolingly ive seen lots of them being covered my uncle alastair ran a stud at one time and someone always held the mare still anyway men say anything to a girl when they want to get their leg over to begin with lysander used to escape to london as soon as he had supervised marigolds frugal supper to party all night returning yawning at breakfast and falling asleep in the afternoon on larrys sunbed but gradually he spent more and more time at paradise grange there was so much to do working out in the gym swimming in the heated pool riding the hunters larry abandoned after hed been bucked off at the opening meet watching all larrys walt disney tapes playing with larrys bar what a pity youre off the booze marigold i could mix you some terrific cocktails one of their first mutual projects was the restoration of arthur whod been confined to box rest for three months by the vet as soon as the old horse arrived lysander had driven marigold over to his cottage to meet him it was a beautiful day after a night of heavy rain the robins were singing their heads off and the racing streams glittered in the sunshine marigold tried not to squeal with terror as lysander stormed the red ferrari along the winding country lanes whose high hedges were filling up so quickly with buds and even leaves one had no idea who might be hurtling in the opposite direction by contrast barking his head off and rattling back and forwards like a shaken dice jack seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself how did you acquire arthur asked marigold faintly well its an extraordinary story basically my cousin titus was in the army in the oman and during some skirmish he found arthur wandering on the edge of the desert thin as a rake and desperately dehydrated well titus had nowhere to stable him that night and no headcollar so he and his men made a corral by parking four army lorries nose to tail even in his desperately weakened condition arthur jumped straight over one of the bonnets after a passing mare titus thought theyd lost him but he was back nosing around for toast and marmalade the next morning anyway he was such a distinctivelooking horse that his owner some arab sheik whom titus was liberating recognized him and was so grateful he let titus keep him arthurs got quite a good pedigree titus brought him back to england and gave him to his father my uncle alastair who was a trainer and who won a lot of races with him i was left some money by an aunt and alastair was in financial trouble he was always bad with money so i spent the lot buying arthur from him id always loved the horse dad was absolutely livid aym not surprised said marigold shocked your uncle shouldnt have taken all your inheritance you havent met arthur said lysander fondly anyway poor uncle alastair died of a heart attack and arthur fell first time out last september the vet said rest him for a year but mum and i were determined to get him sound by next season then mum died in october for a second lysanders hands clenched on the wheel then swinging off the road and destroying any hope that marigold might have had that he might slow down on the stony track up to the cottage he added so im going to get him sound if it kills me yes ay can see that said marigold only thankful to be alive amid so much death as lysander drew up with a jerk outside the stables behind the cottage oh how adorable she squeaked for the great grey horse hanging out of his box was tugging hay from a net so untidily that tiny his black shetland stablemate who was attacking another net hung below his had nearly vanished under a thatch of dropped hay the sweet wee thing marigold rushed forward to hug the little pony i wouldnt warned lysander as tiny lashed out with a lightning offhind he pulled marigold out of the way just in time tiny he added giving the pony a sharp boot on the rump is an absolute bitch she ought to meet nikki said marigold with a sniff nikki said basically i only keep tiny interrupted lysander hastily before marigold could get into her stride because arthurs so bats about her she henpecks him dreadfully and shes tried to kill jack several times scooping jack up lysander held him so he could lick arthurs nose then plonked the little dog between the horses huge flopping ears immediately jack tightroped down arthurs straggly mane and settled down into the small of his back how adorable sighed marigold giving tiny a very wide berth as she stroked arthur hes uge isnt he eighteen hands said lysander proudly he was the biggest horse in training the public still send him fan mail and twix bars because they know he loves them arthur was pure white except for his grey nose and dark eyes which were fringed with long straight white eyelashes and edged with white on the inside corners as though some makeup artist had wanted to widen them arthur looks as though hes been around said marigold basically he has said lysander hes lived in back gardens in fulham and on dollys parents lawn there was a row about that and he spent three days in the orchard of a woman whose house i was er trying to sell not anxious to expand on that lysander pointed to the traffic cones and rubber tyres hed hung over arthurs door to give him something to biff around and amuse himself with hes so good about being inside lysander pulled arthurs ears he just adores being petted he never bites tiny back and if jack attacks his ankles he just looks down in amazement if he were a human hed put on a smoking jacket and velvetcrested slippers every night hes such a gent like his master said marigold warmly i wish dolly thought so sighed lysander shes just sent me a really sarky card congratulations on your retirement now watch this as he produced a tin of fanta out of his barbour pocket arthur gave a deep vesuvius whicker pulling back the tab lysander put the tin between arthurs big yellow teeth and with gurgles of ecstasy arthur tipped back his head and drained the lot he cant get up in the morning without his bowl of coffee said lysander retrieving the tin but only if it has two spoonfuls of sugar february th was a day for celebration marigold weighed in a stone lighter at nine stone four and even patch had shed five pounds and could wriggle through the cat door again after a frugal lunch of clear soup fennelandkiwifruit salad marigold was virtuously stuffing invitations to a save the children bring and buy into envelopes instead of white chocolates into herself and lysander was sitting with his muddy booted legs up on the table trying to compose a valentine poem to dolly who still hadnt forgiven him for his exploits in palm beach ferdies brilliant at writing poems but hes out and i must get it in the post what rhymes with green keen mean been my queen sheen suggested marigold did you know birds choose their mates on valentines day she peered out at the crowded birdtable and that in the spring the chaffinch gets a pinker breast and the blackbird a more golden beak and look at that starlin his feathers are all purple and green in the sunshine but lysander was looking at marigold her skin was glowing pink not dead white laced with hectic red her eyes no longer bloodshot were the same hazel as the catkins dropping their pollen on the kitchen table there was no resemblance now to a beryl cook lady sod the birds youre the one looking terrific he said tipping back his chair oh get on with you said marigold putting two invitations into the same envelope and blushing crimson look at those sweet little great tits swingin on that coconut then her happiness evaporated that was the coconut larry won at the village fête last year how dyou know so much about birds asked lysander anxious to distract her ay thought ay should study wildlaife when we moved to the country unfortunately larry got interested in another kaind of bird thats a sort of joke if a very weak one marigold thought in surprise perhaps im beginning to laugh again how are you getting on with your poem she asked proudly lysander handed it across the table the rose is red the grarse is green read marigold open your legs and ile turn you to creem oh laysander marigold was shocked rigid ay dont think thats in the raight spirit why dont you pop down to the apple tree theyve got some beautiful floral cards with such lovely sentiments inside or even left blank to record your message ay weakened marigold hung her head and sent one with primroses on to larry ay trayed to get it back and nearly got my hand stuck in the letterbox anyway ay dont think nikkill let it through she gets the kettle out for anythin marked prayvate and confidential lysander was so worried marigold would get no valentines that he rushed off to the apple tree and bought her the largest card in the shop which he handed to her with a huge bunch of daffodils the next morning so she wouldnt get all excited and think it was from larry oh thats beautiful said marigold deeply touched inside lysander had written to marrygold who gets prittier eech day love lysander i didnt marry gold she thought sadly its nikki thats going to do that as soon as larry divorces me seeing her face cloud over lysander handed her another present more sellotape than gift wrap thought marigold fondly as she broke her way in and found a size ten pair of blackvelvet shorts theyre lovely she squeaked but you must be jokin give it three weeks said lysander and well be there we mumbled marigold how very nice as we cant celebrate your great weight loss by getting pissed this evening added lysander i bought some magic mushrooms in rutminster ay cant take drugs said marigold appalled aym hoping to become a jp its just a natural product said lysander airily we can make tea out of them youll love it and you wont put on an ounce aym supposed to be going to a bestkept village committee cancel it crocodile dundees on television ay really shouldnt said marigold that was the third committee meeting shed cancelled that week what a very sweet boy thought marigold when they were jogging he helped her over stiles and caught her elbow if she slipped in the mud or on the icy roads and he always opened doors and helped her on with her coat he was probably doing it because he thought of her as a pathetic old wrinkly she told herself sternly but larry had never done any of these things in eighteen years and lysander never got cross she loved the elegant way he draped himself over sofas and window seats and suddenly dropped off to sleep like a puppy and he was so appreciative of her cooking even if it was clear soup fennel and kiwi fruit i got a tipoff about some seriously good dope in cathedral lane in rutminster of all unlikely places lysander told marigold as they jogged up the north side of paradise a fortnight later and this nutter pressed his face against the car window and said are you looking for jesus i said no im looking for no anyway theyre offering an eighth of an ounce for the price of a sixteenth if theyre discounting drugs the recession must be biting he was trying to cheer up marigold who despite the beauty and incredible mildness of the day had been thrown into black gloom by the display of crocuses on the lawn below the house specially planted by herself and mr brimscombe it spelled out the word catchitune in the record companys purpleandyellow colours it was the sort of gesture larry adored ay was going to floodlight them as a surpraise so he could see them from his helicopter when he landed on frayday neight and now bees were humming in the crocuses which were arching back their petals and thrusting forward their orange stamens to welcome the sun if not a returning larry wheres rannaldini asked lysander as they pounded past the secretive grey abbey shrouded in its conspirators cowl of woods whizzin round the world avoiding exwaives and tax said marigold sourly rannaldini plays on peoples weaknesses he realized larry was socially insecure he made us go exdirectory for a start said bein unlisted was the done thing just meant that noone could phone us then he told larry it was common to put up the name of ones house ayd just had a board carved in poker work for larrys birthday larry put it in the attic so noone can faind the house to drop in then he encouraged larry to ave electric gates to keep out the public so if people could faind the house they couldnt get in anyway phew its hot marigolds green track suit was dark with sweat is he attractive rannaldini in a horrid sort of way said marigold disapprovingly not may taype far too edgy makin doesnt angels reach look lovely in the sunshine stopping to rest on a mossy stile they gazed down at the big georgian house which was to be the future home of pop star georgie maguire as well as the stone angels guarding the roof and the gates at the bottom of the drive more angels had been clipped out of the lowering yew battlements which protected the house from the east wind and tossing their yellow locks a row of weeping willows seemed about to tumble into the lake like glorious swedish blondes racing down to bathe itll be lovely having another celeb in the village to vie with hermione and rannaldini said marigold i must make sure georgie opens the church fête this summer to irritate hermione georgies my best friend she went on proudly she and guy bought the house so shed know someone near by in the country ay dont know what shell say when she comes back from the states and fainds out larrys trying to chuck me out people are so competitive round here sighed marigold breathing in the faint sweet heady smell of damp earth burgeoning leaves and violets rannaldini was jealous of larrys executive jet so he got a bigger one then larry got a landrover with three telephones so rannaldini got a range rover with four below them the river fleet lay like mother of pearl along the bottom of the valley blackheaded gulls congregated on its banks our grounds extend to the river said marigold so rannaldini bought another twenty acres so he could have a mooring too then rannaldini had hermione and god knows who else so larry had to have nikki whos rannaldini married to at the moment asked lysander watching the gulls rising and resettling on the opposite bank like a snowstorm well his second wife cecilia was an incredibly glamorous italian soprano but she made scenes rather than beds and rannaldini likes an ordered life and not meanin to boast i think he was a bit jealous that larrys home ran more smoothly than his did i bet he was lysander squeezed marigolds shoulder basically you know how to make a man happy well ay dont know but anyway rannaldini divorced cecilia and married kitty his pa in her case it stands for permanently available shes a poppet an absolute gem runs rannaldinis houses sorts out his finances checks his contracts protects him from importunate fans and exmistresses looks after his hoards of fraightful kiddies and whisks up supper whenever he invaites entire orchestras home without any warning i could do with someone like that said lysander i dont understand the poll tax at all and she puts up with hermione treating her laike a housemaid oh sugar talk of the devil there was a whirl and chug like the last spin of a huge washingmachine as a helicopter appeared over the woods thats hermione coming home said marigold furiously shes also been on tour no doubt shell be over in a flash boastin what a success shes been and how many men have fallen madly in love with her one can never have too many men in love with one marigold and bringing me her latest tape to cheer me up which my husband has already produced in its thousands and saying how are you how are you when she doesnt give a shit whoops penny in the swear box hermione must be the most irritating person since the nurse in romeo and juliet next moment the helicopter landed on the lawn of the big yellow house with beckoning chimneys which lay between valhalla and paradise village they could see a tiny figure getting out and people running across the lawn to meet her and could hear voices and laughter echoing round the wood lets stop off at the apple tree and get some mars bars said marigold through gritted teeth better not ferdies coming down to weigh you tomorrow back home marigold changed out of her track suit and had a long comforting bath when she came very apprehensively into the kitchen wearing some new jeans lysander gave a tarzan howl of joy my god theyre great youve got such a terrific ass i mean figure not so good with all this flesh spillin over like uncooked pastry said marigold raising her dark blue cardigan above the waistband thatll be gone in a week said lysander thinking what a lovely mouth marigold had when it was laughing and not hidden in a hard line brooding about larry she looked ever less like a beryl cook lady now the regimented curls had been straightened and streaked and fell in a shiny blond bob over one eye the hot bath had unleashed the arpège she had splashed all over her body if ferdies comin tomorrow i better take a ton of exlax tonaight said marigold heavens who would have thought shed ever discuss laxatives with a man but having ridden races lysander knew all about getting weight off he really was a very sweet boy half an hour later lysander and marigold were in larrys study smoking like mad to dull their appetites and watching the runners in the at wincanton circling in the paddock ive backed rupert campbellblacks horse penscombe pride said lysander that bay in the dark blue rug doesnt he look well he won both the rutminster and the cotchester gold cups last year even i know that said marigold hes favourite but hes carrying so much weight next moment jack flew out of the basket he now shared with patch and went into a frenzy of yapping as hermione harefield swept in whats the point of electric gates muttered marigold when mrs brimscombe lets in the horrors hermione was fortunate to have looks that needed little maintenance her strong glossy dark brown curls fell naturally into shape her big eyes the colour of after eights were fringed with thick lashes that never needed mascara no spot nor red vein ever marred a complexion as smooth and creamy as carnation milk her splendid bosom soared above an enviously slim waist and she never wore trousers because they would have emphasized a rather large bottom and hidden long charmingly curved legs she could easily have passed for the much admired younger sister of michelangelos david but in hermiones case beauty was only rhinoceroushide deep embracing marigold regally she said how are you how are you in her deep thrillingly rich voice and presented her with a tape of herself singing sea shanties including blow the wind southerly she then insisted on pressing the mute button of the television and playing the tape fortissimo while recounting details of her wildly successful tour such love such love one could feel it reaching out to one cried hermione but its a responsibility to be so beloved i must take my voice increasingly into the open air and bring music to the people so ive decided to do hyde park and wembley this summer but when i felt paradise beneath my feet and little cosmo rushed across the lawn crying mummy mummy i knew that here was the real world she smiled at lysander who having risen when she came in was now back with his feet on the table listening to her nonstop flow with his mouth open finally marigold butted in hermione may i introduce lysander hawkley my personal exercise trainer but you never take any exercise said hermione in disbelief which turned to disapproval when marigold despatched lysander to get a bottle of wine and some perrier for herself you shouldnt encourage workmen to watch television and drink in the middle of the afternoon marigold whats he doing here mending my heart but hermione wasnt listening i need to get in touch with larry im recording dido next week and i want to know whos singing aeneas and which recording studios been booked ay havent a clue snapped marigold ring nikkis new apartment youll find larry in bed there dont be bitter marigold its so ageing chided hermione who loathed her friends having marriage problems because it gave them an excuse to talk about themselves rather than her i refuse to take sides she went on im sure poor larrys as confused as you are and sells millions of your records said marigold furiously oh marigold you silly billy sighed hermione looking at marigold properly for the first time youve dyed your hair i thought i needed a change hermione put her head on one side well if you like it thats the main thing and ive never seen you in jeans before we are jazzing ourselves up with a trembling hand marigold reached for a silk cut hermione who had a singers pathological horror of smoking was about to reproach her when she was distracted by the tape reaching blow the wind southerly this is my favourite i never thought anyone could sing blow as well as kathleen ferrier but the american critics say my version is better oh look sighed lysander pausing in the doorway his arms full of bottles and glasses and nodding at an incredibly handsome man talking to a sardoniclooking jockey in blueandgreen colours thats rupert campbellblack isnt he handsome and seriously cool and thats bluey charteris who rides for him lucky sod lysander was about to turn up the sound when the cameras switched to the latest odds penscombe prides were shortening i was lucky to get that bet on early god i want to meet rupert hermione refused a drink but said pointedly that shed like some tea because she hadnt had any lunch youre out of luck said lysander marigolds on a diet hermione turned to marigold i thought you were looking awfully tired she looks great lysander smiled amiably at hermione im afraid the only thing in the fridge is some smoked salmon for our supper said marigold ill have that said hermione and such was the force of her personality that she was just polishing off the lot washed down by earl grey and honey when jack and patch went into another frenzy of barking this time it was rannaldinis young wife kitty clutching a bunch of freesias and a redspotted tin she blushed when she saw not only marigold but also hermione her husbands mistress plus an incredibly goodlooking young man perhaps he was hermiones latest launching into a flurry of how are yous hermione embraced kitty graciously then embarrassed her by saying teasingly both sides kitty and holding out her other cheek to be kissed after kitty had ducked away marigold who since larrys departure had suffered from chronic lapse of memory suddenly blocked on lysanders surname and merely introduced him and kitty by their christian names heavens hes gorgeous thought kitty he must be some young actor whos making a pop record such a sweet sleepy smile very pleased to meet you lysunder she stammered then turning to marigold you look wonderful i love your air and youre so lovely and slim i have been tryin said marigold gratefully well you probably wont want that said kitty going even redder as marigold opened the redspotted tin which contained a huge dark chocolate cake oh yum sighed marigold oh kitty you are kaind but i truly mustnt lysander can though and so can i said hermione i never have to diet having helped herself to a vast slice hermione rewound the tape to play blow the wind southerly which was blotted out by lysanders howl of joy as penscombe pride won by a length yippee he hugged marigold in ecstasy ive won two fucking grand i can buy you a gold exercise bike now looking very bootfaced hermione picked up a new biography of placido domingo turning to the index for reference to herself i must go said kitty i didnt mean to butt in when youd got company marigold you must have a drink to celebrate said lysander letting marigold go ill have a small sweet sherry then said kitty rannaldini dont approve but i cant drink it dry ill have some more perrier please darling marigold handed lysander her glass clever to ave a win like that said kitty im afraid im terrified of orses id ave walked over ere this afternoon but rannaldinis turned the prince of darkness hes a big black fing with uge teef out in long meadow so i came by car i know the prince of darkness bloody good horse came second in the whitbread said lysander es still got uge teef sighed kitty lysander thought kitty was as plain as hermione was beautiful she was probably younger than him but she had a round pale face and eyes far too wide apart behind disfiguringly strong spectacles her fuzzy light brown hair was dragged off a rather spotty forehead into a bun with her squashed snub nose and big generous mouth the bottom lip of which she was nervously gnawing as she listened to hermione she resembled an apprehensive pug on the end of a chatterbox mistress a gold cross round her neck and a navyblue polyester dress with a white collar gave her a prim look but couldnt disguise her heavy breasts and lack of waist plump legs were not flattered by fleshcoloured tights nor by navyblue high heels which thrust her forward like a plant desperately seeking the sunlight cheers she attacked her large glass of sherry i was wondering if youd like to come to tea i mean supper next week marigold love to said marigold as long as you dont cook anything fattening can i bring lysander hes just moved into a cottage at eldercombe thats nice near ricky francelynch said kitty his wife daisys just ad the most gorgeous liel boy she added wistfully youll be next said marigold reassuringly eavens i ope so said kitty who unlike marigold made no attempt to disguise a strong cockney accent hermione having finished reading about herself in the domingo biography cut another massive piece of chocolate cake and asked do you play an instrument lysarnder yarss said lysander gravely i learnt the piano at prep school but i only play with one hand because i was always fending off mr molesworth the music master with the other one what a pity said hermione ignoring marigolds laughter im recording beethovens cycle to the distant beloved on monday i need an accompanist to rehearse with such a beautiful work dyou know it lysander shook his head cant imagine anyone bicycling to see a beloved round here particularly a distant one the hills are so steep its bad enough jogging for a second kittys face crumpled up into a smile then she quickly asked hermione how little cosmo was magic magic said hermione warmly which reminds me kitty do you know definitely when rannaldinis getting back ive got to learn amelia boccanegra at top speed so i need him to work with me on the character and the vocal demands i fink hes coming back for georgie maguires launching party said kitty id forgotten wed got to be subjected to that grumbled hermione one meets such awful people at poprecord launches i expect larry needs you and rannaldini to raise the tone said marigold acidly i expect he does agreed hermione but i still dont really like georgie maguires voice i love it said lysander so do i agreed kitty defiantly then seeing hermiones glare i must go ive got a great pile of contracts at home said hermione to punish her so perhaps you could pop over tomorrow and check them for me so you dont have to fork out for a lawyer thought marigold furiously as lysander showed kitty out hermione reproached marigold for fraternizing with young men hes probably gay the way he was going on about rupert campbellblack then patronizingly as she refilled her glass youre not in your first youth marigold im about to be into my first youth muttered marigold through clenched teeth blow the wind southerly sang hermione on the tape who was that girl asked lysander returning didnt you realize said marigold thats kitty rannaldini rannaldinis daughter lysander took a cigarette from marigolds pack no his wife his wife said lysander bloody hell i thought rannaldini was into fantasticlooking women hermione had been about to reproach lysander for smoking instead she bowed in acknowledgement of the implied compliment then added sententiously some people think shes rather common but i maintain kitty rannaldini is very much her own woman hardly be anyone elses looking like that said lysander he must have got her from pug rescue thats unkind hermione laughed heartily kittys sweet protested marigold angrily shes such a good listener unlaike some and so kaind you forget how plain she is outside the setting sun like a great red air balloon was turning the mist which had suddenly filled the valley the softest rosepink having polished off another drink hermione known locally as the great white hinter asked if the ferrari outside the door was lysanders and whether he could run her home i walked here but its a bit chilly and we singers are paranoid about getting colds goodbye marigold dont take everything quite so personally lysander returned ten minutes later to find marigold gibbering with rage her fury at hermiones jibes and smugness had been exacerbated by a sudden violent explosion of jealousy because she had waltzed off with lysander this was the more appalling because after all she had suffered over larry marigold thought she was immune from feeling jealous about anyone else the bitch she stormed not taking saides indeed dont be bitter marigold if you like your hair thats what matters and being so patronizing about georgie and poor darling kitty have a drink one wont hurt whats brought all this on then insistin you drove her home god im unhappy marigold was so upset she unthinkingly picked up the remaining quarter of chocolate cake and was about to shove it into her face when lysander grabbed her hand squeezing it until she dropped the cake on the floor then he took her in his arms dont be miserable shes just jealous i think youre absolutely gorgeous you do whispered marigold yarss said lysander and catching her off guard as she giggled he kissed her nearly losing his tongue in the process as marigold clamped her teeth and lips together with a squeal of horrified rage how dare you with shock fuelled by years of respectability and inhibition she was fighting him off pummelling his chest like frank bruno no no no but lysander grabbed her arms and much stronger than her drew her towards him tantalizing her with the lithe youthful warmth of his body refusing to let go until panicstricken she raised her leg to knee him in the groin but somehow her leg never reached its target for far above it lysander was whispering words of such affection and desire into her hair i want you marigold you creep into my thoughts like that pink mist stealing up the valley glancing up amazed by such poetic sentiment and seeing the gentleness in his adorably innocent eyes and feeling his fingers stroking her face seeking some loving message in braille she let him put his beautiful mouth on hers as she kissed him back the raised leg retreated and coiled itself round the other leg in ecstasy and the pummelling frank bruno fists unclenched and may goodness she was hanging from lysanders neck like a chimpanzee because she was so dizzy with lust it was the only way she could stand up slowly slowly like a harrods lift at christmas lysander progressed downwards worried that her breasts might be droopy she clamped her arms back over them but as lysander caressed her neck she couldnt remember if shed plucked out that bristle on her chin this morning raising her hand to check she left her right breast exposed next moment it had fallen like a ripe pear into his hand as he unhooked her bra lets go to bed we cant ayve never been to bed with anyone but larry and he says ay fuck laike a dead marigold gave a wail hush just regard it as a superior form of workout people are said never to remember how they get upstairs to the bedroom but it was imprinted on marigolds memory because lysander kissed her on every stair but still half her mind was fretting about stretch marks and whether her body would be creased by such tight jeans and although shed had a bath two hours ago whether she should wash again so she wouldnt smell of mouldy old woman as they reached the landing she nearly led him into the airing cupboard no not in our bedroom she squeaked with a resurgence of virtue and certainly not in there as lysander tried another door thats where i caught larry and nikki good i can lay you and the ghost but the central heatings been off for days lysanders body was warmer than any radiator as he drew her close and slowly began to unbutton her navyblue cardigan turn off the laight moaned marigold as she shot between the peach satin sheets i want to look at you said lysander in the end they compromised by leaving the light on on lysanders side with the lampshade tipped outwards god i love snogging lets go on for hours and marigold who hadnt snogged since the purley odeon in the sixties responded with alacrity then with the joyful excitement of a child unpacking a christmas stocking he began to explore her body christ these are beautiful he buried his face in her heavy breasts and do you like being stroked here he turned her over to admire her surprisingly high rounded bottom this is my favourite bit his hands crept up the velvet inside of her thighs no it isnt quite this is his long fingers disappeared into the sticky spongy burrow aaaaaah sighed marigold eureka said lysander as like a doorbell in the dark his middle finger found the nub of her clitoris ay reek of what marigold jumped away in horror she knew she should have washed beforehand the only greek i know come here ay truly shouldnt isnt it nice heavenly but we mustnt oh please go on oh gracious me how lovely oh help me help me marigold went silent and rigid her breath came in little gasps and she forgot to hold her tummy in finally she gave a contented moan oh laysander that was top ole it certainly was opening her eyes she saw he was smiling down at her open your legs and ill turn you to cream did you enjoy it oh very much and now ay must give you pleasure dutifully marigold reared up on her elbow the progress of her hand down his flat belly into the down of hair was impeded by a cock rearing up like the tower of pisa may word marigold had never really liked larrys cock which was rather small and because he preferred to make love in the morning shed never known after a nights sleep what was under the folds shed always treated it like an unexploded bomb but lysander having had a shower after their jog smelled as fresh and sweet as the violets that had scented the valley that afternoon and his cock tasting faintly of pears soap was so hard and smooth beneath her lips that she began to give it puppy licks used to dollys snakelike flickering expertise lysander was curiously turned on but when she grew bolder and tried to take his cock in her mouth he sensed her fear and detaching himself slithered down the satin sheets pulling her on top of him oh thats wonderful gasped marigold feeling gloriously thrust upward oh laysander im flaying from your flagpole oh laysander laysander that was miraculous said lysander retrieving the duvet from the floor as he collapsed back on to the satin pillows youre amazing a complete revelation men are supposed to go on for hours i never last more than a minute if im lucky so i make up for it beforehand ay should feel guilty why we must have lost at least five hundred calories then suddenly he sat up put the fist of one hand into the palm of the other screwed up his face engagingly like hermione and sang in a high falsetto blow the cock southerly southerly southerly and they both collapsed with giggles we mustnt tell ferdie said marigold no hed be livid said lysander in alarm he insisted no bonking we wont do it again we might if we use up another five hundred calories we could get a takeaway for supper oh yes please how about now marigold glanced at the clock in amazement but youll miss neighbours some things are more important oh laysander thats the greatest compliment ayve ever been paid why dont we phone mrs brimscombe and ask her to record it this and subsequent glorious couplings cheered marigold up immensely particularly when her two sons came home from prep school for the weekend and fell almost more in love with lysander than she had not only did he play endless billiards and darts with them and took them to the amusement arcades in rutminster and to the stables to mess around with arthur and tiny but he also initiated them into the more dubious pleasures of poker chemmy and betting jasons shriek of delight when he won on an eachway bet at chepstow was only equalled by marks quiet satisfaction that by the end of the weekend lysander owed him at poker marigold was wryly aware that lysander was far nearer to the boys in age and behaviour than he was to her but she was overjoyed to see her sons emerge from pale monosyllabic shellshock no doubt induced as much by two terms at an english prep school as by the collapse of their parents marriage she was also gratified that whenever the boys were absorbed with anything lysander sloped out to the kitchen for a surreptitious but no less passionate embrace he couldnt keep his hands off her she had lost a further seven pounds a week later when she got a telephone call on her private line knowing it could only be larry she was only just stopped by lysander from snatching up the receiver on the first ring the warmth of his hand over hers gave her strength make him wait ten rings and play it cool larry was telephoning to say hed be in the area that evening could he drop in for a very quick drink marigold was thrown into total panic wed better ask ferdies advice on this one said lysander ferdie bored of not selling houses in london and wanting to suss out properties in paradise said he would be straight down to orchestrate the whole thing larry lockton was a bully with a megaego and no small talk who was used to ordering around thousands at work having lost weight found a decent dentist and coaxed his coarse black hair forward to hide a receding hairline he had developed sex appeal late in life huge success at work and a decent tailor had accelerated the process when addressing his social superiors he talked with an orchard of plums in his mouth landing the helicopter he saw a blur of yellow and purple what the hell was marigold doing spoiling his perfect lawn with crocuses it would take ten grand off the asking price he must remember to remove his gold discs the picasso the stubbs and the framed beethoven sonata before marigold got too grasping over the spoils letting himself in larry was surprised not to be welcomed by marigold only patch greeted him and then with reservation larry meant fewer chewsticks and banishment from her mistresss bed at night going into the kitchen he found a table with pink candles laid for two pink freesias and hyacinths everywhere and two bottles of moët in the fridge oh christ he hoped marigold wasnt planning to lure him into staying for dinner nikki was expecting him back they were going to a party to meet kiri te kanawa and marigolds attempted candlelit lobster thermidor last month had ended in total hysterics and both lobsters being hurled at him hed better watch out for flying sauceboats he could hear noises overhead finding a navyblue overcoat covered in dog hairs hanging over the banisters larry went slowly up to his former bedroom where he was shocked to discover his naked wife blowdrying her hair seeing him she jumped only slightly then languidly wrapped round herself a fluffy yellow towel which matched her eyes larry ay didnt hear you arrive let me finish my hair you know it drays crinkly if ay stop in the middle marigold then kept him waiting half an hour giving him time to absorb all lysanders clutter of drying boots breeches sporting lifes and a pile of beautifully ironed harvie hudson shirts on the hall table when she wandered down still in the yellow towel marigold was delighted to see larrys shirt was crumpled and missing a button she also noticed how old he looked compared with lysander and that with hair long enough for a ponytail a new black moustache bags under his eyes and designer stubble flecked with grey all no doubt nikkis work he looked seedy rather than sexy he was also dressed uncharacteristically butchly in a studded leather jacket and black jeans belted with a large silver buckle wheres your motor bike she said teasingly i thought youd have got fat gobblin up all those poor little companies but you seem to have lost even more weight have a glass of bubbly aym going to its my fucking champagne thought larry noticing that as she took the bottle out of the fridge she replaced it with another and that her hair was streaked very blond and her toenails had been newly painted scarlet the towel was showing a great expanse of stunning recently waxed duotanned legs marigold in fact was looking fantastic as though shed been restored and a picture light shone over her larry then asked her if shed mind coming to the party next week to launch georgie maguires new album rock star ive brought the whole package larry threw the tape the single and the album down on the kitchen table the sleeve showed georgie maguire clinging wetly to a rock with her head thrown back eyes closed nostrils flaring long drenched red hair snaking down her back i think it looks terrific hermione was barefoot on the sleeve of blow the wind southerly said marigold who knew nikki had worked on the design are you trying to tell folk your artistes cant afford shoes larry refused to rise albums going to be a massive hit its storming up the american charts so the partyll be a celebration loads of names accepted already hermione and rannaldini are coming and presumably nikki to add glamour said marigold sweetly she might look in admitted larry should be a terrific bash ill bash her thought marigold narrowly missing larry as the champagne cork flew out larry adjusted his leather jacket bought new that morning wondering if it were over the top he felt more at home in pinstripe pop in for half an hour he said gruffly just to show georgie theres no hard feelings because she wont sign another contract with you if she has an inkling what an absolute shit youve been to me said marigold flaring up chill out said larry which irritated marigold more than ever its in your interest youll be able to screw far more maintenance out of me if georgie signs that contract he added heartily besides its her first big break in twenty years she wants her best friend there weighing up the options marigold let the towel slip a fraction and id like you to be there larry was shocked to hear himself saying all right ayll show marigold agreed flatly and tray and behave then glancing at the kitchen clock i must get ready dont hurry finish your drink utterly thrown expecting either abuse or pleading to stay larry drained his whisky and was then even more flabbergasted when marigold said ayve decided ayve been horribly selfish over the kids one must be civilized for their sakes and they must get to know nikki shes so near them in age let larry experience some of the same guilt she felt about cradlesnatching in fact you can have them next weekend im goin away to your mother asked larry no to paris marigold smiled beautifully and mummy would be decaydedly de trop if larry had looked round he would have seen the tears in his wifes eyes instead trampling crocuses underfoot as he strode furiously out to his helicopter he was incensed to see a red ferrari unleashed by a signal from ferdie storming up the drive larry had refused to listen to hermiones hints about an overfamiliar workman workmen in his experience did not drive ferraris only when he looked back from his helicopter did he read catchitune in yellow and purple on the lawn and almost weep five days later lysander drove marigold up to london for georgie maguires launching party a huge sixties star georgie was now in her late forties but from the posters plastered all over the walls of hammersmith and fulham georgie maguire live in concert which showed her clinging to the same wet rock as on the cd sleeve she was still seductive in a slightly blousy way how can one be dead in concert asked lysander dodging and diving through endofrushhour traffic shell be dead on her feet from touring and jet lag said marigold georgies new album was already number two in america because of the leading track the actual rock star of the title the song in fact was not about a rock star but a celebration of georgies abiding love for her husband guy who was not only the rock on which she built her life but the star who guided her the sentiment would have been mawkish had not the lyrics and melody written and sung by georgie herself in her husky mezzosoprano voice been so beautiful with so many marriages breaking up such a simple public confession of love had driven the americans wild the young in particular adored the song because they craved the example of a happy lasting union in the same way they had loved lady in red which chris de burgh had written about his wife to distract herself from the terrors of lysanders driving and the party ahead marigold played the advance rock star tape all the way up to london it still made her cry whats georgies husband like asked lysander overtaking a startled chauffeur in a limo on the inside as he stormed up the lillie road oh very attractive rather stern but incredibly kaind georgie used to be terribly wild before she married and for quite a whayle afterward guy got an honours degree at cambridge and a boxing blue his father was a bishop in some hot african country so guys used to givin orders his family were horrifayed when he married georgie but he stuck bay her he calmed her down understood her need for freedom yet yanked in the reins when she went too far he was also big enough to handle her success and her failures he was there when she went out of fashion in the lateseventies and stopped her drinking heavily when she had one flop after another ayve never forgotten her last big launch in the early eighties they hired the hippodrome and none of the media turned up just georgie dancing by herself to her own music then collapsin in a sozzled heap it was terrible poor georgie lysander was appalled id have danced with her shes a bit scatty too went on marigold checking her reflection for the thousandth time and guys always given her so much backup domestically changing nappies taking the kids out hes a wonderful cook too he should give larry lessons and me said lysander he sounds depressingly like one of my brothers how did you and georgie meet she came as a temp to the office where ay was working tryin to support herself between gigs she could only taype with two fingers and used to come in and collapse on the taypewriter complainin that shed been trippin all night i tayped most of her letters but she was such fun she had lots of unsuitable musician boyfriends but guy was always in the background her guyrope she called him finally they got married what does he do asked lysander shooting a red light at the bottom of the north end road well he was thinking of going into the church hed have packed them in like billy graham but the thought of georgie as a vicars waife probably put him off so he went into sothebys he was always arty and had a terrific eye now hes got his own gallery hes pretty successful discovering obscure painters then making a killing when they become famous their finances have always been a bit haphazard but hopefully rock star will put them on a secure financial footing they need it for all the money theyre pourin into angels reach the trouble is theyre too generous guys always helping struggling artists and he does so much for charity guy guy with the terrific eye said lysander when they move into paradise he can take your place on all those preservation of rural gentlecats committees and you can spend all day in bed with me whay dyou draive so fast shrieked marigold as narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming bus lysander screeched off right into fountain street because im desperate to bonk you before ferdie gets home waving a friendly two fingers at the gays opposite who were peering out of their curtains lysander whisked her into the flat as it was they had plenty of time marigold was changing and lysander was watching eastenders and giggling over a postcard of the eiffel tower signed plastered of paris which he and marigold had sent ferdie when ferdie himself walked in bringing a new dark blue pinstripe suit made by douglas hayward for lysander theyll all be bopping around in black leather and tshirts youll stand out much better added ferdie as he straightened lysanders new blue silk tie oh laysander gasped marigold from the darkness at the top of the stairs ayve never seen you in a suit before everyonell think ive stolen it lysander squinted at himself in the hall mirror you look scrumptious it was true as decent tailoring hides a multitude of turns on a middleaged body it can also marvellously elongate a broadshouldered willowy figure on lysander the suit seemed to dance well come on down marigold lets have a look at you ordered ferdie jesus he caught his breath you have worked hard for the most gorgeous legs encased in black fishnet were coming down the stairs above them marigold was wearing the black shorts lysander had given her on valentines day a white silk shirt and a black velvet coat slung over her shoulders meeting her at the bottom ferdie took her hand and raised it to his lips you look sensational he said slowly marilyn monroes face and body on marlene dietrichs legs whay thank you ferdie and youve got into my black shorts lysander gave a whoop and look what ive borrowed from cartiers for you to pretend lysanders just given you ferdie pinned a diamond brooch in the shape of a key on her velvet lapel now take off your weddingring and remember to look happy itll be strange not being a waife said marigold sliding off the huge diamond and putting it in her handbag ay tried so hard to be the perfect company waife ay wore jaegar shirtwaisters and never yawned or swore or smoked too much ay always read billboard and the gramophone so ay could talk to reviewers and distributors ay even trayed to laike grand opera well its high time ferdie undid two more buttons of her silk shirt you kicked over the traceys or nikkis dont worry said lysander seeing marigold trembling at nikkis name ill stay superglued to you all evening and so will every man in the room you look so beautiful the one person not allowed to make an entrance at the party which was held in a large blackedout film studio in soho was georgie maguire herself her husband who believed punctuality was next to godliness made sure she was there twenty minutes before kickoff only to find the place deserted except for a handful of technicians up ladders adjusting spotlights and softening the filters on the camera lights which hung from the ceiling to emphasize the marine theme of the album a large papiermâché rock had been plonked in the middle of the room a cardboard lighthouse flashed on and off in one corner lobster pots had been placed round the walls from which hung fishermens nets cutouts of fish seahorses with litup eyes and clumps of seaweed which were beginning to smell monitors showed the same clip of georgie clinging voluptuously to the rock waitresses wearing matelot jerseys and bellbottoms many of whom remembered georgie from the sixties crunched around a floor littered with seashells and sand making up a rum punch and putting out glasses caterers who were knocking up a seafood buffet crept out of the kitchen wiping prawn juice on their aprons to have a gawp it all looks wonderful if only i was slim enough to wear horizontal stripes youve gone to so much trouble georgie drifted among them in tearful ecstasy captivating flattering signing autographs then adding to guy in an undertone and absolutely noones going to turn up then because guy hadnt given her time to get ready she shot into the ladies to titivate immediately she was joined by a girl in a dark blue velvet dress with a piefrill collar which flattened her breasts and stopped at midcalf above sensible mediumheeled shoes blond hair held in place by a black velvet band emphasized a long nose and a thin beige predatory face giving the distinct impression of the wolf in little red riding hood trying to pass himself off as alice in wonderland hi georgie said the blonde in a deep puton voice im nikki larry locktons pa we met when you came to the office oh right said georgie who didnt remember at all how nice to see you god im nervous not nearly as nervous as i am thought nikki trying to soften the black kohl round her eyes with a shaking finger ever since larry had been to see marigold last week hed been tetchy and withdrawn and the weekend with the boys had been disastrous not to mention the mud all over her new cream carpet to cap it thered been a piece in the daily mail that morning about the way the careers of high flyers took a dive when they left their wives for bimbos nikkis aim tonight was therefore to look even more wifely than marigold georgie who loathed being talked to when she was getting ready was trying to secure her newly washed hair which guy had insisted she wore up to banish any sixties hippy image she wished this silly girl who was now rabbiting on about the wonders of paradise would go away you must drop in if youre ever in the area again murmured georgie it was her standard response to any fan she would have died if theyd taken her up on it wed like that georgie said nikki little do you know she thought that im going to be your neighbour and the wife of your record producer able to control your fat advances then she added out loud im dead excited about meeting rannaldini arent you momentarily georgie was roused out of her trance id forgotten he was coming she said they say he picks women off like ducks bobbing past in a shooting gallery said nikki adjusting the garters holding up her deliberately wifely nutmegbrown stockings not that shed attract rannaldini like this but there would be years ahead when as the mistress of paradise grange she reverted to her normal shimmeringly sexy black leather tousledblond self having charmed a large bells out of the waitresses guy seymour was lining up glasses and press releases and delightedly noticing the number of press who were signing their names in the visitors book when larry lockton stormed in god he looks ridiculous thought guy larry was wearing a scowl a black leather jacket a white tshirt hanging outside black jeans any inches added by black highheeled cowboy boots were negated by the weight of gold jewellery and the black hair which was beginning to cascade in ringlets over his collar and sweating forehead of all the fucking things to happen he roared flattening the waiting catchitune publicity staff against the walls weve got a lot of heavyweight press here already said guy soothingly reading upside down as reporters from the scorpion and the sunday times style pages signed in fat lot of good itll do us larry glared round theyve all turned up to see rannaldini then as guy drew him out of earshot of the reporters the fucker phoned as i entered old compton street saying he wasnt coming so i rammed the merc in front rannaldini he went on who was on sabbatical from the london met making a film of don giovanni had been due to fly back for the party that afternoon instead he had returned secretly the day before in order to surprise the london met who were playing beethovens ninth at the festival hall under oswaldo their guest conductor oswaldos too bloody good for rannaldinis liking stormed larry grabbing one of two more large whiskies conjured up by guy anyway rannaldini plonks himself down in the front row and sits stonyfaced with his eyes shut until the last moment when the singing starts then he stalks out distracting everyone from the music and telling some gleefully hovering reporter from the evening standard that he cant listen to such garbage any longer so of course it is all over the standard and as is his fucking wont to get himself out of trouble rannaldini jumps into his jet and shoves off back to la missing the fuss and georgies party the bastard didnt even have the guts to ring me until he was safely over the irish sea even kitty doesnt know hes buggered off shes on her way up larry couldnt have been angrier he or rather catchitune had poured vast sums into rannaldinis pocket he and rannaldini were supposed to be buddies and nikki who was a terrific starfucker was dying to meet him and besides he needed moral support in case marigold punched nikki on the nose he and guy were interrupted by a photographer from the scorpion who was loading up his camera first edition goes to press any minute what time are you expecting rannaldini as larry opened his mouth guy interrupted smoothly hell be along in a minute traffics terrible then he murmured to larry weve got the press here lets use them wheres georgie anyway asked larry suddenly remembering he had an album to launch in the bog grouting her face said guy larry went white nikkis in there shit she wont say anything to georgie about you and her will she she promised not to said larry gloomily but shes so off the wall i run a billionpound company and ive been answering my telephone all day while nikki goes to the hairdresser and tarts herself up ill yank georgie out of the bog said guy shooting off and you keep nikki off the drink it gets to women hows rock star doing larry asked the daily mail breaking all records weve already put on a massive repress muttered larry bolting off to the gents noone could have been a less heavenly host than larry he had no chitchat only intense concentration on what temporarily interested him which on this occasion confusingly was both nikki and marigold he also had the nightmare of making a speech practice making more and more imperfect he had been rewriting the draft given him by the publicity department all day outside the ladies guy roared for gods sake come out at once panda which was a nickname from when theyd first met when he could hardly see georgies eyes for sooty black makeup thank you said georgie loudly to the cloakroom lady as she drifted out to draw attention to the couple of gold pound coins shed left beside the silver in the saucer funny observed the cloakroom lady as she pocketed the coins that georgie despite her slim tophalf had revealed plump legs when shed raised her skirt to pull up her tights and the blonde in the ultrarespectable dress had been wearing no knickers at all exhausted from the american launch georgie was now running on pure adrenalin like a longlost lover her american public had been flowing back in the last week of the tour the fan letters dried to a trickle were beginning to pour in workmen hailed her from scaffolding for the first time in years people nudged as she passed in the street the english launch was far more of an ordeal because london had been the home of her last humiliating flop and because guy was with her today which made her far more nervous because he was the person she most wanted to please in the world she was deathly pale as she entered the party room her earthy sensual face almost puddingy but when she saw the waiting army of reporters and frenziedly clicking cameramen colour seeped back into her cheeks her long mournful heavylidded eyes started to sparkle and the deep lines which ran from her wide snub nose past the corners of her coralpink mouth with its huge pouting snapdragon lower lip seemed to disappear in a wonderful wicked facesplitting smile the rigours of the american tour had knocked off seven pounds and given her back her cheekbones the long slinky dress the same blue as sunlit summer seas emphasized her slim shoulders pretty breasts and waist and bypassed her hips and legs as she draped herself over the papiermâché rock for the photographers her heavy russet hair broke away from its moorings and writhed over her shoulders georgie the sex symbol was reborn soon she was wooing the press what are you working on asked the express a musical about midlife crisis called ant and cleo autobiographical asked the mirror of course not georgie smiled across at guy who said firmly and georgies about to sign a contract for a new album for catchitune darling reproached georgie i want to get shot of ant and cleo first you looking forward to living next to rannaldini in the country asked the scorpion god yes im a colossal fan i think hes brilliant and stunning too perhaps he could produce ant and cleo suggested the telegraph paradise productions wouldnt that be wonderful sighed georgie look this way georgie shouted the photographers to me georgie smile georgie climb on the rock show us your legs which was the one thing georgie was not prepared to do shoved rudely aside as so often happened by people anxious to get to his wife guy seymour moved round the room slipping cards with the gallerys address on to anyone rich and famous who might be interested in buying paintings is georgie maguire here in person asked a pale girl from the independent of course she is answered guy quite sharply i went to a launch at lunchtime said the girl huffily where the pop star didnt show the record company didnt feel it was relevant and they didnt play any of her records she shouted over the boom of rock star of course hype and hard sell are very unfashionable at the moment thats why were in the middle of a recession snapped guy shes not bad for fortysix admitted the girl consulting her handout which is her famous husband i am said guy oh right dyou manage georgie noone manages georgie the room was filling up with record distributors disc jockeys catchitune employees musicians produced by catchitune and the general freeloaders of the music business through a fog of cigarette smoke people drifted up and down men in overcoats tshirts designer gymshoes and baseball caps clutching beer bottles like grenades or in leather jackets with their shirts hanging out like larry girls with scarlet lips tangled hair wandering eyes and pale faces like brides of dracula who never saw the daylight crunched over the sea shells restlessly searching for celebrities or at least familiar faces everyone pretended not to stare at georgie but they all agreed that the album was great and that in the down light she looked terrific but they ignored her because big stars dont like to be pestered and it wouldnt be cool to go up to her the press were getting restless thats great thank you one by one they closed their notebooks switched off their tape recorders and looked around for rannaldini georgie however having been out of fashion a long time desperately needed reassurance like a bride at her own wedding whom everyone thinks is too important to waylay she was suddenly deserted and sought guy out in panic its going to be a megaflop everyones leaving dont be so bloody wet panda judging by celebrity headcounts this party is a complete washout said the girl from the independent then in walked dancer maitland thin as a rake with his long tousled mane and blacklined eyes one of the biggest rock stars on both sides of the atlantic hi darling he came straight up to georgie hugging her cautiously so as not to disturb either of their hair or makeup great album wish id written it bloody nice of me to be here when youve just pushed me off number one in the states and no doubt youll do the same in england i hear youre moving to rutshire ill be there in april when practice chukkas start you must come and ave dinner oh wed love to said georgie ecstatically oh dancer thank you for coming and making the party have you met guy dancer looked at guys strong stern face whose classical good looks were only marred by a nose broken when he was boxing for cambridge the warmth of the reddybrown complexion and the friendly smile showing excellent teeth were tempered by eyes which despite laughter lines were the cold pale azure of basildon bond writingpaper a battered gold corduroy suit a blueandgold paisley silktie and beautifully cut straight whiteblond hair falling on the collar of his dark blue shirt gave him an arty look but the overwhelming impression was of some high churchman a man of passion but strongwilled enough to resist the overtures of the most wantonly ravishing parishioner sexy but tough as shit thought dancer wincing at guys firm handshake georgie gives you a good press he said but i thought i was the only rock star livin in rutshire and the photographers got their picture because dancer came to launching parties even less often than rannaldini dancer was followed by andrew lloyd webber rod stewart simon bates steve wright cilia black simon le bon and a host of other celebs so rannaldini wasnt missed nearly as much as he would have liked hermione on the other hand made a deliberately late entrance with her devoted balding husband bob who as the orchestra manager of the london met had had a punishing day dealing with rannaldini and the press hermione was looking radiant in a rich red chanel suit embroidered with roses and with a builtin bra to boost her splendid breasts to boost her sales she carried a large crocodile bag rattling with tapes of blow the wind southerly to thrust on unsuspecting journalists i thought youd like to hear some real music she murmured to the music critic of the times although she smiled graciously round she was pained by the fog of cigarette smoke and the photographers still clustering round georgie and dancer whos that striking woman in the swansdown bolero and red leather shorts didnt she play susannah at the eno she asked bob her face is so familiar shes the catchitune receptionist said bob not unkindly you see her each time you go into the building hermione having spent the morning in bed with rannaldini was shored up in the knowledge that he had blacked the party not because he wanted to avoid the press but because he loathed the idea of georgie maguire and was violently opposed to her stealing his thunder in paradise he was furious that georgie as a pop star would probably earn twice as much as he and hermione put together and he detested georgies mawkish celebration of marriage everywhere he went in la last week hed heard rock star being sung and whistled as it raced up the charts accepting however that this was the quickest way to get her picture in the papers hemione glided up to guy whom shed already met with larry hallo mr wonderful she said archly kissing him on his firm handsome mouth then carefully choosing a lull in the music turned to georgie im simply livid with rannaldini for crying off i said georgie maguires music gives pleasure to so many people i kept telling him youll love georgie when you meet her maestro but hes such an intellectual snob and he does feel rock star is a ripoff of lady in red itll be lady in the red by the time weve paid for angels reach said georgie lightly but her happiness evaporated and when hello magazine asked them both to turn and smile the photographer caught georgie looking miserable and hermione who instantly composed her features eyes open brows raised dazzling white teeth flashing looking gorgeous ive bought you a present hermione handed georgie blow the wind southerly because i wanted to cheer you up about that beastly piece in the guardian i hid it from georgie so shut up hissed guy adding you look fabulous love your hair because women were always distracted by flattery and briskly led georgie off to meet the new music editor of billboard what rannaldini actually said stagewhispered hermione to dancer maitland was that he didnt want to meet an ageing sex symbol because he does that in the mirror every morning snapped dancer people were dancing in corners falling on food tables were filling up with glasses catchitune cashing in on having the press present were playing records by other artistes on their books nikki in her piefrilled collared blue velvet dress and determined to prove she was a better chief executives wife than marigold was working the room pressing her new london address on disc jockeys and important retailers hinting that she and larry were together now and would soon be throwing a lovenest warming party in paradise emerging from the gents after yet another rewrite desperate for a cigarette larry scooped up a handful of prawn volauvents we have given up canapés for lent or we wont be able to get into our new jeans said nikki reprovingly as she glided up and removed the plate what in hells got into her thought larry she looks like a complete frump in fact the only person in the room looking more matronly than nikki was kitty rannaldini who like many women much younger than their husbands tried to dress older than she was exhausted from spring cleaning for rannaldinis return she had belted up the motorway because shed promised to support marigold and because she longed to see her errant husband even for a couple of hours kitty dreaded parties in friends houses she could escape to the kitchen to help or take round bottles and gather up dirty glasses but these matelots in their striped jerseys looked as though theyd down tools if she picked up a plate being a wonderful listener she survived socially on a onetoone basis or in the office where people got to know and love her the only way to communicate over one of catchitunes heavy rock bands however was with your eyes or your swaying body which in kittys case were concealed by hopelessly strong spectacles and a beetrootpink crimplene tentdress which shed bought by mail order because she was too ashamed of her bulges to go into clothes shops now she was being chewed out by larry who needed some ass to kick and who broke the news to her that rannaldini had done a runner as though it were her fault did he say when he was coming back to england stammered kitty trying to hide her desperate disappointment no snapped larry and where the fucks marigold shes definitely coming sorry love larry patted her arm ive given up smoking nikki sent me to a hypnotist last week and i havent had a fag since but thats brilliant said kitty who knew larry had been on sixty a day how dyou feel fine except every ten minutes i climb up the curtains and throttle the cat larry was about to quiz kitty about marigolds bit of rough trade but seeing nikki bearing down he bolted back into the gents who the hell can i talk to thought kitty in panic seeing georgie still talking to the languid new music editor of billboard she took a deep breath and went over i just come to say ow much were all lookin forward to you moving into angels reach georgie looked blank this frump with her fuzzy hair drawn into a ponytail and a big spot on her forehead must have emerged from the catchitune accounts department im kitty rannaldini said kitty amused to see georgies wary halfsmile widen into one of incredulous excitement has rannaldini come after all he cant make it some drama wiv don giovanni he was ever so upset the cross round kittys neck glittered in the moving spotlight then as it moved on darkness hid her blushes at such a thumping lie oh im so pleased georgie sighed with relief hermione said rannaldini blacked it deliberately really said the man from billboard suddenly interested im a triffic fan of yours georgie said kitty hastily could i have your autograph the billboard man was appalled at such lack of cool but georgie delightedly signed a page of kittys autograph book seeing georgie wasting valuable time on some dowdy groupie guy whizzed over may i borrow georgie for a minute he asked and frogmarched her off to charm the manager of tower records piccadilly as the billboard man promptly disappeared in search of more exciting prey kitty overheard a scorpion reporter saying lets call it a day rannaldinis obviously not coming i gather the wifes here said the mirror might get something out of her lets try the mistress first retreating hastily into the darkness sitting on a lobster pot poor kitty miserably ate her way through a large plate of paella trying to ignore the great phallic lighthouse flashing on the opposite wall if only she could escape in her little car down the motorway to a cup of cocoa and her danielle steel but shed promised to give marigold support through the darkness she caught a whiff of chanel no and peppermint breath hi kitty said a caressing rather common voice which shed heard so often over the telephone discussing rannaldinis contracts and recording dates unlike georgie kitty immediately recognized nikki less glamorous than she expected but as the lighthouse beam flashed on to the vulpine features far more predatory what chance had poor marigold got so pleased to meet you at last nikki plonked herself on an adjoining lobster pot and i was looking forward to meeting rannaldini ive heard such nice things about you kitty who hadnt heard anything nice about nikki stared at the pieces of squid round the rim of her plate and felt sorry for them because theyd been rejected too we must have lunch urged nikki i dont come to town very often then well meet in the country ill be moving into paradise grange very shortly nikkis forked tongue was loosened by drink larry and i are getting married kitty was aghast oh poor marigold and wot about the poor kids it didnt deter you that rannaldini was a married man with children said nikki sharply no i know kitty hung her head there didnt seem any point adding that rannaldini was separated from cecilia by the time shed gone to work for him anyway went on nikki fishing marigolds got some rough trade in tow hasnt she nikki in fact was iffy about this development the boys had banged on and on about lysander all weekend and having written off marigold as a sexless old bag nikki disliked any proof that she might be able to attract even rough trade on the other hand if she did find someone it would save larry a great deal of guilt and alimony nikki had been so certain larry was going for a quicky divorce shed even planned her dress cream silk for the registry office and there he was scowling and clutching his speech his hair all tousled noone would think he was worth billions see you in a bit murmured nikki and sliding over to larry taking his hand in the darkness she placed it under her gathered velvet skirt straight on to her damp pubic hair come on make me come i dare you she whispered that should obliterate all thoughts of marigold dyou think we should arraive together said marigold overcome by a sudden fit of respectability as she signed her name in the visitors book ay mean ay am larrys wife all his staff will be there whats everyone goin to say theyll say hallo marigold hallo lysander giggled lysander whod been smoking a joint in the car as they entered the party the room went still hallo marigold hallo lysarnder said hermione loudly larry whipped his hand from nikkis bush as if it were a wasps nest for across the room was the marigold hed first fallen in love with but ten times more beautiful who is he who is he shaken out of their cool everyone in the room was frantically trying to identify lysander kerist exploded the catchitune sales director its the bosss wife lucky thing said denise the receptionist a favourite has no friends nikki since she had taken up with larry had snubbed senior and junior secretaries alike and banned executives from larrys presence marigold on the other hand had always been kind she had written to larrys staff when they married or had babies and been sweet even to the lowest packer at office parties with the increasingly dark cloud of recession they felt marigold would not have let them starve so they now converged on her joyfully telling her how marvellous she looked and having a really good butchers at lysander it therefore took marigold several minutes to reach geòrgie ignoring a hovering larry resisting the temptation to tuck in his shirt and throttle him with his silly gold necklace she flung herself on her great friend telling her how wonderful she looked and how much she adored the album oh georgie aym so proud of you and for guy too its such a wonderful celebration of your love for each other great party said lysander who managed to have eyes for noone but marigold but also on stalks for all the famous people he wanted to meet theres dancer maitland and steve wright and simon bates and all the cast of eastenders and that lovely girl from brookside oh my he looked at georgie and you too the albums fantastic can i have your autograph rootling round in marigolds bag in a gesture of casual intimacy he found a pen and marigolds diary out of which he tore a page and handed it to georgie why are they playing this junk instead of rock star its evidently uncool to play ones own music sighed georgie bollocks its your party georgie turned to marigold you look amazing twenty years younger whatever happened he did said marigold taking lysanders arm lucky thing georgie laughed as though this was a huge joke how are the children asked marigold well floras been at bagley hall since january said georgie so shell be near by when we move to paradise its coed so i hope shes managing to do some work melanies in australia bankrupting us with reversecharged calls and your two asked georgie who never remembered names both at prep school said marigold hermione was having a bad party none of the pop music press were remotely interested that she was doing dido and aeneas once again she had to approach georgie to get her picture taken how was paris she asked marigold oh lovely we stayed at the ritz did you go to the pompidou no and when marigold and lysander hadnt been to any of the operas or concerts hermione suggested she said patronizingly you must have gone to some decent restaurants we just used room service at the ritz said lysander the only thing flambéeing in our suite was me giggled marigold the next moment they were joined by guy and larry both unnerved by the juxtaposition of georgie and marigold are you an actor asked guy no lysander plays polo and raydes in races said marigold he loves horses particularly bonking dead ones said lysander kissing marigold then turning to hermione he asked blandly hows dildo and aeneas going helena determined not to betray her rage hermione grabbed lysanders arm come and meet nikki you two must be the same age the stirring cow thought marigold as lysander was dragged off into the gloom what are flora and melanie doing now she said youve just asked me that said georgie drawing marigold aside are you ok fine said marigold youre not youre shaking larrys having the most terrific affaire mumbled marigold he wants a divorce and me out of paradise christ you poor darling id no idea larrys a bastard who is she nikki that blonde being introduced to lysander oh georgie peered through the gloom she did a number on me in the ladies very plain and frumpy i thought shes trying to look like a waife tonight sighed marigold normally she exudes sex lysander doesnt think so said georgie hes done a uturn wow hes good looking ok lysander took marigolds hand can i borrow you panda guy called over sensing trouble dempster wants a word what did you think of nikki marigold couldnt resist asking gross said lysander beckoning to a waitress to fill up marigolds glass looks as though she fell off the back of a larry marigold burst out laughing scuse me mr maguire an evening standard photographer sent guy flying as he raced to get a picture of georgie greeting jason donovan they also serve said a quiet voice at guys elbow it was bob harefield hermiones longsuffering husband whod got hold of a whisky bottle with which he laced guys glass balding roundfaced bowtied always smiling bob gave the impression of a humpty dumpty whod survived a great fall by the skin of his teeth because of his amiable egglike face people tended not to notice the lean beauty of his body noone could understand how he could put up with hermione and rannaldini but certainly his tactful handling of the latter had stopped most of the london met committing suicide guy would have liked to have had a hearttoheart with him about the catchitune royalty system but unfortunately bob had that bespectacled frump in tow i want you to meet the nicest lady in paradise said bob kitty rannaldini guy nearly dropped his glass rannaldini did you say he added in amazement i didnt realize he couldnt really say love your hair youre looking fabulous short of total hypocrisy so he thanked her for being nice to georgie you are a brickette i was just suggesting to kitty said bob that we ought to start a secondfiddle club for people married to celebs youve got the london met to look after as well said kitty well youve got all rannaldinis children and exwives thats much worse said bob then when kitty protested you know they are ive got used to the post and the telephone always being for georgie volunteered guy i dont even mind being shoved aside by people desperate to meet her the only thing i find wearing is her constant need for reassurance but all artists are like that he watches her the whole time thought kitty wistfully seeing shes got a drink and talking to the right people i did like georgie she said timidly will you be in london during the week guy nodded i hope you and marigold will stop her getting lonely oh i will kitty felt impossibly flattered and angels reach is so beautiful all the angels was turning pink in the sunset as i was driving up this evening as though they was flushed with excitement about you movin in guy smiled thats sweet i so look forward to being part of a community again if you live in a village you must put something back marigoldll rope you in she does so much for others particularly at the moment said bob looking in amusement at marigold who was peeling mediterranean prawns and handing them to lysander that boy is the smoothest bit of trade ive ever seen straight out of fortnums toy department guy who strongly disapproved of extramarital frolicking deliberately changed the subject what are you doing after this he asked kitty kitty looked at her watch driving back to rutshire come dine with us larrys booked a table at heros ive already eaten a ole paella have one course i insist feeling his warm hand on her arm kitty thought guy was one of the nicest men shed ever met it would be lovely having him in paradise as an island at parties who one wasnt frightened of going up to seeing georgie was nose to nose with david frost now guy said ive got to ring brian sewell of the evening standard and try and get him along to a preview tomorrow have you got any pound coins for a fiver returning five minutes later he was grabbed by georgie that bastard larrys having an affaire with that blonde its not serious ill explain later murmured guy larrys about to make a speech go and stand beside him as rock star boomed out from every speaker people turned to watch the video on the monitor which showed shoals of fish turning into inkblot ghosts which in turn became boats being shipwrecked sharks prowling through the deep lusty fishermen pulling in nets then the waves pounded the rock to which georgie was clinging until there seemed no hope for her survival then slowly the seas calmed the sun came out and georgie was draped against the rock drenched in her grey rags but smiling rock star rock star rock star you are my rock star sang georgie in her husky haunting voice and on the monitor appeared a closeup of guy looking wonderfully macho in a blue denim shirt which brought out the strange light azure of his eyes with the wind tugging at his arcticblond hair even people round the buffet stopped eating and drinking and listened to the track swaying and dancing to the beat at the end when guy walked up to the rock picked up georgie and carried her away across the sands with her wet hair trailing and a pack of basset hounds raced after them everyone cheered and stamped their feet those who were holding glasses and couldnt clap banged their other hand on the table and cried speech speech sweat glistening on his forehead larry grasped the microphone were very happy to be producing georgie maguire he mumbled we think shes a bit special and shes going to be around for a long time to come catchitune hope this album is the first of many this party isnt a hype no big deal but as we speak rock star is number one in the american charts i give you georgie maguire thats the first draft i wrote thought the head of publicity indignantly and ive been fired a dozen times today for my pains georgie took the microphone and in a choked voice thanked everyone at catchitune and particularly larry and his lovely wife marigold hurrah bellowed the catchitune staff glaring at nikki its been a long time in the wilderness georgie went on which makes tonight even more special this is the second happiest day of my life the happiest was when i married my husband guy seymour she emphasized guys surname the loveliest strongest man in the world id like you to drink to guy my rock everyone clapped and cheered standing beside marigold lysander noticed a girl in front removing her spectacles to wipe away the tears and realized it was kitty rannaldini hed say hallo later then in the lull that followed out of the gloom marigolds very distinct tones could be heard saying to the man on her other side are you the chief buyer of tower records or a disc jockey for radio well take your and off may bottom then there was a howl of mirth marigold used to be such a dutiful wife whispered hermione in shocked tones what has got into her i think that miraculous toy boy has said bob larrys having an affaire with that ghastly nikki hissed georgie as smilingly she and guy posed for photographs shut up hissed back guy the boots on the other foot lovely speech said nikki coiling her hand into larrys just going to check the other room said larry noticing marigold was missing next door the smell of dope and hairy male armpits spilling out of sleeveless tshirts was suffocating rock star rock star my life would be a zero without my steadfast hero sang the writhing gyrating couples in ecstasy indifferent to such proof of a megahit on his hands larry scoured the room then suddenly the dancers parted like clouds at night to reveal two bright stars lysander and marigold in each others arms outraged larry watched lysander put a joint in marigolds mouth and her breasts swelling provocatively as she inhaled then lysander taking a last puff before stamping it underfoot then french kissing her on and on with all catchitunes staff and distributors dancing round to have a better look larry was appalled at the pain stumbling upstairs he roared at the general manager to close the bar as lysander and marigold drifted back hand in hand georgie noticed the diamond brooch on marigolds black velvet coat isnt that lovely lysander took me to cartiers this afternoon yelled marigold over the din of the music as larry joined the group its the key to freedom noticing his wife was no longer wearing a weddingring larry felt sick waitresses were gathering up plates guests were ostentatiously upending empty glasses hoping for refills we must go said marigold i thought you were coming out to dinner wailed georgie weve got to get back to paradise patch is on her own we just dropped in to wish you luck not that youre going to need it ill ring you first thing for a proper gossip larry and guy exchanged uneasy glances on the way out lysander tore another page from marigolds diary and peeled off to get chris de burghs autograph oblivious of nikkis chilling killing stare larry bolted after marigold drawing her aside she noticed that his tshirt could have been whiter he noticed the softness of her thighs swelling up into the black velvet shorts and the way her breasts swung gently as bells under her white silk shirt oblivious to catchitune staff who were handing out little papiermâché rocks tapes of rock star and body shop seaweed extract as goinghome presents he said you look beautiful mar ill ring you catching them up lysander deliberately dropped marigolds diary which larry pocketed and was horrified to read lysander venice scrawled across the next weekend no wonder she didnt want the boys his evening was further ruined when he arrived with georgie and guy and the rest of his party at heros his favourite restaurant and was accosted by the headwaiter who was the worst gossip in soho and constantly feeding stories to dempster meester lockton i am very pleased to see meesis lockton dining here the other night with your younger brother she look very well i thought you were an only child larry said hermione loudly once again ignoring nikkis killing stare larry snarled bring me a packet of silk cut primed beforehand the band struck up rock star as georgie entered the dining room everyone in the room will be humming it in a week panda said guy proudly then in an undertone to larry weve got to get that contract signed before marigold gives georgie an earful tomorrow georgies insanely loyal but larry could only think of his own problems in the past bored with marigold envious of rannaldinis effortless promiscuity he had fallen madly in love with nikki now he was torn between his rapacious sexy mistress who was at this moment deliberately flirting with guy and marigold who had looked utterly ravishing this evening how unhappy would i be without either thought larry catchitune had just recorded the beggars opera nor had he anticipated how wildly jealous he would be of this adonis with his publicschool accent hed been humiliated in front of his entire staff who knew all about nikki because nikki had told them and if there were a messy divorce he might not get his knighthood before rannaldini if at all in addition nikki was not as clockwork as marigold she was far less efficient in the office now she had to look after him at home and last night she had shouted at him for putting his plate in the sink rather than the dishwasher before he met nikki larry had never lifted a finger at home except to check the dust on top of a picture he was haunted by rannaldinis warning once shes hooked you the mistress becomes the wardress she knows all the tricks you used to cheat on marigold nikki now sat in his office monitoring his telephone calls from all those young singers who seemed perfectly happy for larry to make them if he was prepared to make their records as well since hed taken up with nikki and shattered the myth of being an utterly faithful husband gorgeous girls had been looking at him in the most exciting way all that promise would be nipped in the bud if he settled for nikki they keep a cosh behind their backs warned rannaldini you never see it until theyve got the handcuffs on i made that mistake with cecilia she begrudged me my old freedoms so i ditched her larry was fed up with going to the gym only drinking spritzers bloody wet and not smoking and saying no to canapés ignoring nikkis scowl of rage he accepted a white roll from the waiter and spreading it thickly with butter ordered spaghetti carbonara as a first course followed by a tbone and chips georgie was now signing an autograph for an elderly couple at the next table id much rather she signed that contract hissed guy looking across at nikki being calmed down by bob larry had a brainwave ill get it he said nipping out to the rolls as he had so often in the past when he wanted to ring nikki his heart thumping he dialled marigolds number just as he was about to ring off the telephone was picked up there was music and laughter in the background we oughta talk princess larry told marigold roughly i gotta be in bristol tomorrow thought id spend the night at home and return your diary what took you so long snapped nikki as larry sat down beside her and kissed her fondly on the cheek after all he did want a fuck later getting this he said putting a sheaf of papers in front of georgie can i have your autograph please for your wife your daughter your mother or your girlfriend said georgie with a laugh for myself said larry it was a catchitune contract for a million pounds not wanting to alert the whole of paradise to his return larry drove rather than flew down the following evening arriving as the red flame of sunset finally gave way to the distant russet glow of the rutminster streetlights he caught a glimpse of catchitune written in fading crocuses and breathed in a heady scent of polyanthus narcissus and newly turned earth as he got out of a borrowed mini the grange might face north but it was still the finest garden in paradise he noticed a ladder against the house mr brimscombe the finest gardener in rutshire although threatened with the sack had been trimming the famous paradise pearl from around the masterbedroom windows across the valley he could see a single light burning in valhalla kitty was still working sorting out the tangled skeins of her husbands life soon rannaldini too would be home studying and settling scores in his tower in the woods angels reach was in darkness but shortly georgie would be burning the midnight oil earning her million pound advance as she worked on her new album to be handed in by christmas and to the left he could see the jewelcoloured stainedglass hall windows of the river house bob and hermione must be enjoying a rare evening at home larry gave a sigh of satisfaction all these people beavering away to put money into catchitunes coffers despite the doom and gloom this years figures had been good next years should be spectacular only when he turned towards his own house did he realize that the only lights on were the carriage lamps by the door letting himself in falling over one of lysanders boots he only just reached the burglar alarm in time after initial woofing patch slumped back in her basket sulking because jack her boyfriend had been banished for the evening larry had skipped lunch anticipating a delicious dinner cooked by marigold but had planned on working up a further appetite by screwing her beforehand in the kitchen he was welcomed by marks spencers chicken and asparagus and bread and butter pudding both in foil trays he loathed asparagus there was also a note from marigold larry not even dear these will take five minutes in the microwave gone out to dinner back around midnight make yourself at home its my fucking home thought larry furiously he couldnt even ring for someone to run him up steak and chips because hed laid them all off and even he wouldnt summon mrs brimscombe from the lodge in the middle of coronation street there were no curtains drawn nor a fire in the lounge he couldnt complain it was so mild that in the old days he would have bellyached about the central heating being left on or a fire lit returning to the kitchen he found an empty bottle of champagne in the bin two glasses in the sink and a huge bunch of pink roses with a card on the draining board marigold you were out of this world all love l his harley street consultant had warned him against stress but larry had never been nearer a coronary as he bolted upstairs and was knocked sideways by the smell of joy marigold was tidy to the point of finickityness but now carrier bags with new clothes littered the bed and the armchairs in the bathroom he found the top off the scented body lotion a razor clogged with hair that looked unpleasantly pubic a cellophane pack that had contained black eightdenier seamed stockings and a size ten label on the floor marigold used to be size sixteen the hairdryer was still plugged in and worst of all the joy of sex on the edge of the bath lay open at fellatio it was no comfort to larry that this was exactly the state in which nikki left their new en suite bathroom in pelham crescent with a howl larry hurled the joy of sex out of the window whereupon the clockwork squawking of a pheasant reminded him of his clockwork wife running away not wanting to go home to nikki who thought he was looking at a new pop group in bristol he stormed down to the pearly gates and got so drunk he didnt even notice marigold lysander and ferdie coming out of the heavenly host across the road around eleven ayve got fraightful butterflies gasped marigold as ferdie pulled up outside the grange should be moths at night said lysander whod been getting gloomier as the evening progressed no more lipstick ordered ferdie as marigold opened her bag ruffling her hair he undid several buttons of her red dress youve got to look as though youve been got at before allowing her out of the car now play it cool and remember no bonking well stick around for a sec in case you need rescuing watching marigold going up the steps lysander felt the same sickness as when his mother trying not to cry had walked down the platform after putting him on the school train but a minute later marigold came rushing back hes gone without leaving a note she sobbed ayve blown it ayve blown it appalled to find marigold so devastated lysander leapt out of the car hell be back he put an arm round her probably just stormed out in a strop must have been one hell of a strop if he left the door open and the burglar alarm off with picassos and stubbs in the house mused ferdie can you see anything missing only larry wailed marigold as jack jumped into patchs basket snuggling up to her desperate to give marigold comfort lysander poured her a glass of sancerre i taped casualty for you he said it was marigolds favourite programme aym the only casualty round ere putting her chainhandled bag down with a clatter on the draining board she was bashing the stems of lysanders pink roses with a rolling pin when the telephone rang dont answer it howled ferdie but faster than nijinsky out of the starting gates marigold was across the room the telephone stopped on the third ring its our secret code squeaked marigold as the telephone began again she snatched it up before ferdie could stop her listened for a second then put her trembling hand over the receiver larry wants to come over hes in the pearly gates thats the nearest hes going to get to heaven this evening said ferdie briskly tell him no youve got red eyes and a red nose and youre both so wasted itll only end in a punch or bunkup and blow all your advantage say youre tired ferdies square face could look very big and mean his friends didnt employ him as a bouncer at their twentyfirsts for nothing meekly marigold told larry she was shattered they arranged to have dinner next week whos that in the background growled larry as lysander sulkily crashed the door of the fridge only patch said marigold see you next week well plan the whole operation when the time comes said ferdie come along lysander and because ferdie wasnt supposed to know hed been bonking marigold lysander reluctantly had to comply jack even more reluctant to be removed from patchs paws bit his master sharply on the hand alone in her pinkflounced fourposter marigold couldnt sleep she had envisaged a scene from gone with the wind with herself being so provoking that larry would sweep her upstairs like clark gable well at least the black moustache was the same and ravish her at this point admittedly his technique would become lysanders then becoming larry again he would swear she was his only love and nikki a fearful aberration hepped up for conflict twitching with desire marigold longed for lysanders tender and exuberant lovemaking after which she always fell into a wonderful sleep lysander was better than any pill and he didnt leave you feeling woozy and unable to drive in the morning having spent so many nights alone at the grange marigold was unafraid of the dark and always left her curtains open because noone could see in except the birds outside a full moon was admiring her reflection in the fishponds and a gentle west wind was scratching the bare stems of the famous paradise pearl against the window marigold had never masturbated in her life thinking it a disgusting habit but lysander had made her come so wonderfully with his fingers and tongue she thought shed give it a whirl and put the duvet over patch snoring beside her so the dog wouldnt be corrupted think about something that really turns you on lysander always urged her so marigold thought about lysander goodness it was nice and quite easy her breath was coming faster and faster when she heard a loud bang on the window which couldnt be just windswept wisteria twigs then to her horror she saw a man framed in the window the moonlight behind him screaming her head off she whipped her finger from her clitoris to the panic button mr brimscombe however who slept lightly because of his rheumatism had already heard a car going towards the house the driver must have had a remote control to open the electric gates but it wasnt young mr hawkley because his red ferrari always blared music remembering his ladder outside marigolds bedroom mr brimscombe set out to investigate the paradise pearl a unique silverpink wisteria had been propagated by mr brimscombes grandfather whod gone to the grave with the secret of its exquisite vigour and colouring gardeners came from all over the world to admire and attempt to copy it mr brimscombes first ignoble thought when he saw a man up the ladder was not that he was attempting to break in or rape mrs lockton but that he was taking cuttings off the paradise pearl shooting across the lawn like a crab he seized the ladder just as larry was peering in at the incredibly erotic sight of his beautiful slimmeddown wife playing with herself the lamplight warming her lovely breasts excitement turned to horror however when he saw the duvet moving beside her it must be that young puppy lysander not even capable of satisfying her as larry banged furiously on the window his ladder was suddenly shaken down below with even more fury come down you thieving bugger screached mr brimscombe instantly obeying larry missed the next rung grabbed a gnarled branch of the paradise pearl bringing it and himself crashing to the ground on top of a whole bed of crown imperials if marigold hadnt recognized larry and rushed to open the double glazing and alert mr brimscombe to his masters identity larry would have been cudgelled to death by a foxheaded walkingstick next morning marigold rang ferdie to tell him what had happened just a social climb said ferdie marigold giggled larry got off with a bruising and a sprained ankle hes just discharged himself from rutminster hospital oh and ferdie hes taking me to the four seasons tonaight well play it cool the following morning marigold summoned ferdie to the grange we never made the four seasons we ended up in bed on the first date disapprovingly ferdie dipped a chocolate biscuit in his coffee youre a slag marigold when are you seeing him again tonight hes going to leave nikki and come home oh ferdie ay cant thank you both enough we aim to please ferdie pocketed a cheque for mission accomplished and persuaded marigold she must keep lysander on a years retainer so he could whizz back if larry started acting up and we must return that diamond key to cartiers how do i explain that to larry that it isnt ethical to accept presents from young boys if one has made it up with ones husband its believing lysander could afford one hundred thousand pounds for a brooch that rattled larry marigold was brought up short she was going to miss lysander dreadfully she had found it much easier to forgive larry because having lysander around had made her realize how heady it must have been for larry having nikki but at least if he was on a retainer shed see him occasionally she decided to give him two polo ponies and a set of dick francis talking books as he was such a slow reader lysander was so upset at the thought of larry taking marigold to the four seasons and no doubt to bed that hed gone out and got plastered next morning overwhelmed with hangover clutching a cup of coffee hed gone out to see arthur in his box he found the old horse had eaten all his bedding a habit from his early days when he didnt know where his next meal was coming from that he only reverted to when he felt very low and neglected im sorry boy said lysander appalled flinging his arms round arthurs neck avoiding the green bits where arthur had rolled im sorry mum and uncle alastair i havent forgotten ill bloody well get him sound and have another crack at the rutminster he emptied his cup into a bucket because arthur loved drinking coffee having left marigold and picked up a hamburger from the pub ferdie drove over to lysanders he found him slumped shivering in the corner of arthurs stable clutching jack like a teddy bear with ferdies blue coat wrapped round him like a childs dressing gown lysander was deathly pale and looked absurdly young arthur having abandoned silent sympathy was lying flat out with his eyes open snoring loudly to get his masters attention heres something to cheer you up said ferdie marigolds divorce papers even better having taken his ten per cent commission ferdie handed over a cheque for which lysander pocketed listlessly unlike you i dont think dosh is the most important thing in the world it comes a fucking good second ferdie handed arthur a bit of hamburger bun dont be bloody ungrateful thanks to me you dont owe a bean in fact youve got a fat bank balance as well as a ferrari and some really sharp suits in the old days you were always grumbling that you wanted to take dolly to decent places and become a lanson lout ive grown out of that way of life all those phoneys poncing around at the catchitune party i dont want to be part of that scene any more why cant i stay here and get arthur sound larrys coming back itll be easier if youre not around she cant go back to that overpaid clown lysander was nearly in tears hell have her back in piefrilled collars in a week im very fond of marigold he added defiantly being with her reminded me of mum i wouldnt mind settling down with her dont be ridiculous said ferdie more gently youd have to take her bopping on her zimmer in a few years time and that accent would get seriously on your nerves it would not said lysander furiously its like walking hound puppies you have to send them back you dont have to go back to london ive got another job for you in cheshire rattling a drain billionaire whos cheating on his wife im not interested you will be when you see the wife shes stunning and you can take arthur tiny and jack evidently theres a brilliant vet up there still lying down arthur snored even louder opening an eye to see if ferdie was prepared to relinquish any more hamburger bun come on you owe it to arthur persisted ferdie tomorrow to fresh woods and porsches new a fortnight later when guy and georgie moved into angels reach all the removal men were whistling rock star which now topped the uk as well as the american charts guy who took a week off work masterminded the entire operation georgie drifted about getting in everyones way and going into poetic ecstasies over the lushness of the rutshire spring blackthorn was breaking in dazzling white waves over the brightening green fields on the first morning they were woken before dawn by the birds georgie had never seen so many lambs jumping in the fields or daffodils in a halo round their very own lake a singersongwriter could not but be gay in such a jocund company euphoria however soon gave way to panic as she realized shed lost act one of her musical ant and cleo in the move she darent tell guy as hed insist on helping her look and there were all sorts of old love letters and the odd recent one in her boxes of papers which she didnt want him to find in the excitement of having a number one record shed also agreed to deliver the new album by christmas ill never get it done in time she wailed to guy who was putting up some rather startling abstracts in the kitchen the sink was still blocked with flowers wishing them luck in their new home which georgie would never get round to arranging putting down his hammer guy took georgie in his arms larrys just rung to say hes going to bring in some whizzkid producer to remix and revamp a lot of your old songs so youll only have to write half a dozen or so new ones its so restful here youll do them in your sleep no good if i cant sleep mumbled georgie fretfully into guys chest having not arranged the making of a single curtain to fit the vast angels reach windows she was getting increasingly irritated at being woken by the sun and the bloody birds at fivethirty in the morning so guy who knew where everything was unearthed some swirling blue olive and purple william morris curtains which had hung in the house in hampstead and charmed kitty rannaldini whod left a dozen newlaid eggs in the porch on their first morning into letting them down as kitty had promised to return the curtains as soon as possible guy who felt sorry for her rattling around in that huge supposedly haunted house had invited her over for a late lunch on the friday after they moved in following this they would all drive over to the endofterm concert at bagley hall where georgies and guys younger daughter flora and kittys stepchildren wolfie and natasha were pupils georgie whod been failing to work hugged kitty in delight as she staggered through the front door the curtains in her arms oh you are kind put them down on the hall chair oh dear youre wearing a skirt i was hoping to get away with jeans although kitty had never received any affection from her stepdaughter she felt she ought to support her at the concert because rannaldini was still away she had put on a compostbrown suit with a full skirt which had once looked marvellous on hermione but which did nothing for kittys figure or colouring she had made it worse by trying to add the feminine touches of a pottery flowerbrooch and a frilly white tricel shirt guys bound to bully me into changing moaned georgie lets go and murder a huge drink dont worry guys driving well need to be pissed to sit through all those merry peasants and outoftune fiddles kitty followed her into a kitchen which had just been charmingly redecorated with a cornflowerblue tiled floor white walls primroseyellow surfaces blueandwhite plates and framed family photographs with blue mounts among guys abstracts on the walls ow its so fresh and pretty marvelled kitty guys taste said georgie hes awfully clever the kitchen was also surprisingly tidy except for a large tabby cat with orange eyes who sprawled most unhygienically kitty thought across a big scrubbed table she was frightened of animals particularly of the rottweilers which guarded rannaldini and the prince of darkness the vicious black steeplechaser who now the national hunt season was over roamed the fields terrorizing any rambler who ventured on to rannaldinis land whats he called kitty tried to be polite as the cat bopped georgie with a fat paw as she passed charity said georgie its guys cat he adores her flora chose the name so we could all say daddy does a tremendous amount for charity and he does hes already joined the bestkept village committee and he popped down to say hallo to the vicar this morning he should have been back hours ago it all looks lovely kitty admired the crocusyellow walls in the hall and ive found a cleaner thank god a mrs piggot said georgie then seeing kittys wary look im not sure how hot she is on cleaning but shes ace on gossip shes already told me the vicars a bit of a puff shes so attractive thought kitty wistfully even with her dark red hair going greasy and last nights mascara smudged under her eyes and a split in her jeans where theyd lost a battle with her spreading hips forcing a large bacardi and coke on kitty georgie bore her upstairs to a bedroom so large and high that even the massive stillunmade fourposter looked like a childs cot blushing kitty averted her eyes from a damp patch on the bottom sheet crumpling the duvet was a large bassethound this is dinsdale said georgie screwing up the bassets jowly face gazing into his bloodshot eyes and kissing him on the nose the one thing that can be relied on to look worse than me in the morning now lets look at these curtains goodness youve done them well although theyre not really bedroomy ive never been very good with flowered chintz lets put them up in no time kitty found herself standing in her stockinged feet acutely ashamed of her fat ankles amid the clutter of georgies dressing table as she perilously hooked the curtains on to a big brass rail a bloody girlfriend rang me this morning georgie gazed moodily at the long blond tresses of the willows lining the lake saying wasnt i worried about all those bimbos and separated women in london waiting to seduce guy while im down here guy of all people hes so stuffy about people having affaires then she said do watch the drink it gets to you in the country georgie took a great slug of her bacardi im a bit pissed off with marigold she went on glancing across at the grange which was in deep shadow apart from flowers when we moved in some rather awful mauve gladioli ive hardly heard a word shes having problems with larry nikkis proving even more difficult to give up than smoking he should try nikkis hypnotist again and nikki intends to take him to the cleaners funny when she always forgot to take his suits there when she was living with him now shes never off the telephone screaming abuse at larry and dropping the telephone if marigold answers and lysanders never off the telephone from cheshire dropping it natch when larry picks it up offering to fly down and whisk marigold away which must be tempting i didnt really talk to him at the rock star launch but he was faintmaking gorgeous sighed kitty remembering how lysander had come over to kiss her hallogoodbye as he was leaving the party there i fink thats ok looks marvellous said georgie drawing the curtains and plunging them into such total darkness that kitty nearly fell off the dressing table we must pay you no dont be silly lets have another drink then i must wash my hair im obviously not going to get any lunch thought kitty which was probably a good thing shed totally failed to go on a diet for rannaldinis return tomorrow just as i expected they look terrific said a deep carrying voice why am i always saying youre a brick kitty guy looked so handsome that as he put out a warm strong hand to help her down and then kissed her cheek kitty wished she looked less shiny from her exertions and hastily fumbled for her highheeled shoes what kept you snapped georgie tugging the elastic band out of her hair frogspawn in the village pond blueandwhite violets on the bank primroses like dayold chicks it was such a beautiful day i walked i suppose you havent remembered to put on the potatoes panda hell i forgot sighed georgie im sorry darling but im not really hungry well kitty and i are said guy which is why i bought smoked salmon pâté and vine leaves at the apple tree its such a sophisticated shop i arranged for us to have an account there which means flora will chalk up fags and booze said georgie she must be told not to said guy sharply there was a list for ordering your hot cross buns thats what i call a proper village shop i cant believe its easter in a fortnight ow i love easter said kitty somehow you cant wait for jesus to rise from the dead and walk barefooted in the white dew among the daffodils then she blushed scarlet as georgie said rather mockingly dinsdale loves easter too because it means chocolate how was the vicar mrs piggot says hes gay i had coffee with him and his wife said guy who disapproved of gossip they were charming mrs piggot says hes a pissartist went on georgie takes one to know one said guy dismissively the gins dropped three inches since shes been cleaning for you i must wash my hair said georgie you havent got time said guy flatly youve asked kitty to lunch its already three oclock and weve got to leave by four to get decent seats the concert doesnt start till five and the rushhour starts at four on fridays in the country and floras singing a solo we must be on time panda georgie looked mutinous she was a celebrity everyone would be gazing at her she couldnt have dirty hair reading her thoughts guy said you always look lovely panda what a wonderful husband thought kitty enviously kind and concerned but so firm like a danielle steel hero i dont need any din i mean lunch she stammered a certain row was averted by the telephone georgies work in the last week had been constantly interrupted by the press ringing up to ask how she was adjusting to the country or by demands to go on television or the radio all of which had been turned down by guy my wife has shut herself away with a december deadline he was saying briskly well i can answer that one dogs mostly who was that what did they want to know asked georgie fretfully the scorpion what do you wear in bed and you said dogs georgie started to laugh i do love you people are going to think im even more of a slut than i am ive got an idea said guy as weve only time for a sandwich now and its floras first night in paradise ill take you all out to the heavenly host this evening perfect said georgie as a thankyou present for the curtains i cant sighed kitty suppressing a simultaneous shiver of terror and longing rannaldinis flying in first fing tomorrow i must see everyfinks perfect in fact rannaldini was already in england finally having finished his film of don giovanni which he had produced directed conducted edited and according to the wags of the music world probably played the part of the don with every woman on the set as well arriving a day early at heathrow in his private jet he drove straight to the recently built mozart hall in holland park in order to surprise the london met who were rehearsing for a televised performance of mahlers fourth which he was to conduct on sunday not content with stalking out of the london mets performance of beethovens ninth three weeks earlier rannaldini was now outraged to learn from a rather large bird called hermione that the guest conductor oswaldo had been taking rehearsals with a joint in one hand and a baton in the other such appalling lack of discipline the london met however were devoted to oswaldo he was gentle hugely appreciative rannaldini had never learnt the english for thank you and a marvellous musician he listened to the more experienced members of the orchestra and sought their advice on how things should be played he also remembered his musicians first names bought them drinks on their birthday and tried to get them rises this was quite unlike rannaldini who had the ability to terrorize and hypnotize simultaneously and who could reduce his entire string section to jelly by raising a jetblack eyebrow telling themselves that the same eyebrow was probably dyed did nothing to reduce their terror as musical director of the london met rannaldinis job was to control the orchestra and staff choose guest conductors select the soloists and plan the repertoire for the whole season but as he was also musical director of other orchestras in germany and midamerica where the london met were concerned he would make a series of snap decisions twice a year over a threehour lunch with hermiones husband bob harefield his orchestra manager he then left bob and to a larger extent kitty to augment these decisions as he whizzed off round the world when rannaldini had joined the london met eight years ago he had rowed constantly with the board apart from being away so much he cost them a fortune in overtime because he was always late and then would make the orchestra spend three hours getting three bars right but because he had been so successful he now had them eating out of his very grasping hand and could do what he liked for rannaldini sold records the london met loathed him but he bullied them into perfection they were the best and most famous orchestra in europe and they never had an empty seat they were also the best looking resplendent himself rannaldini liked beauty in others and knew that audiences liked gazing at beautiful people particularly when the music became too demanding bob harefield therefore scoured the country for attractive young musicians who played more vigorously were more malleable and much cheaper in the london met unless you were exceptionally gifted over forty you were a marked man biographers tended to attribute rannaldinis machiavellian nature to his early life his father wolfgang had been a german army officer who met rannaldinis mother gina a chilly leftwing intellectual of great beauty but uncertain temper during the last despairing days of the war when the germans had withdrawn up the leg of italy returning to italy after a gruelling three years in a pow camp wolfgang found gina living on the edge of a small umbrian hill town unhappily and most unsuitably married to paolo rannaldini an italian gentleman farmer whod lost practically everything in the war although gina had grown less beautiful and more cantankerous the affaire started again until paolo found out by which time wolfgang was quite relieved to be seen off with a shotgun having failed to withdraw down the leg of gina however the result was a baby called roberto who took paolos name but little else after this reversal paolo increasingly sought refuge in drink and other women and occasionally to beating up little roberto gina blaming her son quite wrongly for sabotaging the political career which she had always dreamed of was terribly hard on him frequently hitting him for displaying the same sybaritic nature as his german father even worse she gave him no affection particularly humiliating in a country where mothers heroworship their sons and took no pride in his achievements irresistible to women roberto grew up fatally drawn to those who rejected him or gave him a hard time like his mother in return for his savage upbringing he dealt out savage treatment to his musicians his staff and any woman foolish enough to fall in love with him in his late teens he left italy and sought out his father now a rich hamburg industrialist who proud of his unexpectedly glamorous talented son gave him some money and introduced him to a rich but plain wife who supported him through three years at music school and gave him a son little wolfgang just after leaving college rannaldini had another break conducting his first performance of medea during which he fell madly in love with cecilia a famous but incredibly temperamental visiting soprano who was playing the leading role he married her as soon as he could get a divorce cecilia bore him several children of whom natasha was the eldest and helped him hugely with his career a musician of genius who could play several instruments including the eternal triangle rannaldini had been persuaded by cecilia that he would only have the ultimate control he craved if he became a conductor their stormy marriage lasted fifteen years and only foundered when rannaldinis affaire with hermione became too public and cecilias jealousy too excessive leaving her because she was too much trouble he married kitty because she was absolutely no trouble at all an improviser of genius rannaldini expected his musicians to be noteperfect at a first rehearsal he was lucky in that he had a memory instant as a polaroid glanced at a page of music was not forgotten thus he was always able to conduct without a score which was good because he never lost vital eyecontact with his orchestra and because he was too vain to wear spectacles in public rannaldini was a dandy his tailcoats were only perfect after twentyfive fittings women had been known to die for rannaldinis back with its broad flat shoulders beneath the polished pelt of pewtergrey hair the front was even better with the sculptured usually tanned features the beautifully shaped slightly thin lips and the dark dark eyes that not only mesmerized orchestras but gazed deep deep into womens eyes until their eyeballs melted apart from his childhood which still gave him nightmares rannaldini had two great sadnesses he was one of the greatest conductors in the world but he minded that he was only an interpretative artist he had composed in his youth but able to absorb other peoples music so effortlessly he was terrified of being derivative and banal and not succeeding per cent secondly he would have given anything to be six foot rather than five foot six and now he was back padding stealthily into the new mozart hall a day early the orchestra had already played mahlers fourth to a rapturous reception in vienna the night before afterwards most of the musicians had stayed up for oswaldos birthday party preferring to catch an early morning plane home for the rehearsal while still tight with the cheers of the sophisticated viennese audience still ringing in their aching heads they felt there was little need to do more than touch up a few difficult passages and practise with hermione who was to be the soloist in the fourth movement on sunday as rannaldini was due back tomorrow there was very much an elegiac feeling of the last day of the holidays which was intensified by the players paraphernalia of music cases dinnerjackets evening dresses in plastic cases and holdalls which littered the frontstall seats and the gangway noone even minded that a cleaner was hoovering the red carpet up in the dress circle hands floating above the music like a seagull tall and gangling with a shock of blond hair oswaldo swayed on the rostrum his ginger tshirt showing two inches of bony white back each time he raised his arms this is dancing music he said calling a halt in the second movement it should be a little yar short of english he pushed his elbows upwards swaying his narrow hips to illustrate an imaginary beat christ ive got a hangover said the leader of the orchestra calling out to a passing bob harefield get us an alkaseltzer theres a love and lets have a blackcoffee break at the end of this movement ossie but suddenly the musicians at the front desks started to shake without knowing why then gradually as a faint sweetmusky scent reached the nostrils of the entire orchestra they realized it was rannaldinis horribly distinctive aftershave maestro specially created for him by givenchy wafting over them as he strolled towards the rostrum a little yar he murmured silkily what a very specific instruction not very ok ya in this case the leader of the orchestra dropped his bow the percussionist choked on his toffee a bassoonist hastily put down pd james the harpist stopped painting her toenails a beautiful violinist in a purple shirt deliberately placed at the desk nearest the audience stopped reading a letter from her boyfriend a female horn player whod been infatuated with rannaldini since hed bedded her on the orchestras last trip to japan dived behind the cellist in front frantically combing her hair and applying blusher to her blanched cheeks a paper dart intended for oswaldo fell at rannaldinis feet oswaldo melted away like snow in the morning sun bob harefield on his way into the hall with a fizzing glass of alkaseltzer went sharply into reverse normally chatter swelled whenever there was a halt but now the hall was totally silent musicians still trickling in because they hadnt expected rannaldini were greeted with a sabatier tongue which slashed through their excuses another pileup on the motorway the traffic was terrible from the airport bawled rannaldini to a little flautist weighed down by sainsbury carrier bags the road was perfectly clear ten minutes ago a train taken off balderdash his voice rose to a scream youre late if it happens again youre fired im sorry rannaldini there was a bombscare in sloane square said a frontdesk violinist scuttling in bombscare purred rannaldini as the man frantically tuned his violin twiddling and twisting the nobs with a shaking hand then with a roar ill put a bomb under you all of you just look under your cars before you leave slowly he mounted the rostrum as gleamingly brown from the la sun as any of the cellos in his string section he kept on his black overcoat with the astrakhan collar because he hadnt adjusted to the cold march weather letting the score drop to the floor in a gesture of contempt he removed his rolex and laid it on the musicstand then stood as still as one of his own valhalla statues establishing dominance the orchestra edged nearer their musicstands wishing they could have fastened seatbelts against turbulence suddenly the music theyd known backwards five minutes ago seemed terrifyingly unfamiliar tapping the baton given him by toscanini rannaldini held out his arms the leader put his violin under his chin bow quaking in his hand as rannaldini gave the upbeat for the start of the funereally slow third movement eyes missing nothing gesticulating exquisitely with his beautiful hands the right one keeping time the left exhorting his musicians on he let them have their heads economical with his movements even his stick hand twitching no more than the tail of a cat watching a bird through a window rannaldini lulled them into a false sense of security perhaps the audience in vienna had been right after all then he unleashed his fury like a fascist police squad moving in on a defenceless mob with cudgels finding fault after fault with the performance until the women were in tears the men grey and shaking and shredded india rubber covered the floor where theyd erased oswaldos instructions on their scores and replaced them with rannaldinis able to identify a wrong note ten miles away he singled out an oboe player you make a hundred meestakes its difficult that bit stammered the player rubbish thundered rannaldini strolling down from the rostrum he picked up the oboe and played it perfectly you havent practised youre fired he handed back the oboe then he noticed bob harefields charming humpty dumpty face with its tired bruised eyes and shouted that he would not conduct on sunday unless the twentyfour musicians bob had hired in his absence were fired as well i no okkay them he screamed but every seat is sold maestro and what about the bbc and catchitune said the manager of the mozart hall almost in tears it weel ave to be cancelled snarled rannaldini i weel not play with peegs howling he turned on his orchestra and would have kicked over a few musicstands if his handmade black shoes hadnt been new i ear you murder beethoven nine poor beethoven i ope they didnt restore his earing in eaven i ave tape of radio three programme last week when you abort the creation we got very good reviews for both protested bob putting a comforting arm round the shoulder of the sacked oboist reviewers are stupid peegs and i want heem sacked rannaldini pointed at the frontdesk violinist whod rushed in late we cant sack him whispered bob his wifes just left him sensible woman said rannaldini then his voice rising to a shriek i want heem fired a diversion was caused by the cleaner who started hoovering again at the back of the stalls another sensible woman said rannaldini trying to obliterate this cacophony a further diversion was caused by the arrival of hermione swathed in mink to sing in the fourth movement i refuse to put those poor furriers out of business she was saying to her entourage of agent secretary makeup girl seamstress and lighting specialist i for one believe people come before animals having kissed her on both cheeks rannaldini calmed down a little we will move on to the last movement since mrs harefield has done you the honour of turning up and unlike you knows the score hermione was a nightmare to work with beneath the façade of gushing serenity she was ruthlessly egotistical always making a fuss about dressing rooms and acoustics taking against members of the orchestra or other soloists creating fearful anxiety as to whether she would go on at all leaving everyone drained because shed milked them of so many compliments then once she opened her mouth her performance would be flawless today as she flapped around fussing about being properly lit her husband bob went quietly round the orchestra smoothing feathers holding the score eating an apple to moisten her throat hermione listened unmoved while rannaldini bawled out a beautiful little blond female flautist who out of terror had fluffed the introductory bars before hermiones entrance waiting for the nod to bring her in hermione stood on rannaldinis left as she had so often in the past while he was making her famous in every capital in the world it still gave rannaldini a charge hermione couldnt act for the percussionists toffee she always sacrificed acting for beauty of tone she irritated the hell out of rannaldini but when she opened her mouth and that ripple of angelic sound soared full and clear above the orchestra he could forgive her anything in return she seemed to be making love to him with her huge brown eyes grateful to him for conjuring up magic she was unaware she possessed the orchestra watched her wonderful bosom rising and falling with a mixture of lust and dislike but at the end they gave her a round of applause and even the odd bravo because she expected it excellent mrs harefield rannaldinis flat bitchy voice could sink to reverberatingly seductive depths when he was in a conciliatory mood but as for you lot go ome and practise this is the score picking it off the floor he hurled it into the orchestra narrowly missing a lady clarinetist now steek to eet and eef you avent learn it properly by tomorrow i wont go on on sunday and he stalked out leaving hermione who was expecting lunch at san lorenzo mouthing in outrage what can we do asked the manager of the mozart hall in despair you cant sack all those musicians bob shrugged rannaldinis just jackbooting around because hes been away and he cant bear his orchestra playing well for someone else also bob dropped his voice cecilia wife number two is in london shes come over for lucia at covent garden so he wanted an excuse to storm out early and take her to lunch and double bed at the savoy she lives in new york but he always sleeps with her when she comes over or if hes in new york whats she like asked the leader of the orchestra forgetting his hangover little black mamba in little black numbers eats men for breakfast or would if she wasnt always on a diet bob shook with laughter goodness said the sacked oboe player momentarily roused out of his despondency does hermione know christ no why upset her cecilias supposed to be going down to bagley hall this evening to some endofterm concert boris levitskys the music master so the standard may have improved a little i suppose rannaldini may roll up as well and hermione theyll all fly in different helicopters that guys a saint said the leader of the orchestra as bob moved off to calm hermione down bagley hall was a chic progressive boardingschool set amid rolling green parkland on the edge of the rutminstergloucestershire border the parents who tended to be arty or from the media had chosen the school mostly because they heard the music was wonderful and they believed that their somewhat problematical darlings wouldnt come to much harm amid such remote rural surroundings the former assumption was certainly true since boris levitsky had become music master last seen threatening to beat up lysander for comforting his wife rachel after they met in a london chemists boris had shortly afterwards left the london met where he had worked as an assistant conductor in an attempt to save his marriage boris had loathed being an assistant conductor which meant he was a glorified understudy who took rehearsals memorized scores and kept a tailcoat hanging in a cupboard backstage ready to come on at a moments notice but alas the moment never came this with the added frustration of never getting any of his compositions published or performed had driven boris into the ego boost of an affaire with chloe the mezzo envious of boriss genius both as composer and conductor and not wanting competition at the london met rannaldini had actively helped him to get the job at bagley hall not least because he felt his daughter natasha and less so his son wolfgang who was in his last year and musically disinclined could do with some decent teaching boris found teaching much worse than being an assistant conductor it was so draining that he had no effort left for composition he was thirtyone and he was aware of time running out particularly now that europe after the collapse of the berlin wall was flooded with russian musicians his novelty value was ebbing away he would never achieve recognition now the concert hall was filling up through the thick green velvet curtains boris could see kitty rannaldini so sweet and downtrodden being ignored by her stepdaughter natasha a voluptuous sixteen year old almost incestuously in love with her father natasha had inherited both cecilias and rannaldinis histrionic temperaments but not alas their talent her voice was powerful but harsh assuming it must be good however she never listened to criticism boriss best pupil was marcus campbellblack who at seventeen played the piano with such sensitivity and imagination that there was little left to teach him through the curtain boris could see marcuss father the legendarily handsome rupert only dragged here on sufferance by his wife taggie rupert was determined to leave early he didnt want to be buttonholed by his exwife helen who was sitting in the row behind rupert had not forgiven helen for not sending marcus to his old school harrow convinced that there was no money in playing the piano as a career it had taken rupert a long time to get over the shock four years ago when marcus had timidly announced that he wanted to become a concert pianist today rupert was worrying about the recession at venturer the local itv company of which he was a director advertising had slumped the bloodstock market had also taken ä dive finally he had been up all night with a sick filly who was a distinct possibility for the guineas and the oaks and he wanted to get back to her he was therefore the only adult not thrown into turmoil because rannaldini had just telephoned natasha to say he would be attending the concert after all parents and teachers were all in a tizz in case one of their darlings was discovered the pupils on the other hand were more excited by the presence of georgie maguire and guy seymour who were becoming cult figures since the launching of rock star natasha rannaldini who saw herself as the victim of a broken home thought rock star was the most wonderful song and that the reason she wasnt as popular at bagley hall as flora seymour was because she didnt have parents as happy as guy and georgie amazed to see them arriving with her dreary stepmother whom she usually passed off as the younger childrens au pair natasha was forced to speak to kitty in order to meet them shame your father isnt here to hear you singing said guy but he will be from under heavy eyelids natasha shot a spiteful glance at kitty he just rang to say hes on his way for a second guy thought kitty would black out with horror as she remembered she hadnt turned on the central heating in the tower or put clean sheets on rannaldinis bed there or in her bedroom in case he deigned to sleep with her this evening there was nothing special for supper and rannaldinis guarddogs were still down in the village with their handler he liked a pack welcome i must go she mumbled whitelipped ill get a taxi you will not firmly guy took her arm its rannaldinis fault for arriving a day early he can join us at the heavenly host georgie still smarting because rannaldini had dismissed rock star as derivative was even more livid that guy hadnt let her wash her hair shed had to make up in the car and now in the crowded overheated hall was terrified that her pale skin would grow red and blotchy she was also piqued that while everyone elses children were crowding around asking for autographs flora whom she hadnt seen since before the american tour hadnt showed up although she had only been at the school one term flora had already established herself as the bagley hall wild child determined to buck the system wolfie rannaldini had a massive crush on her so did marcus campbellblack but he was too shy to do anything about it like most of the girls in the school flora had a massive crush on boris levitsky who had sallow skin wonderful slitty dark grey eyes and high cheekbones with his long blue jacket and shaggy black hair in a ponytail he would be perfectly cast as mr christian in mutiny on the bounty the concert had been due to start at five oclock it was now fivethirty and there was still no sign of rannaldini the orchestra had tuned up and up parents were looking at their watches many of them had long drives home and would be forced to stumble out in the middle ruining the concert which was probably rannaldinis intention thought boris darkly determined to impress his old mentor he was getting increasingly strung up he was very tired because sustained by vodka he was playing the fiddle in a soho nightclub to make ends meet out in the hall distraction was provided by the arrival of the great diva hermione harefield whod just rolled up with bob and plonked herself down between kitty and guy in the seat that was being kept for rannaldini it was twentyfive to six miss bottomley the headmistress vast and sapphic had just risen furiously to announce that the concert could be delayed no longer when rannaldinis helicopter landed on the lawn outside squashing a lot of daffodils kitty watched him jump down like a cat bronzed and impossibly glamorous with his thick pewter hair hardly ruffled by the wind and her heart failed as it always did georgie prepared to detest him because of hermiones jibes thought he was the most attractive man she had ever seen it was not just the good looks but the total lack of contrition sorry to hold you up sabine he called out blithely to an apoplectic miss bottomley as he swept up the aisle asphyxiating everyone with maestro we had engine trouble then glancing up at boris who was fuming in the wings carry on boris always engine trouble when cecilias in town thought kitty despairingly over here rannaldini weve saved you a seat called hermione in her deep thrilling voice in fact she hadnt it merely meant that helen campbellblack had to move into the row in front and sit next to her exhusband rupert who had in the past been infinitely more promiscuous and far later for every engagement than rannaldini but who was now glaring at him with all the chilling disapproval of the reformed rake fucking casanouveau he murmured to taggie cant imagine him as a schoolboy must have spent his time in the biology lab dissecting live rats moving down the row to join hermione rannaldinis eyes fell on a cringing kitty friday is a work day he murmured as he sat down beside her i assume everythings in order at home for you to play truant like this i fort you was coming tomorrow stammered kitty i fort natasha would like one of us to be here hush said hermione loudly boris wishes to begin boris had a hole in his dark blue jacket buttons off his white frilled shirt a nappy pin holding up his trousers and his unruly black hair was escaping from its black bow mounting the rostrum he bent to kiss the score of brahms academic overture lifted his stick and began immediately if rannaldini was all icy precision boris was all fire and romantic enthusiasm the orchestra played as though they were possessed bob harefield who never stopped talentspotting and was now leaning against the wall at the back of the hall took out his notebook rannaldini on the other hand closed his eyes and ostentatiously winced at any wrong note rupert campbellblack was not much better behaved his golden head lolling on his present wifes shoulder as he gently snored in counterpoint to the music until his exwife woke him up to listen to marcus playing the last movement of mozarts e flat piano concerto this marcus did so exquisitely and looked so touching with his fauns face big hazel eyes and gleaming dark red hair that the audience despite being kept late by rannaldini demanded an encore mopping his brow looking much happier boris tapped the rostrum marcus will now play a little composition of my own i op you all like him the audience wasnt sure and started looking bewildered and at their watches not understanding the music one bit sounds as though the stable cats got loose on the piano awful lot of wrong notes muttered rupert i think theyre meant to be because its modern whispered taggie hush said ruperts exwife furiously rannaldini whod repeatedly refused to programme boriss music felt totally vindicated and smirking pretended to go to sleep again through almost closed eyes he was aware of kitty plump white and quivering like a blancmange it was cruel to compare her with the other very young wife in the room but rannaldini did so staring at taggie campbellblack he decided she was very desirable particularly in that red cashmere poloneck which had brought a flush to her cheeks and what breasts and what legs in that black suede miniskirt her succulent thighs must be twice as long and half the width of kittys she was reputed to be a marvellous cook and to be adored by all ruperts children which was more than could be said for kitty how amusing to take taggie off rupert thought rannaldini who liked longdistance challenges as if willed by his lust taggie turned round and smiled without thinking because he looked familiar then realizing they hadnt been introduced she turned away and rannaldini suddenly encountered such a murderous glare from rupert that he hastily looked up the row at helen she was stunning too rupert certainly knew how to pick them rannaldini wished he had brought cecilia to redress the balance but he had exhausted her so much at the savoy she couldnt be bothered to get out of bed and now it was natashas turn to sing hark hark the lark her voice was strident and she hadnt practised enough marcus played the accompaniment and being a kind boy speeded up to get her through the difficult bits the audience who didnt know any better seeing in their programme that she was a rannaldini gave her huge applause led by hermione rannaldini let his thoughts wander to the little blond flautist he had reduced to tears at the rehearsal tomorrow he would be stern at first then stun her with a word of praise and ultimately ask her to his flat in hyde park square for a drink i only bully you dearest child because you have talent the orchestra with wolfie playing the clarinet natasha the violin and marcus campbellblack the trumpet were just murdering the dove from respighis the birds and plucking the poor thing as well and rannaldini was about to stage another of his very public walkouts which would take all the attention off boris when kitty whispered that the girl wolfie was mad about was coming on next the orchestra who were going to end the concert with an enigma variation stayed in their seats rannaldini couldnt imagine his stolid ruggerplaying son being mad about anyone interesting but when flora strolled on to the platform he couldnt take his eyes off her despite having several spots greasy red hair the colour of tabasco and a pale green complexion from drinking at lunchtime she was the sexiest girl hed ever seen her school shirt drenched in white wine clung almost transparently to her small jutting breasts her tie was askew her black stockings laddered gazing truculently at the back of the hall she sang speed bonny boat unaccompanied and the room went still her voice was beyond criticism sweet pure piercingly distinctive and delivered in a takeitorleaveit manner without a quiver of nerves her star quality was undeniable georgie clutched guys hand deeply moved guy couldnt resist glancing sideways delighted at the dramatic effect his daughters voice was having on rannaldini he didnt want her to become a pop star but a career in classical music would be different perhaps flora was learning to behave at last but when flora reached the line about winds roaring loudly and thunderclouds rending the air she so empathized with tossing on a rough sea that she suddenly turned even greener and grabbing the nearest trumpet from a protesting marcus threw up into it the first person to break the long and appalled silence was rupert campbellblack quite unable to control his laughter sod wolfie thought rannaldini with a surge of excitement i must have that girl georgie and guy were so overwhelmed with mortification and in guys case whitehot rage that they nearly boycotted the drinks party afterwards miss bottomley whod been looking for an excuse all term was poised to sack flora on the spot when rannaldini glided up and smoothed everything over putting his beautiful suntanned hand which was immediately shrugged off on miss bottomleys wrestlers shoulders he assured her that all creative artists suffered from stage fright the girls impossible spluttered miss bottomley but on course for stardom i never ear a voice like this since i first heard hermione harefield even mrs harefield rannaldini lowered his voice suggestively need endless coaxing to go on and very delicate handling frightfully excited at the thought of handling hermione miss bottomley agreed to give flora another chance i will speak to her parents insisted rannaldini he then astounded wolfie natasha and kitty by changing his mind and staying on for the drinks party as rupert campbellblack had led the stampede of cars down the drive he would at least have the floor to himself was hark hark ok papa demanded natasha linking arms with her father as she led him down darkpanelled corridors past gawping staff and pupils excellent said rannaldini abstractedly youve come on a lot what was the matter with wolfies little redhead flora deliberately natasha let the door into miss bottomleys private apartment slam in the face of kitty who was panting to keep up with them on her high heels flora got pissed at lunchtime explained natasha shes got this massive crush on boris levitsky and she saw him french or rather natasha giggled russiankissing some strange blonde not rachel his wife outside the nat west this morning that was boriss trumpet flora was sick into boris had lent it to marcus so boris is back with chloe the mezzo thought rannaldini certainly he didnt regard floras massive crush on the russian as any competition miss bottomleys large study was already packed with parents falling on drink and food like the vultures culture always seems to turn people into most of them rannaldini noticed scornfully seemed to be gathering like flies on a cowpat round that ghastly blousy georgie maguire who kept throwing him hot glances ignoring her totally but accepting a glass of orange juice he never touched cheap wine rannaldini spoke briefly to boris well tried my dear slightly too ambitious they are still cheeldren and was it wise to programme one of your own compositions in front of these pheelistines boris whose conducting arm was not aching too much to prevent him downing several glasses of red wanted to smash rannaldinis cold fleshless but curiously sensual face but then rannaldini murmured something about having a pile of freelance work boris needed the money badly now introduce me to floras parents he said to natasha oh didnt you twig papa floras georgie maguires daughter rannaldini didnt miss a beat gliding forward parting parents like the red sea by sheer force of personality he stopped in front of georgie put his hands in the pockets of his soft brown suede jacket bowed slightly and glared aggressively into her eyes his trick was to unnerve women by staring them out then suddenly to smile senora seymour he said caressingly may i call you georgie then raising her hand which was clutching a soggy ritz cracker topped with tinned pâté and chopped gherkin he touched it with his lips just one cornyetto thought guy i am sorry i mees your launching went on rannaldini i op it is not too late to say welcome to paradise oh not at all how lovely to meet you at last georgie was totally flustered as though a great tiger had strolled out of the jungle and was rubbing his face against her cheek rannaldini was even more faintmaking close up and i loff rock star it is great music and your peecture dont do you any justice what could rannaldini be playing at hermione whod joined them was looking furious oh thank you gasped georgie then remembering her manners this is guy my husband she added almost regretfully i haff heard much of your gallery rannaldini switched his searchlight charm on to guy you were first to exeebit daisy francelynch when noone else had eard of her i ave several of her paintings oh right guy was totally disarmed id love to see them you shall said rannaldini first i want to get bob over to talk about flora seeing his endlessly compassionate and goodnatured orchestra manager making too good a job of cheering up boris levitsky rannaldini clicked his fingers imperiously refusing to be ruffled bob finished what he was saying and was fighting his way through the mob when guy said to rannaldini you may not have been here to welcome us but kitty has been an absolute brick bringing us newlaid eggs and turning down curtains youre a lucky man he added rather heartily aware that the searchlight beam had dimmed a little rannaldini who detested kitty furthering anyones interests but his own much preferred it if she turned down invitations rather than curtains he even begrudged her taking an hour off on sunday to go to church aware of a distinct chill but not understanding why georgie couldnt bear to lose contact we wanted to take kitty out to the heavenly host tonight she stammered why dont we all go we were planning to celebrate floras first night home although on second thoughts she seems to have preempted us rather too well already why dont you both come to dinner at angels reach how about friday week we should be a little less shambolic by then hermione who was about to draw georgie aside and explain that the protocol in paradise was for longterm residents to invite first awaited one of rannaldinis legendary putdowns instead to her amazement he accepted with enthusiasm on four glasses of cheap wine georgie proceeded to invite bob whod just brought boris over to be introduced and hermione who only accepted because rannaldini had then she asked boris and his wife rachel if they were in the country to make up for the sick trumpet which boris reassured georgie would easily wash out then to placate miss bottomley she asked her as well best time to have a housewarming party when its not all done up for people to ruin said georgie happily as they drove home a moon one size up from new was winging its way like a white dove towards a dying flamered sunset slumped in the back flora was fast asleep i thought you wanted peace and quiet in the country chided guy i got carried away i thought it would be good for flora to meet rannaldini she needs an older man to direct her one never listens to ones parents at her age he says shes exceptional anyway i cant cut myself off completely we can have sausages and mash people will only expect a picnic as weve just moved in guy who knew hed be lumbered with the cooking and the organization put his mind to the menu georgie lay back in a blissful haze convinced rannaldini had only accepted because he fancied her it was years since shed felt that loinchurning excitement rannaldinis lovely isnt he she couldnt help saying not terribly said guy shortly not to kitty and hes clearly terribly twofaced but it was such a beautiful face thought georgie dreamily you didnt mind there being two of them guy was an ace cook and a wonderful host but georgie had never known him make such a fuss about a dinner party his nose had been in anton mosimann for days as the dining room was still being wallpapered he took the friday of the dinner party off and set the big scrubbed table in the kitchen first thing in the morning he then got enraged when charity the cat did bending races in and out of the glasses decanters and flowers and with flora when she drifted in at lunchtime with a group of friends and started making toasted sandwiches and leaving a trail of mugs crumbs and overflowing ashtrays we met a crowd of spiders fleeing down the drive singing the theme from exodus flora told her father you ought to put one in a glass case to remind us what they look like dont be fatuous snapped guy bashing a lobster claw with unusual violence when he wasnt cooking guy seemed to spend the whole day cleaning surfaces tidying and rearranging the house and disappearing to get petrol for the mower every superfluous blade of grass must be cut like a woman waiting for her lover thought georgie who having been told she was more hindrance than help retired to work she was enchanted with her new study high up in the west tower and reached by a staircase so narrow they had to hoist her piano her worktable and dinsdales ancient chaiselongue in through the window sitting at her table pen poised over a blank page of manuscript paper she was trying to write a song equating love to everlasting candles on a birthday cake the strongest winds may blow and rack but ill come burning brightly back wrote georgie the word rack was too obscure shed have to think of something else she got down the rhyming dictionary she could see the great lichened curve of an angels wing and if she leant out of the window she could look over a fuzz of wood as soft as rabbits fur to the chimneys of valhalla and rannaldinis grey tower beyond paradise lived more and more up to its name like quill pens plunging into inkygreen spring grass little poplar trees lined the drive as guys mowing machine paused georgie could hear the rattle of a woodpecker after the mornings rain the mist was rising milky blue down the valley like a thousand smoke signals dreamily she imagined herself sending a message to rannaldini guys home his lunch in baths been cancelled we cant meet today on the mantelpiece was an unsigned good luck card from tancredi whod been the lead guitarist in her first famous group of the sixties georgie and tancredi had been the most passionate and fatal of lovers and when the group split up she had settled for guy and stability and tancredi had kicked his cocaine habit and married a homespun middleamerican girl and made good in los angeles but they still telephoned each other occasionally and met up and made love when tancredi came over to england agreeing that although they were far better off with their present partners there was still an undeniable bond between them tancredi was due back in may perhaps he could come down to angels reach when guy was in london there were plainly advantages to being alone in the country midweek particularly if rannaldini was around then georgie looked up at the corkboard where shed pinned cuttings from the rock star launch guy square jawed cleareyed sternly handsome stared down at her she must get a copy of the photograph from the express and have it framed guy was the one who mattered but it was lovely to be fancied feeling dreadfully selfindulgent she slotted in the tape of rock star glorying in the smoky beauty of her own voice and picked up her pen flora had only agreed to wait at the table because boris was coming to dinner now she had further enraged guy by messing up the guest bathroom and annexing his free foresters cricket sweater hearing shouting from downstairs georgie wondered if guy was uptight because hed picked up the vibes between her and rannaldini she felt very excited as she wandered downstairs reeking of giorgio in a clinging velvet mididress the same luminous grey as the sky on a moonlit night which streamlined her opulent body and showed off her tousled red hair no spring nor summer beauty has such grace as i have seen in one autumnal face she could imagine rannaldini murmuring in that wonderful throbbing basso profundo the house certainly looked lovely the huge rooms although hell to heat were a marvellous showcase for guys paintings rannaldini and larry and to a lesser extent bob were collectors guy even had hopes of rupert campbellblack who despite not knowing the difference between a titian and a tretchikoff had one of the finest collections of paintings in the country drifting into the drawing room however georgie found that all their own paintings had been taken down and the stark white walls covered with vast oils of the same copulating couple a rapacious naked girl coiled round a faceless man in a pinstripe suit flora who was still wearing guys cricket sweater and looking as trampishly sexy as her mother looked voluptuous and replete was gazing at them in horror whats this shit she demanded dont swear guys lips tightened as he adjusted a picture light and dont make comments on things about which you know nothing these are original armstrongs youd need strong arms to hoist up a dog like that girl theyre absolutely gross its a moving and original interpretation of the kama sutra pinstripe suitra more like drawled flora whos coming to this bash anyway guy looked even more bootfaced but was not prepared to risk a row that might leave him waitressless well i decided in for a penny in for a pound theres julia armstrong and her husband ben going into the kitchen he gave his raspberry purée to go with the lobster mousseline a stir whos she asked georgie guy sighed oh panda ive told you a hundred times shes having an exhibition at the gallery next month i thought people might enjoy a preview tonight ben and julia live in islington but theyve rented a weekend cottage in eldercombe theyve got young children bens in computers i like him a lot leave those grapes alone flora he said sharply and you were going to wash a couple of lettuces georgie ive done the dressing and for goodness sake do the placement before everyone arrives oh god placement was more taxing than a level maths there was julia and ben rannaldini and kitty annabel hardman another friend of georgies who lived in paradise and valentine her brilliant beast of a lawyer husband who might not turn up boris and rachel marigold and lysander or larry and for miss bottomley georgie had invited meredith whalen an extremely expensive gay interior designer who was nicknamed the ideal homo because he was so often asked to make up numbers at paradise dinner parties ill need log tables to work out this one grumbled georgie bottomleyd better go on your right mum advised flora shell need two chairs dont be silly giggled georgie she goes on daddys right and hermione on his left but guy who was spooning caviar on to each plate beside the lobster mousseline was not in the mood for frivolity put julia armstrong on my left she wont know anyone and ive got to talk shop to her and put ben on your left with alarm georgie suddenly noticed a dozen bottles of dom perignon a battalion of nuits st george as well as the vat of caviar and four bottles of barsac in the fridge they were horrendously overdrawn at the moment but she didnt feel she could remonstrate with guy when hed done all the cooking and her new grey velvet dress had cost a fortune following him into the drawing room she found him putting on a record next moment mozart flooded the house from every speaker oh lovely sighed georgie rannaldinis così its mozarts così snapped guy he is uptight about rannaldini thought georgie guy was wearing neither tie nor jacket which was unusual a cornflowerblue shirt which she hadnt seen before was tucked into very dark grey cords held up with a leather belt he looked glowingly handsome and georgie told him so and youre in great shape she added putting her arms round his broad athletic back and feeling his flat taut midriff must be humping all that furniture youve worked so hard murmured georgie particularly today i am lucky love you darling love you panda said guy now do the placement so you can relax and enjoy yourself the evening in fact was far from relaxed by nine oclock only miss bottomley had arrived roaring up on a motor bike and in a foul mood because shed got lost then at a quarterpast nine boris rang full of tearful and mostly incomprehensible contrition rachel had found out that hed been seeing his old mistress chloe and issued an ultimatum as a point of honour boris felt he must resign from the marriage so he couldnt make dinner nor understandably could rachel which meant a frantic resetting of the table and a rewrite of the placement not easy when one was three bacardis up even worse flora on learning boris wasnt coming retired to her bedroom with a bottle of barsac and the cordless telephone and flatly refused to do any waitressing bob then arrived with hermione looking radiant in an olivegreen chanel suit braided with rose pink bringing up the rear was meredith the ideal homo were late because rannaldini sacked two soloists this afternoon and bobs got to find replacements by monday said hermione handing her mink to guy gracious it looks different since the jennings day she then proceeded to go into ecstasies over the dark green wallpaper in the downstairs lavatory which they hadnt changed and on peering into the study which had been papered in dark mulberry to set off guys victorian paintings said what colour are you going to paint this dreadfully dark room meredith who looked like christopher robin with shirley temples blond curls and who was tiny beautifully dressed and a great giggler made no comment on the principle that any praise might do him out of a possible job i think it looks wonderful said bob harefield hugging a disconsolate georgie by ninethirty they were still light on rannaldini and kitty julia and ben armstrong annabel and valentine hardman and marigold and whoever georgie was so nervous and belted upstairs so often to check her face that bob wondered if she was on something rannaldinis der rosenkavalier was now surging out of the speakers and hermione had started to sing along you better put on the broccoli muttered guy as he opened another bottle of champagne i cant do everything not waiting for the water to boil georgie was returning from the kitchen when through the door came a girl with long hair the red of springtime copper beeches and a lot of dark makeup round her foxbrown eyes she was wearing a cream mididress which enhanced her very pale skin as falling snowflakes whiten the sky her slender neck seemed almost too delicate to support a heavy metal scorpion which hung between unexpectedly full breasts lovely thought georgie with pleasure not unlike me twenty years ago i must go on a diet panda this is julia armstrong said guy and this he added even more warmly is ben ben in computers was bald with protruding eyes full red lips emphasized by a straggling black beard and a little frill of black hair flowing over his white collar like a draught extractor seeing guy in a shirt he promptly removed his jacket to show off a small waist and hips as wide as his shoulders he then proceeded to explain in his nasal very common voice that they were late because hed been kept at the office on extremely important business what a lovely spot guy he went on accepting a drink how did you find it with great difficulty if you had georgies directions boomed sabine bottomley who was gazing in admiration at julia it is sods law thought georgie irritably as julia clapped her hands in joy as she saw her paintings on the walls that such an enchanting girl should be on guys left and i should be landed with her ghaastly husband but next moment the balance was redressed by the arrival of rannaldini whod been kept on even more important business some multibillion yen record deal with the japs and who was livid not to be the last to arrive heartstopping in a dark blue velvet smokingjacket he was followed by poor kitty looking unbelievably plain in burgundy polyester with just the wrong gathers over the hips for her beanbag figure as ben was nearest the door and shamefully because they were the two most unattractive people in the room georgie introduced him to kitty do you play an instrument asked ben she plays the word processor called out rannaldini bitchily dont give her any other ideas introduced to julia who in her nervousness georgie called juliet rannaldini was allpurring amiability but grew less so on learning that flora had pushed off upstairs go and get your daughter guy hissed at georgie always my daughter when shes acting up thought georgie applying another layer of clinique and a squirt of giorgio before banging on floras door darling please come out and be nice rannaldinis bought you tickets for the st matthew passion i dont care sobbed flora whod drunk nearly a whole bottle of barsac the only passion i have is for boris levitsky and hes buggered off with that slag chloe my life is over charging downstairs georgie found guy pointing out the merits of one of julias enmeshed couples to rannaldini bob and meredith the ideal homo theyre very strong guy said warmly im certain armstrong is going to be very big meredith who inveigled vast fees out of his clients with the innocence of a schoolboy touting for pocket money raised his little grey flannel leg three inches off the ground in imitation of the pinstripe lover i couldnt get myself into that position in a thousand years he giggled he must be awfully fit irritated he wasnt taking the painting seriously enough guy turned on georgie annabel hardman has just rung and bottled out he whispered furiously valentines stuck in london and in some blonde oh poor annabel said georgie says she cant face it on her own snarled guy and wheres your friend marigold the quails will be totally ruined next moment a disgusting smell of burnt rubber drifted in from the kitchen oh god i forgot the broccoli wailed georgie guys face tightened even worse dinsdale fed up with being tripped over had hoisted himself on to the big dark gold corduroy sofa in front of the fire and angrily refused to be evicted when hermione wanted to sit down no i wont have any more champagne im looking forward to a glass of wine at dinner hermione looked at her cartier watch pointedly she was fed up with fascinating miss bottomley who had even more beard than julias husband with whom kitty was making very heavy weather im starving muttered meredith to georgie i had lunch with bob and hermione and the old bat just served up stale bread and mousetrap which would have been turned down by any selfrespecting rat hermione i told her this mousetraps been in your larder longer than dame agathas play she wasnt amused in panic feeling as if all her guests were set in gelatine georgie had another drink it was plain from the bored expression on rannaldinis face that he wasnt remotely interested in her and if marigold didnt show theyd need speaking trumpets to hear each other at dinner her heart lifted as lights came up the drive but they went round to the back of the house it was mrs piggott georgies cleaner whom flora had nicknamed mother courage because she drank so much beer and who had already arrived to wash up we should never have moved to the country and got embroiled in such grandiose entertaining thought georgie but just as they were seated round the kitchen table and ben to his horror found himself next to dowdy kitty yet again the curtain less windows were filled with flashing lights and a helicopter landed on the lawn spewing out larry and marigold who was looking stunning in a scarlet satin suit clasping hands they ran across the lawn nearly tripping over a molehill fraightfully sorry were late said marigold as georgie hastily wrote larrys name on a place card instead of lysanders larry was closing a deal anyone we know asked bob harefield after some coaxing larry admitted that hed just bought per cent of a vast japanese record company he also found taime to make love to me on the office carpet whispered marigold to georgie the dinner party perked up a bit after this as larry and marigold affected everyone with their high spirits idly flipping over the piece of paper on which georgie had worked out the placement rannaldini found his cv which georgie had had faxed down from the london met press office so she would be able to talk knowledgeably about his career at dinner rannaldini smirked if georgie had the hots for him hed gain access to her house and flora more easily a gazehound who hunted by sight rather than scent having once seen flora he wouldnt rest until he caught her however long the chase on the other hand georgie wasnt unattractive she looked much better today it would be an added frisson to play off mother and daughter so he turned the charm on georgie praising floras looks and blazing talent which could only come from her mother he then told georgie about his guestconducting and filming commitments all over the world and georgie didnt take in a word he said because from the way he was looking at her she felt hed already taken a degree in the geography of her body without removing a single garment and that voice husky slow reverberating like the molten depths of a volcano pondering whether to wipe out a nearby town just for the hell of it made his tritest utterance sound significant we are both on treadmill my dear georgie he was saying now softly i in my lear jet you in your leetie study both making music but we will meet from time to time in paradise oh yes georgies heart seemed to be beating between her legs hermione who detested rannaldini chatting up anyone else led the shrieks of praise for guys lobster mousseline followed by quails en croute in ginger and yoghurt with great difficulty georgie wrenched her attention away from rannaldini to talk to the horrific ben you have a very beautiful and talented wife she said julia is also a caring mother said ben complacently at the end of the table against the sooty black of the uncurtained window julia her pale skin glowing like pearl was listening to guys plans for the house ill knock this wall through into a conservatory leading to an indoor pool he was saying i mean when does one get a chance to swim outside in rutshire and who the hells going to pay for it only if i write another smash hit which theyre all so dismissive of with their fucking classical music thought georgie julia was telling hermione how wonderfully she had sung in der rosenkavalier having found out from marigold the details of the japanese record company larry had bought into rannaldini was now discussing the sacked soloists across her with bob georgie was dying to gossip to marigold how lovely if i had rannaldini on the side she thought dreamily like marigold had had lysander as there was no broccoli the salad was now being circulated alas hermione found half a slug in the lettuce georgie hadnt bothered to wash because it was iceberg im just worried that some poor person might get the other half hermione was stagewhispering to guy after that noone wanted any salad and conversation moved on to universities which kitty took no part in having left school at sixteen sitting between ben and meredith who had both turned their backs on her kitty wished she was sitting next to bob goodness he looked tired or to guy whod read the lesson so beautifully in church on sunday and who was being so sweet to that lovely painter kitty noticed that rannaldini as the guest of honour had been put on georgies right but did not feel slighted that she as his wife hadnt been put next to guy that privilege was naturally accorded to hermione the maîtresse en titre every night kitty prayed not to hate hermione and to forgive those who trespassed against her georgie plainly had a crush on rannaldini too but her demands on him kitty hoped would be more rollicking like a red setter wanting a long walk down the valley from time to time rannaldini didnt really like georgie and guy decided kitty thats why he had been subtly punishing her since the bagley hall concert finding fault with everything making her feel even more unsure of herself i dont think one can beat the backs at cambridge hermione was now saying glancing down the table guy noticed kittys eyes were as red as her dress rannaldinis work he thought grimly poor kittys having to put up with the backs of paradise he said reprovingly turn round and talk to her meredith sorry love the ideal homo swung round whens your sexy husband going to let me loose on the valhalla dungeons kitty blushed scarlet but thought once again how sweet guy was i dont know how you put up with it she could now hear hermione telling him in her idea of an undertone being dragged into the limelight in a pop song when youre such a man of substance i would never expose bob to such publicity my family is sacred i agree said julia leaving all her pastry and lighting a cigarette at which hermione looked pained until the pudding of guavaandmango icecream with kiwifruit purée reduced her almost to orgasm guy however was incensed that a bottle of barsac had gone missing flora whipped it confessed georgie its a good thing shes going back to bagley hall next month to dry out whoops sorry miss bottomley ben pursed his red lips and said he thoroughly disapproved of teenage drinking miss bottomleys mouth was too full of guava and mango for her to do anything but nod in frenzied agreement oh floras sixteen going on a hundred sighed georgie to rannaldini i get so worried about aids i sat her down last week and said we must have a good talk about sex the room fell silent a good talk about sex because i was worried went on georgie and flora put her pretty head on one side and said oh poor mum are you having trouble with dad georgie laughed so loudly at the sheer impossibility of such a thing that everyone joined in but it was one of the few light moments of the evening georgie was dying to get into another hearttothumpingheart with rannaldini but without a waitress she seemed to spend her whole time leaping up to remove plates and filling glasses it was a relief finally to whisk the ladies off upstairs on the way miss bottomley shot into the downstairs ill use this one julie disappeared into another loo on the landing whereupon hermione vanished into georgies bathroom three old ladies got stuck in the lavatory i wish hermione would stay there georgie collapsed on to her bed between marigold and kitty now were alone how are you she asked wonderful said marigold fluffing on facepowder with a red brush larrys faynally given nikki the push and pelham crescent it cost over a million can you imagine but hes bein magic to me he bought me these she turned her head to show off ruby earrings big as strawberries and hes going to buy me a flat in london and take me on a second honeymoon in jamaica lucky you said georgie petulantly thinking of herself nailed to the desk for months to come im so pleased for you marigold said kitty who didnt feel there was much point in repairing her face hows lysander asked georgie never off the telephone the sweetiepay hes raydin in a pointtopoint in cheshire this weekend and wants me to go ay must say im sorely tempted when they went downstairs larry who normally liked nothing better than to cap other mens achievements over a large glass of brandy had already joined the ladies what recession he was saying to sabine bottomley if youre liquid its bonanza time you can pick up companies like shopping in oxford street fed up with talking about wife avoidance marigold asked him teasingly not at all rannaldini bob and meredith all wanted to know what guy had done to those quails not my boardgame he sat down on the arm of marigolds chair this is though he took her hand then added to georgie dont she look great see the earrings i bought her theyre lovely hows the album going good said georgie truthfully i wrote a song today looking at the big red scented candle flickering on a side table she suddenly found the answer for her lyric swept by tempests drenched by rain ill come burning back again could we play one of your old albums georgie asked kitty as der rosenkavalier finally ended wait till rannaldini goes said hermione georgie gritted her teeth to gain the ascendancy before he left larry bought three of julias paintings and actually wrote guy a large cheque bob egged on by the most beautiful voice in the world put down a deposit on one of the smaller ones rannaldini bought the most erotic and said hed talk to guy about money later proudly guy went round putting red stickers on them julia was in heaven she didnt say much but her skin flushed faintly like the crimsoning on the underside of a wood anemone larry and marigold left immediately afterwards they were followed by rannaldini who was flying to milan first thing to do the barber of seville at la scala just for a second as he and georgie were alone in the hall together he took her hands id love to talk to you sometime about floras career she heard herself stammering of course said rannaldini let us have lunch and then we will have a chance to talk about ourselves she felt he was just about to kiss her when kitty came out saying what a lovely evening it had been and that georgie and guy must come over to valhalla next time rannaldini was home georgie had the feeling that with the departure of his boss bob would have liked to stay on and unwind but that for the same reason hermione felt the evening had lost all point and dragged him away look after julia guy called out briskly to georgie im taking ben and meredith round the house georgie was a little alarmed about what grand redecorating schemes meredith might lure him into but it was bliss to kick off her shoes throw another of their own logs on the fire and relax with a bottle of kümmel and julia how beautiful both marigold and hermione are said julia id so love to paint either of them feeling slightly deflated julia didnt want to paint her georgie suggested julia approached them through larry and bob they both obviously love your work and larrys on such a high with marigold at the moment hed commission anything i do hope it lasts georgie collapsed on the floor so she was level with dinsdale on the sofa larrys been such a shit to her im sorry i was so uptight this evening but two couples cancelled at the last moment because their marriages had gone up the spout julia had chewed off her lipstick and her eyeliner had smudged beneath the foxbrown eyes but her skin was unlined in the candlelight and the scorpion glinted evilly between her breasts as though it might plunge its sting into the soft white flesh at any moment she must be scorpio that most passionate and complicated of signs thought georgie im so lucky to be married to guy she went on hazily i used to be very wild when we were first married and a bit now she thought luxuriating at the prospect of lunch with rannaldini i think guy feels so much safer now im tucked away in the country even when i used to go into the west end from hampstead he used to police my every move dinsdale halfasleep grunted with pleasure as georgie scratched his back guys been so wonderful about my career she went on so happy to bask in any reflected glory but hes going to get glory himself soon not just your exhibition which im sure will be terrific but because of rock star i know the scorpions a rag but theyve nominated guy hubby of the year and if he wins he gets ten thousand pounds i expect guy will insist on it going to charity but it means hell be a star in his own right its lovely that people have started recognizing him in the street and asking him for his autograph julias eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger its so sad when marriages break up you hang on to your ben urged georgie then thought i dont think she should at all hes ghastly i must be pissed as she refilled their glasses she noticed an adorable china puppy tangled in blue ribbon clambering out of a flowered bowl among the ornaments on a side table how lovely victorian she examined it i wonder where that came from geraldine and the girls from the gallery gave it to me as a movingin present said a returning guy smoothly i kept forgetting to bring it home the puppys exactly like dinsdale said georgie enchanted how clever of geraldine saying they must go ben bore off julia and meredith whom they were going to drop off on the way nice arent they said guy gathering up glasses juliets lovely said georgie not sure about him though shes called julia said guy and bens a genius the next morning guy and georgie were woken ridiculously early by the telephone leave it mumbled guy someone might have died well i wish theyd die later in the day the sleepy smile was wiped off georgies face when she found it was hermione too lazy to write but priding herself on her good manners thank you for a pleasant evening we so enjoyed meeting julia armstrong hermione wanted recipes of everything guy had cooked anyone would think hed had a baby or landed on mars thought georgie irritably then before ringing off she announced sabine bottomley has asked me out to lunch she doesnt seem like a sabine thought georgie as she put back the receiver shes the one whod do the raping for a few moments she tried to burrow like a mole back into the dark furry tunnel of sleep but guy was stroking her breasts and putting increasing pressure on her clitoris like a stiff button on the cordless telephone until grumbling georgie lumbered out of bed muttering that she must clean her teeth and wash but guy pulled her back i want you now head turned and mouth clamped shut to divert garlicandwine fumes she admired her bobbing body in a long dusty mirror wondering if she should move more and tried to remember to grip guy with her inside muscles she found it hard to come unless she was still and concentrating on her orgasm beneath her guy looked tired his face rumpled and his whiteblond fringe fallen back off his forehead tell me about the last time you went to bed with tancredi he whispered so georgie told him about the last time guy thought she had been to bed with tancredi afterwards he said im sorry that was selfish of me and he brought her breakfast in bed with grape hyacinths in a little vase only able to keep down the coffee georgie buttered the croissant for dinsdale when she staggered down hungover to the hairline everything had been cleared up and once again she realized how lucky she was to be married to guy her rock star she felt less chipper when she opened their joint bank statement the outgoings had been horrific and had almost mopped up the massive advance from catchitune the advance on ant and cleo had been spent months ago conciliatory before a screw brisk afterwards guy was waving the bank managers letter and just getting into his musttightenourbelts routine when all worry temporarily evaporated because the scorpion rang to say guy had been voted hubby of the year to be quite honest there wasnt a lot of choice the reporter confided to georgie faithful husbands are an endangered species can we come and interview you and him tomorrow for mondays paper at least the house had been bulled up for the dinner party so guy didnt have to spend the rest of the day tidying sunday was a lovely day after the reporter left they sat watching an orange sun setting like a tiger down the black bars of the wood listening to the top twenty on radio i apprehensive almost to the end until they heard the opening bars of dancer maitlands recession blues at number two and knew it hadnt knocked georgie off the number one spot when rock star came on guy turned up the wireless so it blared round paradise im so proud of you panda he said opening the only bottle of dom perignon left from the dinner party i wish i could really tell you how much i love you said georgie then in a brief twilight wander round the garden guy outlined his longterm plans for the house and garden a new heaven and a new earth murmured georgie she must get on with ant and cleo tomorrow to pay for it guy was in amorous mood again at bedtime dont be too long he urged georgie but georgie got stuck into the penguin book of narrative poetry in the bath and by the time shed finished the pied piper marvelling at brownings gift for rhyme particularly as there were no rhyming dictionaries in those days guy was snoring with the light on next morning he set off for london in his new bmw looking splendid his bluestriped shirt and indigo tie brought out the light messianicblue of his eyes as if he was some explorer setting out to discover new continents noticing his beautifully brushed pinstripe jacket and his cases in the back and breathing in his english fern aftershave as she hugged him goodbye georgie felt utterly desolate at being left on her own for five days flora was away staying with friends but it would be nice to watch what she wanted on television not tidy up and work all night if she felt like it it had rained heavily in the night and where the valley was drying off mist the same blue as guys eyes drifted upwards georgie wondered how far away julia armstrong lived and if she sent up smoke signals to some lover she couldnt be in love with that fearful ben georgie was just looking at the scorpion headline caring guy the hunky hubby when she realized hed forgotten to take the little hockney drawing to be framed for floras birthday which was on sunday ringing him she found his car telephone engaged he must hardly have reached the outskirts of paradise but it remained engaged for the next thirty minutes georgie was distracted by her agent ringing saying the gas board were definitely firming up the offer for her and guy to do a commercial and that a champagne firm had rung to check out georgies availability better pay us in kind after friday night said georgie remembering it was dustbin day and mother courage wasnt due for half an hour georgie started to empty the wastepaper baskets in the basket in guys study she found a pink envelope torn up into pieces smaller than confetti was it practising for this that one did so many jigsaws as a child thought georgie having laboriously pieced the envelope together she saw it was addressed to guy seymour private at the gallery i must not let it put me off my work she told herself sternly women have always had crushes on guy look at the way kitty rannaldini goes scarlet every time he speaks to her all the same she jumped as though shed been caught snooping when the telephone rang it was london weekend asking how she was getting on with ant and cleo and whether there was anything they could see its going really well but its still in draft form georgie told them airily but starting to shake after theyd rung off she decided to look for act one perhaps guy had picked it up his study was so tidy she was frightened of disrupting anything opening a desk drawer searching for a sheaf of manuscript paper she stumbled on the most charming nude drawing of a girl in a primroseyellow bath cap with except for the full breasts a long slim almost childish body it was a second before georgie realized it was julia the drawing was unsigned but it didnt have the narroweyed scowling intense look of a selfportrait it was perfectly normal for guy to buy drawings of artists he exhibited but georgie nevertheless felt her happiness seep away like water out of a crooked plughole there was the bloody telephone how was she getting on in the country asked the girl from the daily mail was she meeting lots of interesting people i dont meet people down here i meet fucking deadlines snarled georgie then had to apologize to the reporter who knew what hell deadlines were and who congratulated her on guy being voted hubby of the year and asked if she could do a telephone interview with her about guy feeling guilty that shed been harbouring jealous thoughts about pink envelopes and nudes georgie was even more glowing about her husband than usual the rest of the week was punctuated by thankyou letters for the dinner party praising guys cooking not to be outdone georgie wasted a whole workday making a fish pie for guys return on friday night putting the first bluebells in his study and his dressing room she welcomed him with clean hair and a rust angora jersey which he loved because it made her feel all soft and cuddly as he came out on to the terrace after unpacking he handed her the evening standard theyve given julias exhibition a terrific advance plug i brought it down to show you god its beautiful here a week of sun had brought out the wild cherries and palest gold crisscross leaves like kisses on the willows from you have i been absent in the spring murmured guy sliding his hands up under the rust angora will that deliciously smelling fish pie keep for half an hour next day was just as beautiful and georgie decided to walk down to paradise with dinsdale trying out the new path that had been hacked out through the wood on either side trees soared tall and gangling from being planted too close many of them were smothered to the top in ivy georgie noticed how many of the trunks had been daubed with silver paint which meant they would soon be cut down to make more room for the others georgie felt really sad some of the condemned were really splendid trees happily putting out palest green leaves unaware of their fate would that make a theme for a song she was about to scribble the idea on the back of her shopping list when she realized shed left it behind and calling to dinsdale who was baying in the woods after rabbits ran back home climbing back in through the low kitchen window she found guy on the telephone all alone in a huge house he was sighing god if only you were here then seeing georgie without missing a beat he said im sorry you must have got the wrong number this is not ok no problem and hanging up hallo panda what did you forget georgie collapsed astride the window because her trembling legs wouldnt hold her up who were you talking to wrong number but i heard you saying you were alone in a huge house and if only whoever it was was here i beg your pardon guys mouth gave a little pop of incredulity as he pronounced the b of beg his eyes were as innocent as a kittens guy i heard you are you out of your mind if i get a wrong number you accuse me of having other women youre spending too much time on your own ask kitty over to supper next week or get some pills from the local doctor benson hes called everyone swears by him such was his assurance that georgie felt she was the one in the wrong she ought to have left well alone but she was badly frightened who were you spending thirty minutes talking to on the telephone within seconds of leaving the house on monday then harry replied guy calmly i was bringing him up to date about selling all those armstrongs and talking about a couple of british impressionists rannaldinis after he is my partner and we had a lot to catch up on i had a week off moving you and a friday off to organize your dinner party you asked julia and ben no stay outside darling ill be with you in a sec georgie added as dinsdales lugubrious face appeared at the window and who sent that pink envelope marked private which you tore up and threw in your wastepaper basket i havent a clue snapped guy sliding a squeezedout dishcloth along the runnels of the sink geraldine and the girls in the gallery probably sent it as a joke he extracted a piece of bacon rind and fish skin both of which she supposed she should have removed from last nights fish pie from the plughole and what about the charming nude of julia she hissed that does it said guy losing his temper you said you liked julia so i kept back that little nude for you for easter itll be worth a lot one day and i know how you like women he added nastily georgie flushed in her wild sixties days she and tancredi had had the odd threesome with other girls and dont you get turned on hearing about it she said furiously the row escalated until georgie burst into tears and said she was sorry then guy apologized he hadnt meant to be ratty but he was worried about their overdraft we must pull in our horns cuckolds have horns thought georgie as she hugged him in passionate relief she was particularly glad the row was made up because flora was coming home on sunday for her birthday before going back to bagley hall for the summer term in the evening having forgotten to get the hockney framed guy gave her a cheque instead georgie gave her a sandcoloured shorts suit from jigsaw which shed wanted dinsdale whod been decked out in a big blue bow for the occasion gave her a basket from the body shop i dont want to go back grumbled flora chucking all the clothes which were marginally more crumpled after mother courage had ironed them into her trunk and putting two hundred marlboros on the top ought you to take these asked georgie youll ruin your voice do try and do some work darling and dont get caught drinking you know how it upsets daddy guy had seldom looked less upset as he walked in goodness what a shambles he said panda thats worked out really well you remember that old boy in wales whose private collection hasnt been looked at for fifty years hes just rung hes going abroad tomorrow but hes invited me up to stay at the local and have dinner with him tonight oh a jaunt said georgie in excitement ill come with you you can if you like guy didnt sound too enthusiastic but hes an old queen and doesnt like women so id better go on my own as i had to book at the last moment i only got a single room when we were first married we slept on sofas said georgie sadly darling be reasonable youve got to work and someones got to look after dinsdale will you come back here on the way to london georgie hated to plead i really ought to get up first thing and bash up the motorway said guy removing one of his favourite jerseys from floras trunk ive got a lunchtime meeting with an american collector i can take flora back to bagley on the way to wales so get your finger out he added to flora georgie worked late that night until she was so tired that she slept through a massive thunderstorm which blew down several of the silverpainted trees in the wood then she had a marvellous mornings work joyfully playing the piano singing scribbling and rubbing out she could hear all the themes of the individual instruments in her head and she kept doing different things to prove to herself that what shed written in the first place was the right thing by a quarterpast one shed drunk so much black coffee she was beginning to jump so she went down to the kitchen to get some lunch mother courage had already left so she decided to cook that oxs heart for dinsdale as she was looking for it the telephone rang it was geraldine from the gallery you dont know where guy is his lunch dates arrived and his car phones on the blink i rang the leek and daffodil they said he checked out at eightthirty oh help said georgie going cold you dont think hes had a shunt no probably a tree across the road or something they had force ten gales in wales last night will you ring me when he gets in sure hows the country bliss while youre on geraldine you might be able to help me a lovely puppy vase with blue ribbons turned up in the move someone must have sent it to us as a movingin present or to me for going to number one youve no idea who it could be havent a clue sounds lovely though said geraldine i must go and forcefeed moët to guys disgruntled lunch date heart thumping georgie collapsed on the windowseat guy who was so truthful he made george washington look like matilda had been caught out in a second lie first the wrong number now the puppy coming from geraldine feeling dizzy and sick she found she had thrown all todays post in the dustbin loathing herself she rang directory enquiries and then the leek and daffodil im awfully sorry this is georgie seymour oh mrs seymour gushed the manageress im so glad you rang were such fans and it was lovely the way your husband signed you in under another name we all thought you looked so young and lovely i expect youre ringing about your scorpion necklace thats right said georgie numbly my daughter found it in the bed if you give me the right address ill post it back to you its angels reach paradise lost said georgie and hung up in the exhibitions in progress file in guys office she found a formal letter from julia and dialled her number shes not back from wales said a voice with a strong rutshire accent i was expecting her hours ago whos that speaking but georgie had hung up again her first emotion was passionate relief that she hadnt been going crazy thinking guy was up to something hed always been so adamant about his utter fidelity and now hed been caught out wondering what to do next georgie decided to drive over to julias and confront her it couldnt be very far with a rutshire address shadow cottage miles lane eldercombe said the letterhead on the way it started to bucket down again georgie got terribly lost and nearly bumped into several cars but finally she found the ravishing stanley spencer village with a lazy weedchoked stream meandering between the high street and the faded red cottages the rain had driven everyone in so there was noone to ask the way on the right of the war memorial she found miles lane getting out of the car georgie realized dinsdale was still wearing his blue birthday bow and whipped it off putting her belt through his collar as she started to trudge through the deluge she hoped miles lane wasnt miles long and wished she knew on which side was shadow cottage but the next moment dinsdales nose had gone down and sweeping her past three modern houses tail waving frantically he took a sharp right up the path of the prettiest garden filled with scillas primulas and early forgetmenots toys were neatly stacked on a table in the window and someone had left a paperbill addressed to armstrong in the porch dinsdales tail was really going bashing georgies legs the door was answered by an elderly woman in a red mac and a crinkly plastic rain hat mrs armstrong asked georgie no shes out it was the same rutshire accent that had answered the telephone im mrs seymour georgie tried to control her breathing guys wife hes putting on an exhibition of mrs armstrongs work oh right the woman in the rain hat looked suddenly more friendly you must be georgie maguire weve got all your records at home can i have your autograph somehow georgie held the pen to sign the piece of paper im expecting julia any minute shes so excited about her exhibition shes just rung shes been eld up four hours on the severn bridge there were cross winds so they reduced the traffic to single line ive just got to pop out and pick up the kids if you want to wait she wont be long that woman doesnt know anything about guy and julia thought georgie watching her splashing down the path perhaps im imagining things julias cottage was absolutely gorgeous inside a rainbow riot of pastel colour with her paintings on every wall if shes taken my husband thought georgie im entitled to help myself to her drink there was only elderflower wine but it was better than nothing georgie took a slug then opened the desk by the window and nearly died for there were a sheaf of rock star cuttings and the same express picture of guy in a handsome silver frame slamming the desk shut georgie was pleased to see dinsdale had left muddy pawmarks all over julias pale blue sofa and when the telephone rang she answered it ju ju said guys voice no its georgie for a few seconds guy thought he had rung home by mistake panda hallo he said cheerfully ive only just got to london i was stuck on the severn bridge for four hours im at julias said georgie quite matteroffactly how long have you been having an affaire with her desperate to wriggle out of the situation guy found his mind moving as sluggishly as maggots in a dustbin surprised by a torrent of boiling jeyes fluid all he could manage was a feeble are you mad youre the mad one mad about julia georgies voice rose to a screech you bastard geraldine didnt give you that puppy and you took ju jufuckingarmstrong to the leek and daffodil last night and passed her off as me you look so lovely and young mrs seymour you left your scorpion necklace behind mrs seymour and theyve put it in the post to me at angels reach so you havent got a clay foot to stand on how longs it been going on there was a long pause during which guy decided against bluffing it out well ive taken her out once or twice in london bed not before last night im sorry panda weve been working very hard getting ready for the exhibition these things happen shes only a child and shes got this terrific crush on me probably because her marriage isnt very happy and im getting her work recognized and you know how gratitude turns into heroworship dad had it all the time as a bishop i hope he didnt end up in the leek and daffodil do you want to marry her of course i dont look shell be home any minute dont say anything thatll encourage her to blow it up into anything more serious youve got to protect me go home and ill come down im leaving now i love you how dare you bring dinsdale into this bordello shouted georgie she got even more lost on the way home the torrential rain had let up rainbows were lacing a sky the colour of guys cornflowerblue shirt the white cherries were luminous in the unearthly light only when she got home did georgie realize she was still wearing her pyjamas georgie was so shivery that she had a bath and was just cleaning her teeth to get rid of the terrible sick acid taste when the doorbell rang running to the window she could see hair as red as dried blood it was julia she must find out if her version tallied with guys throwing up the window she said shed be down in a minute having pulled on an old grey jersey and a pair of leggings brushed her hair and slapped on a bit of base she was amazed to see she looked rather beautiful scent she decided was pushing it she would play the whole thing magnanimously running downstairs she saw julia in the hall dressed in jeans and a black poloneck her hair was pulled back from her deathly white face into a ponytail she looked younger than flora georgie held out her arms julia poor little duck im so sorry dont touch me julia thrust her violently away well at least lets have a drink only as they went into the drawing room did georgie remember julias faceless pinstripe lover in the paintings two of the paintings were still on the wall i dont want a drink julia was shuddering as though she had malaria her eyes staring how much has guy told you that he went to bed with you for the first time last night that hes taken you out one or twice in london guys a kind man girls are always getting crushes on him a crush julia collapsed on the gold corduroy sofa guy and i have been having an affaire for nearly two years since you moved to angels reach weve spent virtually every night together when hes up in london virtue doesnt seem to have much to do with it said georgie pouring herself such a massive bacardi that there was only room for an inch of coke he loves me said julia flatly hes never had another woman since hes been married to you i know admitted georgie hes been a wonderful husband and youve totally neglected him all you did at that dinner party reproved julia was burn the broccoli and leave slugs in the lettuce guys been sneaking thought georgie taking her drink to the window and admiring the pale green of the wood against the navyblue thunderclouds you dont take any interest in the gallery you didnt even know my christian name i hope now i may call you ju ju said georgie gravely she was getting rather a charge out of being bitchy the bacardi was beginning to put fire in her empty belly you dont share any of his interests said julia flushing well i certainly didnt share his interest in you and you had endless affaires i did not i had the odd onenight stand when we were first married years ago said georgie thinking that tancredi had been going on so long and so infrequently that he didnt count dinsdale was slumped on a coralpink chair on the other side of the empty fireplace which still contained the ashes from the dinner party georgie crossed the room to sit on the arm i had a wonderfully happy marriage with ben julia was saying bitterly guy pestered and pestered me to sleep with him ben used to joke about it and call him my dirty old man finally i gave in because i felt sorry for him he seemed so lonely and bored with his marriage and now ive fallen in love with him and hes totally fucked my marriage and you too by all accounts georgie was nettled by the dom reference she was the only person allowed to slag off guy i cant imagine him pestering anyone guy and i love each other bored husbands dont police their wives every moment you stupid idiot said julia almost pityingly the reason why guy polices your every move when youre in london is because he doesnt want you to bump into him and me fumbling in the back pocket of her jeans julia brought out a red diary look she turned the pages georgie recording georgie promo georgie recording georgie in america that was a bonus the green pentelled arrow went through two weeks in february and into march guy told you he couldnt leave the gallery it was me he couldnt bear to leave heres the key to guys flat like a hypnotist she swung it in front of georgies nose do you need a key said georgie taking another great gulp of bacardi to fortify herself i would have expected you to come in through the cat flap stop taking the piss screamed julia and how does ben fit into this asked georgie taking dinsdales ginger ears and putting them on top of his head like a second world war pinup is his software not hard enough for you ben works in chelmsford said julia through gritted teeth and hes abroad selling computers all week it wasnt difficult the writing on the pink envelope georgie examined the diary again its yours of course and i gave him the china puppy for his birthday and when hes in the country he rings me the whole time when he goes for petrol for the mower when hes having drinks with the vicar julia was hissing down a bobsleigh run now and couldnt stop i saw angels reach before you did she stammered we slept in the spare room when you were in london with the mail on sunday letting dinsdales ears fall georgie shut her eyes and breathed in the anaesthetic of shock was beginning to wear off getting to her feet she tried to gather the shattered rags of dignity round her i dont believe a word youre saying guy isnt like this she felt strengthened by the sight of headlights in the drive and by dinsdales thick tail whacking her thighs once again guy was home she was so desperate to run to him that the bad dream should be over he called me his second peregrine said julia quietly georgie stopped in her tracks the knittingneedle dipped in acid plunged straight into her heart he what his second peregrine peregrine had been a schoolfriend guy had loved at wellington the one great unconsummated passion of his life when peregrine had drowned falling out of a punt at some wild cambridge party guy confessed that it was only his faith that had kept him from suicide it was this sadness and the fact that for ages he didnt make a pass at her that had drawn georgie to him when theyd first met peregrine was sacrosanct a love georgie respected and of which she had never been jealous ive got letters to prove it and photographs guy took of me in the nude sobbed julia hardly conclusive evidence unless hes in them too said georgie as guy came through the door he looked sulky and aggressive like a small boy caught stealing sweets it seems your affaire with mrs armstrong is more extended than youve admitted guy pursed his lips and looked proconsular well if she says it is she does georgie moved towards the drinks table if you care to come upstairs with me ju ju and look into a suitcase under guyguys bed youll find a large folder of photographs guys taken of me with nothing on some i hate to tell you with angels reach in the background you said you never slept with her julia turned screaming at guy ah but then he told me hed only been to bed with you once i think you two ought to get your stories straight grabbing the bacardi bottle georgie turned to guy youre a fucking hypocrite and im leaving you tomorrow im going to sleep in the spare room on the kitchen table she discovered a note mother courage had left earlier georgie change in the envelope heart in the deep freeze upstairs in the spare room georgie felt boiling hot she took off her clothes and crawled under the duvet then she remembered that this was where guy had slept with julia it was the repository of all their worst furniture even a china alsatian which flora had won at the fair on hampstead heath at the age of eight on the windows were ghastly curtains put up by a previous occupant which clashed with the equally ghastly wallpaper would guy have explained that this room hadnt been done yet or had he been too busy bonking she gave a groan and took a huge slug of bacardi shed ring the ideal homo and order new curtains tomorrow morning but what was the point when she was leaving anyway seeing the reflection of her flushed face on the pillow she realized the mirror on the dressing table had been adjusted so that you could see what was going on in bed guyd always liked watching himself she heard a car starting up and rushing to the window saw julias car lighting up the little green beacons of the poplar colonnade whore she screamed after her and was so plastered and furious that she rushed downstairs in the nude and went completely berserk first she smashed julias puppy and then she rushed into the kitchen and started breaking glasses stop it guy came rushing in dont be infantile julias a complete fantasist its all lies she knows my diary better than i do and what about fucking peregrine or rather fucking your second peregrine you bastard georgies yelling face was like a tomato that had been hurled at a rock guy ducked as a pint mug hurtled towards him finally having taken down one of julias paintings and tried to smash it over guys head its you in the pinstripe suit you disgusting lech georgie raced off into the night in panic guy rang larry who was in the middle of making love to marigold julia came down and dumped christ said larry who when he was with nikki had made up several foursomes at dinner with julia and guy it was all much too close to home were off to jamaica in a few hours he added or id say come on over are you ok no im not georgies run off bollocknaked into the night no sweat said larry snows forecast shell come home when shes cold but what if people in the village see her spluttered guy the road goes straight past the vicarage theres a meeting to discuss my election to the parish council on friday larry tried not to laugh id put your feet up watch the boxing and have a large scotch i cant georgies broken every glass in the house and plate too for that matter people who live in cotswoldstone houses shouldnt throw glasses said larry at least it shows she cares take her away for a little holiday guys mistress has come down and dumped he told marigold as he switched off the telephone and took her in his arms guys got a mistress said marigold collapsing back on her ivory silk pillows in amazement ay cant believe it gays not laike that hes so upraight georgie must be shattered its plates that are being shattered shes throwing them at guy said larry not displeased that guy who was always so sanctimonious had been caught with his hand in the sexual till oh poor georgie marigold climbed back on top of her husband then gave a shriek of anguish as she impaled herself on his upright cock oh may god whats the matter princess said larry in alarm are you still sore down there no theyre our plates wailed marigold they were a matchin set ay lent to georgie for the dinner party sitting in the kitchen guy lined up all the milk bottles mother courage never put out on the kitchen table so georgied have something to smash when she came home georgie actually burst out laughing when she saw them then the laughter turned to tears and although they rowed most of the night in between sobbing on each others shoulders guy felt by morning that he had calmed georgie down enough to go back to london ill call you the moment i get to london he promised but as she waved him off georgie felt like demeter seeing persephone disappear into the underworld slowly she began to piece together the horrors of the previous night one moment she was freezing the next boiling hot she kept putting on and taking off jerseys she still couldnt get rid of the sick taste in her mouth mother courage had laid out a page from the sunday telegraph under the cats plate as georgie emptied a tin of choosy on to it she noticed a large piece by peregrine worsthorne about john major you dont call a child who wont leave you alone your second peregrine thought georgie and felt so furious she rushed into guys study and put a message on the ansaphone saying go screw yourself then she put on another jersey and cleaned her teeth again she felt she was rotting inside half an hour later mother courage came storming up the drive ive just had mr seymour on the telephone he cant get through can you ring him urgent sulkily georgie dialled guy at the gallery what the hell are you playing at panda thundered guy youre totally overreacting what happens if the press ring or even worse the vicar or lady chisleden i dont care screamed georgie out of the window she saw that a sudden fall of snow had covered the sweet spring promise of the primroses and burst into tears the marriage limped on full of spats guy came down at midday on good friday looking wretched and carrying a box of glasses to replace the ones you threw at me he said heavily then priding himself on his frugality from the reject shop why dont you put me in the window snarled georgie unable to suppress a craving for information that guy was plainly not going to volunteer georgie asked if hed seen julia we spoke briefly on the telephone said guy who had his back to her at the drinks table ive talked to harry and because weve sent out the invites and done a lot of press lobbying and advertising weve decided to go ahead with her exhibition did julia mention me asked georgie we didnt discuss you said guy crushingly pouring half an inch of whisky into one of his new glasses harry will deal with julia from now on but i shall obviously have to attend the private view thought youd viewed her enough in private dont be petty julia wants us to be friends as much as we can be shed like you to be there as well if he says to err is human to forgive divine i shall scream thought georgie to err began guy im not gracing her private view said georgie flatly just because she needs a celeb to pull in the press that is the most horrible remark ive ever heard said guy its my gallery and i make fifty per cent out of every sale i would have thought you would have wanted to attract the press and georgie had promptly burst into tears and run out of the house as she ran down the path guy had cut out of the wood for her she heard the cuckoo for the first time the angelic third floating through the trees unpleasing to a married ear cuckoo cuckoo sobbed georgie ahead lay valhalla she was tempted to dump on poor kitty rannaldini who had been endlessly cuckolded and survived just but as rannaldini might be there who would be amused rather than sympathetic she stumbled on there had never been anything like the pain wandering aimlessly she arrived home to find the bmw gone the red sun was disappearing over the horizon a cricketball hit for six like guy over ju ju sunsets were only bearable because the sun would rise again tomorrow if guy never came back shed die leaping into her ancient golf she set out to look for him she didnt have to go as far as eldercombe there was the bmw crookedly parked in the churchyard which in the twilight was still lit by daffodils the church was decked for easter breathing in the smell of narcissi and furniture polish georgie saw guy slumped over the front pew head bowed on clasped hands when she touched his shoulder his face was streaming with tears oh panda he sobbed ive made such a cockup of my life but i love you so much please dont leave me georgie pulled his head against her belly its ok i love you too i nearly died when i saw the car gone i thought youd gone to her never never never stumbling out of the church they stopped to kiss each other in the doorway and were seen by a photographer who worked for the rutminster news on his way home from football on monday morning the scorpion printed a picture of the happiest couple in england the truce was fleeting in the weeks that followed guy talked of commuting but he never did the weight fell off georgie who tried to glam herself up when he came home but however quick she was in the bath he was asleep by the time she came to bed georgie was distraught she couldnt stop crying and unable to believe guys protestations that he wasnt seeing julia any more she felt as venomous and rejected as ragwort in a field of cows not only had she lost her hero and her best friend but her image of herself as a nice person which guys great imagined love had given her the rows were terrible with georgie boozing and ranting into the night then apologizing in panic in case shed gone too far and guy really would leave her the wastage was awful too milk going sour because it wasnt taken in dinsdale getting the casserole mother courage had made for the weekend which noone had touched fuzzy potatoes on their third day in a saucepan of water black volcanic shapes discovered in the aga days later and all the vegetables leaking in the rack even dinsdale finally went off his food the press were also sniffing around so many marriages were breaking up they wanted to know the secret of a happy one ignorance georgie told the scorpion in an unguarded moment on automatic pilot she managed to go up to london talk about rock star on aspel open a supermarket and have a long session with the whizzkid producer who was revamping some of her old songs for the new catchitune album rock star still topped the charts but every time she heard this celebration of guys dependability on the radio she felt sick she also had to live through the nightmare of julias exhibition she didnt go to the private view guy didnt want any more glasses smashed but there was a large piece in you magazine julia from the photographs had cut her hair and now had a head of russet curls rather like the bubbles painting there is a wistful air about lovely julia armstrong ran the copy slim as a boy more like the first peregrine than ever thought georgie savagely but it made her realize how awful it must be for julia reading about her and guy all the time poor guy wasnt having much fun either julias paintings had sold well but the art market had taken a dive and hed also bought a couple of minor french impressionists for a property developer whod suddenly called in the receiver guy was left with the bill but he could have put up with business being so awful and georgies tantrums and the nightmare of his marriage if hed still had julia to lighten his darkness he missed her terribly it broke his heart when she rang up and tearfully pleaded with him to see her nor were his men friends any help larry in his nowmarried bliss in jamaica showed no interest in buying guys paintings but insisted on being incredibly sanctimonious if i can give up nikki why cant you give up julia shes refusing to give me up get an answering machine thatll stop the dropped telephone calls ive got an answeringback machine at home said guy its called georgie rannaldini was vastly amused by the whole thing find another mistress dear boy there are plenty more fishwives in the sea guy was fed up how could he find anyone else he was desperately strapped for cash there were all those pretty separated women who made warm eyes at him at gallery parties and in church on sunday but he could hardly afford to buy them a drink in the old days both julia and georgie had adored him told him he was marvellous and asked his opinion on absolutely everything two loves had he of comfort and comfort now they were both displaying all the venom of tabloid newspapers denied an exclusive hell certainly knew no fury like two women scorned guy felt like a worm done over by a blackbird georgie couldnt work there had been no rain in paradise for weeks and as the springs that had hurtled past her study window when they moved in had dried up so had her inspiration trailing through st peters churchyard with dinsdale towards the end of may she noticed queen anne was losing her lace and the wild garlic its flowers there were white petals everywhere and yellowing leaves flattened probably by lovers but not by her georgies eyes were so full of tears she didnt see kitty rannaldini approaching with her arms full of huge scented pink peonies to decorate the church ow are you georgie seeing she was plainly not all right and not knowing what to say kitty added come and ave dinner on monday about one oclock arriving at angels reach on monday morning mother courage persuaded georgie not to cry off nice girl that kitty rattledicky gives her the run around shell have cooked you something nice do you good to fatten yourself up seven stone twelve on the scales this morning said georgie getting thin was the only good this terminally ill wind seemed to blow her make a nice day out for you encouraged mother courage with georgie gone she could help herself to the gin and slope off early be a tonic only if she adds vodka said georgie gloomily however id quite like to see inside valhalla its aunted said mother courage getting a black dustbin bag out of the cupboard i dont know ow kitty can sleep there on her own she ought to get the vicar in to circumcise the ghost mind you that rattledickys pretty spooky in his watch tower hes got one of them jujitzu baths had guy ever had a ju jujitzu bath with julia wondered georgie at twentythree kitty rannaldini was exactly half her husbands age and his better half according to most people who knew them brought up in the suburbs of london she had had a strict but happy childhood her father had been nearing retirement as a station master when she was born and her mother who took in ironing and minded other peoples children had been in her forties every sunday kitty had been taken to st augustines church round the corner which her mother had cleaned for nothing nowhere else had brass gleamed more brightly an industrious rather than a bright pupil kitty had left school with eight o levels at sixteen and taught herself to type the family were staunch tories the only time kitty remembered a bottle of wine being opened at home was when mrs thatcher first became prime minister so it was natural that as well as the guides and the youth club kitty should have joined the young conservatives where she met a local bank clerk called keith to whom she was engaged when she went to work as a temp for rannaldini it took rannaldini less than a week to realize kittys genius as a secretary he was in the middle of a production of rigoletto everyone was walking out writs were flying around like valhalla bats at dusk in twentyfour hours kitty somehow restored order she was not only meticulous conscientious unobtrusive worked till she dropped and exuded an air of absolute calm but somehow by listening patiently to everyone from soloists to scene shifters and sympathizing with their problems she diffused the allout warfare exceptionally kind by nature she was very shy and cautious decisions took a lot of thought it had therefore taken rannaldini a long time to persuade her to work for him permanently involving as it did a long journey into london every day and leaving her mother to nurse a sick father one of the few impulsive acts of kittys life and she never stopped feeling guilty about it was to chuck keith and all the plans for setting up house with him and her nowwidowed mother and run off with rannaldini a week before the wedding but it was not until rannaldini promised that her mother would at least be financially provided for that kitty had agreed to leave home in fact the financial provision was never enough and kitty had to scrimp constantly on the housekeeping and take in typing rannaldini didnt know about to help her mother out beneath her calm exterior kitty was not only a worrier but an incurable romantic she admired people who were wild and freespirited and stood up for themselves although her temperament and looks conditioned her to hold back the moment her gentle heart was moved she was the softest touch in the world she didnt resent all she did for rannaldini but her greatest pleasures were the occasional hours snatched in church or in reading another chapter of danielle steel when she went to bed which was often long after midnight kitty had been desperately upset by the rumours about guy and georgie their apparent happiness had briefly restored her faith in marriage which had been shattered by the examples around her in paradise particularly her own guy was so kind thoughtful and thoroughly boyscout decent seeing how he protected georgie and did so much both at the rock star launch and at the angels reach dinner party had convinced her he was an exceptional husband being married to rannaldini kitty knew about living in someones shadow happier in the shade herself she felt it must have been difficult for a man as forceful and as charismatic as guy although shocked to hear he was having an affaire with julia she could see he might need the boost to his morale and working with someone was so seductive she had only to remember the way she had given in to rannaldini guy had looked so wretched in church recently and when he stayed praying long after the service she had noticed there were holes in the soles of both his shoes she felt he longed to talk but thought it was a weakness to dump kitty didnt judge but she felt georgie didnt look after guy as well as she might and knew whose side she was on then she met georgie trailing through the churchyard in tears and she felt so sorry for her that she asked her to lunch the boiled chicken in white sauce and the roast potatoes were now in the oven the mint lying on top of the new peas and the apple tart waiting to be warmed up kitty was a good plain cook plain in all senses of the word she thought wiping her steamedup glasses before glancing ruefully at her round sweating face in the mirror the telephone rang and she guessed it was georgie cancelling but it was guy darling kitty oh that deep commanding voice youre such a brick for having georgie to lunch im going to call you brickie shes bound to be late shes so unhappy and got everything so out of proportion please try and calm her down even on a hot brilliantly sunny day with white hawthorns exploding everywhere like grenades and cowparsley still foaming up to touch the foliage of great trees nurtured over the centuries valhalla looked sinister pigeongrey hidden from the road by a great conspirators cloak of woodland mostly evergreens the house itself had originally been built as a medieval monastery but had been considerably enlarged during the restoration the result was hshaped with rooms of all sizes on different levels and low beams and doorways which concussed every visiting male except rannaldini hurtling up the long drive because she was late and disappearing into the protective cloak of dark woodland georgie was shivering as she emerged ahead through rusty iron gates lay a mossy courtyard leading to the back of the house following the drive round the north side of the house georgie parked outside more ancient gates with omnia vincit amor written in rusty iron lettering across the top despite such an optimistic message and a charming paved path up to the front door which was overgrown with thrift moss and saxifrage and bordered by scented pale pink roses rising out of drifts of green lavender the house gazed suspicious and unwelcoming out of its narrow mullioned windows before georgie had time to tug the ancient doorbell kitty came rushing out looking comfortingly modern in a ninja turtle tshirt and an overstretched grassgreen skirt although she kissed georgie shyly she actually put her lips to her guests cheek rather than merely clanking jawbones like the rest of paradise she also hid the fact that she wasnt wild about dinsdale joining the party not in a noticing mood georgie was only aware of a trek down scrubbed winding flagstoned passages past panelling dark and shiny as treacle toffee and hung with tapestries crossed swords and the occasional family portrait to left and right she caught a glimpse of rooms with leafy jacobean ceilings and vast empty fireplaces rannaldini wanted rooms big enough for two grand pianos and sometimes entire orchestras explained kitty hastily looking the other way as dinsdale hoisted a redandwhite leg on some dark blue velvet curtains finally they reached the tidiest kitchen georgie had ever seen apart from the corkboard with the telephone numbers of rannaldinis childrens schools and a large smouldering poster of rannaldini there was nothing on any of the surfaces at all except the newly bleached and scrubbed kitchen table which was laid for two at one end at the other were two neatly stacked piles of envelopes and signed photographs of rannaldini which kitty had been sending out to fans while she waited how guy would love this house said georgie everything so wonderfully ordered and lined up she picked up one of the photographs in which rannaldini was smiling slightly a fan of wrinkles at the corner of each smouldering dark eye beautiful man murmured georgie thinking how odd that she would have secretly nicked one of the photographs had she come to lunch a couple of months ago giving a deep sigh dinsdale lumbered on to the crocusyellow windowseat which gave a glorious view of silver hayfields and sloping lawns no doubt paced over the centuries by monks wrestling with temptation rather gingerly kitty poured out georgie a large bacardi and coke and made a cup of tea for mr brimscombe whod recently been poached from larry and paradise towers by rannaldini and who was now clipping a yew peacock out of the vast dark green side of the famous valhalla maze i darent face marigold when she comes back said kitty particularly as mr brimscombes tending a cutting of the paradise pearl in the greenhouse listlessly picking up a photograph of rannaldini surrounded by adorable sloeeyed children georgie asked kitty who looked after them well cecilia thats rannaldinis second wife shes livin with a record producer at the moment hes pretty wealfy so shes got the kids wiv her and a couple of nannies but if it breaks up they might come back ere how awful shuddered georgie are they monsters theyre sweet said kitty but very italian cecilia believes kids should ave supper and go to bed when they want to and do what they like are you hungry a bit lied georgie as kitty poured white sauce on two slices of breast lovely house georgie was making heroic efforts not to talk about herself mother courage said something about a ghost i shouldnt have said that she thought as the colour drained from kittys face there was a young novice very andsome evidently mumbled kitty he died here sometimes at night i fink i hear him crying but its probably the wind georgie shivered dont you get frightened here all by yourself ive got a panic button and the burglar alarms wired up to the police station securitys very tight rannaldini dont want his furniture or pictures nicked you ought to have a dog said georgie as dinsdale lured by a delectable smell of chicken lumbered off the windowseat and took up baleful drooling residence beside her id be more scared if i ad them said kitty sitting down at the table i didnt mean to be rude to dinsdale hes ok but rannaldinis guard dogs frighten me to deaf stupid livin in the country and being terrified of dogs you ought to have someone living in rannaldini doesnt want it cecilia had a livingin nanny and when rannaldini fired her she went to the press georgie was staring into space so kitty pushed the carrots peas and mashed potato dishes forward so they were in a ring round her plate shall i elp you oh yes please georgie had finished her bacardi and coke so kitty gave her another one nice kitchen said georgie admiring the walls covered with exotic brilliantly coloured flowers snakes humming birds and monkeys like a malaysian jungle id never have dreamt of having wallpaper like this in a kitchen meredith did it said kitty but rannaldini told him what to do ouch that hurt screamed georgie as dinsdale scraped her skinny thigh with his paw leaving great white tracks guyll probably employ meredith to wallpaper over the cracks in our marriage she went on bitterly nice wife nice family nice house in the country nice bmw nice mistress he believes in the united front for the outside world she was twisting her napkin round and round try and eat georgie said kitty gently i dont mean to pry but you looked so very unhappy in the churchyard and like a burst water main georgies misery came flooding out kitty was appalled when shed finished i cant believe julia showing you her diary and telling you all those fings she was distraught on balance she probably loves guy almost more than i do but nothings ever hurt me so much in my life it must have been a sort of fatal attraction fatal distraction said georgie in despair i cant work and we sink more and more in debt ill have to pay back the advance on ant and cleo i thought i might retitle it octavia and write it from the angle of the cuckolded wife every morning georgie dripped white sauce all over the floor as she gave a piece of breast to dinsdale i read julias horoscope then guys and then mine i bet julia does the same thing then i feel sick guy and i are so terrified of touching each other we keep bumping into the furniture i know i should be sweet and loving with my legs permanently open or hell go back to her but i cant stop sniping georgie was eating nothing because she was talking so much and kitty was reduced to giving herself second and third helpings no wonder listeners got fat i dont know whats got into men said georgie despairingly theyre all at it they ought to change the name of london on the map and call it bloody adventure playground doesnt rannaldini hurt you she asked hermione must shes such a cow yes admitted kitty but i knew what he was like before i married him i love him so much georgie even a bit of him is better than nuffink an hes fortysix he might settle down one day if only we could find nice lovers down here sighed georgie as kitty removed her untouched plate but men are so dire at the moment annabel hardman went out with a quantity surveyor the other night he just lay back on the sofa said he wanted to hear all about her life from the age of two and then fell asleep then he was terrible in bed and expected her to drive him home afterwards kitty giggled and put the kettle on there didnt seem any point offering georgie apple tart but she cut a slice for a lurking mr brimscombe who was weeding the flowerbed outside what are you going to do she asked georgie its the duty of all prisoners of war to escape said georgie so id better start vaulting over a wooden horse my problem is i cant stop telling people ancient marinading i call it i think ive gone a bit mad its such a comfort to dump but you feel so disloyal afterwards and its bound to reach the press soon kittys wideset eyes behind the thick spectacles were full of tears im so sorry georgie you and guy are such lovely people i cant bear you both being so unhappy im sure youll work it out you are nice georgie hugged her im awfully worried about you being lonely in this huge place im ok natasha and wolfie come ome at weekends bringing lots of friends and you know floras coming to stay on sunday im so looking forward to meeting her are you sure said georgie she always cheers me up but its a bit of a strain having to pretend everything is ok in front of her wolfie adores her said kitty and rannaldini says shes got a wonderful voice meanwhile in counterpoint to this tragicomedy rannaldini was taking advantage of the boiling hot summer and the collapse of guys and georgies marriage to pursue flora at first he made no progress none of his witty postcards from all over the world were acknowledged flora was simply not interested she was carrying a torch for boris levitsky who was still teaching at bagley hall but looking increasingly gaunt and miserable at having left his wife she had loads of boys in the school after her she had a hankering for marcus campbellblack who was terribly shy and wrapped up in his piano playing and she much preferred the tall blond wolfgang who was now cricket captain and a year ahead of her to his father as part of his campaign rannaldini encouraged natasha to make friends with flora natasha who was feeling neglected because of her mothers affaire with the record producer was in turn gratified that rannaldini was suddenly taking so much interest in her schooling even rolling up to watch her play in a tennis match one sunday which hed never done before longing to please him she found she could always gain his attention by talking about flora how she was always climbing out of her dormitory window at night and running off to a nightclub called gaslight and how miss fagan their housemistress who was always pinging bras far from being furious looked really excited when flora streaked through the house for a bet and how flora passed her french oral the examiner asked her what her father did for a living flora said mon père est mort then he asked her what her mother did and flora said ma mère est morte aussi and burst into tears the examiner spent the rest of the exam comforting her and gave her an a it simply isnt fair shes so sexy everything falls into her lap including rannaldini who on the day natasha had a music exam offered flora tickets for a concert at the albert hall flora jumped at it anything to get out of bagley hall particularly when rannaldini sent the helicopter for her arriving at the albert hall she found queues hoping for returns coiled like an ancient lady novelists plaits round the building typically rannaldini delayed and delayed his entrance so the packed audience would be panicked into thinking he wasnt coming on when he finally appeared women didnt actually scream but they gasped cheered clapped bravoed and then swooned at the incredible beauty of rannaldinis back on the rostrum the gleaming pewter pelt emphasized the wide muscular shoulders beneath the impeccably cut midnightblue tailcoat the beautiful suntanned hands were shown off by the kittywhitened cuffs with the silver cufflinks which leonard bernstein whose showmanship if not his excessive emotion rannaldini had greatly admired had given him for his fortieth birthday and if berlioz conducted with a drawn sword rannaldini conducted with a newly sharpened cupids arrow flora was the only woman in the front row not wearing one of catchitunes yellowandpurple i love rannaldini tshirts as he mounted the rostrum she caught a whiff of maestro and the white gardenia flown in for his buttonhole wherever he conducted the programme might have been chosen for flora strausss don juan followed by his four last songs sung by hermione every time rannaldini turned to bring her in with toscaninis ivory baton the audience caught a tantalizing glimpse of his haughty profile he also took such liberties with a score branding his own personality on it so forcefully that afterwards his interpretation seemed to have become the true one you felt it couldnt be bettered and it couldnt be otherwise he and hermione took bow after bow at the end of the first half her gushing ecstasy blowing kisses and clutching cellophaned roses to her heaving bosom was in total contrast to rannaldinis cold stillness which became even colder when glancing down he saw flora engrossed in womans own strauss was followed in the second half by stravinskys the rite of spring which portrays a virgin who has been offered up for pagan sacrifice dancing herself to death and which is difficult enough to unnerve the most sophisticated orchestra having told hermione he couldnt see her later that evening because kitty was in london rannaldini had left a note at the box office with floras ticket saying that if she met him at daphnes in walton street at ten oclock he would buy her dinner whizzing through the rite of spring even faster than stravinsky himself so that toscaninis stick was a mere blur in order to get to flora sooner rannaldinis sexual excitement seemed to have transmitted itself to the orchestra at the end the audience went berserk after a performance rannaldini always left the london met rung out like a dishcloth but there was not a drop of sweat on his forehead as he unsmilingly took his thirteenth bow only then did he deign to look in floras direction anticipating delirious adulation her little hands with their bitten nails sore and scarlet with clapping but her seat was empty the briefest scrawl on a diary page left at the box office told him shed had to leave before the end to meet some friends rannaldini was so furious he went back to the green room and fired ten musicians including beatrice the little blond flautist whose bed hed been intermittently warming since march but floras indifference only fuelled his lust justifying his actions by saying georgie and guy needed space to sort out their marriage he encouraged natasha and the totally smitten wolfie to invite flora to valhalla for halfterm as valhalla had many rooms on different levels it was possible to look out of windows into rooms near by an outraged mr brimscombe who was increasingly tempted to go back to larry was told to leave the shaggy pink clematis montana round rannaldinis dressing room which had long since finished flowering so rannaldini could peer through it into floras bedroom but far worse mr brimscombe was then ordered to hack back from around floras window a rare honeysuckle just as it was emerging into its goldscented glory such was his desire that rannaldini would have ripped out the paradise pearl valhalla with its tennis and squash courts cricket pitch which the village team was occasionally allowed to use and huge swimmingpool protectively ringed with limes was a paradise for teenagers there were also horses to ride and to add excitement the famous valhalla maze planted in the seventeenth century while the abbey was briefly in the hands of the laity by sir william westall for the entertainment of his descendants now twenty feet high with nearly a quarter of a mile of dark convoluted alleys it was alarmingly easy to get lost in beyond the maze deep in the wood was rannaldinis tower and beyond a path had been cut through the undergrowth to the edge of the valhalla estate near to hermiones house this was kept clear by rannaldinis henchman clive a sinister blond young man given to black leather on his day off who doubled up as his masters dog handler outside the tower rottweilers prowled frightening off fans trespassers and most of all kitty when flora arrived at valhalla rannaldini was away recording mahlers resurrection symphony in berlin a heat wave which had caught the country on the hop was into its second week the darkening woods seemed to smoulder in the burning noonday sun the hayfields quivered as though his battery was running down the cuckoo called laboriously from a clump of horse chestnuts whose candles were already shedding their white and bright pink petals the dark maze drew the eye like a magnet its always more relaxed when papa isnt here said natasha as she and flora peeled themselves off the leather seats of the mercedes in which clive had collected them papas wonderful but when he doesnt get his way the whole building shakes looking up at the house grey brooding and secretive with its tall chimneys flora noticed blinds drawn on most of the windows imagine draculas victims languishing behind them unable to take the sun papa likes them down during the day explained natasha sun ruins pictures and tapestries beautiful isnt it quite flora refused to be fazed bit hammer house of horror in fact extremely so she added as natasha led her in through a side door past a darkly panelled room containing rows of gleaming black riding boots and a daunting collection of spurs bits with chains and hunting whips many of them with lashes i didnt know your father was into sm normality was restored by a delicious smell of mint and fennel drifting from the kitchen kitty spectacles misting up her face as red and shiny as a billiard ball damp patches under the arms of her straining blue cotton dress was cooking sunday lunch this is my stepmother announced nastasha disdainfully dumping two carrier bags of washing on the floor at kittys feet and please handwash my purple flares you shrunk my red pair last time i thought stepmothers were supposed to be wicked said flora my mother has never handwashed anything in her life youre bloody lucky natasha how dyou do she smiled at kitty pleased to meet you kitty wiped a red hand on her apron blimey its ot im afraid these melted in the car giving kitty a squashed box of terrys all gold flora reflected that kitty reacted as though they really were gold going even brighter red with pleasure ow very kind of you flora thats really fortful not really said natasha bitchily wolfie gave them to her but she doesnt want any more zits that was another box snapped flora how are yer mum and dad asked kitty ok but mums getting horribly thin these are hers although she doesnt know it flora held out the bottom of the slategrey shorts she was wearing with a pale pink camisole top theyre part of a size ten suit and theyre already miles too big for her theyre gorgeous natasha took a bottle of wine from the fridge and sloshed it into two glasses i wish i had a mother over here who was trendy enough to nick clothes from flushing kitty asked her how work was going boring and even more boring talking about it natasha handed a glass to flora ill show you your room i dont know why youre bothering about lunch kitty its much too hot to eat im starving said flora see you in a bit kitty later she and natasha sprawled in the windowseat looking at old photographs isnt papa ravishing sighed natasha quite flora examined a coloured photograph of rannaldini shooting in the bracken hes a bit urban as though he pays some peasant to throw mud over his gumboots every morning and tread in his new barbour in the autumn like grapes he is good looking for a wrinkly though she added kindly whats his christian name roberto i shall call him bob said flora draining a second glass of wine i wouldnt said natasha an american baritone called him bob at a dress rehearsal and never made the opening night bob harefields a sweet man said flora giggling that ghastly hermione isnt short of a few bobs is she oh christ flora suddenly remembered kitty who fortunately seemed to be preoccupied putting peeled prawns and sliced cucumbers round a sea trout im starving now natasha grabbed a chunk of cheddar from the fridge and removing the clingfilm took a bite before smoothing away the toothmarks with her thumb thank god heres wolfie we can have lunch having been given a golf gti for his eighteenth birthday wolfie rannaldini insisted on driving everywhere blond ruddy complexioned beaky nosed solemn and ambitious when he wasnt training for various school teams he was swotting for his a levels he had taken after rannaldinis german side while the volatile histrionic overemotional natasha seemed all italian unlike his sister he gave kitty a hug before pulling flora up from the windowseat seeking her mouth and letting his hand slither under the pink camisole top for a quick squeeze having dismissed love as a girls concern he had been knocked for one of the sixes he was always hitting by flora did you beat fleetley asked kitty slaughtered them wolfie got a can of beer out of the fridge any runs a hundred and twenty and three wickets but thats wonderful kitty is nice thought flora who could never work up an interest in cricket they were pissed off went on wolfie when we got out of the bus the fleetley xi sneered at us and said whats it like being at a secondrate public school i said i dont know ive only just arrived and then we buried them this is seriously funny he unrolled a long school photograph flora and natasha screamed with laughter for there grinning in the third row just behind miss bottomley was flora wearing a gorilla mask theyve printed six hundred and sent most of them out without checking said wolfie in amusement bottomley will go apeshit gorillashit said flora come and look kitty kitty giggled so much she had to remove her glasses and wipe her eyes shes not much older than us thought flora in surprise and on closer examination decided that if kitty wasnt remotely beautiful she had a sweet crumpled face and certainly wasnt the total dog natasha made out you look nice tasha she said turning back to the photograph too voluptuous at present despite long thin legs natasha had shaggy black curls rannaldinis heavylidded dark eyes a big pouting mouth like a frog and a sly sliding slightly asiatic face giving off the possibility of great glamour to come watching the three of them laughing together and seeing wolfies hand creep round floras slim waist to find her breast again kitty felt a wave of envy then she turned in terror and nearly dropped the potato salad as the room was plunged into darkness by the unexpected arrival of rannaldinis helicopter blotting out the sun fuck said wolfie whod been planning to spend the afternoon in the long grass with flora just then flew down a monstrous crow as black as a tarbarrel said flora only natasha was delighted when five minutes later the house was flooded with mahler and rannaldini stalked in he was followed by tabloid his favourite and more ferocious rottweiler who would have plunged his teeth into nastasha when she rushed forward to hug her father if rannaldini hadnt shouted and given the dog a vicious kick in the ribs which triggered off a serious of howls pavarottweiler said flora disapprovingly i heard you bullied your soloists was the recording cancelled asked natasha hastily i made everyone rise early to beat the heat once home rannaldini established his ascendancy with the inevitable jackbooting a brilliant imaginative cook he often produced sunday lunch himself cooking as he conducted keeping five saucepans going at once mixing tasting stirring ordering kitty around like a skivvy but today as lunch was ready he kept everyone waiting out of malice sending kitty scuttling to get him a drink going through the synopsis shed typed of his post faxes and telephone messages finding fault with everything snarling like tabloid who lay panting at his feet if she didnt know the answer in his post was a letter from some distinguished composer saying the concert in the albert hall out of which flora had walked had been the most marvellous thing hed ever heard a peety you meesed most of it rannaldini chucked the letter across to her expect the old sycophant wants you to commission another symphony said flora unrepentantly basically i thought the don juan very selfconscious you couldnt hear strauss for rannaldini and ive never liked it as music you keep longing for that divinely soppy theme tune to be repeated and it never is and im not surprised those were strausss four last songs if hed known hermione was going to sing them my mothers voice is far more beautiful than that gurgling canary terrified that rannaldini might see her laughing kitty gave the mayonnaise a stir to check it hadnt curdled you will never find a more exquisite voice said rannaldini icily passion and thrust are what matters hermiones got no soul beneath the pale red fringe which was tangling with her sooty eyelashes floras cool cactusgreen eyes a mixture of georgies seaweed brown and guys pale azure were scornful and utterly unafraid i must get that girl into bed thought rannaldini are we never going to have lunch he snapped turning on kitty and when she had laid out a beautiful pink sea trout a huge bowl of yellow mayonnaise which he complained should have been sauce verte a green salad including the tiniest broad beans and new potatoes he made no comment only rejecting the bottles of muscadet and sending her scuttling back to the dungeons of which she was terrified to get some sancerre why dont you have a little train to get your drinks for you said flora unfolding an emeraldgreen napkin then kitty wouldnt have had to run around like a barmaid in happy hour but rannaldini was looking at the times crossword which was normally faxed out to him wherever he was in the world filling it in as easily as a passport form who like a black swan as death came on poured forth her song in perfect calm he asked the assembled company presumably none of you dolts know st cecilia said flora accepting a plate of sea trout from kitty yum that looks good correct said rannaldini unlike my children you read books im doing auden for a level natasha was still studying the school photograph nice one of marcus campbellblack have you snogged him yet flora too shy wouldnt mind snogging his father though rupert campbellblack was the man we voted wed most like to lose our virginity to natasha told rannaldini but you were second daddy she added hastily rannaldinis vile mood returned although the food was delectable he immediately emptied a sootfall of black pepper and a pint of tabasco over his sea trout before taking a bite then when he had taken one mouthful snapped at kitty that the fish must have died of natural causes and gave the whole lot to tabloid who promptly gobbled it up then yelped his eyes spurting tears as he encountered the tabasco and pepper this sea trouts perfect protested flora you kept lunch waiting youre lucky its not old and tough like certain people round here and that was bloody cruel to that dog ignoring her rannaldini started talking in german to wolfie kitty said nothing throughout lunch as still as an extra on stage not wanting to attract a seconds attention from the actor who is speaking there was another explosion when rannaldini found the brie in the fridge im sorry rannaldini stammered kitty but it was running away in the eat dont blame it said flora if it gets shouted at like you do in the silence that followed natasha wolfie and kitty gazed at their green ivypatterned plates and shook rannaldini glared at flora for a moment then laughed you have to practise this afternoon natasha you have homework wolfie i will show flora the ouse ducking unnecessarily so as to avoid hitting his sleek grey head on the low beams rannaldini whisked flora through endless twisting and turning passages and darkpanelled rooms occasionally from the shadows grinned the white or yellowing teeth of a grand piano on the way rannaldini pointed out ancient tapestries tudor triptychs and family portraits belonging to other people because sadly his leftwing mother had flogged off those of his own family in the great hall with its minstrels gallery rannaldini had commissioned a redandgold mural of trumpeters harpists and fiddlers and a bust of himself in front of the huge organ something wrong there said flora slyly surely you should be behind the huge organ ignoring the crack rannaldini led her up the great stone staircase where sunlight poured through the stainedglass window of st cecilia at yet another organ blessed cecilia appear in visions to all musicians murmured flora is that burne jones a copy said rannaldini the originals in oxford leading the way up to the attic stepping over stray angels wings and broken chalices left behind by the monks rannaldini pointed to a rope running down a groove in the thick stone wall whats that asked flora the rope of the punishment bell said rannaldini caressingly the abbot used to ring it from his study after vespers every friday evening telling the monks to return to their cells and flagellate themselves for the duration of the misericordia this went on until a father dominic came up here and valiantly clung on to the rope and the practice was finally stamped out how gross flora fingered the rope with a shudder through a narrow slit of window she could see the valley lit by chestnut candles and beyond green fields streaked with buttercups and dotted with redandwhite cows like the backdrop to some medieval madonna it was very cold in the attic in some distant room she could hear natasha sulkily thumping out a chopin nocturne i suppose you use the punishment bell on kitty blurted out flora only when she needs it said rannaldini silkily flora shivered but was determined not to appear afraid mum said kittys terrified of a ghost here the paradise lad murmured rannaldini softly he was a very beautiful young boy a novice here and very loving and charming and not entirely sure of his vocation then he fell in love with a village girl and decided he wanted to leave the order denied this he was caught with the girl the abbot loved the boy and was so insane with jealousy that he threw him down in the dungeons before ordering him to be flogged and rang the punishment bell on and on until finally the monks grew quite out of control and flogged the boy to death many people say they ave heard his ghost sobbing at night rannaldinis face was enigmatic but there was a throb of excitement in his deep voice thats horrific said flora utterly revolted and probably apocryphal said rannaldini idly examining a battered cherub wondering if it could be restored the wind howl down the chimneys ere thats probably all the screaming people ear lets go and play tennis rannaldinis passion for flora was severely tested on the tennis court unaware of the honour of being his partner she simply didnt try and ducked collapsing with laughter each time wolfie and natasha both powerful muchcoached players hit the shocking pink balls straight at her she and rannaldini ended up in a screaming match your fathers insanely competitive she grumbled as she and wolfie cooled off in the big blue swimmingpool which was tiled like a roman bath when he simmered down rannaldini was reduced to watching her through binoculars while she sunbathed topless envying the ambre solaire wolfie was rubbing into her high freckled breasts at bedtime peering through the montana he caught a tantalizing glimpse of her undressing before she slipped on the outsize pyjamas which had come into fashion that summer he imagined his hand stealing under the trouser elastic with her cropped red hair shed be just like a schoolboy next moment he heard wolfies door open and shut followed by creaking floorboards then floras door opening and shutting then the light went out rannaldini was demented stalking along the landing he barged into kittys bedroom without knocking she was wearing a highnecked white cotton nightgown and knitting a custardyellow jersey for her mothers christmas present on the shelf were little bottles of shampoo moisturizers and transparent bathcaps in cardboard packs which rannaldini brought her from hotel bedrooms on trips abroad she never threw out anything he gave her looking up at her husband in fear and longing she waited for the next hammer blow time for the real thing said rannaldini dropping danielle steel on the floor returning to the kitchen after waving goodbye to natasha wolfie and flora the following evening kitty gasped in horror flora had added a moustache a squint some long earrings and a mass of tight curls to rannaldinis poster on the cork board underneath she had written stop being shitty to kitty kitty removed it only just in time over the next few weeks the heat wave intensified and so did rannaldinis obsessive passion but whenever he flew home he found wolfie and flora wrapped round each other like labrador puppies he was in despair then on the last saturday in june in the middle of wimbledon fortnight having despatched kitty to stay with her excruciatingly dull suburban mother so he could install a twoway mirror between his dressing room and the spare room into which flora had been moved rannaldini dropped in for a drink with georgie and guy as the sun had lost a little of its heat they sat out on the terrace gazing down on a valley lit by white elderflower discs and garlanded by wild roses that shrivelled in an afternoon only docks nettles and ragwort had been left by the ravenous sheep and cows both lake and river below it were dangerously low dinsdale panted gloomily under georgies deckchair georgie in a pair of oatmeal bermuda shorts and a sagegreen tshirt which showed the skin falling away from her upper arms and thighs gazed into space she had dried up like the valley around her great cracks split the footpaths the ivy round the house was showering down yellow leaves and the lawns of angels reach because guy unlike rannaldini observed the hosepipe ban had already turned brown georgie and guy were just reeling from another frightful row while guy was fussing around making pimms georgie unbuttoned to rannaldini guy says he hasnt seen julia since her exhibition then he buggers off for two hours this afternoon and returns with poor dinsdale utterly exhausted and reeking of je reviens the shoemakers children may be the worst shod but adulterers dogs have the sorest paws my dear i cannot theenk why youre upset rannaldini put a soothing hand on her razorsharp shoulder you are cross with guy so he seeks approval elsewhere having an affaire is like going on television one gets the chance to talk at length about oneself in front of an admiring audience but i dont understand pleaded georgie if he needs her why does he insist on sleeping with me all the time i locked myself in the spare room last night and he broke the door down quite seemple rannaldini smiled he feel guilty and he know eef he stop fucking you you will suspect something and if he ees thinking so much of julia he needs the release ooo said georgie in anguish is that the reason my dear child guy will only really want you again when you find yourself a new man he paused as guy came out with a clinking tray sorry rannaldini id forgotten pimms takes such a long time do you think beckers going to win guy who always became more military when he sensed combat had had a too short haircut rannaldini noticed with a stab of pain that guys newly revealed rather pointed ears were very like floras as were his flat cheekbones and square jaw but floras luminous white skin her earthy animal features and big sulky mouth were all georgies hows my friend kitty asked guy putting a piece of mint in everyones glass staying with her mother a pair of clacking false teeth in an armchair and sorting out my vat said rannaldini kittys a saint said guy heartily they always say behind every famous man theres a clockwork wife and behind every famous woman theres a wildly unfaithful husband snarled georgie turning puce guy shot a seewhatihavetoputupwith glance at rannaldini fortunately the telephone rang and guy bounded in to answer it i found a bill for janet reger under the lining paper of his pants drawer hissed georgie do you think hell claim vat virtue annihilated tax on that when in silks paid for by guy my julia goes christ you are on form this evening murmured rannaldini noticing georgie go quiet trying to work out if guy was talking in code hallo sabine he was saying did you beat radley yesterday singlehanded i should think said rannaldini guy returned looking absolutely furious sabines had to suspend flora until the end of term for three offences drinking in a pub smoking in church in church and being caught halfnaked behind a combine harvester this afternoon with your son im afraid rannaldini laprèsmidi dun fornicator said rannaldini enviously hell its only a few fags half a bottle of sancerre and a roll in the hay said georgie who thought it was funny at least shes gone astray with the right sort of chap she clinked her glass against rannaldinis has wolfie been suspended too evidently not he wasnt caught smoking and drinking and the xis got a needle match against marlborough tomorrow and wolfgang still has two a levels to take flora shouldnt have got caught said guy disapprovingly thats always been your attitude said georgie flaring up i never did anything wrong snapped back guy rannaldini was ecstatic at last a chance to get flora on her own while wolfie and natasha were still incarcerated and sabine says floras got a singing exam in ten days said guy taking such a large gulp of pimms he tipped cucumber and apple over his face id better go and collect her and pop in on julia on the way thought georgie despairingly she shouldnt have made those bitchy remarks shed have to crawl later send flora over to me said rannaldini ill go through her songs and give her a bit of coaching returning from a telerecording in a suffocatingly hot london studio two days later rannaldini went straight into the shower on the white porcelain floor lay a huge spider a second later rannaldini had assassinated it with a boiling jet of water in almost intolerable sexual excitement he took a long time choosing what to wear then opted to show off the depth of his tan and the broadness of his shoulders with an ivory silk shirt tucked into cream chinos having brushed his hair till it gleamed combed his black brows which could splay like centipedes and drenched himself in maestro he went downstairs to the summer parlour here the cheerful serenity of primroseyellow curtains and walls and drained blue and white striped sofas and chairs was somewhat marred by savage hunting scenes of lions and bears fighting off packs of dogs and men with spears rannaldini had just switched on wimbledon and his own magnificent recording of shostakovichs tenth when flora rolled up looking sulkier than ever christ i didnt come all this way to watch becker hes got white eyelashes like dad and whyd you always listen to your own records dyou spend hours conducting in the mirror for a second rannaldini listened to the growling brass im playing this in new york next week its important not to repeat oneself shostakovich wrote thees music to encourage the russians to resist the germans youre halfgerman i dont need any encouragement to resist you said flora rudely unfazed by her sniping rannaldini handed her a glass of krug the sunshine which had browned everyone else had merely sprinkled a few freckles on floras turnedup nose she wore no makeup but at least she had washed her hair her cornflowerblue espadrilles were trodden down at the back her lighter blue skirt had been shredded round the hem by her bicycle a black shirt of wolfies was knotted under her breasts you look good in black matches the blackheads wheres kitty with her mother then im off said flora crossly im not staying here unchaperoned dont be silly rannaldini took her and the bottle of krug down some stone steps on to the terrace around which the valhalla garden had reached perfection sprinklers undulated languidly like strippers casting off rainbows of light over the emeraldgreen lawns old roses in every pastel shade tawny honeysuckle regale lilies single and double white philadelphus pale yellow lime blossom all seemed to be dabbing their sweetest scent on the pulse spots of the valley like women in their ascot finery jostling forward to watch a big race the herbaceous border was overcrowded with whiteandpink phlox dog daisies redhot pokers foxgloves yellow snapdragons and soft blue cathedral spires of delphinium a strange very clear light heightened every colour the smell of each flower intensified by the hot muggy air for a while neither rannaldini nor flora spoke watching blackandwhite cows like scattered dominoes in the fields below and listening to the tetchy bleating of sheep and the rattling hoofbeats of rannaldinis horses as maddened by flies they galloped about neighing a red tractor chugged back and forth cutting rannaldinis hay swallows dived after insects its going to thunder flora said finally mums got a ghastly headache perhaps she doesnt want to sleep with your father rannaldini flipped through floras music dyou want to sing to me no on the inside page of the magnet and the churn she had written flora seymour lower sixth a beautiful trochaic name flora its gross howd you like to have flatstomached men mouthing your name across supermarket freezers and as for interflora you can imagine what the boys at bagley hall made of that black clouds were edging round the sinking sun saying he had to walk his dogs rannaldini took flora round the garden which seemed deliberately designed for love despite the drought streams still hurtled through narrow ravines naked statues were strategically placed in sheltered glades a little summerhouse here a white seat under a weeping ash there beckoned dalliance as he passed rannaldini let his hands rove suggestively over each romping nymph its like a nudist colony grumbled flora she was more charmed by rannaldinis rottweilers who bounded ahead muzzles covered in grass seed soothing their thistlepricked nettlestung paws in the streams attacking clods of wet turf and wood shaking and worrying them emerging with dirty wet faces giving skips in the air and bouncing fatly away avantgarde dogs theyre sweet flora hugged tabloid to people who are not afraid observed rannaldini passing under a pergola fantastically entwined with pale pink roses and acidgreen hop they reached a frantically rushing stream almost a river but narrowed to a width of six feet between dark drenched very slippery rocks the sounding cataract aunted me like a passion said rannaldini softly gazing down into the white churning water this whirlpool is called the devils lair in the eighteenth century the young westalls and their friends had bets eef they were brave enough to jump across several young men were keeled springing across like a great cat rannaldini turned towards her come leetle flora its a hell of a long way snapped flora as the rottweilers distraught at being separated from their master but not brave enough to jump whimpered and barged round her legs unlike you im much too young to die life ees about taking risks whispered rannaldini his dark eyes glittering his teeth gleaming in the halflight jump leetle animal or are you scared refusing to be beaten flora took a great leap slipped on the damp moss and was only just pulled to safety in time for a second rannaldini held her shaking with fury and terror let me go you fucker she screamed i want to go home releasing her rannaldini trailed a warm caressing hand over the gooseflesh of her bare waist why you fight me because i really like kitty because im not into gerontophilia and because im sleeping with your son and he satisfies you hes known as trunch at bagley hall spat back flora hush rannaldini put a finger which smelt of wild mint over her mouth i want confirmation not details and if that werent enough went on flora youre utterly unselective natasha told me about hermione and jumping on her mother every time she hits london and bonking every female musician in the london duodenal not to mention choral sex with all those panting groupies in their i love rannaldini tshirts you just pick them off they had reached a little bank covered in pinkspotted orchids a blushing sun was retreating behind the wood kicking off her espadrilles flora cooled her dusty feet in the long wet grass like rannaldini his sprinklers went everywhere i am don juan said rannaldini sticking to the path above which made him taller or being italian don giovanni i seek the perfect woman and always despair of finding her because all women are the same you would be different you are not classically beautiful but you light up when you smile dad doesnt smile when i light up you shouldnt smoke when god has given you a voice id rather he gave me boris levitsky taunted flora disappearing into the fringed depths of a weeping ash boris not goodenough said rannaldini chillingly why did you marry kitty flora emerged from the far side of the weeping ash was it an act of deliberate sadism did they toll the punishment bell at your wedding did the paradise lad howl on the first night rannaldini gave a shrug kitty run my life she was brought up by elderly parents so i seem like spreeng chicken and she help her mother look after other peoples children so she has no problem with your bratpack correct rannaldini moved off down the ride pausing to caress the upturned face and breasts of a naked wood nymph then letting his hands stray downwards eef one is going to run more than one woman he continued one must have a loving wife rather plain so ones mistresses dont get jealous rather working class so women think keety is fortunate to be plucked from her humble origins and to have landed such a mesmerizing rannaldini paused mockingly over the word husband that she cannot expect heem to be faithful to her above all he went on with a satanic smile keety is the perfect alibi eef hermione is being difficult and i want to see cecilia i tell hermione that keety is in town so i cannot get away eef i want to see someone else you for example briefly he touched her cheek i tell both hermione and cecilia keety is in town if i want to drop someone i say i am so sorry my dear keety has found out and i cannot urt keety if a woman suddenly refuses to get out of my bed or one of my ouses i say keety is due any minute you must go finally eef any of them are foolish enough to want to marry me i tell them i cannot leave keety she do nothing wrong it would be like throwing a freshwater fish into the sea he has got the most beautiful voice thought flora husky caressing anodyne perhaps it was an essential of adulterers because so much of their campaigning was done on the telephone youre such a shit she said fascinated like byron gently rannaldini fingered the crutch of the wood nymph we love our men of genius not because they are perfect but because they are great then running his hand over the wood nymphs bottom still warm from the sun as though she has been given a spanking i would love to spank all the bad temper out of you leetle flora you bloody wouldnt outraged yet excited flora plunged back into another weeping ash as she emerged rannaldini drew two ropes of fronds round her neck trapping her i ave a ole in my heart from cupids arrow he whispered tightening the fronds aware that he could throttle her flora gazed into his mocking sensual infinitely cynical face my father was a spanish captain she sang softly went to sea a month ago first he kissed me then he left me bid me always answer no she paused so long on the high note that rannaldini felt the hair rising on the back of his neck then she smiled and went on oh no juan no juan no juan no rannaldinis straight black eyebrows underlined a forehead almost without lines not a man who worries or who suffers from guilt thought flora his lips were absolutely on a level with hers she was sure he was going to kiss her and shut her eyes then he laughed and moved away come and see my tower flora could hear the distant hum of a tractor trying to get the hay cut before the storm the sun had set but the heat was still murderous as they moved through the wood rannaldini held back nettles and brambles and having climbed a stile overgrown with elder turned to help her the starry elderflowers that fell into her hair were as creamy as her skin overcome with lust rannaldini let his hand stray over her right breast testing its soft springiness leaping away livid with her heart for pounding like the hoofbeats of rannaldinis horses flora hurled a clump of goosegrass at him to lower the tension clinging but instantly detachable like the perfect woman said rannaldini peeling it off his silk shirt and throwing it back at flora who ducked and ran down the path as she reached the clearing a crack of lightning lit up rannaldinis tower then thunder boomed like a twelve pounder the rottweilers collided against their masters legs in terror rannaldini just had time to kick them into their kennel and bustle flora into the tower when the heavens opened the ground floor where rannaldini worked was completely walled by records tapes and editing equipment its soundproof so however much you scream it wont sound as awful as hermione mocked flora as the soundtrack of rannaldinis film of don giovanni flooded the tower and its surrounding woodland flora bounded up a sprial staircase into a sitting room furnished with pale grey sofas and chairs and two high footstools covered in buttercupyellow and crimson silk flora looked up at the bright scarlet walls and ceiling like being wrapped in the flames of don giovannis hell she said on a side table beside a shoal of silver photographs of rannaldini being congratulated by the famous including gorbachov and princess diana stood a big yellow bowl overflowing with pinkandgreen grapes peaches mangoes persimmons and fruit so exotic flora had never seen it before a yellow aubusson carpet swimming with roses and oak leaves caressed her bare feet the only pictures were an eric gill panel of an ambiguouslooking madonna offering a perfect breast to a rather tooknowing and adult baby and a picasso girl whose eye squinted over rannaldinis ivorysilk shoulder as he opened another bottle of krug the bathroom also in pale grey and scarlet with a mirrored ceiling and walls was dominated by a vast jacuzzi mother courages famous jujitzu bath giggled flora i cant tell you how much i admire her she makes my fathers shirts look as though dinsdales slept in them and she told mum that mrs arefield ad just had her back passage painted bottle green you should know presumably even though a faint smile flickered at the corner of rannaldinis mouth flora decided not to tell him about rattledicky i could listen to her for hours unlike boris levitskys compositions said rannaldini handing her a glass to us to my guardian devil trying to suppress her surging excitement flora sauntered next door into a bedroom which was all bed with a mural above it of an endlessly applauding opera audience beautiful bareshouldered women in wonderful jewels handsome men in dinnerjackets all cheering and clapping so realistically you could smell the carnations in their buttonholes and hear the bravoes ringing out christ youre a narcissist snapped flora do you delay your entrance even here howd you take out your teeth without a bedside table she jumped as a huge clap of thunder burst overhead her heart was beating almost as loudly any moment rannaldini would pounce vile seducer sang hermione like a fury ill pursue you haunt you to your dying day exquisite sighed rannaldini and going downstairs he turned on wimbledon to watch a replay of an excruciatingly boring womens singles match feeling absurdly let down flora slumped on one of the silk footstools sulkily consuming an entire bunch of green grapes pips and all by which time leporelló was listing don giovannis conquests to a distraught donna elvira dark blond fat thin tall tiny all were fair game to the don but his favourite form of sinning is with one whos just beginning sang leporelló realizing that the rain was no longer machinegunning the roof and windows flora knocked back her krug well i cant stay here all night gazing up miss sabatinis knickers ill walk you home are you tired rannaldini switched off the television and the soundtrack no bored ees the same thing as they were leaving he flicked on his answering machine suddenly the tower was filled with desperate weeping rannaldini its beatrice i must see you i love you so much with an irritable shrug rannaldini turned off the machine some stupeed flautist want her job back and you too by the sound of it reproved flora how can you hang a cross round your neck and behave so horribly theenk how much worse i would behave if i didnt wear it women make such a fuss as a sex you will soon be expendable the japanese invent a robot that makes exquisite love afterwards you sweetch it off it must be called hermione rannaldini laughed you should scowl more often mocked flora going towards the door youre too attractive when you smile rannaldini punched her gently in the belly you wanna go ome while i still can peety you have no idea of the unimaginable pleasure you will miss see these leetle footstools they are very old italian voluptuaries used to kneel their mistresses up on them so they could spend hours licking their bottoms how disgusting flora was rigid with shock shes a child thought rannaldini come leetle wild thing putting a warm hand on her neck he drew her towards him and kissed her gently on each corner of her mouth then slowly worked inwards his mouth cool and tasting faintly of krug supported by the door flora just remained standing now i can tell them at bagley hall ive snogged rannaldini outside night had fallen the wood steamed like a tropical jungle the rain had bowed the trees into a dripping green tunnel and pestled a rank sexy smell out of elder nettles and the last yellow leaves of the wild garlic as they emerged the maze reared up a great jetblack wave waiting to topple over them an owl hooted warningly a bat swooped duck its the count said flora through desperately chattering teeth go into the maze whispered rannaldini give me a ball of thread ariadne although youre more like the minotaur keep your hand on the wall and youll reach the centre rannaldini buried his lips briefly in her neck i geeve you a minutes start never one to resist a challenge flora plunged into the maze feeling her way between drenched lowering yew cliffs with a scream she ducked in terror as a sinister dark figure reared up ahead like a black cowled monk about to pounce on her then she gasped with relief it was only one of mr brimscombes yew peacocks shivering yet pouring with sweat as her feet crunched on the wet cold pebble floor she felt she was walking down an endless beach into a sea of no return turning twisting falling to her knees losing both her espadrilles in her panic she could hear rannaldini behind her like the hound of heaven should be hell his footsteps deliberate but relentless stealthily drawing closer oh christ she could hear breathing in front now someone else was in the maze or was it the way it twisted back on itself terrified she started to run piercing herself as she crashed from one massed wall of sharp twigs to another twenty feet above a thin strip of dun starless sky gave her no direction her breath was coming in such gasps she would have none left to scream for help shed never get out meeting a dead end she stumbled to the left hands desperately searching rannaldini was going to murder her the maze was a trick there was no centre she gave a sob as an owl hooted overhead then suddenly she breathed in the headiest smell the path seemed to widen her feet must have touched a pressure point because soft light suddenly flooded a bower of bliss in which an ancient stone bench was fantastically garlanded by great clumps of rainsoaked philadelphus and jasmine with white rambler roses clambering to the top of the yew ramparts all wafting their sweetness flora gave a moan of relief and joy next moment rannaldinis arms were around her she could feel the burning heat of his body don giovanni in the flames you made it leetle wild thing im waiting for mr rite of spring to come along you must not mock this time he kissed her with real passion quivering with tension his tongue stabbing and probing her mouth his hands untying the black knot of wolfies shirt laying bare her dovesoft white breasts he covered them with kisses murmuring endearments in italian then he seemed to gain control of himself and pushed her gently away now we play games he said softly you must do what i say you are leetle village girl who wishes to enter the great convent of paradise but first the allpowerful abbot of valhalla must inspect you to make sure of your purity and innocence it ees his privilege his face was totally impassive are you some kind of nutter stammered flora backing away take off your clothes said rannaldini sharply furiously flora stepped out of her rainsoaked blue skirt and pink and white striped pants sit down he pushed her on to the stone bench now the abbot will examine the leetle girl fully he touches her breasts rannaldinis warm hands were stroking squeezing searching and he theenks what a tragedy that two such lovely theengs should be hidden for ever under a nuns black robes the little girl is frightened now he went on sensing floras apprehension but just when she think the touching has gone on too long for decency the abbot moves downwards he is delighted to find her a little plump her puppy fat will protect her from the bitter cold of the convent in time to the deep husky caressing voice rannaldinis hands roved over her belly and thighs slowly meticulously assessing and examining once again flora was appalled to find herself revolted but wildly hopelessly excited sturdy legs too murmured rannaldini good for kneeling for hours on a cold chapel floor then as he pushed her back on the bench now she must lie down and put her knees up to her breasts for the crucial examination to begin the test of her virginity what sort of fucking pervert are you hissed flora but powerless to resist she lay back raising her legs and giving a wail of pleasure as his fingers slid inside her they go in too easily purred rannaldini the leetle girl try to tighten up to pretend she is still intacta but she is far too excited as the abbot explore probing her most secret places she cannot stop herself gripping his fingers she is embarrassed how wet she is getting she knows the abbot is excited too he no longer care eef she is virgin rannaldinis ironhard thigh was rigid against floras bare leg she began to gasp with helpless pleasure as his finger moved up to her clitoris see the hood is back from this tiny pink bud blossoms all female joy it is so pretty the abbot will cure all her tensions all her fears and geeve her such a lovely feeling oh you bastard flora arched her back went rigid and came that was nice crooned rannaldini delightedly gathering her against his chest and stroking her hair bliss but utterly bent is only the beginning tomorrow you can be little nun who has been caught in some wickedness and youll be the abbot of valhalla ordering me to be flogged not bloody likely desperate to regain the upper hand flora dropped to her knees unzipping his fly lowering the blue silk boxer shorts and burying her face in the scented powdered hair flattened by the tight trousers as the thick powerful cock flew up like a jack in the box oh wow sighed flora but feeling her tongue rannaldini pulled away i weesh to come inside you pity i wanted to have my cock and eat it for a second she thought he was going to hit her stop taking the pees lifting her back on to the stone bench he roughly parted her labia and shoved his cock deep inside her aaaaaaah lovely cried flora starting to move she was used to overexcited schoolboys who came in an instant rannaldini now totally in control could have been a metronone for the rite of spring his rhythm was so exact and so relentless keep your eyes open he ordered his face satanical above hers i want to see you come are you bored now not as much as i was twelve bored more likely ah those deep slow thrusts flora was battling not to abdicate herself completely for a pervert youre seriously good at straight fucking although this bench is even harder than you oh my god on second thoughts perhaps it isnt oh rannaldini oh rannaldini at the end of a weeks suspension flora was allowed back for the leavers ball because wolfie rannaldini whod won every cup and prize going interceded with sabine bottomley two days before the ball flora who was supposed to be practising who is sylvia with rannaldini in his tower was actually perched on his huge treble bed rubbing baby oil into him while he finished the crossword ah thats good deeper deeper you learn fast later he combed back the hair between her legs you are very charming like a rose called felicia i cannot wait to shave you do you shave all your women usually cecilia ave a brush like bernard shaws beard so i ad to you are decadent you should publish a coffee table book of all your ladies and call it clitoris allsorts anyway you cant shave me until after the leavers ball think of the raised eyebrows if we all go skinny dipping you are not going to leavers ball i must i feel so dreadful about wolfie i promised id go with him two months ago im not letting him down in front of all his friends im off backpacking soon so he and i will just peter out without his knowing about you eef you go to that ball do not come back to me it was her first experience of rannaldinis intransigence she knew she mustnt give in she was horrified how difficult she found it having persuaded georgie to buy a slinky black dress covered in sequins for the clive anderson show so she could borrow it for the ball flora discovered it was too tight on the hips resorting to half a packet of exlax she spent the day of the ball on the groaning that she was dying that makes two of us thought georgie deathly pale buckling at the knees flora managed to gird her ransacked loins to get ready at least the dress fitted perfectly georgie was just fastening her own jade pendant round floras neck when flora asked her point blank if shed ever been unfaithful to guy no of course not as georgie crossed her fingers the jade pendant slithered between floras breasts and has daddy ever been unfaithful to you this time as she crossed her fingers georgie held on to the pendant with her thumb of course not how very boring said flora marriage must be like a prison next moment her mother had burst into tears but denied there was anything the matter just saying work was going badly as wolfie was playing cricket against the fathers and going to be pushed for time guy the everwilling chauffeur dropped flora off at valhalla where the roses were scattering pale petals all over the lawns rannaldini whod just flown in from a wonderfully successful performance of shostakovichs tenth was delighted to see flora looking so wan but she had the wonderful skin of youth where sleepless nights only put darker blue shadows under the eyes and made her look more appealing he had never wanted anyone more but icily he ignored her before she left with wolfie and natasha they paraded before the grownups in their finery oh id love to be beautiful and thin and go to a ball thought kitty longingly wolfie asked his father to tie his tie he had made another century this afternoon and looked bullish very brown and handsome none of our generation can tie bowties said natasha family ties are more important said flora pointedly for a second as his father had to stand on tiptoe to see over his shoulder into the mirror and flick and slot the yellow paisley tie in and out wolfie had a spookie feeling rannaldini wanted to throttle him you all look beyootiful called out kitty as they drove off as kitty sorted through the mountains of washing from her stepchildrens trunks the following afternoon she felt really depressed not only had she got the curse which meant yet again she wasnt pregnant but also because shed just switched on wimbledon and seen hermione and rannaldini sitting together on centre court shed just removed the clothes which natasha who was flying to new york the next day might need when wolfie tottered in still wearing his dinnerjacket at first she thought he was drunk then as he collapsed at the kitchen table she realized he was crying christ i hate my father kitty went cold mindlessly she filled the kettle flora was impossible all evening said wolfie furiously wiping his desperately bloodshot eyes then she vanished and came back all lit up i thought she was on something she refused to dance the sides of the marquee were up because it was so hot she kept looking up at the stars then she gives this shriek of excitement and runs across the pitch leaving her bag her shoes and her green jacket behind as my fathers helicopter lands on the pitch wolfie couldnt go on the wind from rannaldinis blades had blown floras skirt over her head and his last memory had been of her black legs and suspenders and her red bikini pants she was so crazy about boris he said despairingly and marcus campbellblack but i thought id seen off the competition but how can i compete when my father comes out of the sky like close encounters wolfie was a kind boy but so deranged with grief hed forgotten who he was talking to my mothers still in love with him and theyve been divorced for years he went on bitterly when we were in salzburg papa swanned up and put his hand on her shoulders youre looking lovely gisela and mum started shaking and shaking he can have anyone why does he have to take flora as well suddenly wolfie realized the cup kitty was putting down in front of him was spilling tea all over the table oh jesus kitty im sorry i dont know what im saying you must have known what a bastard he was when you married him when his father returned even browner from wimbledon having been denied the satisfaction of seeing boris becker winning wolfie asked for five minutes alone expecting trouble rannaldini was surprised when wolfie bleakly announced that instead of an eighteenth birthday party hed like the money to go round the world relieved to see the broad back of his son rannaldini wrote him a surprisingly generous cheque i feel terrible said flora when rannaldini telephoned to tell her and i doubt if hell ever forgive you course he will sooner or later hell need money or a legup in his career so bad he have to forgive a legover youve no fucking heart and im worried about mum if shes writing a musical called ant and cleo why is she reading othello returning to paradise from her second honeymoon in jamaica in late july marigold rang georgie and suggested they went for a cheeringup lunch at the heavenly host i cant face the outside world at the moment mumbled georgie ayll bring some smoked salmon and several bottles straight round weve got to talk half an hour later marigold rolled up at angels reach looking gloriously suntanned but a bit plump with an apricotpink shirt worn outside her shorts to cover the bulges aym so sorry she hugged georgie kitty filled me in ay didnt realize how awful itd been she was horrified by georgies appearance the magnolia complexion which men used to write songs about was all blotchy she was desperately thin her skin hanging like loose clothes on a skeleton she couldnt stop shaking poor dinsdales aged more than i have hes been walked so much as an excuse to get out of the house that he hides behind the sofa whenever his leads rattled oh god another single magpie frantically georgie crossed herself i keep seeing them theyre always single in july because the females are feeding their babies and protecting their nests said marigold now wheres the corkscrew we both need a noggin hes still seeing julia georgie couldnt keep off the subject i ought to get out but im like a hotel coathanger useless when detached from my moorings i was like that said marigold how are you and guy when youre together terrified we never stop apologizing like british rail i bitched about him so much to annabel hardman the other day with the answering machine on that i had to record dire straits over the whole tape there marigold put a huge bluegreen glass of chardonnay in front of georgie thanks larry was so hellish to you id never have signed that catchitune contract if id known about nikki but you look so stunning now how did you ever get him back promise promise not to tell whispered marigold ay paid laysander you what ferdie laysanders flatmate orchestrated everythin they put me on an awful diet took me joggin and made me act totally unconcerned whenever larry rolled up ay gave laysander some lovely clothes and a ferrari and we hired jewels for him to give me larry was so mad with jealousy he came roaring back it really worked georgie showed the faint flicker of animation of the dying castaway hearing the chug of a helicopter far better than before said marigold taking the smoked salmon out of its transparent paper and laying it on a blue plate from the reject shop which had presumably replaced her plates georgie had smashed you know how hopelessly undomesticated larry was she went on searching among the spice shelf for red pepper now he brings down his washing and even loads and unloads the dishwasher aym thinkin of writing nikki a thankyou letter and hes become so marvellous in other ways marigold unearthed a tiredlooking lemon from the bottom of the fridge not just terribly loving and not being able to keep his hands off me but he doesnt rev up any more or shout at me if ay mapread wrong and he gives me the remote control when we watch tv and smothers me in ysl thats why im looking so good and best of all i dont have to go to masonic dinners any more golly georgie found herself peeling off a bit of smoked salmon i wonder if it would work with guy how much did you pay lysander she asked then bleating in horror when marigold told her i cant afford that its worth it urged marigold youll never be able to pay back the ant and cleo money and larrys hellbent on having your album by christmas hes mean about deadlines itll be such fun having laysander back in paradise and hell keep larry on his toes she added dreamily did you sleep with him may word no marigold crossed her fingers hes just there to rattle ones hubby do give it a go he was in cheshire bringing some drain billionaire to heel and now hes in mayorca on some rescue mission ay promise he and ferdie are brilliant feeling anything but brilliant lysander huddled in the only bit of shade on the burning deck of the motor yacht feisty lady as she chugged round the rocky majorcan coast he was seven days into the worst job ferdie had ever found him to rattle a fabulously rich arms dealer appropriately called mr gunn who had brought his appalling bimbo on the cruise as well as his equally appalling wife bloody ferdie had also poohpoohed lysanders gloomy prognostications that he was bound to be seasick that was rowing boats at school large boats are quite different large boats turned out to be infinitely worse the minute feisty lady left the hamble lysander started heaving his guts out it was absolutely no consolation particularly during a storm in the bay of biscay that the busty braceleted mrs gunn spent her time vying with the ships crew who were all as gay as crickets mr gunn was taking no chances over who should minister to lysander on his death bunk nor that mr gunn became so jealous of mrs gunn playing florence nightingale twentyfour hours a day that he dumped the bimbo in gibraltar and was now bonking florence nightingale so vigorously in the master cabin below deck that feisty lady was pitching worse than in the bay of biscay it was lysanders first day up a molten midday sun blazed down out of a royalblue sky and he felt too dreadful even to watch goodwood on satellite or crawl to the telephone to ring his bookmaker his wracked stomach was even more concave than that of the bronzed deckhand in frayed hotpants who seemed to be spending an unnecessarily long time polishing the nearest life buoy its really kind gregor but i honestly dont want anything mumbled lysander he tried to concentrate on yesterdays sun but the cheery forecast for pisces bore no resemblance to the horrors of the day before and he was depressed by a survey in which the majority of female readers said they preferred men to be well read rather than well hung lysander hadnt finished a book in years sick for a home that no longer existed he longed for jack or arthur to cuddle he was terrified once mr gunn stopped emptying himself into mrs gunn he would empty one of his kalashnikovs into the catalyst and wretched ferdie who had a maddening habit of going off air when he wanted lysander to stay put was always out of the office and refusing to return his calls listlessly he gazed across a tiedyed turquoise and navyblue sea at the pinespiked cliffs falling into the sea they were so like hedgehogs he halfexpected them to curl up taking their tower blocks and hotels with them as the yacht approached the buildings themselves were like the eggbox castles he used proudly to take home from playgroup for his mother who to his fathers irritation always put them in the drawing room he always missed her more when he was feeling ill they were approaching palma feisty lady was bucking ominously and lysander was wondering if he had the strength to stagger to the side or anything left to throw up when a huge yacht overtook them thats britannia sandy isnt she lovely sighed gregor the deckhand raising his binoculars with effort lysander scoured the deck for princess diana or the queen he seriously admired the queen noone knew more about racing if she fell overboard he could dive in and rescue her although in his weakened state he probably couldnt swim that far perhaps princess diana could rescue him she was supposed to swim every day he imagined her firm hands on either side of his head her soothing voice saying not long now as she towed him towards britannia at the thought of her beautiful long legs doing a vigorous backstroke lysanders mind misted over he was roused by the ships cook waving a cordless telephone smelling of garlic at him nice sounding man for you sandy as ferdie was the only person who knew he was on board lysander grabbed the telephone in a fury gemmyoutofhere you bastard where the hell have you been ive been propositioned by every bum bandit in the british navy chill out said ferdie who had an irritating addiction to modern slang whats the state of play lysander told him then after a long pause in which ferdie outlined his next assignment lysander gave a whoop of delight georgie maguire fucking hell the georgie maguire shes gorgeous all right i am keeping my voice down i thought she was happily married the bastard ill get the next flight out of palma wait till tomorrow said ferdie then i can meet you the following afternoon as the temperature soared into the nineties ferdie was amazed to see lysander sidling through the nothingtodeclare doors at gatwick smothered in an enormous camelhair overcoat swathed in long scarves sending fellow passengers flying as his trolley hopelessly overloaded with dutyfree polo sticks and expensive suitcases out of which protruded shirttails and legs of boxer shorts veered out of control wheres the fucking car he hissed to ferdie in the car park well take this trolley and move it you ok move it for christs sake even when he was shaking like a leaf with sweat pouring down a yellowing face people stopped and gazed at lysander hell thought ferdie hes picked up a fever or worse it turned out to be worse the moment they were alone and going up in the grey carpark lift lysander parted his stifling coat to reveal a pink nose and a pair of totally crossed eyes tucked under his arm was a painfully thin bedraggled reddybrown mongrel puppy who nevertheless managed to twitch its curly tail and stretch up to lick lysanders chin what the fuck is that what does it look like sweet little thing i had to trank her so shes very dopey lysander dropped a kiss on the puppys head all the way from palma jesus if another hostess asks if she can take my coat ive never had so many women trying to get my clothes off isnt she adorable and probably rabid hissed ferdie then as the lift stopped cover it up for christs sake the row continued in the car have you ever seen anyone with rabies ferdie was practically diving out of the window to avoid contact no nor anything like this puppy shes got cigarette burns all over her back christ people are bastards you could go to prison for ten years so could i for abetting you thanks for reminding me i must have a bet lysander reached for ferdies car telephone put it down dont change the subject that dog could have rabies course she hasnt her owners kept her locked in a cupboard the boys from the boat took me clubbing and we heard her howling we had to break in afterhours to rescue her i really like gays basically theyre so brave and so kind to animals it took gregor and me an hour to wash the shit off so its stolen as well said ferdie sternly thats fifteen years anythingd be better than that bloody boat i am not into bateaued wives ferdie didnt smile youre so fucking impulsive like that time you hijacked the school cat jack will be wildly jealous jack will be delighted once he knows shes female then they can have lots of rabid puppies lysander giggled ive got you a huge bottle of jack daniels and some toblerone for fat jack and scent for marigold i cant wait to see her god its bliss to be back i hate abroad people cant understand me and i cant understand the television when are we going to see georgie about halfpast six how exciting she looked so stunning at her launching party perhaps shell write a song about me called cock star you are not allowed to bonk her no well i better have a shower before we see her ive got pee all over my shirt what have you called that puppy death threat asked ferdie maggie after thatcher no after this girl in the mill on the floss what are you reading that for lysander who was now marking runners in ferdies evening standard his hand edging towards ferdies mobile explained about the survey in the sun how far have you got page three hes quite a good writer this george eliot lysander was very hurt when ferdie roared with laughter he knew he was thick but hed just executed a dangerous assignment with great skill and put a lot of dosh into ferdies pocket mrs gunn was so grateful this morning shes given me twenty grand to spend at ralph lauren so i can buy lots of sharp suits if hed been bitchy hed have added that ferdie had put on a lot of weight and there was no way he could get into any of them and she offered me a yacht with my own mooring at the hamble whenever i want which i told her i didnt you dickhead exploded ferdie ring her up and accept and well flog it marigold was overjoyed to see lysander chanel number fayve oh you remembered oh laysander as she flung herself into his arms lysander noticed that she had like ferdie put on a lot of weight but as they had been held up in traffic there was no time to do more than bath and change before setting off to georgies maggie the puppy who was still dopey having devoured a bowl of bread and milk and been inspected by jack and patch had now fallen asleep on the sofa poor little thing came from the national canine defence kennels in evesham lied ferdie as lysander still a bit pale and black under the eyes came downstairs rolling up the sleeves of a dark blue shirt god gregor knows how to iron you look gorgeous sighed marigold lucky georgie she wanted to come along to effect the introductions it had been her idea but ferdie didnt want any feminine compassion softening the hard bargain he intended to drive well at least nag georgie about the village fête said marigold we desperately need any clothes she doesnt wear any more for the nearly new stall georgie watched a dying wychelm showering yellow leaves on the burnt lawn it hadnt rained since the storm that had delayed flora the first day shed had singing coaching with rannaldini honeysuckle buds like bloody red hands clawed at the terrace walls the hay had been cut for a second time in rannaldinis field below the bales like yellow coffins symbolizing the death of the summer georgie had had a terrible day not a note of music or a word written having made a dropped telephone call earlier she had found out that julia was back in the cottage at eldercombe so guys compulsive mowing even though there was no grass would go on she didnt know what had made her agree to see lysander and ferdie the whole enterprise would distract her from work and cost a fortune and her confidence had taken such a battering shed never pull it off theres no way guy was going to stop seeing julia they were shooting clays across the valley in preparation for august bang bang bang like a relentlessly approaching army she turned on the prom it was the tchaikovsky violin concerto which guy was always playing probably because it was one of his and julias tunes georgie started to cry marigold looks well doesnt she said lysander as they stormed up a drive lit by hogweed and dogdaisies when you think what she looked like last february i cant wait to see georgie in nervous excitement lysander smoothed his windswept hair in ferdies wing mirror georgie however was in a far worse state than marigold had ever been even done up on their last notches her belt and her watch hung loose the stones of her engagement ring fallen inwards scratched against her wine glass like purple worms the veins rose on her thin hands her hair had lost its lovely titian glow and had no life like a dull village she hadnt shaved the back of one of her emaciated legs and her ankles were scratched with brambles from wandering aimlessly through the woods it also looked as though someone had grated coconut on the shoulders of her black tshirt getting drinks took ages im sorry this tonics flat she said when theyd finally sat down on the terrace theres a bottle in the fridge she added as ferdie leapt up im sorry the place is a mess mother courage my cleaner has gone to the costa brava for a week lovely dog said lysander as dinsdale wriggled along the bench until his head and shoulders were resting on georgies lap she winced as the dogs elbows dug into her fleshless thighs i spend my time taking grass seed out of his eyes which are only marginally more redrimmed than your own thought lysander we had a basset he told her theyre terrible at getting up in the morning you two should get along said ferdie returning with the tonic in the fridge he had also found blackening avocadoes tomatoes spotted with grey whiskery sweetcorn and mouldy cheese all the plants in the kitchen were dying phlox and nightscented stock drooped round the terrace unwatered this was definitely a house out of control lysander loathed the moment when ferdie told the wives where they were going wrong rannaldinis haybales reminded him not of coffins but of school trunks and sobbing into his pillow every night at prep school until every boy in the dormitory had hurled their regulation black laceup school shoes at him no wonder he was brain damaged he was still smarting over ferdies amusement how was he to know george eliot was a woman down below he could see rannaldinis horses seeking shade beneath a huge oak tree he must get arthur sound box rest had done no good hed turn him out when hed got him back to paradise i cant afford that an aghast georgie was saying as she rotated her leather bracelet marigold never said itd be that much inflations gone up three per cent since we sorted her out said ferdie and lysander must have a softtop ferrari i am due a big royalty cheque said georgie if it arrives when guys not here i suppose i could stash it away and pay you with that no sweat the important thing is to get guy back hes away monday to friday i presume georgie nodded but the coast isnt always clear guy keeps telling his lady friends that im lonely last night bloody hermione dropped in had three whiskies and scrambled eggs and i had to miss eastenders the bill after henry and capital city lysander turned even paler how dreadful couldnt you have taped them i was buggered if id show her im hooked on soaps she thinks im an utter philistine as it is then she had the cheek to tell me i wasnt unhappy just suffering from rejection and hurt pride the smug cow well if the lady friends roll up it doesnt matter ferdie was anxious to get down to basics itll be no bad thing if they tell guy lysander was here but guys always been turned on by my having other men said georgie bursting into tears when we were first married and i went on tour and had the occasional onenight stand he used to love hearing about it when i came home although he made me promise never to see them again i often made things up to excite him so he thinks im far more promiscuous than i was but hes never faced serious competition on his own doorstep interrupted ferdie the first thing to do is to start eating cut out the booze and get some sleeping pills i wont be able to work they make me so uncoordinated in the morning said georgie in panic youre not working anyway when he starts next week lysander will take you shopping dont buy anything strapless or sleeveless youre too thin at the moment and no minis either it looks too feverish and ferdie added sternly you must do something about that scurf it isnt scurf georgie frantically brushed her shoulders its sand from burying my head like an ostrich for so many years back at marigolds house lysander sank into the blackest gloom even marigold taping eastenders and the bill didnt raise his spirits hed last seen marigold six months ago when shed been down to eight stone looking terrific and was giving off sexual vibes like a mare in season she had also provided him with comfort and a home when he desperately needed it he had therefore carried an idealized picture of her in his head which had sometimes merged with that of his mother the reality was a letdown marigold was more matronly bossier all that fuss because theyd forgotten to ask georgie about the nearly new stall and much commoner than hed remembered her she was now having a double chinwag with ferdie as she painted bluebells on a pink chair gay aym afraid has been rather a swayne to georgie she was saying part of lysanders buzz at taking on georgie had been that it would give him the chance to bonk marigold again now he wasnt sure he wanted to and georgie had been harrowing he was fed up with selfobsessed desperately unhappy married women he wanted some fun clutching jack as he always did in moments of stress he announced i cant take georgie on shes too old and too far gone she ought to be in the funny farm oh please said marigold who was secretly relieved lysander didnt fancy georgie shes so low and you were so wonderful at bringing larry back ferdie noticed the picasso and the stubbs had vanished from the drawingroom wall hed always suspected larry was overleveraged it must have cost a bomb getting rid of nikki or keeping her quiet if hed perhaps weakened and seen her again marigold might well need lysanders services the puppy who was stretched out beside lysander on the sofa gave a whimper and flexed her toes in her sleep her skin drooped between each rib ferdie knew how to touch lysanders heart georgies like that little dog he said gently she may not have cigarette burns on her back but shes in just as bad a way give it a try for a week there was a long pause safe from the banging clays pigeons cooed contentedly in marigolds wood oh ok said lysander crossly come and have a look at the cottage ive found for you said marigold and then well have some dinner magpie cottage stood in the far side of dense woods on the edge of larrys land approached from the road by a rough carttrack its front garden consisted of neat squares of lawn bordered by iceberg roses pink rambler roses and purple clematis swarmed over the door inside there was a kitchen a dining room and drawing room knocked through and two bedrooms upstairs out at the back was another little lawn a scented flowerbed filled with white stocks pinks and tobacco plants a pond and a white bench under a walnut tree a fouracre field filled with dog daisies and red sorrel curved round the house and garden like a magnet its seriously nice arthurll love it said lysander who had cheered up hes so nosy hell be able to put his head in through all the downstairs windows itll need a few pennies spending on it admitted marigold judging by the smell a few pennies have been spent in it already said ferdie a keeper had it explained marigold hence the pong of ferret ayll get it painted and cleaned up and youll need a cooker would you prefer gas or electricity basically i dont cook said lysander but gas is better for lighting cigarettes you will keep the garden taydy wont you lysander paradayse has won the bestkept village award ten years runnin marigold worked fast furnishing the cottage with among other things a large brass fourposter blueticking sofas and chairs and a big wooden bishops chair shed found in a jumble sale eight days later lysander arthur jack tiny and little maggie moved in loot from grateful wives now included six polo ponies which lysander was keeping over at ricky francelynchs yard at eldercombe and mrs gunns promised yacht which ferdie had already swapped for a new softtop dark blue ferrari he felt it was important for people to be able to see lysander driving round paradise and besides he wanted to appropriate the red ferrari himself after moving in he and lysander went out to the heavenly host where they dined outside under the stars in the buddleiascented dusk taking off his jacket ferdie noticed lysanders post which hed left in his inside pocket i forgot to give you these fan mail still coming in for arthur and three letters from your father i dont want to see dad he was so horrible last time well at least open the one from your bank ferdie chucked a thick white envelope across the redcheck tablecloth are you determined to ruin my dinner gregor and i lost a hell of a lot of money in the casino at palma if only youd let me come home straight away open it said ferdie i promise youll be pleasantly surprised with shaking hands lysander tore open the envelope and holding up a candle scanned the contents for a long time his lips moving as he read growing paler and paler my god he whispered im overdrawn and ive got to pay interest what am i going to do the ferrarill have to go and the ponies and what about arthurs vet bill oh christ its in credit you jerk said ferdie and you made in interest just last month so you can bloody well buy me dinner it took him several minutes to convince lysander who promptly suggested they went out later and blew some of it at the nearest casino we will not said ferdie tartly ill be fired if i dont put in some work at the office and youve got to move in first thing on georgie heres the way i suggest you play it a heavy dew silvered the parched fields invisible larks carolled joyously in a sky as blue as marys robes however as lysander drew up at angels reach the following morning georgie maguire greeted him in a dressing gown and tears i thought guyd left me a little love note on the kitchen table she sobbed but when i looked it just said dont forget the dustbins and even worse hes written julias number without her name of course on the inside of his parish council file she waved a buff folder i felt so miserable ive written cuckoo beside it in biro and now i cant rub it out pas de problème taking the folder lysander tore off the corner with julias number and chucked it in the bin guy will notice that even more said georgie aghast say its mice or better still moths the waitress at the heavenly host says there is a plague of moths because of the drought there arent any clothes for them to eat because theyve all gone to marigolds nearly new stall said georgie but she stopped crying go and have a nice long bath and get dressed said lysander dumping several carrier bags on the kitchen table im going to make you porridge for breakfast no i promise its delicious with cream and treacle and then croissants with blackcherry jam dyou know how to make porridge asked georgie ive made enough bran mashes in my life you just read the directions then im going to take you to meet arthur and then well have lunch at the pearly gates to get people gossiping and then go shopping for lots of glamorous clothes baths better than rutminster oh look theres a little green van going up marigolds drive that van goes to all the big houses in paradise every monday said georgie sadly it takes away old plants and replaces them with shiny new ones with flowers they ought to do the same with wives now now reproved lysander youve got to stop sniping and cheer up the ice was broken by lysander reading all the directions wrong and making porridge so thick the spoon set in it like cement so they had three croissants each and gave the porridge to arthur when they returned much later in the day they discovered that the video that lysanderd thought was a jolly musical turned out to be an incredibly blue movie about rent boys as a result lysander sat through the entire video in mounting horror with his tshirt neck pulled up over his eyes only lowering it occasionally when georgie in fits of laughter said it was safe to look or when he wanted another drag at his joint i really like gays he kept saying in bewilderment who would have thought my friend gregor could do things like that im sorry georgie hes still only a child thought georgie but certainly a very endearing one when guy returned on friday he was relieved to find the house a lot tidier and flowers in the downstairs rooms but no little posy to welcome him in his dressing room nor any whisky nor dinner on nor any sign of georgie usually the sniping started as he crossed the threshold when she drifted down the backstairs from her study half an hour later she looked noticeably better as though an iron had smoothed out her face what are you doing here she asked in amazement i usually come home on friday said guy nettled is it friday i didnt realize o god i havent done anything for supper work must be going well guy was nonplussed coming home had recently been like being parachuted into an effing mine field next morning georgie rose early insisting she must walk a surprised and intensely irritated dinsdale before it grew too hot she put on a new and becoming tshirt and lots of lipstick and scent before she left then stayed away for two hours reading billboard and the face under a chestnut tree on the way home she carefully removed her lipstick with a kleenex and rubbed into dinsdales fur some of lysanders eau sauvage which theyd hidden in an oak tree on the edge of the wood this made her giggle so much she walked into the house looking happy for the first time in months returning from a sunday afternoon trip to get more petrol for the mower and ring julia guy was disconcerted to find a note from georgie just popped down to the apple tree to get some milk youve lived here for over four months reproved guy when she returned an hour later and you hadnt realized the apple tree is shut on sunday afternoon they have to have some time off arent i stupid said georgie blithely and weve got plenty of milk opening the fridge door guy confronted her with a regiment of white bottles i must be going senile on sunday night guy who was getting edgy heard georgie singing stranger in paradise in her bath christ the whole village must be able to hear that raw thrilling yelping voice ringing round the valley georgie hadnt sung in her bath since julia came down one of the great setbacks to guys amorous career had been having to sell the bmw to appease the bank and other creditors going to the station in a battered golf which had no airconditioning didnt have the same kudos and the loss of his car telephone had really clipped cupids wings at least hed got a phone card with his own personal number so he could put any calls made from telephone boxes or from home on the gallery number the new monitoring of calls was an awful bore he and julia had made plans to travel up to london together the following morning but it would mean him getting a later train than usual because julias babysitter couldnt reach her until halfpast eight terrified of rousing suspicion he waited until georgie emerged pink and reeking of floris from her bath before announcing that he intended catching the nine oclock train instead of the seven after a perceptible pause georgie said i wouldnt at least youll get a seat on the seven the nines packed out on a monday at least it gives me another hour in bed with you said guy gallantly thinking how much better georgie looked as she slithered into her cream satin nightdress and climbed into bed guy edged up and slid a hand round her left breast feeling his cock stiffening drowsy from a mogadon taken half an hour ago georgie curled up like an armadillo elbows on her hip bones knees up to her wrists shutting him out night darling she murmured and was asleep going into the bathroom next morning after a sweatily sleepless night trying to suppress that churning guilty excitement which overwhelmed him whenever he was going to see julia guy was brought up by a rim of foxbrown hairs round the bath why the hell was georgie shaving her legs to write songs up in her turret after bathing and dressing at lightning speed a skill learnt through adultery guy tracked georgie down in another bathroom thinking how vulnerable she looked with her waterdarkened hair streaming away from her thin white neck and fartoobumpy backbone he asked her what on earth she was washing her hair for radio paradise are coming to interview me at eleven their two hundred listeners arent going to see you no but the interviewer will i hate having dirty hair not for me you dont thought guy well id better go ok see you friday said georgie aiming the shower at her right temple to shift all the scurf bewildered not to be clung to and exhorted to ring soon or even made a cup of coffee guy had just gone into the utility room to get some fairy liquid soap and toothpaste for the flat over the gallery when the telephone rang in the kitchen but when he picked it up and said hallo it was promptly dropped at the other end having no idea that it was actually a dripping georgie ringing him from her private line up in her study guy was even more rattled which was what she had intended whoever had rung must have expected him to have left for the seven oclock by now and meant to catch georgie after an irksome week when he could hardly get georgie on the telephone he decided to catch her out by getting back earlier and was rewarded by having to stand all the way down in appalling heat crushed against a woman whod bought kippers for tea reaching home sticky and badtempered he found a dark blue softtop ferrari with a dog is for life not just for christmas sticker on the windscreen parked outside the front door at a contemptuous angle as though the owner had been in a frantic hurry to get inside despite its sleek exterior the car inside was a tip of tapes race cards chewed trainers old copies of the sun cigarette ash coke cans and polo balls on the terrace guy found a very suntanned incredibly goodlooking youth who looked vaguely familiar light brown curls clung to his smooth brown forehead and a black shirt to his marvellously elongated body georgie who was totally transformed in a clinging leotard which had just come into fashion and which flowed emeraldgreen into whiteandgreen flared trousers was gazing into his eyes as though shed like to be clinging to him as well her white ankles had turned a lovely gold and her toenails were painted softest coral a shaggy reddybrown puppy lay between her thighs and a halffull jug of pimms stood between her and the beautiful youth dinsdale thumped his tail but didnt rise only a beadylooking jack russell went into a possessive frenzy of yapping it is my fucking house thought guy as larry had done six months before hi darling said georgie happily dyou remember marigolds friend lysander hawkley he came to the launching of rock star resisting kicking jack in the ribs guy became extremely hearty and after discovering lysander had moved into the area said you must meet my daughter our daughter flora youre about the same age shes coming home this evening isnt she he added to georgie shes been staying in cornwall im expecting her to ring from the station any minute said georgie dyou want a drink er sir lysander got to his feet shall i get another glass guy was not amused by the slightly pisstaking sir nor by the strength of the pimms when lysander filled all their glasses been playing at the rutshire asked guy looking at his dirty white breeches and bare feet lysander nodded got any ponies six said lysander im keeping them at ricky francelynchs at eldercombe ive just been playing practice chukkas there guy flickered ricky francelynchs wife was a painter and a friend of julias they pushed prams together it was the sort of connection that might suddenly push georgie into orbit how was dinner with larry asked georgie idly thinking how hot middleaged and crumpled guy looked beside lysander guy flickered again he cancelled what did you do instead demanded georgie suddenly feeling desperately insecure gently lysanders foot nudged her ankle ferdies instructions were to be totally detached and never interrogate but guy was distracted by a huge emerald glittering on georgies newly manicured right hand isnt it lovely agreed georgie dreamily i liked it so much i decided to buy it with my royalty cheque maggie the puppy wriggled to be put down already plumper sleeker and gaining in confidence after a fortnight of human food and sleeping on lysanders bed she pounced on a yellow leaf from the dying wychelm and bounding up to dinsdale started swinging on his ginger ears raising a prehensile paw dinsdale sent her flying covered in dust she righted herself then seeing charity emerge from the long bleached grass on the side of the lawn took off after her maggee shouted lysander named after thatcher mocked guy who regarded himself as a champagne socialist no maggie tulliver in the mill on the floss said lysander with all the authority of one who has reached page four guy was fazed an adonis who read georgie had always been an intellectual snob he was dying for a pee and a change into something cooler but he was loath to leave these two together doing anything exciting this weekend georgie asked lysander removing a rose petal from his hair playing cricket for the village on sunday oh really guy perked up at a challenge were on opposing sides im playing for rannaldini lysander drained his glass you play a lot whenever work allows said guy i played for my old school and for cambridge and the free foresters what about you i havent played since school georgie i must go ill get you a bag so you can take the pimms fruit for arthur said georgie lysanders horse she added to guy hes such a duck lysanders determined to get him fit for the rutminster gold cup next spring standing up to hasten lysanders departure guy suddenly noticed several holes in his beloved lawn my god who did that i think dinsdales been trying to reach melanie in australia said georgie next minute maggie shot round the corner with a regale lily corm plus plant in her mouth pursued by a panting jack and dinsdale grinning lysander bent to kiss georgie goodbye thanks for the drink then lowered his voice and remember be happy and distant and no sniping oh theres rannaldinis helicopter returning said georgie as the great black crow landed on the other side of the wood guys temper was not improved when flora sauntered into the house twenty minutes later wearing nothing but flipflops and a ravishing shirt in prussianblue silk over bikini bottoms darling you were going to ring from the station said georgie hugging her i got a lift granias father was driving up to london how was cornwall asked guy you didnt get brown too hot to sunbathe said flora whod spent most of last week in rannaldinis bedroom in his villa outside rome lovely shirt said georgie enviously granias lied flora who as a leaving present had been taken to pucci youre always nicking peoples things exploded guy finding a genuine outlet for his irritation over lysander where the hells my free foresters sweater how should i know you had it last at that dinner party guy stopped as he remembered the occasion when julia armstrong was the guest of dishonour said georgie oh hell she wasnt supposed to snipe i gave it back the next day protested flora you did not spluttered guy im playing cricket on sunday and i need it noone needs a sweater in this heat after one has been making a lot of runs or bowling its easy to catch a chill borrow my pink shawl said flora kindly im not stuffy about lending things guy found that lysanders wide untroubled smile like the cheshire cat seemed to linger unnervingly after hed gone he was further rattled by two dropped telephone calls which hed no idea were rannaldini still in rome hoping to get flora then he realized it would be too late for him to ring julia ben would be home from london by now rannaldini himself did not play cricket an awkward ball on the hand could put him out of conducting for weeks but he liked occasionally to distribute largesse to the village and flew in just before the match on sunday to find that kitty had been slaving all night preparing a magnificent tea and bob harefield had conjured up a formidable side consisting mostly of london met musicians bussed down from london these included a cellist who was a demon bowler and the horn player rannaldini had sacked last march whod been hastily reinstated because he was a brilliant bat although the side would miss wolfgang and his centuries lustre had been added by bob himself who was a characteristically reliable wicketkeeper larry who hadnt been tested but who boasted a trial for surrey and guy who was by all accounts a class player other london met musicians would spend the afternoon playing in the blueandwhite bandstand right of the pavilion having wandered around finding fault with everything and ensuring none of his orchestra had more than one glass of wine at lunch rannaldini stalked upstairs to change the villagers were already streaming in by car or on foot they liked to gawp at valhalla jump the devils lair which had dropped two feet since floras leap get lost in the maze and marvel at rannaldinis famous alldelphinium bed whose blue spires seemed to touch the sky taking up position round the field perched on car bonnets before they grew too hot the men opened beer cans and the prettier girls stripped down to their bikinis in the hope that rannaldini might claim droit de seigneur of all the players guy was the most anxious to make his mark determined to upstage lysander he also wanted to get on to the village cricketclub committee which would give him an excuse both to do good and to get out and ring julia hed already joined the local labour party the parish council and the bestkept village committee his plans to ring julia on the way to the match however were scuppered by flora who was desperate to see rannaldini after a twentyfour hour absence cadging a lift ill drive she announced with all the assurance of one who had been manoeuvring rannaldinis mercedes round rome you will not guy snatched off the lplates im not risking our only car wheres mummy working shes coming later suddenly guy had a feeling georgie might be lingering to hear from lysander his worst fears were confirmed as he parked on the edge of the pitch and natasha immediately joined them very tanned and wearing a sloppy black tshirt and white shorts which showed off her long slender legs she looked unusually pretty and guy told her so why thank you mr seymour how was cornwall she added to flora brilliant christ look at that following floras gaze natasha saw lysander lounging against his blue ferrari with a telephone glued to his ear and a jack russell and a shaggy reddybrown puppy to each ankle he was wearing his sex is evil evil is sin tshirt were about to field he was saying or id come over miss you too you coming over or shall i nip over when hes in the field right see you later hes ringing georgie thought guy furiously blimey whos that said natasha in awe as lysander stripped off his tshirt to show a dark bronzed back still a little ribby from seasickness before he plunged into his cricket shirt next minute ferdie had roared up in lysanders red ferrari looking mafiaesque in a white panama and dark glasses to oversee operations afternoon lysander called guy remember i told you about flora well here she is with her friend natasha hi lysander turned round from greeting ferdie and over the din of jack and maggies excited yapping introduced his mate lysanders taken magpie cottage just across the valley for the polo season guy told the gaping flora and natasha so i hope you young people get together and bloody well stop pestering my wife was the unmistakable implication as guy strode off to the pavilion to find out the batting order natasha had had a miserable few weeks aware of rannaldinis increasing neglect she had expected to go abroad backpacking with flora during the holidays when flora had suddenly dropped out natashas mother was totally wrapped up in her new lover and her younger children bewildered starved of affection she gazed into lysanders smiling untroubled face and thought he was the bestand kindestlooking boy she had ever seen for the first time in weeks she removed her sloppy black tshirt to reveal an orange camisole top which left her splendid suntanned breasts to their own devices can i look after this adorable puppy she said scooping up a startled maggie thats really kind as long as you keep her in the shade said lysander keep an eye on jack he added to ferdie hes rabbitmad and theyre moving so slowly must be myxomatosis he keeps catching the poor little things some things like to be caught natasha threw lysander a trapping look then smiling at ferdie who was getting a picnic basket out of the ferrari do come and watch with us she had already noticed that ferdie was red faced and sweaty beneath his dark glasses and panama and that beneath his loose hawaiian shirt spare tyres billowed over his straining jeans but she had enough of her fathers manipulative nature to realize that a way to lysander would be through his friend five minutes lysander shouted paradises captain michael prescott landlord of the pearly gates and predictably nicknamed archangel mike he had become great buddies with lysander since he moved into paradise how did you and lysander meet natasha asked ferdie at school kneeling down to lace up lysanders other cricket boot ferdie murmured hows it going ok guys uptight but georgie keeps blowing it by showing how hurt she is here comes another of your enemies said ferdie as a large purple and yellow striped helicopter caused a ripple of interest as it landed by the pitch and out jumped larry lockton jewellery flashing in the increasingly hot sun if you come at me hostile ill fight you all the way he was yelling into his mobile get padded up larry called bob who was opening the batting with the reinstated horn player ive put you at number four on his way to the pavilion larry bumped into rannaldini whod just emerged from the house whos that boy by the blue ferrari asked rannaldini who knew perfectly well his spies were everywhere but who wanted to goad larry seeing lysander for the first time larry snarled with rage got some poncy name like alexander harley for some reason marigolds let magpie cottage to him in the old days larry would never have allowed such a thing but since his affair with nikki he had less clout extremely glamorous remarked rannaldini no wonder larry had been rattled nodding to acquaintances but not stopping rannaldini wandered over to the group round the ferraris which now included a slavering ideal homo wearing pale blue shorts and a little white sunhat papa natasha hugged him joyfully you must meet lysander while flora had slept off their sexual excesses in rome rannaldini had studied scores dictated letters and even held auditions on the balcony of his roman villa a tan as dark as treacle toffee was now enhanced by a white suit of such impeccable cut and panache that it instantly set him apart from the crowd both as host and warlord of the manor lysander gave a sigh of pure wonder prepared to detest rannaldini he hadnt counted on such charisma or blazing vitality hed never met anyone as smooth or as sexy that is the sharpest suit he stammered where did you get it some back street in singapore said rannaldini with a smile which softened the glittering deadly nightshade eyes god the boy was heartbreaking close up with a competitive surge of excitement rannaldini wondered if flora had fallen under lysanders spell and ignored her nodding on the other hand to ferdie and the ideal homo who said i agree with lysander that suit is to die for better watch out youre not run over by a snowplough mocked flora determined to disguise her longing wheres kitty asked lysander organizing tea doesnt she get to watch demanded flora disapprovingly kitty doesnt understand cricket said rannaldini didnt go to that kind of school added natasha bitchily the umpires mr brimscombe and rannaldinis dog handler clive neither of whom were paid to be impartial were leading the players on to the field when lysander was sent flying by two blond bullets marigolds sons jason was wearing a tshirt saying im afraid of noone in the world except my dad markie was carrying a cricket bat almost bigger than himself weve got rocky iv at home will you come and watch it after the match and will you bowl to us asked jason wait till the tea interval lysander tucked his billowing shirt into his white trousers ive got to field how was going back last term fine said markie mummy cried so much i felt i should cry too but only to make her feel better hows arfur come and see him he likes your fathers grazing come on lysander yelled the archangel mike hes sweet with kids as well thought natasha as lysander loped on to a pitch as emeraldgreen due to illicit sprinkling as georgies new leotard which flora was now wearing in the bandstand sweating members of the london met sawed their way through the trout quintet wishing they too were under water the group round the ferrari were now joined by marigold whod been working the crowd touting for the church fête she was feeling low because the jeans she and lysander had bought in february were now within three inches of doing up telling herself they would have been too hot was no help at all hows it going she whispered accepting a glass of ferdies champagne not as well as you and larry whispered ferdie but watch out for fireworks this afternoon i hope you girls are going to help at the church fête said marigold ill be abroad said flora hastily so will i said natasha shame and i thought you could decorate a room for free meredith marigold turned to the ideal homo it would make a lovely raffle prize it would not said meredith huffily theres a recession on dearie if you hadnt noticed having met lysander he was not going to forgive marigold for not calling him in to redecorate magpie cottage talk about the reincarnation of the paradise lad he muttered to flora as he parked his small bottom beside hers on the bonnet of ferdies ferrari the wine waiter of the heavenly host opened the bowling squaring his shoulders bob hit him for four oh well clouted said marigold who got very hearty on such occasions dont eat all ferdies jaffa cakes boys is hermione here asked flora who wanted to suss out the opposition no thank god shuddered meredith shes playing salome in new york when she gets to the seventh veil the entire audience rears up and yells no no keep it on as rannaldini was now well out of earshot everyone howled with laughter must be bliss for bob having her away said marigold bliss bobbys got a good body hasnt he oh well hit thatll be a six bob is nice looking actually admitted flora pity hes losing his hair hes just receding to match the recession bobbys always been trendy giggled meredith oh good shot as bob snaked a single past first slip this is going to be a rout poor paradise more like inferno in this weather it was getting hotter a silver haze writhed above the pitch a sweep of mauve willow herb wilted beneath the smouldering ashgrey woods which bordered the ground birds exhausted with feeding their young were mute ferdie running with sweat wished he was thin enough to remove his shirt and get brown like all the other blokes he couldnt take his eyes off natasha hed never seen anyone so pretty full of patter normally he was suddenly so shy he could only fill her glass and ply her with cherries as dark red and shiny as her lips a hundred for no wicket the village were getting tetchy theyd hoped for a glimpse of georgie whod been singularly elusive since shed moved in rumours of marriage problems spread by mother courage were circulating faster than greyhounds on a track guy however was much in evidence looking very cheerful batting only at number seven rather to his irritation he was now being sweet to the wives of the fielding paradise players admiring their tans and their babies making a manly show of reluctance when asked to sign autographs intimating that he hoped to be playing for paradise this time next year by contrast larry who was going in at number three was sitting in the shade furiously shaking the sunday times business section hed run out of people to shout at on the telephone and it didnt look as though this stupid opening partnership would ever get out he was livid to see mr brimscombe umpiring the judas after the massacre of the honeysuckle round floras bedroom mr brimscombe had been tempted to return to his old boss but had decided that larry was a badtempered bugger the paradise pearl cutting had taken in rannaldinis conservatory and the promise of a fat rise and an even taller mower from which he could look over the hedge at natasha sunbathing topless by the pool had persuaded him to stay on the situation was getting desperate a flustered paradise had started dropping catches lysanders supporters had moved back into the shade under the mulberry trees and when he was sent to field on the boundary near them barracked him because his side was doing so badly can you ring ladbrokes for me he shouted to ferdie my cards on the dashboard cover point just told me blue chip babys a cert in the can you put on five hundred pounds on the nose in the light of his new bank balance lysander had considerably upped his stakes rich as well murmured meredith excitedly spoof you for him sighed natasha bloody stupid putting on that kind of money snapped ferdie you got anything to eat called lysander whod already accepted an iced carlsberg ill make you a sandwich natasha leapt down off the bonnet would you like chicken or smoked salmon mulberries were falling on the parked cars the crowd were melting bob and the horn player had put on if someone doesnt get out soon grumbled marigold larry wont get a knock god shes pretty mumbled ferdie as natasha sauntered on to the pitch with lysanders sandwich quite said meredith whod hung two pairs of cherries over his ears like earrings but an awful bitch lysander however only had time for one bite things were getting so desperate that the archangel michael beckoned him over you bowl a little cant do worse than this lot mike lobbed the ball at him wickets harder than rannaldinis heart try and keep the ball up to the bat this should be interesting said ferdie as he finished off lysanders sandwich bowlers name shouted the scorer hawkley yelled mike the crowd particularly the women perked up so this was the gorgeous man whod moved into magpie cottage the london met bored with playing classical music launched into hey goodlookin meredith waved in time with a chicken drumstick hi teddy lysander grinned at mr brimscombe as he paced out his run the two had become great mates when lysander was sorting out marigold lysander had been a nice young lad always prepared to carry logs or dustbins even if he couldnt mow in a straight line his shirt billowing out longlegged and looselimbed as a west indian lysander loped up to the wicket a split second later the ball had removed bobs middle stump the crowd exploded in joy and relief which turned to illdisguised mirth as larry came in to bat he had padding on his thighs chest and gut and he was wearing ian botham gloves astraturf trainers with plastic studs a shortsleeved cricket shirt that was much too tight for him a helmet and a face guard his bat had never been used fortunately the laughter was drowned by loud applause as bob came back with seventyeight runs on the board what sort of a ball was it asked larry pompously i think it was a red one bob mopped his brow its like a furnace out there and heres larry lockton said the commentator who were told had a trial for surrey as larry made a prolonged fuss about taking guard lysander walked back rubbing the ball up and down his trousers oh to be that ball sighed meredith lysanders second ball hit larry on the snowwhite pad owzat howled the paradise slips out intoned mr brimscombe to the noisy chagrin of marigold bollocks bellowed larry mouthing like a gorilla behind his face guard out confirmed clive the doghandler who didnt like larry any better dont think youll ever get your fucking job back roared larry as he stalked back to the pavilion must have been a trial to surrey rather than for them giggled meredith as marigold rushed off to give solace lysander had taken a devastating five wickets for nine runs and ended his second over with london met looking suddenly in trouble when guy came in immediately the band launched into rock star mum is clever admitted flora it does sound lovely played by a proper orchestra mr rock star himself crackled the loudspeaker no mean cricketer if my spies tell me right with his athletes stride his powerful body his strong handsome face and arcticblond hair glinting in the sunlight guy looked worthy to have pop songs dedicated to him he wished ju ju was watching and where the hell was georgie who could blame him being unfaithful to a woman who never gave him any support then just as he was taking guard he saw her arrive with dinsdale wandering round the wooded side of the pitch past lysander who was now fielding in the deep again her newly washed hair was tied back with a blue ribbon and she was wearing a duckeggblue shirt tied under her slender midriff and yesterdays flowered trousers and if im not mistaken heres georgie maguire herself mrs rock stars just arrived in time said the commentator and the band struck up again guy kicked off with a wristy single to loud applause then the tenor who had the reputation for being a big hitter blocked four balls then clouted a six over lysanders leaping outstretched fingers deep into the dark midgy wood behind next moment lysander georgie and dinsdale followed by a racingup yapping maggie and jack disappeared in search of it at first the players were happy to sit down and rest then all eyes were turned to the wood as dinsdale emerged carrying the ball waddling across the pitch he proudly dropped it to shouts of laughter at his masters feet as the field changed over it was lysanders turn to bowl again and all the paradise fielders yelled for him to come back because the ball had been found then everyone waited and waited and waited until finally a good five minutes later lysander and georgie came out of the wood grinning from ear to ear lysander was ostentatiously wiping off the remains of georgies peachpink lipstick with the back of his hand and georgies hair had escaped the blue ribbon once more the whole crowd burst out laughing and the band struck up if you go down in the woods today youre sure of a big surprise at rannaldinis instigation guy was shaking so much that lysander proceeded to bowl and catch him with his first ball for only one run flora had wandered over to join rannaldini by the pavilion as guy stormed past youre a single parent now dad she called out as lysander was being free in the forest with mum he should wear your sweater rannaldinis eyes sparkled with evil amusement poor guy was absolutely livid never had he needed his greenandmagenta sweater as a badge of former achievement more a reporter from the rutminster news whod witnessed the whole scene wondered if it would be an idea to ring dempster about the rocking of rock star larry had suddenly cheered up hugely your toy boy seems to have transferred his affections to georgie he told marigold nastily pity wolfies not here to make some runs for you flora murmured to rannaldini arent you sorry now you pinched his girlfriend it was worth eet have you missed me a leetle no said flora then looking up at him from under her thick eyelashes i missed you a lot once the london met and your father are safely in the field we can slope off to the tower tabloid will keep watch london met was all out for followed by tea in the great hall which was blissfully cool white tablecloths had been laid over big oak tables huge vasefuls of redhot pokers and early scarlet dahlias flamed like beacons in each corner kitty had provided a wonderful tea her sandwiches made of smoked salmon prawns swimming in real mayonnaise scrambled eggs filled with herbs and the most delicate turkey breast contained more filling than bread there were also homemade scones to eat with mulberry jam and clotted cream walnut lemon and chocolate cakes beautifully decorated on top and groaning with butter icing inside and a huge rainbow cake on whose white icing she had piped in blue london met v paradise everything had been done to please rannaldini it was a pity that because of the heat more praising went on than eating i cant go in there whimpered georgie whod already been mobbed by autograph hunters as she saw the crowds milling in the great hall guys about to murder me for disappearing ill stay with you the whole time said lysander soothingly actually im bloody hungry very gothic this house isnt it nor could the heat of hellfire put percival hillary the vicar of all saints paradise off his grub a consummate cadger of other peoples food and drink with a fish face redder than ferdies ferrari and breath that could crack a safe at fifty yards he was now piling his plate with sandwiches and crying in a fluting voice what a wonderful wonderful spread what a feast cried his wife joy who was always described as a tower of strength a bosomless chatterbox with a ringing laugh she spent her time bullying the unwilling into charity work and hovering round paradise flushing out lapses of behaviour like miltons god i always feel i should wear my figleaf outside my shorts when joys about grumbled meredith it was a running battle between joy marigold and lady chisleden who actually ran paradise despite her high moral tone however joy hillary shared her husbands weakness for goodlooking men and was potty about guy guy was only prepared to be buttonholed by her for so long yanking georgie from lysanders side hissing how dare you show me up in front of the whole of paradise he shoved her at joy hillary joyful my dear id like you to meet my wife georgie a staunch vegetarian who was systematically opening and casting aside sandwiches which contained meat eggs or fish joy told georgie that shed just been saying to guy that she couldnt understand why there were so many wild oats about this year symbolic of the times said georgie bleakly and when joy hillary looked blank men cant resist sowing them noone sowed them said joy patiently the field behind us has been sprayed for twenty years but weve still got wild oats at least its better than that ghastly rape said her husband percival coming over on the pretext of introducing himself but actually to cut a huge slice out of kittys utterly delectable chocolate cake alas he was just about to plunge in the knife when dinsdale lifted his big mournful face on to the table and sucked in the entire cake georgie burst out laughing then seeing their horrified deprived faces i better absent myself from the scene of the crime and go and congratulate kitty even in her current state of selfabsorption georgie was appalled by kittys appearance shed put on weight and her reddened eyes gazed into space as she filled cup after cup from a huge brown teapot she was always quiet when rannaldini was around but she seemed to have lost all her warmth and her interest in other people she didnt even smile over the story of dinsdales pilfering the chocolate cake and when georgie ducked under the table to stand beside her and thank her for letting flora spend so much time at valhalla kitty said nothing just lowered her eyes you ok kitty youre shaking im fine how could she tell georgie that her daughter was having a raging affaire with rannaldini a month ago when poor wolfie had sobbed all night like the paradise lad kitty had steeled herself to tell rannaldini that he shouldnt pinch his sons girlfriend particularly when she was thirty years his junior and still an impressionable child whereupon rannaldini had launched into one of his petrifying tirades screaming that wolfie was an insanely jealous paranoid fantasist who had to make up stories to justify flora falling out of love with him and how dare kitty virtually accuse him of child molesting he had punished her ever since by withdrawing all affection and kitty was nearly at breakingpoint almost worst of all she had previously heroworshipped flora for sticking up for her so often but in the end flora had not just taken her part but her husband from her as well and now kitty had spilt tea all over the snowwhite tablecloth because rannaldini and flora were approaching flora in fact was starving georgie didnt feed her family much and it was a long time since breakfast hi kitty she said in delight how are you ok kitty spilled even more tea here let me take that brickie guy seized the teapot as though it was a large fractious baby kitty couldnt quiet ill fill the cups you chat to flora ill just get more ot water frantically kitty seized a big silver jug ave a sandwich she shoved a plate at flora oh yum im so hungry cried flora then found that suddenly she wasnt because fat hopeless redeyed defeated kitty looked absolutely wretched and couldnt even meet her eyes she knows about us thought flora in horror and kitty had been so sweet to her but as she felt rannaldini just behind her surreptitiously caressing the bare sweating insides of her thighs such was her longing she couldnt stop herself pressing back against him rannaldinis little wifes done so well said joy hillary taking a third piece of walnut cake we must utilize her properly at the fête perhaps we should take her off bricàbrac and put her in charge of teas as kitty bolted down the dark passages to the kitchen lysander leaning nonchalantly on a suit of armour blocked her path dyou remember me we met at marigolds and at the rock star party here let me take that jug stunning tea ive stuffed myself so much i wont be able to bat my mother hated doing cricket teas she never produced more than a bought cake and curling marmite sandwiches he found it a relief to mention pippa even in a faintly derogatory fashion and to find that it didnt hurt so much kitty raised her eyes the terribly strong spectacles magnified the inflamed lids and the redthreaded eyes grotesquely god she looked unhappy marigold told me about your muvver she stammered she was so young you must miss her somefink awful lysander who often picked up vibes others missed had noticed rannaldini touching up georgies sexylooking daughter what chance did kitty have rannaldini was a shit after all he decided as he carried the jug of boiling water back to the hall natasha who couldnt imagine what lysander could have to say to her boring stepmother charged up with ferdie whom lysander introduced to kitty ferdie and kitty might do rather well together decided lysander before they had time to find out guy had butted in with a plate of sliced rainbow cake you must eat something yourself brickie why dyou call her that asked natasha because shes an absolute brick said guy warmly how many bricks are there in a tower of strength asked georgie earning herself a dirty look from guy as she joined the group well be eating this stuff for weeks rannaldini told his wife as he glared at the stillloaded tables people were lighting cigarettes and drifting back to the pitch youve overcatered as usual kitty itll all go snapped lysander ill come and help you wash up kitty its nice and cool in here lysander called out marigold you were going to bowl to the boys youre bloody not hissed ferdie youre being paid to rattle guy stick to georgie but as soon as lysander had sat down beside georgie on a bench under a chestnut tree the archangel mike ordered him to pad up and open the batting instantly his seat was taken by larry whom georgie had been avoiding all afternoon hows the album coming on ok guy said it was going really well and you might deliver early pigs might fly snapped georgie my guess is that things are rough at the gallery said larry and you should help out by finishing as soon as possible guys always looked after you in the past georgie its a conspiracy im being forced to rush things cried georgie hysterically guy put you up to this over dinner guy cancelled announced larry he had too much on georgie started to shake in a sentence larry had chucked her into the pits youre psyching yourself into this block he went on bullyingly all we want is something warm sincere and happy that kids and older folk can relate to just like rock star i wrote rock star when i was happy hissed georgie how can i be warm loving and sincere when my hearts breaking and my worlds fallen apart taking the field guy noticed georgie leaping up and sending a deckchair flying as she stumbled away from larry christ he hoped larry hadnt mentioned his cancelling dinner he should have warned him but as a bishops son he found it tacky saying could you possibly tell georgie it was you who ducked out could you possibly donate half a dozen signed copies of rock star to the fête as prizes joy hillary met georgie head on no i fucking cant screamed georgie contrary to what you might think i dont get my own albums free and i dont get the full whack every time a record is sold remind me to ask your husband to hand over the entire church collection to the musicians benevolent society next christmas oh look lysanders batting excuse me and she walked off leaving joy unjoyfully mouthing guys lied to me yet again thought georgie whats the point of finishing an album to appease their joint bank manager when he wont give julia up sod angels reach shed rather live in a council flat with lysander it was a second before she registered that the field had changed over and guy was bowling holding the ball in that strong right hand that had given her so much pleasure pounding up to the crease on those strong muscular legs that had once been nightly wrapped round her georgie gave a wail of misery a moment later as if to avenge her lysander had hit the ball in the air soaring like a lark into the rippling gold wheat fields sending the london met players searching among the wild oats paradise were in heaven theyd never made a decent showing against the london met before soon the london met musicians who relied on their hands too for their livelihood had moved to the outfield and guy larry bob and the bighitting tenor were nervously surrounding the wicket but to no avail whack whack whack went the ball over the boundary and each time lysander scored runs the cheers increased until even the london met players abandoned themselves to the voluptuous pleasure of watching a mortal become a god having played see the conquering hero comes the band swung into the british grenadiers some talk of alexander and some of hercules of hector and lysander and such brave men as these sang the hardhitting tenor and all the crowd particularly the vicar joined in the chorus after fiftyfive minutes paradise were for no wicket lysander had made a century shaken hands with the opposition players and the two umpires and waved his bat at the ecstatic crowd then almost contemptuously as though he was saying now im off to romp with your wife he hit the easiest catch in the world to a crimsonfaced dripping guy and sauntered grinning back to the pavilion before mr brimscombe had even given him out the local reporter was so busy racing back to the office to reset the huge headline paradise lost that he forgot to ring dempster guy then had to field impotently in the deep for the next forty minutes while paradise somewhat laboriously made the remaining runs and lysander wandered off into the woods with georgie trailing dogs both georgie and guy were far too preoccupied to notice that flora had disappeared with rannaldini i wish georgie maguire hadnt left so early i was hoping to brief her about opening the fête complained percival hillary who was actually much more interested in getting a closer look at lysander the sun must have unhinged her said joy first she rudely refused to give me any rock star albums then i approached her again and asked her most politely for some very personal item that she doesnt want any more that we could raffle and she said how about my husband and flounced off im sure she was joking im not and when you think what a tower of strength guy has been i didnt take to her and as for that dreadful thieving dog one of the hottest augusts of this century resulted in paradise drying up and the fields cracking open like vast jigsaw puzzles even the evenings were stifling as the music of the promenade concerts drifted down the valley on the rare occasions rannaldini was home to listen to a prom he criticized nonstop measuring the applause which would certainly never be as deafening nor as long as the ecstatic tearful ovation he would receive when he conducted the london met in verdis requiem at the beginning of september as rannaldini was now perfectly confident of floras affection he decided to irritate guy and larry and distract natasha from his own affaire by inviting lysander and ferdie to lunch on the sunday after the cricket match lysander who wanted to go to the gatcombe horse trials only accepted for ferdies sake not that ferdie was making any progress with natasha it was plain from the way she was gazing at lysander as he lounged on the terrace before lunch drinking bloodies and laboriously reading mystic meg in the news of the world that it was him she was after by comparison ferdie looked awful there were black rings under his normally merry calculating brown eyes he had several spots his gruelling schedule allowed him no time to sunbathe or take exercise his ankles had swelled up in the heat and his chin spilled over the collar of his hawaiian shirt worn outside his trousers to cover his gut his chief asset his fast line of patter had dried up like the paradise streams he could only gaze and blush piggy in lord of the flies thought rannaldini then letting his hand stray briefly across lysanders flawless brown cheekbones he murmured im amazed youve got so far in life without duelling scars lunch laid out under a spreading chestnut tree almost made up for missing gatcombe spinach roulade lobster vast langoustine and a huge plate of oysters ferried in from bristol that morning by rannaldinis helicopter ive never had oysters before they look like poached dishcloth said flora as rannaldini tipped half a dozen on to her plate and sprinkled them with lemon juice ugh its like swallowing ones own phlegm an acquired taste rannaldinis leg moved against hers on his right sat hermione who with bob were the only wrinklies invited and who spent most of the lunch happily reading out faxes from new york of her salome reviews which despite merediths sniping had been excellent bob who never ate much spent his time cracking lobster claws and peeling langoustine for hermione and trying to bring ferdie and even more kitty into the conversation this left lysander at the mercy of natasha who went on and on about her famous mother and the famous people she knew and how embarrassing it was having the name rannaldini on her suitcases because everyone knew whose daughter she was and how lysander must come and stay in the villa in como only when theyd eaten most of an incredibly light glazedapricot tart made by rannaldini and were drinking coffee and brandy did lysander feel able to escape to watch the last horses at gatcombe on television but he found when he switched on that the competition was over and the leading riders were waiting for the presentation after the appalling heat and the terrible spills and thrills they seemed blissfully happy to be alive lysander wistfully thought how young they looked in their dusty boots and breeches many of them now wearing nothing above the waist but their coats and their white stocks there was lysanders hero david green so much the most handsome his red coat not clashing remotely with his suntan and there was mark todd towering above the others with his charming lugubrious livedin face and there was the winner mary thomson crying with joy and hugging her brave horse in gratitude lysander wiped his eyes what the fuck was he doing wasting his life hanging round rich bitches who were far too selfobsessed to care about anything else he started as he felt a hand on his shoulder it was rannaldini for once his cruel sensual face was surprisingly gentle poor boy you mees zee real work with horses come and see mine the sun had lost its fiercest heat so theyd decided to go for a ride except kitty who was petrified of horses and who would anyway be better employed clearing up leave her whispered hermione when lysander tried to persuade her to come too shes only sulking because im here lysander hoped the bloody bitch would fall off but irritatingly hermione who had been brought up on a farm in south africa rode beautifully and as she rode she sang boot saddle to horse and away with her lovely voice echoing round the woods rannaldini obviously enjoyed dominating the vicious big black prince of darkness a brilliant steeplechaser who had won many races he had come second to his greatest rival penscombe pride rupert campbellblacks top national hunt horse in last years rutminster gold cup having spent a summer resting and terrorizing any rambler and particularly kitty who strayed into his field he was being slowly got fit for the next season he was now having a battle of wills with rannaldini who wanted to rub his leg against floras without the prince of darkness savaging the old gymkhana pony of natashas she was riding bareback lysander noticed rannaldini put his hand right up floras skirt when he gave her a leg up bob who was competent and ferdie who was petrified but determined not to show it had been given two of rannaldinis hunters who were also getting fit and who were less blown out with grass than in more fertile years sadly ferdies courage did nothing to further his cause with natasha a wobbling maneclinging lump of dough he was a sad contrast to lysander who rode with the dash of a cossack and with hands even lighter than rannaldinis pastry allotted fräulein mahler a young bay mare who had already been very successful over hurdles lysander put her effortlessly over logs and little hedges this is a seriously good horse he told rannaldini you ought to run her in the whitbread or the rutminster next year perhaps youd like to ride her said rannaldini christ i would but basically ive got other plans and he told rannaldini about arthur this is like something out of tolstoy sighed flora as they cantered across the platinum stubble rannaldinis farm workers were still harvesting tiny conkers were swelling on the chestnuts down drifted from thistle and willowherb mingled with the blue hazy evening cows lumbered clumsily to their feet like schoolboys when the headmaster comes into the room finally they reached rannaldinis lake at the bottom of the valley its flawless azure surface being ruffled by splashing rottweilers the level had dropped dramatically only at the waters edge were wild flowers forgetmenots frogbit and soft mauve spearmint still growing my livestock is dependent on thees water rannaldini told bob dyou think it will dry up never has ive no idea how deep it is in the centre in answer lysander dug his heels into fräulein mahlers sweating sides and galloped her into the lake with a huge splash down down hardly rippling the water until lysander had completely disappeared and all that could be seen were the fräuleins brown nostrils just above the water hell drown screamed natasha thats a valuable horse said hermione outraged help him someone pleaded natasha then both horse and rider emerged on the other side with lysander roaring with laughter even when the mare shook herself like a dog he didnt shift in the saddle his eyelashes were separated like starfish his hair slicked back from his face his bare brown back glistened weed dripped from his jeans belt and from the fräuleins bridle as he waited for them to catch up like venus from the foam sighed bob but much more beautiful purred rannaldini we know who to use if we ever want to make a film of the paradise lad it was so hot that both horse and rider were dry by the time they got home natasha was adrift with love flora and hermione were equally diverted but both mildly irked that lysander had shown nothing beyond politeness towards either of them rannaldini rode the prince of darkness home in silence pondering how he could manipulate this charming but clearly naïve boy to his own ends over at angels reach georgie looked out of the drawingroom window in that particular despair that overwhelms unhappily married women in the country on sunday nights knowing there wont be anyone even to row with until friday guy had just announced he was going to london shed been so bitchy she couldnt blame him for the first time since march rock star had dropped out of the top twenty nor were her spirits raised when a dark blue ferrari drew up at the front door in a cloud of dust hi mum shouted flora elongated as a piece of asparagus between two slices of brown bread she lolled between ferdie and lysander in the pistachiogreen dress which georgie had just spent hours looking for boot saddle to whore and away sang lysander in his high tuneless falsetto see you lot in a bit said flora as she clambered over ferdie with much giggling georgie yelled lysander but georgie had slammed down the window babbling on about her gorgeous day flora met her mother in the hall lysander rides so well and poor ferdie so badly im afraid natashas been put off for life and she went on to describe the plunge into the lake stupid exhibitionist said guy coming downstairs with his suitcase as a result rannaldini wants lysander to ride for him supperll be ready in half an hour said georgie i thought we could watch howards way and have supper on our knees only possible because guy who disapproved of soaps would be gone oh mum im sorry im going out with ferdie and lysander they want me to meet arthur and then were going to the cinema good idea guy was absolutely delighted if you buck up ill drop you off on the way thats really kind not wanting to witness her mothers disappointment flora bolted upstairs still stupid exhibitionism said guy pouring himself a weak whisky but im glad lysander and flora have got together theyre the right age somehow georgie managed not to cry until theyd left she knew guy was off to see julia hed deliberately played squash with larry after tea as an excuse to shower and change before going to london she was ashamed how depressed she felt that suddenly guy and flora were getting on but most painful of all was that flora had obviously got off with lysander georgie had grown so fond of him over the past three weeks although despite guys suspicions he hadnt laid a finger on her admittedly when theyd disappeared into the wood yesterday hed squeezed her waist and with his lovely infectious laugh said shall we play it for real but she knew he was joking young boys didnt fancy hoary wrinklies although it was clear from the suicidal way she felt now the reverse was possible she couldnt even win guy back like marigold had recovered larry she was an utter utter failure ferdie returned to fountain street three days later in even lower spirits hed just taken natasha out for a ludicrously expensive dinner her first course of two scallops had cost twentyfive pounds shed spent the whole evening quizzing him about lysander and bitching about kitty unfortunately ferdies increasing dislike did nothing to diminish his lust lunging with all the finesse of a grisly bear he was rewarded with a slapped face it was after midnight but the telephone was ringing as he let himself in hope that it might be natasha apologizing gave way to fury when it turned out to be lysander oh ferd im so depressed i dont think this campaigns going to work guys showing no sign of giving up julia and georgies really ratty with me and shes losing weight again basically i think we should scrap the whole thing and pay her her money back dont be so fucking wet ferdie had already invested his per cent rome wasnt built in a day try a bit harder take georgie on some decent jaunts youve got the church fête on saturday havent you the party of the decade said lysander gloomily i want to go clubbing ferd i need some fun youre to beat guy at everything shooting chucking coconuts tug of war guessing the weight of the pig youll have to tell me how much natasha weighs shuddup and youve got to win the bestchocolatecakemadebyaman competition dont talk bollocks i cant cook oh jesus howled ferdie so i have to make it for you i cant get down till late friday get the recipe from marigold georgies mood did not improve the following week when marigold kept borrowing lysander to pick up stuff for the fête and then roping him in to set up stalls why the hell should she pay lysander to give marigold kudos having savagely prayed for rain on the day georgie was ashamed to find her hopes fulfilled but the rain only chucked down for a couple of hours leaving puddles all over the rockhard ground and the weather hotter and closer than ever georgie found opening the fête even more frightening than her own launching party embarrassed to show the world such a diminished version of the abandoned beauty on the rock star album she was also desperate to shine in front of hermione marigold joy hillary and most of all guy particularly as she had repeatedly refused both his and the vicars offers to rehearse in front of them if by some miracle she did it well she didnt want them taking the credit guy spent saturday morning commuting between angels reach and the vicarage every vegetable had been dug up in the garden to find longer carrots and larger marrows than rannaldinis larrys and bobs hed even tried his hand at some elderflower wine but competition was at its fiercest in the class for the best chocolate cake made by a man guy had baked four cakes last night before he was satisfied larry was rumoured to have enlisted the help of anton mosimann and to be flying the cake down from london rannaldini had made his cake last weekend and kitty having removed it from the deep freeze had just delivered it to the flowertent wondering if she should leave tabloid on guard she now despondently surveyed her bricàbrac and was wondering how she was going to sell cracked s single bookends cake knives jigsaw puzzles of norwegian fjords purple plastic roses and a flowered vase she had given hermione last christmas when lysander came rushing up kitty kitty help help ferdies going to murder me he stayed up all night making me the perfect chocolate cake and ive just dropped it in a puddle kitty giggled they decided against pinching a cake from joy hillarys stall next door in case the cook responsible recognized it but by the time kitty had found a clean plate and a white lacy paper mat squeezed out the cake shoved it together disguised the cracks with cadburys flake sprinkled on top and written a new card lysanders offering looked quite presentable god youre a star he hugged her i dont know how you made all those cakes for that cricket tea it took ferdie and me till four in the morning he looked at his watch now georgies opening the fête at twofifteen that gives us ages to have a bet on the onethirty and a quick one or three in the pearly gates come on i cant said kitty sadly i promised marigold and joy id watch their stalls she refused all lysanders entreaties so he was reduced to boosting her turnover by buying an old fox fur as a present for jack and maggie and insisting she kept the change from twenty pounds its for the spire oh jesus here comes marigold i dont want to blow up any more balloons and with that he shot into the pearly gates back at angels reach georgie was livid with guy for insisting she wear a dress her only presentable one had disappeared with flora why the hell flora needed a pistachiogreen silk tunic to go backpacking georgie couldnt imagine and shed have to shave her legs and put clinique on her varicose veins ill just ring marigold to check everythings on target we must leave by five to two said guy as georgie switched on her hair dryer switching it off a second later to spray on some mousse she heard guy say hi its me marigold ok georgie asked later as she ringed her eyes with dark brown pencil couldnt be bothered to ring her i heard you saying hi its me then as guy put on his mentalnurse face i did guy you must be going mad i didnt ring anyone promise to go and see dr benson on monday unearthed from a black dustbin bag in the attic georgies grey denim midi was wrinkled like a rhino if i composed classical music it wouldnt matter she thought savagely everyone would say i looked charmingly eccentric why are you spraying scent on the back of your knees to open a village fête asked guy i might meet a ravishing dwarf snarled georgie you are not bringing dinsdale no dinsdale no me you can open the fucking fête yourself yellow leaves dislodged by the rain tumbled out of the limes around the village green the high street was hung with redandwhite bunting parked cars glittered like shingle in the newly cut barley field next to the vicarage sheltered by high walls seldom exposed to the winds which swept up from the bristol channel the hillarys garden was a topcoat warmer than valhalla or paradise grange it boasted a yellow catalpa covered in big creamy white flowers and two massive horse chestnuts whose leaves touching the ground like cardinals robes added a suitable ecclesiastical note a rainbow of different coloured clematis rose out of a bed of lavender against the ancient lichened walls of the house the crowds already milling round the stalls agreed on joy hillarys green fingers but chuntered that the vicar must have been sprinkling illicitly to produce such a perfect lawn turning all that wine he drinks back into water suggested bob harefield whose bald head had tanned as brown and freckled as a farm egg and who in his quiet steadily efficient way had achieved far more than anyone else having set up most of the stalls priced the goods and refereed squawking matches he was now taking money at the gate you two ought to get in free he told georgie and guy who insisted on paying how good of you to come chorused the vicars wife marigold and lady chisleden as they all surged forward to receive the personality the recently drenched grass pegged their highheeled advance we dont really allow dogs said joy hillary remembering dinsdale without enthusiasm well at least keep him on a lead said marigold a quick whisk round the stalls to thank our caring helpers said lady chisleden and then wed better proceed with the opening poor kitty was running bricàbrac singlehanded because last years miss paradise who was supposed to be helping her hadnt turned up whats this said meredith waving a cardboard disk you put it at the bottom of your pans to stop fings boiling over pity you cant stand rannaldini on it ive just bought a first edition of a book called the autobiography of a cad for p written by every husband in paradise said georgie pausing in front of them joy hillary shot her an alarmed look marigold had promised that georgie could be relied on to behave but she had a wild look about her and she must have slept in that dress i think you know kitty rannaldini said lady chisleden a tower of strength an absolute bricàbrac giggled meredith grubbing around in a cardboard box he discovered the purple plastic tulips and handed them to georgie just in case marigold forgets your bouquet dear dont be silly meredith snapped joy hillary bustling georgie on to the plant stall where marigold was urging people to buy plants to enhance their bestkept gardens weve got some lovely heartsease she told georgie take more than a plant to ease mine come and guess the weight of the pig interrupted joy hillary hastily and then i think well have your opening allo georgie yelled mother courage ot isnt it people are passing out like ot cakes after the rain the wasps were beginning to divebomb fruit and the jam tarts on the cake stall i had a coffee cake in here a minute ago announced lady chisleden gazing into a carrier bag in bewilderment on the way to the platform georgie caught sight of ferdie who was having a ghastly afternoon giving pony rides on tiny who maddened by flies and general illtemper had bitten him three times and lashed out at several small children wheres your bloody little friend hissed georgie he promised never to leave my side ferdie was tempted to snap back that his bloody little friend had promised to be there to control tiny but as there was so much money at stake he murmured soothingly that lysander would be here any second guy like his father the bishop always whisked hither and thither at church occasions big hand on bare elbows telling willing helpers how splendid they were being now he was manning the loud speaker his strong voice ringing round paradise pray silence for our vicar everyone milled around patting dinsdale who was thoughtfully licking coffee cake off his whiskers percival hillary then went into an orgy of platitudes about georgie needing absolutely no introduction and how she and her husband guy had been a most acceptable addition to our little community and how grateful they were to georgie for taking time out from her busy schedule ladies and gentlemen began georgie the microphone let out an eldritch screech speak up yelled old miss cricklade whod been homemade wine champion for ten years running thank you for making us so welcome georgie sounded as though she was coming from outer space it all looks absolutely lovely but i know events of this kind do not spring up overnight like mushrooms they take months of hard work and organization and id specially like to thank she was interrupted by the doodlebug chug of larrys helicopter which landed in the nextdoor field blowing chaff over everyone miss cricklade who had been a fire watcher during the war took refuge under a trestle table as our opener was saying prompted percival but georgie had lost her place and couldnt remember whom shed thanked she could see that mother courage her wisteriamauve hair piled on top her overmadeup face flushed from the i pub was holding dinsdale and egging her on id like to thank the reverend and mrs hillary for lending us their lovely garden stammered georgie and was about to urge everyone to dig deeply into their pockets and spend spend spend and tell a little joke at the end when she realized shed lost her audience looking down she saw that lysanders jack had rolled up and was vigorously fornicating with dinsdales back leg dont debenham thats rude squawked mother courage as her white plastic boot sent jack for six and i declare this fête open mumbled georgie to very muted applause i am going to murder jack and lysander vowed georgie furiously and larry she added as she saw him scuttling into the flowertent to get his chocolate cake in on time but there was no time for brooding hissing if only youd allowed percy and i to rehearse you guy whisked her off to judge the fancy dress she never thanked produce nearly new or coconuts miss cricklade was grumbling to marigold well done youll need a bulletproof vest murmured bob as he ushered georgie into a ring full of shepherdesses gypsies clowns and pop stars georgie liked children and earmarked marigolds boys dressed as margaret and dennis thatcher and archangel mikes two daughters sweating inside a white pantomime horse as desert orchid as the likely winners when a diversion was caused by hermione looking wonderfully cool in a cream chanel suit and a big straw hat i do hope were not too late she was saying in her deep thrilling voice as she posted an angelic little boy in a sailor suit with a sailor hat on his dark curls into the ring this must be cosmo hermione and bobs treasure hallo darling you only made it just in time lets have a look at you crouching down beside him georgie nearly dropped the clipboard with her markings on for looking out of a tiny version of hermiones face were the shiny black deadly nightshade eyes of rannaldini next moment she gave a shriek as cosmo kicked her sharply on the shin and then laid about denis thatcher with his telescope this speedily concentrated georgies mind she put marigolds boys first desert orchid a close second miss muffets spider third cosmo nowhere little cosmo is very sensitive he wont like that decision said hermione ominously as she retrieved her bawling child youre going to need that bulletproof vest more than ever whispered bob can we have all animals in the ring for the best pet shown by a child shouted guy pity rannaldinis in geneva or we could have entered him said meredith judged by our very own hermione harefield added guy to loud cheers which temporarily assuaged hermiones ire i must have tubes of smarties for everyone she was now insisting i will not have any little one disappointed hermiones so caring said joy hillary seeing ferdie give tiny a great kick miss cricklade reported him to the rspca who had a tent by the exit numbly georgie signed autographs still dazed by the fact that little cosmo was rannaldinis son how did bob and kitty put up with such a constant public reminder finally over the loud speaker guy announced that judging had finished in the flowershow tent and the public would be admitted shortly to see whod won where the hells lysander thought ferdie and georgie in murderous unison the hero of paradise after last sundays cricket match had in fact fallen among thieves in the pearly gates everyone wanted to buy him drinks and being lysander he promptly bought them back then crooked mouse his hot tip for the came in first and as he had told everyone to back her it was more drinks all round to celebrate then at his suggestion they backed georgies day for obvious reasons in the and it came last so they had loads more drinks to cheer themselves up by twothirty lysander was out of his skull hazily remembering he had to meet georgie somewhere he staggered out wearing his fox fur and eventually found himself behind the vicarage hearing noise he shinned over the wall landing in a guelder rose bush at the back of a large tent wriggling through a side flap he stumbled upon the homemade wine section on a nearby table with all the bottles open after the judging the winner had once again been miss cricklade last year after a couple of glasses of her elderflower wine the archangel michael who normally drank for england had driven straight through the apple trees shop window after leaving her house having finished the remaining half of this years winning bottle lysander who hadnt eaten since the previous evening and then only uncooked cake mixture suddenly decided he was hungry and polished off an excellent spinach quiche and a plate of sausage rolls before starting on miss cricklades prizewinning elderberry red by now people were flooding into the tent shaking him by the hand and congratulating him really thought lysander this is the nicest wedding reception ive ever been to he must have another drink outside the rspca inspector who had rolled up to prosecute ferdie having been bitten sharply by tiny was tempted to prosecute the pony instead the shadow of the spire fell over the vicars garden as the sun started its descent disconsolate exhibitors were pouring out of the flowertent rannaldini and mr brimscombe seemed to have won everything having thrust cups of tea on willing stall holders and remembering that hermione liked hers camomile and flavoured with honey guy led marigold whod been up since six off to the beer tent for something stronger now georgie could see them laughing together traitor thought georgie wishing someone would hurl a coconut at guy guy was less amused as were larry the vicar and meredith when they discovered that the stillabsent lysander had won first prize for his chocolate cake it had a lovely damp texture and a delicious flavour we cant pinpoint was the judges comment it was time for larry to run the auction and regain the ascendancy after not winning a single prize hed show who could drive a hard bargain and kicked off by getting eighty pounds for a signed copy of rock star guy then impressed everyone by bidding an unheard of forty pounds for hermiones posy of wildflowers consisting of marjoram thyme scabious and light and dark purple bellflowers they had been picked and arranged by little cosmos nanny gretel hermione was in heaven guy seymour is the most generous man in rutshire she told everyone after kissing guy several times full on the mouth having only had the courage to open the joint bank statement that morning and seen the abyss of their overdraft georgies smile fell heavily among the bricàbrac she knew she ought to roll up her sleeves and help marigold or kitty but somehow she felt paralysed in her high heels and too shy to talk to people who were too shy of her fame to talk to her she found ferdie sitting on a haybale eating a chocice all his bounce had left him im sorry georgie id go and look for him if he hadnt lumbered me with this fucking pony i thought id cured him of bunking off the fortuneteller was hidden in a little white tent under the taller of the chestnut trees as georgies nails were clean after washing her hair and the queue had almost dried up she decided to test her fate outside a sweetfaced woman with long dark hair was trying to quiet an adorable but fretful baby and telling two pretty little redheaded girls mummy wont be long then well go back to robinsgrove and swim in the pool next moment a redheaded girl stumbled out of the tent tears pouring down her cheeks oh daisy i cant bear it she wailed to the dark woman hes not going to leave her georgie realized to her horror that it was julia there was no way of avoiding her she was wearing a white shirt blue schoolboy shorts and black pumps and the combination of tawny freckled skin and russet hair was absolutely stunning she doesnt need to clinique out her varicose veins thought georgie wearily oh georgie im so sorry i tried to keep away today sobbed julia but i couldnt help myself hes not going to leave you youre so lucky to have him come on julia daisy put an arm round her heaving shoulders lets go home im so sorry she turned to georgie i do hope youre ok georgie was not kicking off her beastly high heels she ran off to find guy who was surrounded by eager helpers including joy hillary and lady chisleden and having his photograph taken for the local paper as he pinned a tail on the donkey got a tenner he called out to georgie no i have not hissed georgie if youre not worth a fortune youre certainly worth a fortuneteller ive just bumped into julia and daisy francelynch julia and daisy guy didnt miss a beat how good of them to look in perhaps they could sell some of their paintings here next year joy and give you a percentage dyou know daisy shes so sweet theres so much local talent then turning to lady chisleden i think cocoa gives a better flavour actually gwendolyn my mistake this year was to use drinking chocolate i do not believe i am hearing this said georgie guy did you know julia was coming of course not i havent spoken to her for months settle down georgie guy drew her aside think of other people rather than yourself for a change time for you to draw the raffle interrupted joy hillary whose eyes were on stalks ill make an announcement said guy striding off i do hope i win the copenhagen dinner service said joy its so good of hermione to donate it gives her another excuse not to invite anyone to dinner muttered meredith to an exhausted kitty shes already got three sets in the attic she gets one every time she sings wonderful copenhagen as an encore in the danish opera house among other raffle presents were a basket of fruit from the apple tree a set of crystal glass donated by the local antique shop dinner for two from the heavenly host and an array of bottles from the pearly gates georgie was mindlessly scuffling round in the drum praying that she wouldnt pull out julias ticket when everyone was distracted by a piercing shriek from the flowertent ancient miss cricklade who had only just left her post at the nearly new stall to check how many prizes shed won came scuttling up to marigold all my wines been drunk she screamed thats three bottles and its him whats done it on cue out of the flowertent supported by miss paradise and with their crowns askew came lysander with his legs running away in every direction and his eyes crossing there is a greenfingered hillary far away whoops without a city wall sang lysander waving a halfeaten rock bun in time georgie had never seen anyone so drunk suddenly lysander turned his head with a superhuman effort georgie he tried to focus oh georgie darling ive been looking everywhere for you when are you going to make your speech then georgie flipped piss off she screamed advancing on him with her bouquet just piss off you little fucker to your playpen and never come back again there was an appalled silence georgie wailed lysander desperate to reach her he lunged forward tripping over a guy rope and lumbering into the raffle table sending everything flying with a deafening crash the copenhagen dinner service was in smithereens as were the waterford glass and the bottles from the pearly gates put not your trust in princes murmured bob time for a natural break said meredith who was quite hysterical with laughter hermione who had hysterics of a different kind was whisked inside the vicarage by joy hillary guy seized control of the microphone telling people to leave now to avoid broken glass assuring them that the raffle would be drawn at a later date and all the winners would get their prizes in due course and that little shit is going to pay for them he said grimly as he switched off the microphone after the broken glass and china had been swept up organizers and helpers retreated to the vicarage for a wellearned drink while the money was counted georgie who was shaking with mortification only wanted to slope off home but guy insisted she came too youve made a complete fool of yourself panda you owe it to the committee and to me to put in an appearance and show a bit of contrition the moment they entered the vicarage he was off congratulating stall holders hermione as a result of smelling salts two large whiskies and a vat of buttering up was recovered enough to draw georgie aside having misinterpreted georgies tight lips earlier she said i want to put your mind at rest guy admires me very much indeed it was so caring of him to buy my posy but im far too much of a friend of yours to encourage him anyway hes not my type why dyou kiss him on the fucking mouth every time you see him georgie was appalled to hear herself saying oh georgie hermione put her head on one side i thought by showing you everything was in the open youd realize nothing was going on this time misreading georgies stunned silence for approval hermione went on we all feel so sorry for guy hes such a darling man so dependable and so different when youre not around glowering at him like a wardress he may have lied to you but men do lie when theyre frightened anyway any man of gumption keeps a mistress hermione lowered her voice you wouldnt want to be married to a wimp take a leaf out of kitty rannaldinis book and accept it brickie knows how to behave with dignity because she doesnt kick against the lack of pricks snarled georgie oh im sure rannaldini fulfils her every need stumbling away from hermione georgie searched for a friendly face but all the stall holders holding their glasses of cheap wine like unexploded bombs averted their eyes poor guy to be lumbered with such a liability did liabilities always turn men into liars i wasnt always like this georgie wanted to plead you all right it was marigold no im not that fucking lysander hush marigold drew georgie towards the window the ledge was covered in dust a vase of roses was dripping petals joy hillarys thoughts had been elsewhere this week and what were you doing letting guy buy you drinks i was thirsty said marigold apologetically and ay do like him oh georgie weve made six thousand pounds and ferdies just given us a cheque for a thousand to pay for lysanders breakages where is the little beast passed out in the field next door i hope they burn the stubble with him in it but marigold wasnt listening weve made six thousand and oh georgie lady chisleden has asked me to call her gwendolyn somehow because georgie was busy working out whether to kill guy with a bread knife or a carving knife they managed to get home without a row she had just fed charity and dinsdale when he came into the kitchen carrying a file im off panda i told joy and percy id help clear up dont bother with supper ill grab a sandwich at the pearly gates ive got a bestkept village meeting later why dont you enter julia in the bestkept mistress competition screamed georgie you might even beat hermione georgie cried and cried had a large bacardi got down her suitcase and couldnt think where to go it was so hot she put on an old denim bikini scrumpled up in the ironing then she took a plum from the fruit bowl and found shed put the stone in her mouth and chucked the fruit in the ashy muckbucket everything turned to ashes poor julia had looked devastated too georgie found she didnt hate her any more and maybe marigold hermione and all the ladies of paradise were right and guy was different and really nice when he wasnt with her why had lysander let her down because she simply wasnt important enough to him she jumped as the telephone rang it was flora where are you lake geneva er staying in a youth hostel its great here and where the hell is my white silk shirt no doubt split across the back of one of your ruggerplaying boyfriends or being used to clean his car there was a pause look behind the spareroom door said flora huffily youll find it there go and look now belting upstairs georgie found her white shirt then remembered it was the spare room where guy had adjusted the mirror to sleep with julia and started to cry again by the time she got downstairs flora had rung off georgie felt awful poor darling flora might jump in lake geneva i was beastly to her said a small voice because i was jealous of her and lysander she was overcome by a sick heartthumping craving for information she darent snoop in guys study she was a bit drunk and hed notice if papers had been moved loathing herself she went into floras room the radio and the record player were still on clothes carpeted the floor on the wall was a poster of a gorilla underneath it someone had written flora seymour on a good day here was floras diary georgies hands were shaking so much that at first she couldnt focus august read the franklyns tale not bad for a set book about a man who sleeps with a disgusting old woman who turns into a beautiful princess i can really relate to the franklyn would i turn into a princess if i went to bed with lysander wondered georgie august sunday here it was lunch at valhalla lysander and ferdie there and hermione being a pain then followed a lot of guff about lysander riding into the lake hes gorgeous but quite old he and ferdie really sweet and invited me over to magpie cottage daddy really nice too gave me a lift we had a good chat later we had fantastic sex in the wood im terrified im falling in love giving a moan georgie turned the page august x made me come by just talking to me over the telephone hes given me a tiny vibrator in the shape of a fountainpen as a goingaway present so i dont miss him but i know i will at least hes flying out lots to see me georgie was so transfixed with horror that at first she didnt hear the telephone sobbing at the sickness that had made her pick the lock of pandoras box she reeled down the landing to her bedroom and snatched up the receiver georgie its lysander im sorry i got pissed i want to come round fuck off screamed georgie i know i let you down ferdies just bawled me out ill make it up to you you wont your bloody dog screwed up my speech then you make a fool of me in front of everyone and finally youre fucking my daughter how dare you keep your rotten fee but i dont want to see you or ferdie ever again and dont you dare contact flora slamming down the receiver she raced round the house pulling out telephones as though she were weeding tares out of her life she couldnt believe it was only eleven oclock out on the terrace the air was heavy with nightscented stock in the moonlight rannaldinis strawbales encased in black shiny bags looked like great slugs coming to eat her undressed in her lonely double bed she looked in the big mirror over the fireplace and in her reflection with her red hair flowing over her bare shoulders she could only see julia sobbing she swallowed two sleeping pills and crashed out next day she woke as always after taking pills feeling calm and almost euphoric what did a million mistresses matter in one of those bewildering voltefaces she didnt shrug off guys encroaching hands today she was going to be like brickie who would never spurn a husband lets make love outside oh panda ive missed you said guy taking her down to a corner of the lake hidden by willow trees and laying her on the scratchy yellow grass but just as hed put his hand between her legs dinsdale had barged through the willow fronds and was shoved aside so vociferously he had waddled off in a sulk to mother courage georgie needing the release so desperately found herself wracked by sexual paralysis too tense to reach orgasm that way she started to cry and begged guy to come inside her but she was so tight down there she nearly screamed out with pain that was lovely darling she mumbled afterwards thank you so much but as she got out of her bath guy came out of his dressing room with a cricket bag kissing her on the cheek and announcing he was off to oxford youre always complaining you cant work panda so i thought id give you a clear day no doubt he and julia would meet up in ricky francelynchs woods and guy would say things cant go on georgies being so awful it was terribly hot the smell of dew drying on a nearby clump of fennel reminded georgie of wheelers london and fun whooping across the valley larrys farm boy was moving weary cattle in search of grazing the bells of all saints rang out no doubt in grateful anticipation of a rebuilt spire a young vixen sat motionless in the stubble awaiting victims disorientated by the combine harvesters rabbits and fieldmice so desperate for water that they lost their instinct for survival like me thought georgie with a sob oh please god help me she dropped to her knees god told her to get down to work getting into her bikini she took manuscript paper pens and biscuits for dinsdale whod come back but was still sulking out on to the terrace scraping back her hair in an elasticated band to get her forehead brown she whipped off her bikini top coated her pale breasts with ambre solaire and started to think cleopatra was always ranting and raving at anthony who was charming selfindulgent and adored by his men a tower of strength with his willing helpers to the west she could see a red glow beneath a mushroombrown spiral of cloud they were burning the stubble like anthonys funeral pyre georgie shut her eyes and hummed slowly a tune that her brain had been chasing for days took form in her head almost as fast the words followed i want to blaze with love once more before i die joyfully she started to write but her biro refused to function where the paper was soaked with suntan oil she took a fresh sheet somehow she must capture the doomed folly of their love she didnt know how long she wrote only that music was singing in her head and words racing as though the streams of angels reach were carrying the rains off the hills once again like hemingway she was about to stop when she was going good and make a cup of coffee when dinsdales bay rang out and jack and maggie raced across the lawn maggie was carrying an envelope which she dropped in her excitement georgie only had time to whip off her elastic band fluff out her hair and clutch her bikini top to her sweating breasts when lysander crept round the corner he was wearing ferdies dark glasses and carrying a bottle of champagne and a bunch of clashing pinkandpurple asters it was hard to tell if he was shaking more from nerves or from hangover get out said georgie ive come to say im sorry its the worst thing ive ever done but basically i got pissed and jacks desperately sorry too he reached down to pick up the envelope which maggie had dropped jesus my poor head i can promise you theres nothing sham about this pain as he handed over the bottle of moët he looked at georgie under his lashes and was disappointed to see no flicker of amusement why arent you playing in that polo final she snapped i pulled out youre more important and im not bonking your daughter i dont believe you said georgie wishing she wasnt so conscious of being hot sweaty and middleaged when all she should be thinking about was floras honour she didnt get back till four in the morning last sunday and i overheard her talking on the telephone there was no way she was going to own up to reading floras diary flora stayed half an hour last sunday and had one drink said lysander and what is more he went on indignantly she wasnt remotely interested in arthur even when he lay on his side and snored and shook hands for a twix bar and drank a can of fanta i was appalled not exactly the way thought georgie thawing slightly to lysanders heart and she kept looking at her watch he went on then a car came to the bottom of our lane and she was off like a rat up a drain you ask ferdie he always covers for you he does not hes just given me another bollocking any idea who was in the car no lied lysander wheres the ace carer gone to oxford for an endaway fixture am i interrupting you lysander glanced at her paper you have written a lot ive had a good morning georgie suddenly felt absurdly happy dyou want some lunch dont think i could keep it down oh georgie thank you for not being cross any more ive been so miserable he followed her into the kitchen which was as cool and dark as a cave i ought to get dressed said georgie putting the asters in the sink please dont youre overdressed as it is how about some cold chicken or a bit of sea trout georgie opened the fridge door unless youre starving im honestly not hungry lets watch eastenders first you ought to cook for me said georgie since you beat everyone in the chocolatecake competition lysander opened his bloodshot eyes wide then roared with laughter i stuffed it with hash no wonder the judges finished every scrap and couldnt identify the special flavour ferdie got livid because i kept taking spoonfuls while he was mixing it cakes are so much nicer before theyre made like women said georgie acidly not all women said lysander handing her a glass collapsing on to the dark gold sofa in the drawing room georgie wished guy hadnt just cut back the rambler rose which had obscured the window now the bright sunlight streamed in showing up all her bags and wrinkles dinsdale promptly heaved himself up beside her and refused to budge so lysander was reduced to sprawling on the shaggy rug at her feet as her children so often did from now on she must regard him as one of floras cricketing friends delectable but out of bounds it was a gripping instalment of eastenders and georgie was so involved in michelles conversation with sharon that she suddenly found to her horror she was stroking lysanders hair i thought you were dinsdale she said aghast if only i were lysander trapped her hand id like to climb into your bed every morning oh georgie ive had my binoculars trained on angels reach since first thing waiting for guy to go out and i stood watching you this afternoon while you were writing you looked so gorgeous i really fancy you dont be ridiculous georgie swelled with all the outrage of a cat startled by a dog i nearly kissed you in the woods during the cricket match and i know you fancy me i do not you do too or you wouldnt have been so furious about me and flora sliding his other hand round her neck he drew her towards him until their lips touched and he kissed her with such alacrity that she fell off the sofa on top of him no we really shouldnt for a moment they were all deliciously sprawling limbs then his tongue slid inside her mouth and as she struggled with increasing halfheartedness to escape the safetypin holding her bikini top gave way and she was naked except for her fadedblue denim bikini pants with her redgold hair flowing over her golden shoulders and youthful rounded breasts oh theyre sweet lysander kissed each nipple youre so beautiful laying her across his thighs he pushed back her fringe and adoringly kissed her forehead her heavy eyelids her snub nose and then with a whoop of delight returned to her mouth all the time he was gently stroking the back of her neck her armpits and her breasts an inch below the nipples every place where she was most responsive before tunnelling under her bikini bottom until he could feel her heart bashing against his and her thighs quivering with delight i thought you had a hangover muttered georgie struggling to keep a metaphorical foot on the bottom of the pool you could put fernet branca out of business whispered lysander god i want to get inside you ive got a thing about women of experience experience of retreating men said georgie sadly oh why hadnt she kept up those exercises to strengthen her internal muscles anyway we cant not in front of dinsdale laughing lysander laid her on the rug switching off eastenders he removed his dark blue shirt threw it over dinsdale and turned a photograph of guy to face the wall then dropping his jeans he knelt beside georgie gently easing off her bikini bottoms burying his face in her breasts breathing in ambre solaire he mumbled i dreamt and dreamt this would happen im going to be the bridge over the ravine to your new happiness dont cry itll be so lovely lie on top of me if the floors too hard it had been such agony with guy that morning that on seeing the splendour of lysanders cock georgie was terrified hed never get inside her but having turned her sideways with one thigh between his he spat on his fingers and stroked her so delicately that she was soon bubbling like a hot churn of butter oooooh thats heavenly she sighed as he slid easily right up inside her were tailormade god what a wonderful cock lysander grinned down at her its an absolute tower of strength he whispered and georgie got such giggles he came and she didnt god that was magic lysander filled their glasses with tepid champagne im sorry i should have kept going ferdie always distances himself by reciting shakespeare or latin verbs but i can never remember anything long enough to remember it anyway i cant think of anything but you oh georgie and he kissed her with such love it was worth all the orgasms in the world as he lit them both cigarettes a deep sigh came from the sofa jack maggie and dinsdale peering out from under lysanders shirt were watching them with the utmost disapproval they look like jack tinker milton shulman and irving wardle after the first act of a seriously bad play said georgie except it was seriously lovely bending over she kissed lysanders flat brown belly then moving slowly upwards kissed each rib you are desirability incarnate but it must be the last time youre less than half my age its obscene so what look at rannaldini and lysander just stopped himself saying flora god he must be careful and er all those groupies hes always deflowering according to hermione rannaldini fulfils a womans every need chucking his cigarette into the fireplace lysander stretched out on the rug his cock pointing unambiguously heavenwards come and sit on my need he said and this time youre going to come georgies life changed feeling herself wildly desired by someone she found wildly desirable her confidence flooded back she started looking sensational she had never enjoyed sex so much shed never believed lust and larkiness could be so entwined ferdie on the other hand was livid youre not supposed to bonk them he shouted at lysander youll be done for enticement guyll take you to the cleaners i dont care i love bonking georgie shes ancient snapped ferdie youre like a robin nesting in some rusty old kettle ferdie was somewhat surprised to find himself being shaken like a rat dont you ever talk like that about georgie again guy was also seriously rattled georgie had cried wolf in the past often threatening to walk out when she was plastered but now she was never in when he rang she claimed she was working but he noticed exactly the same notes on her musicstand and the same words of lyric in her notebook on fridays as there had been on mondays youre seeing far too much of lysander hawkley he told georgie who was wearing a scarf on the hottest day of the year to hide the lovebites and you see too much of julia armstrong said georgie blithely small tits for tat were not talking about me its juvenile to try and get your own back whoever said revenge was sweet was a smart cookie guy tried another tack we must do more things together panda right said georgie lets kick off by getting a divorce the impossibly hot summer sweltered on and people wore as few clothes as possible georgie and lysander spent a great deal of time in bed and his presence at magpie cottage kept the husbands of paradise more on their toes than baryshnikov in particular guy and larry started ringing solicitously night and morning cutting down their sporting activities at weekends and getting home early on friday with bunches of flowers in guys case it was dramatic how british rail had suddenly improved their services only rannaldini carried on in his usual fashion making love to flora in every possible position in every capital in europe hermione and cecilia unaware of this new passion joined natasha in feeling more than a faint neglect and became increasingly demanding and histrionic particularly towards kitty who was the one who had to cancel when rannaldini was supposed to be seeing them the only pleasure afforded a chronically cuckolded wife of witnessing the anguish of ones husbands current mistress when he moves on to a new one was denied to poor kitty because she felt that rannaldini was far more smitten with flora than any of the others a diversion was caused at the end of august by the launching of his film of don giovanni promptly nicknamed dong giovanni because many of the leading characters appeared with nothing on the critics while full of praise for the production pointed out that the wonderfully lit conductor appeared more than the don paradise was electrified because their very own hermione harefield and cecilia rannaldini the exwife of their very own rannaldini appeared in the buff grin and barefield the scorpion called it pirate versions were soon circulating paradise with the sound turned down and much framefreezing on hermiones bottom at a private and raucous latenight showing in the pearly gates pats of butter and even darts were thrown at the screen hermione was not quite so beloved in paradise as she believed having borrowed the tape to show georgie lysander wandered down to paradise the following morning to hand it over to ancient miss cricklade who was next in the queue since the arrival of a vast box of chocolates miss cricklade had forgiven lysander for drinking her homemade wine at the fête and was now taking in his washing it was a day fit for a wedding after heavy rain in the night a newly washed blue sky arched over gold fields every blade of bleached grass and already turning leaves sparkled in the sunshine apples reddened like blushing brides in the orchards of paradise lysander had meant just to take the dogs but arthur had looked so bored and eager for a jaunt and tiny made such a din if left behind that in the end they all went jack strutting out proudly with arthurs lead rope between his teeth and maggie who was now three times larger than jack cavorted in front teasing tiny and keeping out of the way of her gnashing jaws and lightning hoofs lysander felt absurdly happy wearing just loafers and frayed denim shorts he could feel the sun on his back which was now darker gold than the fields he was in love he had a mother to fuss over him once more and he adored living in paradise since hed mistaken the fête for a wedding reception and made the vicars wife marigold and lady chisleden all regarded as bossyboots look silly his popularity had soared even higher in a world where nothing seems real i have found you i have found you sang lysander to arthur who waggled his big ears lovingly and didnt remotely mind his master being out of tune passing bobs and hermiones lysander noticed a pair of sweating workmen hoisting very large newlooking white balls on to the greying flattopped pillars on either side of the gates he was so busy staring he didnt see anyone approaching giving a snort of irritation that lysanders pack was spilling over the road and pressing herself into the hedge like a cat when the hunt passes was a very tall very thin girl startlingly pale for such a hot summer she had very short spiky beige hair and a fineboned foxy face dominated by angry eyes she was wearing a loose earthcoloured dress which totally disguised her figure somehow she seemed familiar lysander heard her footsteps halt but when he turned shed disappeared she must have gone into jasmine cottage the sweet little house belonging to hermione which was hired out for expensive holiday lets by the time lysander had had a cup of coffee and a glass of parsnip sherry with miss cricklade and dropped off his washing and had a glass of sancerre with miss paradise who waited at the heavenly host and whod saved the remains of last nights breadandbutter pudding for arthur and had a bet and a pint of flowers at the pearly gates and reached the apple tree he was in fine fettle but as tiny had eaten his shopping list hed forgotten what hed come down for wandering round the shop throwing smoked salmon frozen mars bars and a bottle of moët into his basket as treats for georgie lysander bumped into eve the owner who was as short plump and jolly as the unknown girl had been tall thin and disapproving whos taken jasmine cottage he asked mrs levitskys come back said eve with a sniff she was married to boris that russian they were so happy when they first lived here she had two lovely kiddies and hair down her back then he went off with another woman ah is she called rachel and plays the piano thats the one she likes to be called rachel grant now i know her said lysander in amazement she was so beautiful she made me forget to go to an interview gosh shes changed lysander added pedigree chum chewsticks and carrots for the horses to his basket its unhinged her said eve writing down lysanders purchases in a red book shes joined the green party and shes always in here complaining none of the fruits organic enough i mean were not a healthfood store then she says weve got the wrong washingup liquid the wrong toothpaste the wrong shampoos eves sense of grievance boiled over i hope her hair turns green and it all falls out shes put off so many of my customers whats she doing down here asked lysander adding the sun and sporting life to the pile come back to accompany hermione shell get a pittance for that she keeps grumbling jasmine cottage is so dark not surprising with all those save the whales and the white rhino and the rain forest posters in the window she could start by saving her breath added eve putting everything into a carrier bag ill drop in and say hallo on the way home said lysander eve followed him outside giving a finger of kitkat to the dogs and breaking up a twix bar for arthur and tiny what did you think of madams video she asked well basically im not into opera i can never see how they can sing so loudly and for so long when theyre supposed to be dying and hermiones got a bigger ass on her than arthur talking of asses i better get mine into gear here comes the vicar the return journey took almost as long with more drinks and bets and a long chat with mother courage returning from angels reach with huge sweat circles under the armpits of hermiones jean muir which shed bought for at the nearly new stall take your time sandy she told lysander georgies playing and singing up in her tower like a lark you avent been missed allo jack allo maggie going to see debenham yes i know rachel always flying off the angle her husband was a nice fellow used to walk along the road composing hed always buy you a drink people say he defecated all the way from russia moving on lysander read in the sun about a forest fire raging through france it had probably been started by flora tossing her fag into the bracken and crying encore rannaldini he wondered what georgie and flora would both say if they knew with whom the other was sleeping he was dithering whether to pop in on rachel when jack took matters into his own paws seeing rachels tabby cat in the road ahead he dropped arthurs lead rope and took off followed by maggie when lysander caught up with them the cat had been chased up an ancient quince tree hanging over the wall and the dogs were yapping hysterically round the base with rachel swiping at them with a broom and screaming go away you bloody animals dont kill them begged lysander here hang on to arthur and tiny he had grabbed jack when maggie unnerved by raised voices and any kind of violence crapped extensively on rachels lawn producing a further tirade are you trying to blind my children cant you keep your bloody dogs on a lead get them out of my garden im really sorry tucking jack under his arm grabbing the horses and calling to maggie lysander backed down the path until he had shut the gate firmly between them look dyou remember me lysander hawkley we met in that chemists and went back to your house we were having a really nice time until your husband came back slowly painfully rachel seemed to lug her mind out of the horrors of the present into the far worse torments of the past boris left me furiously she started deadheading yellow roses i know im desperately sorry what are you doing here living at magpie cottage where are your kids a friends taken them ive got to go over to hermiones shes got a prom next week and needs to go through the score rachel was even thinner than georgie had been her face was seamed with pain her huge eyes dark with loss christ what awful things men do to women thought lysander as it was friday hed be at a loose end tonight because guy was due home hed also had a lot to drink and heard himself saying why dont you come over to supper after youve finished no thanks rachels face shut like a trap hermionell keep me for hours she takes her kilo of flesh then ive got to put the kids to bed oh right said lysander relieved some other time his skin was as smooth dark and shiny as any of the rainforest mahogany she was trying to save his bleached hair flopped into his eyes he was heartbreakingly pretty you ought to put on a shirt or youll get skin cancer snapped rachel the ozone layers so thin but i dont expect you care about that slamming the front door she started to cry it was a relief to be jolted out of her dry stony grief lysander had stirred up so many memories that brief afternoon when theyd been so furiously and rudely interrupted was the last time she had been totally sure of boriss love the marriage had started with such promise after boris caught sight of her slender bare back topped by shining piledup brown hair as she played beethovens third piano concerto in moscow and had fallen so wildly in love that he could do nothing but defect for a while like the gemini they had been two glittering stars in the musical firmament the broodingly handsome young conductor immediately snapped up by the london met and his equally dazzling young pianist wife having shaken off the shackles of communism however boris who already had a passion for red wine red meat and redblooded women started amassing capitalist trappings fast cars designer clothes cds tapes and electronic equipment which was fine when he and rachel were both working but with babies the trouble started because her mother had gone out to work rachel had been determined to stay at home with her own children and on one income the money soon ran out rachel also grew increasingly resentful at not being able to pursue her own career as she pushed prams in the park with a green guardianreading feminist who indoctrinated her with her subversive ideas rachel started serving up vegetarian food and throwing boris out of the house for smoking and drinking then determined to return to work she accepted an invitation to tour america hoping that the totally undomesticated boris left at home to look after two small children and the house would appreciate what she had to put up with but boris missing his homeland and family and fed up with rachels passion for the truth which many people called tactlessness suddenly felt a desperate need for warmth approval and companionship thus rachel returned from america to find he had fallen in love with chloe the mezzo who was beautiful bosomy successful and only too happy to tell boris how marvellous he was finding himself unable to give up chloe and too straight unlike guy rannaldini and larry to run two women boris had finally resigned from his marriage rachel having lost touch with the music world was getting no concert work a couple of earlier recitals where she had loyally played boriss compositions which had meant half the audience leaving at the interval hadnt exactly helped her career hermione paid her a pittance as did her few pupils and she was embittered at boriss constant failure to keep up the maintenance payments her evenings were now spent festering and firing off letters on recycled paper to the prime ministers of foreign countries complaining about their treatment of the environment at least it ensured that she occasionally got some post in return after smoked salmon moët mars bar icecream and a languorous sweaty afternoons lovemaking at magpie cottage rather than angels reach in case guy or flora who was due home any time from backpacking rolled up unexpectedly lysander was roused by the telephone it was rachel fulminating that hermione had cancelled due to some megacrisis and asking ungraciously if she and the children could come to supper after all lysander who would rather have gone back to sleep or out on the bat with his pearly gates cronies said of course hed come and fetch her only to be told whats wrong with walking its only half a mile that was rachel sighed lysander isnt she fantastically young and pretty asked georgie jumping out of bed and scuttling into the bathroom so lysander shouldnt get too long a sight of her droopy bottom used to be but shes got seriously fierce oh dear it didnt even seem a good idea this morning fridays my worst night of the week knowing i wont see you until monday following georgie into the bathroom he slid his arms round her waist nuzzling at her shoulder promise to ring me every moment you can and try and persuade the ace carer to play cricket on sunday then turning on the taps id better have first bath so i can nip down to the apple tree and get some supper and a video for the kids before they close suddenly georgie realized why the mention of rachel upset her she was coming to dinner the night she and boris split up that was the night guy fed julia in she said dont think about julia lysander took georgie back in his arms stroking her hair you wont fall in love with her will you georgie clung to him one of the lovely things about lysander was that she never had to try and be cool the day that had started so beautifully deteriorated returning from the apple tree lysander passed rachel trailing two tired fretful children vanya and masha aged four and three who were only too pleased to jump into such a glamorous car and shrieked with excitement when lysander drove at his usual reckless pace rachel was less amused any speed over mph wastes energy she then proceeded to castigate him for not using unleaded petrol and for not having a catalytic converter to exclude carbon monoxide lysanders hayfield of a front garden however temporarily cheered her up how brave of you to flout the bestkept village committee and grow your lawn those nettles attract the peacock butterfly and the thistles are a wonderful magnet for goldfinch and look kids lots of dandelions so we can make a salad for supper the inside of the cottage was less of a success there were plates glasses and overflowing ashtrays everywhere and a bowl of uneaten dog food black with flies when jack and maggie rushed to meet them both children knocked their heads together burying their faces in their mothers skirt seeing rachel wrinkling her long elegant nose at the smell of dog and gamekeepers ferret which always surfaced on hot days lysander let rip with air freshener and fly spray and got a bollocking for using aerosols this place is a bottle bank in itself rachel went on in horror i keep forgetting its dustbin day basically the dustmen come before i get up said lysander apologetically lets have a drink for a second as lysander took out some cans of coke and a bottle of muscadet the childrens eyessloeblack like their fathers lit up theyre not allowed coke sugar rots their teeth said rachel water will do where are the mugs kept in the machine its just finished but its only halffull said rachel opening the door cant you appreciate what a waste of energy this is masha and vanya werent allowed crisps either nor little chocolate nests filled with eggs ill have to reeducate you completely sighed rachel those chocolate nests are at least eight hundred calories and when you think of the pesticides used on the cocoa bean you must have some carrots and apples i can chop up the fridge nearly finished her off by not defrosting it lysander was completely responsible for global warming everything was past its sellby date and hed get listeria from the three halffull tins of pâté getting some carrots out of the vegetable compartment she started ferociously chopping on a wooden board arthur who always hung around touting for snacks when he saw people in the kitchen frightened the life out of her by sticking his great face half of it stained olivegreen from rolling in through the window his wall eye lit up at the sight of the carrots really he was the muckiest horse arthurs joined the green party giggled lysander must you trivialize everything i hope to stand for the rutminster greens at the next election oh right said lysander or rather left greens are not automatically leftwing rachel put a plate of carrot matchsticks in front of her unenthusiastic children go and explore lysander told them theres a nice pond outside who furnished this place rachels eyes roved over the ticking sofas and chairs and the bishops throne marigold lysander handed rachel a glass of muscadet shes getting me a microwave thank god he removed a dandy brush a curry comb and a chewed trainer from the sofa whichll help because i get bored and forget to eat waiting for things to heat up trust marigold rachel was appalled microwaves are not only toxic to the liver but they kill off the brain cells my liver came out waving a white flag years ago said lysander draining half his glass and ive never had a brain cell to kill hallo kids ive got you a good video again the childrens faces lit up then faded as their mother said she didnt allow them to watch television then getting some rolls and egg boxes out of her basket urged them to make a castle want to watch television grumbled vanya well you cant ill start you off said rachel getting out a bottle of glue this place is a tip dont you ever clean it mother courage comes once a week but we seem to spend our time gossiping she says she doesnt like to move things so she doesnt there was a pause it was terribly hot perhaps youd like a swim in the river suggested lysander i wouldnt mind one polluted snapped rachel well wed better have some supper oh god rachel clutched her head white baps are the worst thing you could give them and havent you realized beef burgers are made from the pancreas lungs and testicles of animals lysander looked at her meditatively easygoing to a fault he was about to tell her he could see exactly why boris had walked out then he caught sight of masha and vanya they were like children on newsreels so often photographed beside bomb craters and the dusty rubble of houses in foreign wars children displaced because theyd been fought over there are plenty of eggs he said gently your mother can make us something she considers suitable for supper and we can play football with jack and then ill give you a ride on arthur this was a huge success jack could dribble a ball for hours and arthur loved children sent to wash their hands before supper masha and vanya came out shrieking with giggles rachel rachel come and see the willies storming into the downstairs lavatory rachel found the artistic fruits of lysanders drunken despair after the church fête when he had taken a can of red paint and sprayed cocks balls and a vast nude lady with enormous tits and crossed eyes over the walls and then written i love gorgy in huge letters oh god i forgot about that lysander tried not to laugh with the children not only are you damaging the ozone layer and adding to global warming stormed rachel but youre ejecting tiny particles of toxic paint into the environment and you make the worst scrambled egg ive ever tasted lysander wanted to tell her as he emptied half a bottle of tomato ketchup rannaldini fashion over the loose tasteless mass the only way rachel used salt was to rub it into peoples wounds the dandelion salad was even more disgusting lysander found the only answer was to drink as much as possible and even rachel mellowed a bit after two glasses and allowed the children to watch a donald duck video i identified with donald like mad lysander told rachel as he loaded the machine when i was a child noone could understand what i said like him but rachel was gazing across at valhalla theres that bastard rannaldinis place he was the one who wrecked our marriage persuading boris it was de rigueur to have something on the side he introduced boris to chloe how does she get on with the children chloe they adore her not surprising shes filthy rich and fills them up with sweets and junk food and batteryoperated toys every time they visit her and boris how can they ever learn to reject consumerism with that going on and she lets them watch television all day theyre sweet children i know i just go crackers not being able to practise to distract rachel from the fact that both jack and maggie had climbed on to the childrens laps lysander took her outside the sun was setting tobacco plants and stocks fighting a losing battle with nettles scented the evening owls were hooting in the wood not daring to risk mosquito spray lysander lit a cigarette after a long pause rachel stammered im sorry ive been bloody all evening ive had to nag and nag boris for maintenance this morning a cheque arrived for the right money but signed by chloe its so humiliating but i cant afford to tear it up lysander was shocked you poor thing ill give you the money then you can im quite flush at the moment but rachel was too proud ive got teaching jobs and hermione pays when shes around god shes awful she never opens her mouth except for dollars and all her conversation is about money whats the point of those balls outside her house selfaggrandizement said rachel sourly rannaldini has griffins georgie maguire has angels marigold has lions now hermione has balls probably bobs she emasculates him enough hes a seriously nice guy said lysander good cricketer too hes the most attractive man in paradise said rachel she looks beautiful again now thought lysander with her sad foxy face warmed by the falling sun and her beautiful foxs ankles beneath that shapeless dress by the way he said i discovered what hermiones megacrisis was how from gretel her hairylegged nanny why on earth should she shave her legs no reason at all but if she wants me to be her hansel she better start waxing anyway she told me that rannaldini is making this film called fidelio should be called infidelio about some woman called nora who dresses up as a boy and springs her husband from jug shes called leonore i know the story said rachel crushingly of course you would sorry anyway hermione automatically expected to get the part but rannaldini told her you could hardly pass for a faithful wife my dear and with those outsize boobs no selfrespecting gaoler would ever mistake you for a boy so hes given the part to cecilia rachel whistled but i suppose it figures rannaldini would far rather put catchitunes vast fee into the pocket of cecilia whos always pestering him for more alimony than into hermiones no wonder hermiones livid dyou think hell make cecilia strip off again fidelios quite a different opera said rachel patronizingly on the one hand its about an individual living in chains being rescued by a loving woman but beethoven raises the story to a universal level in which the human race is saved by the female sex oh right said lysander rannaldini should love it hes turned on by chains pity some loving man cant rescue poor darling kitty kitty could walk out if she wanted to said rachel dismissively yawning surreptitiously looking at his watch lysander wondered how soon he could take her home he looked longingly across at angels reach blank now the sun had set straining his eyes to see georgie and guy sitting on the terrace and dinsdale snapping at flies if you never got to that interview asked rachel what are you doing for a living now playing a lot of polo said lysander evasively and hoping to get arthur fit for the rutminster next year lucky to have a private income are you in a relationship no well yes suddenly he desperately needed to tell someone basically im mad about georgie maguire she and i well were sort of an item rachel went rigid with disapproval but what about her wildly uxorious husband hes been screwing around so all that rock star rubbish is for commercial profit united front for the world screw like rabbits in private i always thought georgie was phoney she didnt know about the screwing around when she wrote rock star she was devastated said lysander icily shes the loveliest woman ive ever met dont be ridiculous shes old enough to be your mother thats probably why i love her the videos finished lysander picked up his car keys ill take you home rachel was horrified why had she been such an utter bitch how could she explain that shed been celibate for six months that she felt like a funfair in winter endlessly wondering if summer would ever come again that it was desire that made her so cantankerous and the only thing she wanted was for lysander to take her to bed hermiones hysterics echoed round paradise she wasnt placated by the letters fanny mail the ideal homo called it that poured in after the release of don giovanni nor even by offers to star in a musical of lady chatterleys lover being hermione however within twentyfour hours she was telling everyone including kitty that the only thing that shocked her was rannaldinis appalling insensitivity to kitty in casting an exwife as leonore hermione had not forgiven kitty for being the recipient of georgies and marigolds confidences about their marriage problems she might put down georgie by praising brickies dignity but she still wanted to exceed kitty in everything even in being more of a brick but she was not prepared to concede defeat as rannaldini had inconveniently buzzed off to madrid and flora hermiones first chance to confront him would be at the camera rehearsal for the verdi requiem which was already being trailed as the prom of the year knowing rannaldini would be stymied if she refused to go on hermione was determined to use this as a bargaining point to get herself the part of leonore as usual rannaldini rolled up at the albert hall when the rehearsal was nearly over having left it to heinz the colourless swiss who didnt even have one variety who had replaced boris levitsky as assistant conductor three of the soloists a tenor a bass and monalisa wilson a vast black mezzosoprano with a vast voice were well into the lux aeterna exhorting the lord to let eternal light shine on them hermione who was not needed in this penultimate section had retreated to her dressing room venting her rage at rannaldinis tardiness on her dressmaker the poor woman had stayed up night after night finishing a ravishing lowcut dress made of panels of lavender and willowherbpink silk specially for the occasion alas she had not allowed for hermiones misery bingeing over the weekend and the zip wouldnt do up youve skimped on the material hermiones screeches rose above the orchestra and other soloists you cut it too small deliberately so youd have some spare for yourself those silks cost two hundred pounds a metre ouch that pin stuck into me trying to appear not to be listening the television crew wandered about looking for places to put their lights and cameras the following night the london met used to hermiones tantrums were fed up it was a blistering hot afternoon outside in the park one could hardly breathe theyd just returned from an exhausting tour of the eastern bloc with oswaldo rannaldini earned three hundred thousand a year as their musical director they hadnt seen him for three months and now hed swanned in to impose his usual rule of divine right and brute force they had vowed that theyd stand up to him but now once more they were reduced to quivering jelly lux aeterna over rannaldini insisted on taking the orchestra without hermione and the chorus through the final dies irae with its deafening thunderclaps that came before the skirling descending flashes of lightning the london met knew the requiem backwards they had made the definitive recording with rannaldini and hermione in but he was determined to show even the oldest hand that their playing had become fuzzy and inaccurate as he raised his baton some of the orchestra started and some didnt and they started to laugh out of nerves and were yelled at for inattention but soon the brass fanfares were ringing thrillingly round the hall sounds like a completely different orchestra said cordelia the bbcs glamorous blond lighting cameraperson calling a halt rannaldini got into a huddle with her and the director persuading them to lower all the albert hall and television lights during the sanctus and agnus dei then at the beginning of lux aeterna at the words let everlasting light shine upon them to raise them dramatically what about harefield shes the star asked cordelia shell need special lighting no no rannaldini gave a thin smile light her better than monalisa and the men and youll be accused of racism and sexism oh right said cordelia going pale not even in mrs harefields last section the libera me for soprano and chorus in fact rannaldini leant forward so cordelia who had already been mesmerized by his coalblack eyes caught a whiff of maestro it is me who the audience have come to see tomorrow you will witness the rerun of the most successful classical record of all times oh right said cordelia five minutes later so were really talking about rannaldini in concert and if the cameras focus on you throughout the evening with total darkness at the end except for your litup face we wont go far wrong exactly smiled rannaldini and we can always concentrate on harefields cleavage in the boring bits there will be no boring bits said rannaldini icily the orchestra looked at their watches in ten minutes theyd be into overtime determined to hold up the proceedings but disconcerted because she hadnt been summoned hermione finally emerged from her dressing room for once she was wearing trousers which emphasized her large bottom but covered up the bramble scratches on her ankles caused by trying to force her way down the now unstrimmed path to rannaldinis tower ignoring him she took up her position for the final libera me on his left with monalisa wilson like a great bolster between them maestro and maestress giggled the first flautist breast quivering eyes shining with unspilt tears hermiones mournful voice was soon soaring above the orchestra and chorus like a full moon above the stars as she pleaded to be delivered from gods wrath gods maybe but not rannaldinis murmured the leader of the orchestra what a beautiful voice what a beautiful lady thought cordelia with a shiver of pleasure but rannaldini had called a halt youre dragging mrs harefield he said bitchily we dont want the promenaders nodding off theres nowhere for them to lie down this is a requiem in memory of the greatest italian writer since dante not a lot of old horses on their way to the knackers but when hermione opened her mouth to screech a reply rannaldini countered by pointing at the brass as though he were plunging a skewer into a welldone turkey and started up the music again hermione had a powerful voice but supported by the heavy artillery of the orchestra and the aerial bombardment of the chorus rannaldini was bound to win louder louder he yelled raising the empty air with splayed fingers i can steel hear mrs harefield the screaming match that followed was so terrifying that the poor little tenor fell into the ferns and monalisa wilson snatched up the yellow duster belonging to the leader of the orchestra and tied it under her chin mistaking it for her new hermès scarf before she fled the orchestra watched mildly interested and later heard hermione and rannaldini squealing in her dressing room like pigs in an abattoir until rannaldini stormed out when hermione rang rannaldini in his flat overlooking hyde park to continue the row the london secretary put her on hold so she had to listen to herself singing donna annas aria from don giovanni all my love on him i lavished on the recorded musak which made her crosser than ever rannaldini spent the rest of the afternoon auditioning singers and musicians for fidelio who had to hump their instruments up eight flights of stairs because the lift wasnt working he then read through a letter he had dictated to rachels husband boris who having waded through a mountain of unsolicited scores sent into the london met had weeded out half a dozen of merit putting boriss berlin wall symphony dedicated to his new love chloe on top rannaldini needed boris he was aware that a great conductor is assessed in part by the new music he brings into being boris had been invaluable on a freelance basis pulling out the good stuff often presenting it in a simplified form to save rannaldini time he didnt want to upset boris too much my dear boy he wrote in black ink then reading the typing thank you for the latest batch from which i am returning your symphony since we are friends i know you would prefer me to be frank when i read your music i do not hear it for the enormous orchestra it requires it is highly complex noone could sing the chorus correctly one would have to hear it a dozen times to begin to understand it neither i nor the public have the time nor the inclination the good news is that i have a series of lectures to do for bbc in the autumn i shall need research done i will call you best to chloe his london secretary didnt type as well as kitty but she was much prettier as he scribbled yours ever rannaldini he felt he had been very good to boris showered and scented in a new grey satin dressinggown having assembled some exciting sex toys including a threefingered vibrator bought in paris on the way home and several phials of amyl nitrite rannaldini waited for flora clive was collecting her from heathrow outside the dusty plane trees were past their best and the bleached grass of the park was already covered in curledup brown leaves and couples in tshirts and shorts sharing a bottle before tonights performance tomorrow you wouldnt see a blade of grass for crowds jostling to gaze at him and hermione while he waited he flipped through the requiem he had conducted it so many times but one must always try and bring something new and exciting to a work his thoughts strayed to cordelia the blond cameraperson she was new and very exciting tomorrow flora had to return to paradise to get her trunk packed for the autumn term so he would ask cordelia out after the performance then he could invite her to light his bedroom with its shiny indigo walls and ceiling its dark mirrors and its rich crimson fourposter he might even offer her a job on fidelio he would have loved a threesome this evening but flora despite her habitual cool would never wear it even so he was roused out of the most erotic fantasy by crashes on the door louder than verdis thunderclaps through the spyhole he could see hermione let me in rannaldini hermione could cry louder than she could sing and as the editor of the scorpion had installed a bimbo in the nextdoor flat rannaldini let her in at once i cannot bear it maestro life is too short rannaldini agreed and opened a bottle of krug you have been behaving very badly carissima i know rannaldini you will ave to stand in the corner and you know what that means yes yes hermiones eyes glistened with excitement he could smell the goaty reek of her body what a peety keety is due any minute rannaldini smiled sadistically and you must leave now kitty wont mind protested hermione say were rehearsing we promised to treat keety with compassion remember hermione remembered no such thing when we get back to valhalla briefly rannaldini massaged her bottom it will be the punishment bell he was so worried flora would arrive as there was no latenight shopping to hold her up that he was forced to get dressed and go down the eight flights of stairs and bundle hermione into a taxi flora arrived twenty minutes later wearing georgies emeraldgreen leotard weighed down by carrier bags full of knickers and bringing him dutyfree armagnac givenchy for men and a new biography of swinburne whom he admired rannaldini who never wore any other scent but maestro was touched knowing him to be rich women seldom gave him presents rather indiscreetly he told her about the screaming match you need some hermione replacement therapy flora took a slug of krug the only time the silly old bag hits top e these days is when some journalist reveals her real age you should take your singing seriously then you can replace her what dyou think of these he threw half a dozen photographs on the little table beside her uck who are they you my angel rannaldini slid his hands over her breasts dont you recognize yourself my god fascinated flora examined her own shining pink clitoris and glistening labia lips laid back like butterfly wings i enter two prints anonymously in competition in german pornographic magazine announced rannaldini proudly you win first prize thats nice as im obviously going to plough my a levels i can put that in my cv when i start jobhunting it might help in times of recession at a rare looseend hermione went back to hers and bobs house in radnor walk always grumbling that she never had an evening in she now had absolutely no idea what to do with herself bob still tying up all the details for tomorrow wouldnt be home for hours the maid about to go out on her evening off made hermione a prawn omelette and was understandably irritated to find seveneighths of it in the bin the following morning having sung a lullaby over the telephone to little cosmo who rudely told her to piss off hermione picked up the score of the requiem shed show rannaldini he couldnt do without her tomorrow when she moved the promenaders to tears and then frenzied applause how dare he boot her out because kitty was in london on impulse to reassure herself she rang valhalla allo it was kittys breathless voice oos that hermione thought she must have rung the london number dropping the telephone she repunched the paradise number got kitty again and hung up in a fury she rang rannaldini who had his head between floras legs and mumbled truthfully that he couldnt talk then when hermione threatened to come round he said he would take it in another room having put on the mute button while he brought flora to orgasm he proceeded to tell hermione he had lied to her i am with cecilia not keety but i didnt want to upset you before your big night i want you to sleep well and ave beautiful dreams why are you seeing cecilia demanded hermione a crisis about natashas future we have to discuss ucca forms rannaldini lowered his voice i must go carissima why are you such a terrible liar asked flora fascinated when i was five i own up to stealing chocolate and my mother beat me which i didnt like so i never bother with the truth again hermione had a terrible night she went to bed early passed the long lonely hours brooding about cecilia flicking channels and then ordering the maid and bob to make her endless cups of camomile tea and honey when they returned having been persuaded by bob to take a mogadon she was wracked by nightmares about losing her place forgetting the notes and arriving at the albert hall to find cecilia singing in her place after another pill at five in the morning she woke at midday when the maid brought her breakfast and the daily telegraph the doctor would be coming round later with her vitamin a and b jabs to give her stamina and keep the saliva going she had just taken a large mouthful of fried bread when a picture of cecilia on the arts page with a caption about a husband and exwife team in the forthcoming fidelio reignited her rage when she dialled the savoy where cecilia always stayed a maid answered cecilia wasnt to be disturbed say its mrs harefield and its important finally out of curiosity cecilia allowed hermione to be put through and was very surprised when hermione congratulated her with great warmth on getting the part of leonore i know how good youll be vy tank you ermione although placated cecilia was still suspicious that is large of you is natasha all right vy should she not be did rannaldini give you those tickets last night asked hermione idly i thought we might all dine together afterwards i did not see rannaldini last night i only fly een this morning said cecilia he was with keety last night he was not screamed hermione kitty was in paradise i checked rannaldini said he was discussing natashas ucca with you the fucker he no discuss ucca wiz me screeched cecilia ven did he tell you zat but hermione was gone tugging on her clothes and roaring round to rannaldinis the lift was still broken and a cellist was lugging his priceless strad up the stairs when hermione overtook him shoving aside rannaldinis london secretary who was holding the door open for the cellist she barged inside rannaldinis not here mrs harefield said the london secretary aghast hes just slipped out of whom screeched hermione dont lie to me charging into the bedroom she met rannaldini coming out of the shower wrapped in a red towel you wicked liar screamed hermione terrified she was going to knee him in the groin rannaldini clapped his hands over his testicles leaving his face exposed next moment hermione caught his eye with a punishing right hook rannaldini would have hit her back had not the cellist appeared open mouthed in the doorway followed by a screaming cecilia very italian with snapping overfamiliar dark eyes an oily olive complexion streaked blond hair and a muscular workedout body cecilia was wearing an immaculate black suit with a long collarless jacket and a short pleated skirt and looked as though shed come straight off the catwalk with every claw out gathering up a bust of donizetti with a manic jangling of bracelets she hurled it at rannaldini who ducked so it shattered the mirror behind him which had witnessed so much of their lovemaking scellerato scellerato screamed cecilia echoing donna anna as she started working her way through a bowl of alabaster eggs monster of vice sink of iniquity screamed hermione echoing donna elvira bastard screamed cecilia just missing rannaldinis left ear shes right you are a bastard yelled hermione kicking rannaldinis shins and rushing out of the flat not my strad screamed the waiting cellist as rannaldini ran into the living room and grabbed his cello to stem the bombardment cecilia had not played cricket at school but she finally caught rannaldini on the corner of his other eye with a powderblue egg storming out she sent flying a blonde in a white towelling dressing gown whod just emerged from the flat of the editor of the scorpion to see what the fuss was about at which moment laughing her head off flora emerged from the shower having witnessed the whole thing through a twoway mirror oh dear she touched rannaldinis two fast blackening eyes now there are two pandas in paradise rannaldini had conducted with peritonitis with snakebite even with a sprained right wrist before now but he refused to expose himself to ridicule ringing bob he croaked down the telephone that he was dying of pneumonia shrouded in dark glasses and a black fedora he flew off to a retreat in the alps over in richmond in chloes drawing room boris levitsky wrestled with a twohour lecture on mahler which he had to deliver at cotchester university the following day and tried not to brood over rannaldinis vile letter returning his symphony chloe was out recording the alto rhapsody one of her first big breaks she would probably go out to dinner with the director and the conductor afterwards and not be home for hours bearing in mind boriss fondness for red meat and red wine and redblooded women she had left him a bottle of pedrotti now being warmed by the evening sun which he had vowed not to touch until he had finished his lecture in the fridge was a large steak with instructions how long to grill it on each side and a pierced baked potato to put in the top right of the aga an hour before he wanted to eat chloe herself however had been less redblooded since boris moved in as he was hopelessly impractical she had to look after him and as he hadnt sold a single composition and had packed in his job at bagley hall she had had to support him as well finally last week with the thought why doesnt the stroppy cow get off her ass ringing through her head she had had to write a cheque for rachels maintenance this had been the greatest humiliation of boriss life which was why he had fired off his new symphony to rannaldini groaning he wrenched his mind back to his lecture god i could endure anything mahler had written in despair to a woman fan after paying the berlin phil to perform his second symphony if only the future of my work seemed secure i am now thirtyfive years old uncelebrated very unperformed but i keep busy and dont let it get me down i have patience i wait boris didnt have patience chloe said it was like living with a goodlooking bear nor did he have the cash to pay the london met to perform his symphony which that shit rannaldini had torn to shreds outside the turning trees were casting long shadows of evening across the park a young mother with a pack of dusty happy children walked past carrying a picnic basket boris groaned again he never dreamt he would feel so guilty or miss rachel and his children so much bob harefield having endured hermiones hysterics was now faced with the prospect of replacing rannaldini placating an enraged bbc and probably being lynched by a massive audience suffering from acute withdrawal symptoms oswaldo was in moscow heinz the swiss was on a plane to rome bob was fed up with rannaldini there were other conductors he could have tried but he had always had a soft spot for rachel and her husband taking a deep breath bob dialled chloes number rannaldinis got his whores crossed he told boris do you want to conduct the verdi requiem tonight im afraid theres no time for a rehearsal there was a long pause yes i will come thank you bob said boris but i ave no score no car no tailcoat he is at dry cleaners chloes cat throw up on heem im sending a car for you with the score in said bob who knew boris had been done for drinkdriving and did not want to risk him getting lost and well find you some tails what size shirt are you i look boris tugged the back of his collar round to the front size sixteen i thank you bob from the beneath of my eart boris was too busy mugging up the score to feel really nervous until he saw the albert hall enmeshed like laccoon in the cables of the bbc television vans and the vast crowds that had gathered without any hope of tickets just to get a glimpse of harefield and rannaldini arriving once in the conductors dressing room he had great difficulty putting on the hired tails when your hands are trembling frantically it is hard to get the studs through the starched shirtfront he wished he could stiffen his upper lip accordingly the white tie took even longer and was so white that his face and teeth looked yellow by comparison he felt as if he were in a sauna and a straightjacket already need any help bobs gleaming brown head came round the door eef my hand shake this much when i get up there we start prestissimo and the ole thing will be over een ten minutes said boris through chattering teeth then blushing is possible to let rachel know i rang her said bob then thinking that at such a time white lies didnt matter she sent her love and wished you luck her love oh god if i make a dickup what will she say and how can i control hermione hermiones cried off said bob grimly despite his uncharacteristically enraged accusations that she was being utterly unprofessional and bloody wet his wife had refused to go on christ who sing eenstead i thought fuck it so i rang cecilia omigod boris went even paler i control her even less she raise skirt in middle of other soloists arias to distract audience bob laughed tonight shell play ball shes got the perfect opportunity to upstage rannaldini and hermione its me whos going to end up out of a job and in the divorce courts the shadows under bobs eyes were as deeply etched as bison horns in cave paintings the poor guy really has put his head on the block thought boris it was a stiflingly hot evening ladies with fans ruffled the fringes of those beside them the london met were tuning up like birds in a wood microphones hung like spiders tossed out of a window in the dress circle stalls and redcurtained gold boxes people chattered away excitedly in a score of different languages the promenade area was overflowing mostly with young men with beards and their girlfriends bright eyed and rosy cheeked like younger sisters in chekhov many of them held up rannaldini rules ok and we love hermione banners paper darts were sailing through the air the bbc had threatened to cancel richard baker who was covering the prom for television and peter barker for the radio were frantically rewriting their scripts as bob mounted the rostrum and dropped the bombshell that both rannaldini and hermione would not be appearing with the storm of protest that broke over his head it was a minute before he could announce that their places would be taken by boris levitsky a young russian composer and conductor very well known in his own country and by one of the greatest divas in the world cecilia rannaldini so at least bob shouted over the uproar you neednt fold up your rannaldini banners the audience glared at him stonily and started to boo and catcall some of them had flown thousands of miles and threatened to demand their money back others walked out in noisy disgust i ate them muttered boris waiting to go on theyll hate themselves even more when they realize what theyve missed said bob combing boriss tangled ponytail at the back his calm exterior belying panic within what if boris really couldnt cope the requiem was one of the most complex and demanding pieces of music the chorus sitting up against their crimson curtains slumped in disgust all the young sopranos and altos had been to the hairdressers and bought new black dresses they might never get another chance to sing or whatever under the great rannaldini o day of wrath o day of calamity sang the frontdesk cellist whod nearly lost his strad in rannaldinis flat the day before bobll get lynched if boris cocks it up boris is a good boy said his neighbour opening the score they were sharing and virtually inexperienced in public well be ok as long as we dont look up larry lockton was so enraged he had to rush to the bar for a quadruple whisky in anticipation of massive popular demand catchitune had just put on a huge repress of harefields and rannaldinis legendary version the only thing that fucker can be relied on to do is to let one down were leaving at the interval there isnt an interval said marigold consulting her programme they keep going for ninety minutes without a break poor boris i wonder whats happened to hermione and rannaldini i hope its something serious snarled larry it was bang on seventhirty boris tried to keep still take deep breaths and make his mind a blank but the butterflies inside him had turned into wild geese flapping around good luck said bob and may god go with you he whispered the promenaders scrambled to their feet boris fell up the stairs as he and the four soloists came on and had to be picked up by monalisa wilson enormous and resplendent in flamered chiffon im glad megastalin is indisposed she murmured to boris he frightens the life out of me reluctant laughter swept the hall as she brushed the dust off his knees in a motherly fashion and straightened his tie we show eem we do better wizout him whispered cecilia who looked stunning but more suited to sing in a nightclub in clinging gold sequins the boys very attractive she thought and comparatively untouched by human hand the biggest audience ever squeezed into the albert hall were bitterly disappointed but they saw boriss deathly pallor and his youth and some of the cognoscenti remembered his defection from russia goodwill began to trickle back standing on the rostrum all boris could see below the soaring organ pipes were rows and rows of men and women dressed in black as if for his funeral he saw the pearly skins of the drums and the gleaming brass who would play such a big part in the next ninety minutes the bows of the string section were poised above their instruments boris looked at them all solemnly and searchingly the notes of the score seemed to swim before his eyes pages of decision making and complexity bending his dark head he kissed the first page and with a totally steady hand gave the upbeat the whispering nightingales of the kyrie eleison can seldom have been slower or more hushed alas some gunman took off down kensington gore after a shootout and soon a convoy of police cars sirens wailing sforzando and hurtling after him could all be heard within the hall destroying the mood of veneration and snapping boriss concentration the first deafening crashes of the dies irae were very ragged every hair of boriss black glossy head was drenched in sweat the audience were beginning to exchange pained glances twice he lost his place pages fluttering like a trapped butterfly but like kindly trusty old arthur with a nervous young rider the london met carried him until he found it again his stick technique was ungainly when emotion overwhelmed him he slowed down dangerously in the recordare jesu pie when cecilia and monalisa sang their first exquisite divinely complementary duet together their voices chasing each other in arrows of light like fireflies he was so moved that he took his stick in both hands and began loudly to sing along with them until he remembered where he was and then had to wipe his eyes but slowly both orchestra chorus and packed crowd responded to his passion and terrifying intensity back in paradise earlier in the evening lysander sounding like neptune at the bottom of the sea had rung georgie from his car ive really goofed this time he said rannaldinis ducked out of the prom so boris is going on in his place verdis recreation or something rachel wanted to tape it on my machine but its fucked and i was stupid enough to say i was coming to see you and before i knew it georgie i said why didnt she come as well im really sorry ive screwed up floras last night its ok georgie stemmed the flow well get a takeaway rachel can have very dry vegetables said lysander reeling in gratitude shes seriously fierce but basically if shes watching boris she wont have too much time to bang on about unleaded petfood rachel was even fiercer overwhelmed with envy for georgies lovely house her replete indolent beauty and the obvious adoration of lysander only curbed by floras presence she was driven into a frenzy of disapproval she was also overcome with nerves for boris furious at having to watch him in front of strangers ashamed how jealous she felt that he rather than she should be given this massive break a quick drink on the terrace before the programme produced a storm of abuse because the overflow from floras bath came splattering out on to the terrace and noone did anything to save the water for the garden or even for washing the car trying to lighten things lysander said it was like arthur peeing and then couldnt stop laughing georgie who was wearing an old sundress and a yellow chiffon scarf to hide yet more lovebites was taken aback by how pretty rachel was like one of those girls the upper fourth have crushes on at school she carried understatement to an art form tonight her unmadeup eyes were hidden by big spectacles and with loose black trousers and padded shoulders on her long black cardigan you had no idea what shape she was but could only think how marvellous shed look with everything off on the way into the drawing room and the television georgie made the mistake of showing her the new yellowflowered paper in the dining room i wonder how many rainforest trees were cut down to produce that said rachel coldly i prefer painted walls myself nor were matters improved when flora wandered in with a huge vodka and tonic and wearing one of guys shirts with all the buttons done up to hide her lovebites from her mother and promptly lit a cigarette you shouldnt be smoking at your age snapped rachel having heard about flora throwing up in boriss trumpet and remembering him saying how sexy and talented she was she was not disposed to like her if i want to kill myself i should be allowed to said flora kissing lysander hallo its the harm youre doing to everyone elses lungs move dog ordered rachel who wanted to sit on the sofa facing the television dinsdale growled ominously im afraid he wont said georgie apologetically the fleas are terrible mum said flora slapping her ankles like dew leaping on the lawn very pointedly curling her long legs underneath her rachel sat in an armchair richard baker was now telling viewers that rannaldini and hermione wouldnt be appearing why on earth dyou think rannaldini cried off asked georgie emptying the remains of a bottle of muscadet into everyones glasses flora who knew couldnt say anything expect he had an offer he couldnt refuse remarked rachel sourly like some girl he hadnt fucked before once in flow she went on about rannaldinis promiscuity he was always trying to get me into bed and hes had chloe boriss present incumbent ultracool on the surface about rannaldini having enjoyed nearly a month in his company flora was now realizing how desperately she was going to miss him tired and depressed that she hadnt done any of her holiday work she wondered how on earth she would put up with the restrictions of bagley hall and now this stupid bitch wouldnt stop slagging him off once the requiem was under way however rachels scorn was reserved for boris why the hell was he wearing red braces why hadnt he cleaned his nails look at his hair halfway down his back that must be chloes doing look how it was escaping from its ponytail now he was taking things too fast now much too slowly he was so overemotional why the hell couldnt he beat in time why dont you shut up and listen muttered flora boris is conducting marvellously said lysander at the end of the dies irae but its a bit inspector morse for me kissing georgie and seeing they were supplied with drinks he slid off to rutminster to get a takeaway id no idea cecilia had such a wonderful voice or was so beautiful sighed georgie rannaldini bonks her every time she comes over spat rachel ill kill her soon thought flora oh theres marigold said georgie as the camera roved over the audience doesnt she look gorgeous anyone can look gorgeous when they spend that kind of money on clothes hissed rachel and the way her megalomaniac husband floodlights his house every night such a waste of energy she was panicstricken that any minute the cameras would latch on to chloe looking more blond and beautiful than anyone there dominating the screen was the husband who had left her and who after the performance would go back to chloes arms the requiem was drawing to a close the television crew whod come to mock were in ecstasies that a new star had been born boris had also been helped by cordelias superb lighting although he had to muddle through the agnus dei and the sanctus almost in the dark arms stretched out like a young christ tears spilled out of his long dark eyes and poured down his wide pale tortured face as he coaxed miracles out of orchestra chorus and soloists even though theyd sung and played their hearts out for well over an hour without a break both performers and audience wanted it to go on for ever after the thunderclaps the lightning and the soaring brass cecilia was singing again divinely mewing making up in dramatic effect whatever she lacked in beauty of tone the whispering nightingales had returned as like a priestess she intoned pianissimo twentynine quavers on the same middle c lord deliver my soul from the doom of eternal death in the great day of judgement then against an eversoftening drum roll the chorus joined in for the last two delivera mes and boris his stick like a scimitar brought the work to a close as the final brass sounded the last trump the promenaders gathered themselves up like a great tiger it seemed impossible that such a hush should be followed by such a deafening roar of applause as the entire audience musicians soloists and chorus rose from their seats shouting screaming and cheering the hall that had been so still was a churning sea of clapping hands richard baker was so excited he could hardly get the words out then boris who seemed in a trance broke down and sobbed like a wild animal until monalisa wilson pulled him comfortingly to her bosom and the bass lent him a red paisley handkerchief to dry his tears as the bravoes rang out as he stumbled downstairs for the first time bob was waiting his round kind ecstatic face told it all didnt you hear giuseppi weeping with joy up in heaven oh my dear boy and they were in each others arms frantically clapping each others backs but not for long boris was next being smothered in kisses cecilia only had time to wipe away her mascara before they were back on stage running on with a mosaic of red lipstick down the side of his face clapping all the time like an excited child boris shook hands repeatedly with each of the soloists then brought the section leaders to their feet with as many of the orchestra as he could reach to mighty roars of applause and thunderous stampings of feet he made the entire chorus stand up again and again then there were more cheers for the chorus master but the applause was for him and when two huge bunches of yellow carnations and lilies arrived for monalisa and cecilia everyone laughed and yelled approval when cecilia promptly gave hers to boris with a little curtsy what are you doing later she murmured more more more yelled the entire albert hall stamping their feet vot shall i play i breeng no music i no expect said boris bob smiled i took the precaution of getting copies run off of one of your songs so boris mounted the rostrum once more with cecilias flowers still under his arm and the hall fell silent i no spik good english he said in a choked voice but i zank you all i feel the good weel she carry me i will have zee orchestra play leetle composition of mine in style of russian folksongs that grass is not more green on other side of fence despite the orchestra and cecilia sightreading the charm and haunting beauty of the little piece was indisputable and once more boris was cheered to the rooftops and they were still applauding when richard baker regretfully bid goodbye to the viewers that was the most wonderful programme ive ever seen said georgie wiping her eyes you really missed something she told lysander as he came through the door weighed down with carrier bags i saw a bit in the chip shop said lysander then turning to rachel you must be so thrilled but rachel was inveighing against bob for not making boris play one of his more ambitious compositions as an encore instead of that sentimental derivative crap and did you see the way cecilia was pawing him talk about cradlesnatching thats a very ageist remark said flora gently as she removed a mcdonalds cardboard box out of the nearest carrier bag your exhusband is without doubt one of the sexiest men in the world all he had to do this evening was stand up and women of both sexes would have swooned all over him as it was he produced the most exciting and beautiful requiem people will probably ever be privileged to hear and cecilia sang like an angel too unlike you boris hears music with his heart not his ears and youre such a bitch i can see exactly why he left you darling protested georgie you have no idea the sacrifices weve made went on flora getting out a burger and taking a large bite i havent had a cigarette for over an hour youve wrecked my mothers and my last evening together and poor lysanders had to miss eastenders and the bill and he cant even watch it later because we were taping boris for you oh shut up flora lysander leant forward to fill up rachels glass boris did so well its a pity richard baker cant interview him afterwards like rugger players i know rachels stony face crumbled in an avalanche of grief he was absolutely miraculous but i cant ring and tell him because chloell be there bob had spread the word before the concert and the green room was absolutely packed with press gimme a ring in the morning said larry whod actually stayed awake throughout pressing his card on boris ill record that folksong and anything else youve got at home in the past interviewers had slit their throats because boris had been so inarticulate but tonight he had found his tongue why havent you been discovered earlier asked the standard i didnt know how to beat when i start the reviews were so terrible they almost depart me i became rannaldinis assistant rannaldini never go seek what happened to rannaldini this evening asked the mail boris grinned i think he ran into french window why doesnt he programme more of your music he dont like eet he no understand avantgarde music then as an afterthought rannaldini ees a vanker the press howled with laughter thats enough said bob hastily boris has had quite a night give him a ring tomorrow morning i geeve lecture on mahler in the afternoon be the last youll have to give said bob having extracted boris rather reluctantly from cecilias clutches he took him out to dinner at the chanterelle in old brompton road boriss wrist ached so much he could hardly cut up his steak he wasnt very hungry anyway but he drank a lot of red wine and talked a lot about rachel she geeve me a terrible cold shoulder at zee end of our marriage she wont sleep wiz me because she tink i was carrying on and i carried on because she wouldnt sleep with me is vicious triangle she is beetch but i love her i ate rannaldini living so near her you know he ad chloe at one time shes only a bitch because shes insecure said bob chloe come home as i was leaving said boris darkly she could have come but she was tired and her air was dirty rachel would have drop everything but she would ave given me hard time because she was frighten for me i once zink grass is greener on other side but now i find eet cover een pesticide tonight was wonderful i zank you bob but i weesh rachel and the children had been there my new symphony is dedicated to chloe when i write it down in pencil chloe went over it in ink for me and put in the bars i should keep your options open said bob why not dedicate it to cecilia ive read it he went on there are fantastic things in that symphony i didnt know such sounds existed id send it to simon rattle rachel is miserable and she loves you why dont you try again if you had money and you certainly will after this evening things would be very different can i borrow the score said boris as they went out a little unsteadily into the hot russet night i like to go through and ighlight my mistakes you can keep it said bob youve made history like the night lennie bernstein took over from bruno walter this was confirmed by ecstatic reviews and news stories in all the papers the following day the best notice came from the times critic whose wife rannaldini had once taken to bed in revenge for a lousy review invitations to conduct to compose to appear on television and give press interviews poured in all day instead of lecturing his students about mahler boris sat on the edge of a desk and told them about his night at the albert hall rannaldini who watched the video with two very black eyes was insane with jealousy ringing up bob he screamed at him for replacing him with such a hopeless amateur he was brilliant argued bob he had the longest ovation ive ever heard promenaders ave no discrimination eef tabloid come on in a white tie they cheer their eads off rannaldini was even crosser when the story leaked by the bimbo next door of the row with cecilia and hermione was plastered all over the scorpion the next time he confronted the london met to rehearse the missa solemnis they launched into two lovely black eyes and when he screamed at them they refused to be intimidated and played it again when it came to the public performance the frontdesk cellist whose strad rannaldini had endangered deliberately played god save the queen in the wrong key machiavellian as ever rannaldini decided to avenge himself on boris by laying siege to rachel this would not only enrage hermione and cecilia with whom he was still furious but also flora who refused to take the whole eyeblacking incident seriously she insisted on calling him panda ii and had been cheeky enough to insist that boriss requiem had been the best thing she had ever heard rannaldini was further turned on by rachels animosity and the way she kept firing off incensed letters to the local papers complaining about his clay shoots his closing of footpaths and his spraying with pesticides ignoring such bombardment rannaldini started dropping in at jasmine cottage occasionally at weekends encountering lysander who was at a loose end with guy at home and the polo season over rannaldini had also persuaded catchitune to sign up rachel to record the rachmaninov piano concertos in the autumn with himself conducting he knew it was too big a break for her to refuse he was amused that despite his largesse rachel kept an icy distance and just as the husbands of paradise had tried to make the best chocolate cake for the fête now following rannaldinis example they vied unknown to their wives to be the first to comfort rachel lysander thought the whole thing hilarious and promptly picked up the telephone ferdie ferdie youll never guess rachel my eyegel friend has emerged in paradise and all the husbands are mad about her theyre all putting up shelves for her health foods and stalling their mowers with unleaded petrol first they rolled up with trays of tomatoes for chutney last week it was twolegged carrots this week its apples her cottage looks like harvest festival and rachel chucks out most of it because its not organic enough so arthur and tiny are doing terribly well whos after her asked ferdie beadily well rannaldini guy larry bob and the vicar for starters larry and guy bloody shouldnt be snapped ferdie thinking of marigolds retainer and georgies fat monthly cheque your only justification for being down there is to keep them keen on their wives youd better come back to london and earn some serious money ive got a terrific job for you in kenya beautiful rich wife shitofaparasite husband stacks of polo and racing im happy in paradise bleated lysander in a panic at the thought of leaving georgie none of them is serious about rachel they just dont want each other to get her rachels a crosspatch but seriously goodlooking i wouldnt mind giving her one myself if you stopped at one i wouldnt mind said ferdie disapprovingly i had to cope with your father yesterday rolled up in a strop because you hadnt written hes left you a letter i wont read it itll be just another lecture about getting a proper job ive been working rannaldinis horses said lysander by way of mitigation he wants me to race ride for him in the winter that wont keep you in fags fags want to keep me the vicars asked me to go to the holy land dont be fatuous hows natasha asked ferdie even her name still caused him pain gone back to school but she and flora are home on sunday for rannaldinis famous tennis tournament do you want to play ok ill come down for the weekend it would be an excuse to see natasha and protect his investment poor kitty meanwhile had been having a dreadful summer increasingly desperate for a baby she had spent nearly all the runningaway money she had saved in case things became too awful hawking herself from one gynaecologist to another putting up with the embarrassment of endless tests and internal probings but even when her tubes were blown noone could find anything wrong and its not my husband hes got loads of kids already kitty kept telling the doctors rannaldini who bitterly resented any time kitty took off felt she should have been satisfied with her seven stepchildren eight including little cosmo concentrate on being a mother to them and a secretary to me but im almost the same age as your older children thought kitty and the young ones although very cute made her feel guilty about longing so much for one of her own her chances seemed less and less likely as rannaldini slept with her so seldom she had put up with rannaldini and flora all summer and she had been upset and had to fend off the press over the eyeblacking furore but it had given her a faint hope that with hermione and cecilia out of favour and flora back at bagley hall rannaldini might have more time for her but immediately cecilia whom rannaldini had to forgive because she was starring in fidelio turned up to use valhalla as a base for the duration of filming hermione who was still excluded from maestros presence became even more histrionic cecilia was easier than hermione because she was less stupid and patronizing and at least had a sense of humour but she was just as demanding and narcissistic and there was also her total assumption that rannaldini was still in love with her i cannot understand keety why he is so obsessively jealous of all my admirers he ripped out the telephone when i was talking to carlo the other day and i darent tell him luigi wants to take me to thailand every time cecilia went out she invited kitty to her room pretending to ask her advice on what to wear but really to show off how wonderful she looked in clothes often to kittys embarrassment she would greet her in the nude taunting her with a body that was fullbreasted but wonderfully slender elsewhere and magnificent for someone well over forty how could rannaldini ever notice kitty with that around it was the eve of valhalla tennis tournament cecilia had mercifully disappeared to paris in a ravishing pink shorts suit and rannaldinis helicopter rannaldini who was at home for once had retreated to look at rushes of fidelio in his tower kitty had hoped for peace to make cakes and sandwich fillings for tomorrow and to give herself a perm but alas rachel turned up trailing two fretful children who found making fortresses out of egg boxes insufficiently amusing during a hot summer afternoon kitty had been very kind to rachel listening endlessly to her problems and looking after her children when rachel needed to practise or see lawyers rachel felt it was only fair in turn to prevent kitty poisoning herself and the environment why make a strawberry flan she was now complaining when strawberries are out of season and theres a glut of apples and tuna fish tuna fish shrieked rachel didnt you know tuna congregate beneath schools of dolphin and the tuna fleets haul up dolphin at the same time nearly a quarter of a million dolphin die in the pacific poor fings muttered kitty appalled ill remember next time good though to use brown flour said rachel feeling shed been a bit sharp then catching sight of a packet of tampax in kittys shopping bag but i wish youd use sts tampons floating round in the sea take a hundred and twenty days to biodegrade shut up kitty wanted to scream normally as regular as clockwork she was a week late and praying that at last she might be pregnant like taking an umbrella out on a sunny day she had bought the tampax rachel was now glaring at a screen kitty was secretly covering with photographs of rannaldini and the famous for his birthday in december christ look at him leering at princess di your husband is such a lech kitty why dyou put up with it i love im god knows why i wish hed stop dropping in on jasmine cottage i wish all the husbands would ones so defenceless being so close to the road everyone can see lights or hear the radio not rachel as well thought kitty hopelessly on the dresser was a letter from her mother enclosing a postal order for three pounds and a card with a printed message wishing a wonderful daughter many happy returns tomorrow rannaldini was sure to forget it was her birthday as it was mr brimscombes day off shed better water the new plants the roots of older plants were supposed to go down far enough to find water emptying an entire wateringcan over a blueymauve clematis against the wall she reflected that new plants like new or potential mistresses required attention was this why rannaldini was giving rachel all this work and insisting she came to the tournament tomorrow and making sure gretel looked after her children dear god help me to stop grumbling pleaded kitty if im pregnant ill never never grumble again and at least rannaldini hasnt taken hermione back as rannaldinis tournaments were so unbelievably competitive marigold and georgie had arranged to play a warmup foursome with ferdie and lysander the evening before guy had gone to salisbury to look at a private collection larry wasnt due back from london until later so the coast was clear on the way over to angels reach lysander had to pop in to rannaldinis yard to pick up some worming tablets for tiny and arthur there had been no letup in the weather the authorities were even muttering about standpipes travellers joy fell in creamy festoons over the hedgerows which were weighed down with haws and shining scarlet hips ferdie could have leant out of the ferrari and helped himself to huge ripe blackberries if lysander hadnt driven so fast a glut of crabapples crunched beneath the wheels lysander was unsettled by the tang of bonfires in october his mother would have been dead a year he clenched the steeringwheel to ease the pain he must put some flowers on her grave perhaps he should make it up with his father autumn had been daubing rannaldinis woods yellow and orange the virginia creeper smothering the grooms cottage had already turned crimson walking into the immaculate but deserted yard lysander heard a bloodcurdling scream like a rabbit caught in a snare whipping round he was relieved to see maggie and jack still sitting beside ferdie in the car no please please no screamed a female voice for a horrified second lysander thought it might be kitty being savaged by the prince of darkness but no he was safely muzzled in his box there it was again another dreadful wail coming from the indoor school in which rannaldini enjoyed being left alone to dominate difficult horses his methods were very cruel according to janice the head groom but being well paid she let well alone beckoning frantically for ferdie lysander loped round the corner and found the door of the indoor school locked no more please the moaning voice was too deep and throaty for kittys you agreed to do everything i asked it was rannaldini spinechillingly cold clambering on to ferdies broad shoulders lysander straightened up and nearly fell off he must be seeing things for there in the centre wearing shiny black ridingboots and the tightest buff breeches stood rannaldini with one hand he held a hunting whip which he was cracking like a rattlesnake with the other a leading rein which was attached to a studded dogcollar round hermiones neck hermione was totally naked except for tightfitting highheeled boots her body ran with sweat her large wonderfully firm breasts bounced as she trotted round in a circle her big curved bottom was already slightly pink her eyes glistened in terror and excitement youre not going fast enough snapped rannaldini cracking the whip again so the wicked thong caught her left buttock with a neighing scream hermione broke into a canter wrong leg thought lysander she was panting hard now rannaldini smiled but his eyes were dead are you sorry for the way you behaved oh yes rannaldini sorry you made scenes yes yes what are you going to do about it head up straighten your back with another vicious flick he caught the underside of her breast im sorry shrieked hermione i said what are you going to do about it yanking her towards him nearly toppling her he put a hand between her legs youre getting bloody excited loving it arent you yes rannaldini then well try a few jumps come on bitch at this moment lysander tumbled off ferdies shoulders and sent a yard broom flying whos there called out rannaldini just in time ferdie and lysander leapt behind the mounting block at least the ferrari was parked round the corner as rannaldini came out they flattened in terror fortunately lust drew him back again must have been a horse they heard him say as the key turned in the lock what was going on hissed ferdie lysander bright red with shock trying not to laugh mouth wide open in amazement couldnt utter until they had hurtled to the boundaries of rannaldinis land and turned into the road up to angels reach oh ferd you never saw such a thing in your life talk about undressage he was schooling her and she was bollocknaked except for her boots shes got the most fantastic body you can see exactly why he stays with her she was giving excited little squeaks like maggie when she gets on a rabbit trail give me a cigarette and they were obviously about to have the most enormous bonk god it was gross but seriously sexy wow ive never seen anything like that you must have in a porn mag dearie me ill never get rid of this erection he took a cigarette from ferdie gave a long drag and gasped in horror you dont suppose he schools poor darling kitty do you shed be a lot thinner if he did georgie looked better really wonderful thought ferdie as he and lysander went into the kitchen at angels reach he felt distinctly envious when after pecking him on the cheek she turned to lysander wrapping him in a warm voluptuous embrace and kissed him quite openly on the mouth she was wearing a torn grey tshirt of floras and a pair of guys boxer shorts covered with bonking alligators despite chunkier legs she looked twice as sexy as marigold who was all done up in a pleated white tennis dress with her hair in a pink bow aym afraid ay always maintain the discipline of wearin whayte she said apologetically lysander wouldnt let anyone hit a ball until theyd drunk a bottle of muscadet and hed relayed every detail of his adventure the grass court was tucked away behind the house marigold was a good player having spent her youth aspiring to join a tennis club she had been much coached in later life and as a nonworking wife played all summer ferdie was overweight but he had a good eye and got most things back georgie had no backhand and was out of practice but she played with lysander who was so soaringly better than anyone else that they beat marigold and ferdie after that they started fooling around pretending the ball was hermione and saying youve been a naughty girl whack and giving a shriek and getting so weak with laughter that maggie got excited and ran off with all the balls with jack yapping encouragement so they packed it in georgie seemed so happy that as they walked back to the house ferdie dropped back and asked lysander if she knew anything about guy pursuing rachel no im sure not why upset her god this weathers bliss if this is the greenhouse effect long may it last said georgie emptying a wateringcan over a panting dinsdale dont let rachel hear you said marigold nervously and dont let her see you wastin water laike that shes given me hell about larrys floodlaightin and our chandeliers in the lounge it was the most perfect evening nightscented stock and tobacco plants mingled their sweet scents with the first autumnal waft of the poplars a pale blueandcherryred airballoon drifted home into a rosepink sunset passing the bright star arcturus which had just appeared above the wood rannaldinis going to be livid lysanders so good said marigold hes so used to being the best player by miles you and i might beat him said georgie fondly arent you going to play with guy no im not he gets so cross if i serve double faults lysander couldnt get the scene in the riding school out of his mind it was the act of a seriously depraved man why doesnt kitty leave him georgie shrugged her face in shadow why doesnt anyone leave anyone mental paralysis a belief in fidelity kittys awfully religious she worships the bastard and hes sapped her confidence anyway where would she go her mothers in a home rannaldini wont let her go shes far too useful said marigold an owl hooted pigeons cooed across the valley they were shooting clays georgie topped up everyones glass and took another bottle out of the ice bucket for lysander to open ive had a brainwave she said patronizingly kittys got a birthday this month shes a virgo wouldnt you know why dont we club together and give lysander to her as a present she turned to lysander her sludgegreen eyes dark brown and mocking in the halflight youre always talking about the need for a real challenge forget the rutminster try kitty dont be ridiculous said lysander with rare ill temper itd be a farce theres no way i could get rannaldini back for kitty he was never hers in the first place for marigold for you for hermione not that she needs it for rachel even no problem but not poor little kitty for christs sake with her sad round formless face kitty reminded him of the huge white moon hanging like a plate above larrys woods hardly discernible in the pale azure sky of the first dusk go on urged ferdie scenting more cash give it a try if lysander was refusing to leave paradise and georgie this seemed a good way to supplement his income lysander scooped up maggie who was trembling at the bangs of the clay shoot cuddling her to his chest you just collect the ten per cent he said crossly you get rannaldini back if you feel so strongly im having none of it the others proceeded to get drunk and noisy lysander sat in silence watching the moon rising turning from a pale pinkyorange to buttergold like one of miss cricklades sunflowers to incandescent motherofpearl and then flooding the whole valley while the sky deepened from smokyblue to sapphire as the doomed menacing notes of rachmaninovs third and most difficult piano concerto floated up from jasmine cottage rachel plays wonderfully well said marigold larry says shes going to be a big star might cheer her up said georgie better than grumbling about junk food and fending off passes from rannaldini youd be a true knaight in shining armour if you rattled rannaldini and made him naicer to kitty said marigold at six oclock the following morning kitty was woken by the hiss of illicit sprinklers defying the hosepipe ban the floodlights of paradise grange across the valley had been switched off which would delight rachel but to the left venus blazed golden and as orion followed by his yawning dogs pulled on his boots and climbed up the sky kitty could see mr brimscombe wearily picking up discarded underclothes round the pool natasha and a crowd of friends had gone skinnydipping in the middle of the night their shrieks must have roused the whole neighbourhood glancing in the mirror kitty gave a wail desperate at the lankness of her hair in her tiredness she had misread the homeperm directions and left the mix on too long the result was a scorched frizzy mass if only she could hide behind the tea urn this afternoon but at the last moment rannaldini had asked the vicar whose wife was away and would expect kitty to make up the numbers falling to her knees kitty prayed to god to make her less vain and let me not let my partner down too badly this afternoon and please dont let anyone find out its my birthday or theyll be embarrassed it was already hot and airless as she crept downstairs amid the chaos of dirty glasses mugs beer cans and overflowing ashtrays there was a note from natasha about not singeing her tennis dress kitty wanted to scream but at least she hadnt got the curse and mrs brimscombe was coming to help with tea matters were not improved by cecilia wandering down at lunchtime wanting three exquisite tennis dresses shed bought in rome ironed and rannaldini arriving from a morning on the fidelio set finding fault with everything and insisting she repack his suitcase should he decide to push off back to germany tonight instead of early tomorrow now in accompaniment to richard strausss arabella kitty could hear the buzz of three hairdriers upstairs as fearful of rachel arriving early and bollocking her for using aerosols she gave a closet squirt of mr sheen to the diningroom tables before laying out the tea things the main tennis court at valhalla lay some three hundred yards from the house beyond the swimmingpool it was ringed by a thick high hornbeam hedge which also encompassed grassy banks where spectators could lie out and a charming duckeggblue pavilion opposite this a spyhole had been cut out of the hornbeam giving a delightful view of the valley and magpie cottage although valhalla was greener than anywhere else in paradise on this stiflingly hot day rannaldini couldnt entirely stem the approach of autumn despite mr brimscombes incessant sweeping the lawn was strewn with gold leaves and chattering swallows lined up on the grey roof of the house on the table in the pavilion kitty had put a big blue bowl of greengages and plums from rannaldinis orchard a matching blue vase of yellow snapdragons and red dahlias and two big jugs of lemon barley water but no alcohol tennis was taken deadly seriously at valhalla pained by such a hideous colour combination rannaldini removed the red dahlias from the vase chucking them on the grass to be trodden underfoot by the first arrivals as beautiful as the peacock butterflies crowding the michaelmas daisies round the pavilion gathered the ladies of paradise their limbs as smooth and shiningly brown as the conkers hanging in their prickly cases on the great golden chestnuts on the edge of rannaldinis woods cecilia wore the palest pink dress with huge cutouts at the waist natasha a zipup white mini with her dark hair in a long plait tied with a scarlet ribbon marigold had covered her bulges with a broderieanglaise shift and flaunted her lovely legs in the tiniest of white shorts she was kicking herself for lending an adorable white cottonjersey dress with a lace neckline to rachel which clung to rachels figure and showed off her even lovelier long lilywhite legs which rachel loathed herself for shaving nor had being gratuitously rude about the monstrous expense of the dress deterred rachel from wearing it arriving late georgie instantly cursed herself for not making more effort touched because guy had brought her breakfast in bed exhausted but happy after a long successful mornings work she hadnt bothered to wash her hair unable to find the new white shirt and flowered bermudas shed specially hidden from flora shed been forced to wear yesterdays grey tshirt and a pair of cycling shorts which had looked fine in the bedroom mirror only outside did she realize how pallid the backs of her legs were flora looked her usual truculent sexy self in the baggiest of white tshirts the male players on the whole looked less glamorous the vicar sporting a nazareth carpenter seeks joiners sticker in the back of his ancient ford rolled up in baggy greying shorts of just the wrong length tepid rather than hot pants murmured georgie do i look like a bender asked ferdie as he trained his normally slickedback hair forward to cover a large red spot yes said lysander turning the ferrari into rannaldinis drive feeling horrendously overweight having eaten last night most of the large curry he and lysander had ordered ferdie had kitted himself out at lillywhites before leaving london he was now appalled to discover he was wearing the same jokey orange shorts and white tshirt covered with orange red and mauve squiggles and orangeandmauve sweat band as larry the only difference was that larry had dressed up his outfit with a great deal of gold jewellery and was weighed down by six black hammer wilson racquets guy was in stitches ive got a nonfigurative exhibition coming up next month he told ferdie and larry ill have to hang you both in the gallery ferdies certainly got a nonfigure said natasha poking his beer gut with her tennis racquet ferdies brilliant at figures said lysander sharply seeing the hurt in ferdies eyes aware how white flattered his powerful body and ruddy suntanned face guy was pleased with his appearance until he saw rannaldini in a ten times more expensive cream polo shirt shorts showing off his chunky walnutbrown legs and a cream bomber jacket with terracotta piping flung over his muscular shoulders no heat was ever too hot for rannaldini getting into training for hellfires thought guy sourly at least that fucker lysander looked hungover to the teeth and had only taken the trouble to tug on a pair of trainers and frayed denim shorts unlike georgie lysander was dreading the afternoon not being married he got no buzz out of situations where he had to conceal his feelings he hated not being able to kiss georgie and tell her how much he adored her and she had warned him to be particularly careful today because she didnt want flora to suspect anything lysanders dogs showed no such reserve leaping out of the ferrari they threw themselves noisily on dinsdale maggie swinging on his ginger ears jack chiding him for being away from them for at least eighteen hours until they all took off into the wood by the time the stable clock struck three all the guests had arrived natasha black plait flying was knocking up with marigold larry and guy the standard terrifyingly high as kitty tried surreptitiously to join the party she was foiled by cecilia keety i never see you een shorts before an you change your air lets see you everyone turned to look thunder and lightning the size of your thighs is frightening sang natasha aware of rannaldinis irritated indifference kitty wanted to turn and run guy made everything worse by charging off the court brickie looks terrific we missed you at matins didnt we percy and you missed a splendid sermon hell for you kitty darling having cecilia staying whispered meredith who was looking sweet in mauve shorts and his white christopher robin hat worse than having the builders in he went on at least youve got hot water and no hermione or rather you did have manaccia swore cecilia swallowing a greengage stone marigold and georgie exchanged looks of horror i cant bear it thought kitty bloody hell murmured flora rannaldinis forgiven her and not me for hermione had emerged from the path which had once more been strimmed through the wood to her house trampling heavily on chuckedout red dahlias like a goddess in search of an apple she was ravishingly dressed in a pleated white tunic which left one big golden shoulder bare her shining dark curls were arranged most becomingly over a flamingopink sweat band which echoed the flush in her glowing brown cheeks hallo brickie cried hermione ignoring all the other women then turning to curtsy to rannaldini good afternoon maestro sorry were late horsey horsey dont you stop whispered lysander to ferdie do you think rannaldinis going to school her over the tennis net and he had such difficulty in keeping a straight face that he had to wander off into the wood following hermione carrying her bag and racquets as well as his own came bob smiling as usual and looking elegantly oldfashioned in white flannels braces and a panama shading his tired deepset eyes he really is handsome thought rachel cecilia who was livid to see hermione said we better get started rannaldini ive got to be on the set by ten oclock tomorrow and she launched into mir ist so wunderbar from the first act of fidelio to rub in that she and not hermione had landed the part of leonore his eyes glittering with malice rannaldini tapped the table with the handle of his racquet welcome to our tournament the procedure is seemple there are sixteen of us here we divide into two groups each consisting of four couples who each play one set against each other group one play on this court group two on a court round corner this means six sets on each court then we break for a quick cup of tea followed by the finals in which the best couple in each group play against each other we then have proper tea as much champagne as any of you feel fitting to dreenk on a sunday night then the couple who has lost the most matches will streep off and jump naked into the pool rannaldini smiled evilly and the punishment bell will be rung who plays with who asked the vicar gazing longingly at lysander i come to that the man who draws longest straw has first choice of partner him with second longest second choice and so on natasha came round with the straws as lysander whod temporarily stopped laughing stretched out a lazy hand natasha deliberately let hers touch his lucky in love you choose first she said as he drew the longest straw lysander glanced round at the charming expectant faces flora looking sulkily sexy natasha smouldering with promise hermione radiating certainty of course hell choose me rachel trying to appear indifferent but her eyes telling a different story marigold smiling at larry who was ringing japan on his mobile cecilia letting her pink slitskirt fall open i will excite you more than any of the others said her hot lingering glance and georgie fondly indulgent lysanders dear love and to him even lovelier because she looked tired and not her best then at the back her fat legs as brickred as the squashed dahlias she was clutching her face topped by that frightful frizzy perm and shiny from racing around all day cringed kitty her very white aertex shirt and her pleated shorts strained over her large breasts and bottom dying of humiliation she gazed down at her racquet knowing she would be the last to be chosen georgie whom he longed to please had begged him to look after her id like to play with kitty said lysander you what said rannaldini incredulously smiling mishearing georgie moved forward i said i wanted to play with kitty said lysander firmly going over and putting his arm round her shoulders he saw tears swimming behind the impossibly strong spectacles fank you she mumbled the judgement of paris murmured bob well done ferdie was incensed youre supposed to be getting guy back for georgie he hissed what nice manners lysander has said hermione loudly anyone who says the young havent got exceptionally nice manners doesnt know what theyre talking about georgie was livid particularly when the vicar who had the second longest straw noticing her closeness to lysander and desperate to get in there decided to overcome his disapproval of her behaviour at the fête and chose her as his partner she was even crosser when guy relieved of his duty as ace carer to choose kitty infuriated the husbands of paradise by picking rachel natasha however was crossest of all to be chosen by ferdie who was getting redder and sweatier by the minute i dont want my eyes blacked giggled the ideal homo so i choose flora nor do i muttered bob ignoring hermiones furious stare he chose marigold larry chose cecilia because hermioned just sent him a furious letter about an advance men are frightened of playing with really good women players hermione told the empty air as rannaldini whod drawn the short straw bore her off to court two oh goodee a cosy girls foursome murmured flora as she and the ideal homo also set off to the second court to play against georgie and the vicar a spitting natasha then had to watch kitty and lysander drawn against larry and cecilia both class players on court one im orribly bad kitty told lysander miserably clutching her ancient prince racquet hurrah said lysander ive got a dreadful hangover so if we get knocked out early we can slope off and watch longchamps a champing larry kicked off unleashing a thunderbolt at poor kitty who missed it completely his next serve to lysander came hurtling back picking up the ball on the halfvolley larry whacked it crosscourt to kitty who missed once again returning to serve to kitty once more an overeager larry released another thunderbolt while she was still retrieving a ball from the long grass hitting her hard on the bottom you shouldnt be so large shouted natasha you ok kitty called lysander sympathetically she wasnt ready he yelled to mr brimscombe who was umpiring forty love said mr brimscombe who fed up with sweeping up leaves thought he might allow himself to be lured back to larry just lulling the opposition into a feeling of false security said lysander grinning at kitty as he easily passed cecilia with his backhand forty fifteen but poor kitty was nowhere near larrys next service game to mr lockton and mrs rannaldini they lead kitty hung her frizzy head im so sorry doesnt matter lysander peered through the spyhole as they changed ends i can see arthur talking to some children i wonder where jack and maggie are theyve been gone for ages weve got sun in our eyes this end he plonked his baseball cap over kittys perm it cant be much worse than larrys jewels lucky cecilia to have olive skin that never goes red thought kitty as she cringed at the net waiting for lysanders serve watch zee ball keety called out cecilia kindly you wont even see this one duckie muttered lysander bouncing the ball reflectively he waited for cecilia to get into position then curling over like a breaking wave he aced her larry jumped from foot to foot awaiting service blowing on his nails twitching his orangeandpurple shirt he had all the wimbledon tricks hed show the little bastard another ace hurtled past his ear at mph game to mr hawkley and mrs kitty said mr brimscombe two aces later cecilia was so furious that she served a double fault to kitty which gave her and lysander a vital point lysander only having to win his service to clinch the next game aware of everyone watching her and she thought laughing kittys hand was so sweaty that she promptly served two double faults on the second lysander reached out and caught the shocking pink ball as it veered off into the woods tossed it into the right court he then turned and gave kitty a smile of such reassuring sweetness that she served the next ball in cecilia pounded it straight to lysander who whipped it between her and larry from then on kittys dollydrops went in and lysander killed the return he was such a dazzlingly natural player and his encouragement and kindness if she missed a shot gave kitty such confidence that having beaten the outraged larry and cecilia they went on to thrash natasha and ferdie flora and meredith fooled about so much they lost all their three matches which suited them both meredith wanted to drink lemon barley water and drool over lysander flora was desperate for a word with rannaldini who with hermione had slaughtered her and meredith without the loss of a point or the flicker of a smile now as he stood alone watching the needle match that had just started on court one rachel and guy v kitty and lysander to see which pair went into the final flora sidled up detesting herself she slid a hand into his whispering cant we slope off into the wood too many people around said rannaldini coldly removing his hand never put you off in the past i weesh to watch hermione and i play the winner ere in final flora slunk off despairing as a rescued dog returned to battersea and missed rannaldinis quick smile he had been recently glued to the serial about vita sackvillewest and violet trefusis on television repeatedly replaying the love scenes between the two women which made him all the more eager for sexual variation he was aware how crazy flora was about him if he made her desperate enough by freezing her out she would agree to anything even going to bed with cecilia who loved to go both ways or hermione that would humble the spoilt bitch or rachel ditto he glanced at flora kicking the grass puffing furiously on her cigarette god knows he wanted her but hed have to punish her a great deal more before he reduced her to an adequate level of submission georgie wasnt enjoying the afternoon any more than flora unlike lysander the vicar had been very shirty about double faults he was enraged they hadnt made the final how impressed his congregation would have been if that had been the reason for him to miss evensong and although georgie thought it sweet of lysander to be so nice to kitty it had encouraged guy to be even nicer to rachel georgie experienced an excruciating feeling of déjà vu as guy whisked about finding balls when rachel was serving putting strong brown hands on her slender back when she played well gently guiding her in front of him as they changed ends and shouting yours commendably often if a ball were hit between them what a poppet thought guy as rachel bent down at the net to retrieve a ball she had delightful legs it was so hot hed remove his shirt for the finals and ask her to rub in some ambre solaire to show his awareness of the ultraviolet rays and as all the matches had ended on court two they now had an admiring audience to watch them thrash brickie and that little pipsqueak whod been fawning over georgie he was gratified rannaldini was watching guy arranged his sweat band as rachel waited for service in deference to a woman lysander tempered his thunderbolt oh well hit rachie shouted guy as she clouted it back to kitty so lost was he in admiration he mishit kittys gentle lob a split second later lysander had murdered it from then on he had both guy and rachel racing all over the court rachel upset at how aware she was of rannaldinis smiling scrutiny started hitting wildly lysander who had an uncanny ability to guess when a ball was going out took every advantage mr hawkley and mrs kitty lead announced mr brimscombe in a place where nothing seems real i have found you sang lysander happily to himself as they changed ends miss saigon said kitty longingly ive got the tape at home if you want to borrow it said lysander id stand further back for this game the suns tricky and guys going to step up the pace he was right but when even guy forgot his acecaring role so much that he served and hit really hard balls to kitty fired by lysander she managed to get them back good liel prince she said looking down at her ancient racquet at set point guy was hurtling towards her smiting a great shocking pink cannon ball in her direction shutting her eyes kitty stuck out her prince and prayed next moment she heard cheers and clapping game set and match to mrs kitty and mr hawkley said a delighted mr brimscombe neither rachel nor guy could crack a smile as they all shook hands pile up on the motorway lysander said to kitty as bob guy and larry all converged on rachel two minutes later with cups of black tea and lemon not that she was very grateful and when they started to compete in telling the most grisly recession story she stalked off to bend the vicars ear about pvc coffin liners giving off noxious fumes the vicar pretended to listen but was much more interested in eavesdropping on the frightful row georgie was clearly having with lysander what the fuck are you playing at she hissed youre paid a bomb to rattle my husband and hes been crawling over that ghastly vegan all afternoon how the hell did he know she didnt have milk in her tea im sorry georgie lysander was flabbergasted i was so sorry for kitty i thought that was what you wanted i wish we hadnt got into the finals whens guy going back to london i miss you he tried to take her hand but georgie snatched it away for gods sake everyonell see us flouncing off georgie found herself in a gaggle of women hows ant and cleo going asked hermione radiant with smugness at being in the final fine said georgie shortly i just wonder if the musical is quite the right vehicle for shakespeare kees me kate grossed a few million interrupted cecilia brush up your shakespeare she sang softly start quoting him now when you ave a score for ant and cleo i like to see eet georgie oh youd be a wonderful cleo i would enjoy eet kiri as been eliza doolittle the verdi requiem was fantastic both you and boris said georgie in wonder hermione was furious its amazing how you manage to inject sex into everything cecilia she gave a little laugh your libera me was more like come and get me youre not doing too much are you your voice sounded tired in rannaldinis rushes yesterday this was a body blow one only saw rushes in rannaldinis tower dont talk crap said flora rudely mrs rannaldini sang wonderfully she lifted the verdi every time she opened her mouth and at least she doesnt duck out at the last moment because of a lovers tiff why zank you carissima said cecilia in amazement abandoned by the vicar who had beetled off on seeing lysander looking miserable and standing by himself rachel was screwing up courage to ask cecilia how boris was but hearing arguing voices didnt think this was a good moment putting her cup down on the table she idly fingered a yellow snapdragon squeezing its mouth open as she had when she was a child like a cloud over the sun rannaldini glided up enjoying yourself meesis levitsky not particularly his smile was mocking his thighs as hard and thick as the magnums of champagne that mr brimscombe was now opening for those who had finished playing shed never met a man who upset her more this place is a disgrace she fumed were in the middle of a drought your garden is an oasis i know how to look after my own said rannaldini softly i thought you like things green not at other peoples expense dont be fatuous rannaldini noticed the slight down on her upper lip and the underarm hair inside her sleeve as she scratched a midge bite in her hair smiling slightly he edged a finger into the snapdragons gaping furry mouth instantly rachel let go and the mouth shut gripping him one day amore a more exciting part of you will greep me and you will love every minute of it he said softly dont be disgusting in fact you will beg for eet your host not looking after you said guy arriving with a magnum and two glasses presumably you want to keep your eye in until after the final rannaldini wont make any difference ermione he called out well start in five minutes the grass was very kitty this morning announced natasha collapsing on the bank beside flora to watch her fat stepmother make a fool of herself in the finals kitty asked ferdie squatting down beside her stands for wet snapped natasha why are you so vile to kitty for a second real pain flared in natashas face i cant bear to think of her in my fathers bed i shouldnt think she is very often said flora reasonably fancy kitty do you natasha taunted ferdie if she rolled over in bed shed squash you flat although youd probably do the same to her ferdie got to his feet can i give you a word of advice he said politely if youre trying to pull lysander hes never been attracted to bitches the sun dropped into the towering valhalla woods the shadow of the abbey with its tall chimneys stretched towards the tennis court like a great black hand as the players took up their positions rannaldini had service trembling kitty waited to receive opposite her at the net skipping from foot to foot in her grecian dress like an avenging juno crouched hermione lysander had lost all his bounce he wanted a stiff drink and this match to be over as quickly as possible so he could make it up with georgie before she left shed already put on a cardigan and gathered up her racquets he could see her pretending to listen to merediths patter as she watched guy plying rachel with champagne and compliments as they discussed saving the rhino in a quarter of an hour rannaldini and hermione were leading they had followed a deliberate policy of hitting the ball at kitty like a child fending off blows she missed everything apologies pouring from her whitening lips lysander simply wasnt trying your little friend certainly cracks under pressure guy called out scornfully to georgie as the players changed ends rannaldini beckoned natasha well be through in a few minutes run and tell mrs brimscombe to put the kettle on bastard thought georgie lysander and kitty looked so cast down and hermione so smug horsey horsey she suddenly called out to lysander as he slouched past her then as he swung round she smiled whispering dont let the old bat get away with it blissful to be forgiven lysander sauntered back to the base line next moment an ace whistled past hermiones pink sweat band changing sides lysander curved into a perfect bow threw up the ball and blasted it across the net just out which was lucky for rannaldini whod been staring at rachel and hadnt even seen it the second service was even faster out fifteenall snapped rannaldini as he walked back to the base line lysander didnt budge that serve was in it was out snarled rannaldini it was in sir if youre going to cheat theres no point in playing kitty quailed rannaldinis face contorted in rage the spectators exchanged glances of gleeful anticipation that ball was in rannaldini agreed bob who was umpiring the final i saw the chalk rise on cue maggie came bounding on to the court nose brown from digging pink tongue lolling frantically searching for her master in a fury rannaldini picked up a ball and served it at her only just missing sending her fleeing in terror from the court instantly lysander bounded over the net seizing rannaldini by the lapels of his cream polo shirt i wouldnt do that if i were you vafuculo swore rannaldini you should learn to control your dogs not in the way you control your bitches retorted lysander so only rannaldini and hermione could hear you ought to be suspended for excessive use of the whip your partner can hardly sit down today hermione froze speechless and openmouthed like a photograph of herself reaching top c keety as been sneaking said rannaldini in a fury not at all lysander scooped up a ball you should keep the windows of your indoor school shut on hot summer afternoons it took all bobs tact to get them to play on to lysanders relief that georgie had forgiven him was added a cold fury with rannaldini and his game took on a sustained brilliance as with great leaps he intercepted the viciously powerful bombardment rannaldini was directing at his terrified wife hermione worried how much lysander had overheard had been totally put off her game that teas going to be very stewed crowed georgie twenty minutes later hermiones quite fat isnt she kind bob always turns down the scales when she comes home from tours said marigold oh good shot kitty the spectators gave a great cheer theyve caught up at last at sixall they went into a tiebreak well done kitty take it slowly youre doing brilliantly said lysander as like a cat washing its ears he wiped the sweat from his forehead with an inside arm rannaldini kicked off and won his first serve watching his brute strength as he uncoiled like a cracked whip lysander was unpleasantly reminded of his behaviour in the indoor school fired up lysander served two aces and somehow kitty got hermiones next serve back bounding in front of hermione rannaldini poached her ball but in trying to pass lysander he left his own side exposed unpassed lysander powered the ball away into the farthest corner hermione now served to lysander promptly netted his return and turned dark red as rannaldini swore viciously at her under his breath kitty and lysander lead said bob not without satisfaction the spectators were cheering every point kitty managed to lob her service in to hermione who was so upset by rannaldinis invective that she hit it straight to lysander who whipped a topspin pass down the backhand rannaldini didnt get near it someones soon going to have to save the rhinoldini drawled flora the crowd except rachel and guy howled with laughter rannaldini was so furious that he ran in hitting such a vicious return to kittys service that she ducked to avoid being killed temper temper said lysander then to kitty you ok babe weve got him on the run rannaldini promptly aced kitty making it a heartstopping rally followed which had the crowd on their feet yelling with excitement seeing his wife quivering like a strawberry jelly in the middle of the court rannaldini opened his shoulders and fired the ball down the tramlines well played partner panted hermione run kitty begged lysander like a little hippo kitty lumbered across the court slicing the ball with a stretchedout racquet so it just toppled over the net and rannaldini who was now reaching for a towel had no time to catch it well done we can do it whooped lysander great play kitty called out natasha who had taken ferdies lecture to heart how can i love a man who is such a terrible loser thought flora in despair it was lysander to serve again crouching at the net kitty felt stabbing pains in her tummy but was more aware of hermione crouching on the back line there was no goodwill in that beautiful face now just hatred her return came straight at kitty hitting her glasses sending them flying blindly kitty groped for them in front of you shouted the crowd racing up lysander disengaged them from the net you ok sweetheart shes got gorgeous eyes he thought irrationally as he handed her glasses back to her ferdie must get her into contact lenses strolling back to the base line he bounced the ball longer than usual until a hush fell over the court it was still set point rannaldini took service blasting it at kitty who shaken mishit it the pink ball sailed up in the air brilliant howled lysander terrific return kitty mine shouted rannaldini shoving hermione aside and coiling himself up for a pulverizing smash alas he was an inch too short the ball cleared the top of his racquet dropping a centimetre inside the back line the crowd erupted game set match and tournament to kitty and lysander said bob in illdisguised delight rannaldinis face was expressionless as he shook hands but kitty gasped with pain as his grip almost broke her fingers with the sun gone it was suddenly chilly a screech owl screamed from the depths of the wood as people gathered round clapping lysander and kitty on the back the pavilion telephone rang only members of the family knew the number natasha got there first wolfie she gave a scream of delight where are you you got straight as didnt you know bloody good hows australia what time is it you sound plastered its wolfie she said to rannaldini whod gone even stiller his eyes boring into flora dyou want a word with dad natasha went on as rannaldini held out his hand oh right then incredulously you want to speak to kitty youve rung up to wish her happy birthday omigod even natasha was horrified is it today ill put her on everyone exchanged shocked glances but noone looked blacker than rannaldini or redder than kitty as she picked up the telephone allo wolfie well done with your hay levels we was so proud its ever so kind of you to remember well i got a postal order from mum and a nice card floras eyes filled with tears poor kitty and poor wolfie whom shed treated so dreadfully she was about to snatch the telephone from kitty and ask him how he was when kitty said cheerio wolfie we all miss you come back soon she put down the receiver to a chorus of you should have told us shame on you rannaldini happy birthday to you sang floras sweet clear piercing voice and everyone joined in with hermiones voice soaring above everyone elses just to prove she should have been picked for leonora many happies brickie as the singing ended guy hugged kitty i cant tell you how much were all looking forward to tea you better come and organize it said rannaldini stalking off towards the house as kitty panted after him lysander noticed a dark red stain on the back of her shorts snatching up natashas long scarlet cardigan he sprinted after them where the hell were his dogs ferdie was useless at keeping an eye on them entering through the french windows of the summer parlour he heard rannaldini saying in a chilling voice why didnt you tell me it was your birthday im ever so sorry rannaldini i didnt want no fuss its your job to remember birthdays how dare you show me up as a sheet in front of all those peoples youll pay for eet ahem lysander joined them in the hall you mustnt get cold and putting natashas cardigan round kittys shoulders so it completely covered the bloodstain he did up the top three buttons he was just pondering how he could warn her that shed got the curse without her dying of mortification when an even more piercing scream made them all jump out of their skins and mrs brimscombe rushed in its mrs kittys tea she screeched come quickly joined by the rest of the guests swarming into the dining room in greedy expectation they were greeted by a scene of total devastation jack was on the table paws in the smokedsalmon quiche cocktail sausages hanging like fangs from his mouth dinsdale stood with his forepaws up on a chair owlishly looking round like an old man disturbed in his club a large chocolate swiss roll drooping from his lips like a cigar plates of sandwiches and cakes had been upended all over the floor and a great jug of milk dripped its last into a huge white puddle on the floor beside which maggie was languidly licking the last of the whipped cream out of kittys strawberry flan there was a terrible pause then over the pandemonium rannaldinis voice could be heard saying i shall be leaving in five minutes keety theres a button needs sewing on my tailcoat compared with rannaldinis green and pleasant oasis this place is like the sahara grumbled georgie as she sat on the terrace with ferdie and lysander the following evening drinking pimms and surveying her parched garden all the little trees she and guy had planted were dying the only things that thrived were the wild oats growing outside the kitchen window which had turned as claret coloured as an old club roues face why was kitty crying so much she went on shes such a trouper i was convinced shed magic up stroganoff and lemon meringue pie for twenty out of the freezer i never dreamt shed go to pieces she thought she was pregnant and found shed got the curse lysander put down the racing post shes desperate to have a baby if she had rannaldinis child said ferdie it would give her some financial hold on him shes not like that said lysander quickly she just adores children and wants one of her own then she wouldnt be lonely in that great dracula barracks id be scared shitless living there alone id be more frightened when rannaldini was at home said georgie with a shiver she confessed he doesnt sleep with her very often you did get a lot out of her said georgie amazed so youll take her on asked ferdie suddenly businesslike lysander gazed moodily at the gold coin of the setting sun on the dark horizon it was as though ferdie was putting a pound in the slot ok but only to annoy rannaldini improving her appearance is the most important thing said ferdie briskly weve got to deprude her burn those terrible clothes and get the weight off mind you im one to talk he squeezed the huge roll of fat above his agonizingly tight waistband sales of chocolate have rocketed since the recession he was feeling guilty about skiving from the office but at least hed confirmed his suspicions that both larry and guy were desperately strapped for cash neither had bought a single round when the remains of the tennis party had retreated to the pearly gates last night there was no point in marigold and georgie having quixotic and extravagant schemes for salvaging kittys marriage if there wasnt any money fortunately georgie had received a large overseas royalty cheque that morning shed planned to give half to guy but after yesterdays pursuit of rachel she wrote a cheque to ferdie instead retaining lysanders services for herself and kitty until christmas lets go and see kitty said ferdie draining his pimms they found her in the garden talking to mr brimscombe her eyes were still red but she greeted them cheerfully mr b and ive been chasing a cow out of the vegetable garden must of stuffed hisself fank goodness rannaldinis away how did it escape asked georgie i thought your husbands fences were everythingproof must have come over the cattle grid said mr brimscombe ive seen cows do it they get so hungry they stand sideways on the edge of the grid then they lies down and roll their legs over and wriggle till their feets touch tother side then they stands up and off they goes isnt it brilliant said kitty in delight reassuring too said georgie drily means you can get out of anything if you want to enough done much damage only a few footprints on the lawn and a lot of veggies said kitty but arvest festival comes up before rannaldinis back so we can blame that waving mr brimscombe goodnight kitty led them into the kitchen where she had been making bramble jelly and listening to the tape of miss saigon heavenly smell georgie gave the scummy dark crimson mixture a stir ill give you a jar said kitty and fank you for the lovely bouquet ferdie i got a lovely azalea from guy as well we even send separate presents these days thought georgie wearily and fank you for miss saigon lysander ive been playing it all day what else did you get asked georgie kitty giggled a solarpowered calculator from rachel and a jumper from hermione its got a pattern wiv sheep round the bottom which make my bottom look uger than ever typical said georgie and what did rannaldini give you other than a thick ear kitty blushed nuffink but hes been filming all day never mind said ferdie marigold and georgie are going to give you a special present lets you and me go into the drawing room in a place that wont let us feel i have found you sang miss saigon just let me hear this bit pleaded kitty you can hear it later kitty was flabbergasted to learn that lysander had been paid to make guy and larry jealous but he seemed so keen particularly on georgie things have got a bit out of hand there admitted ferdie and im not sure its had the desired effect on guy but when he explained that marigold and georgie wanted to give her lysanders services kitty at first flatly refused i couldnt do that to rannaldini it wouldnt be right anyway nuffing would bring him back when he wasnt there in the first place but you love him oh yes kitty gave a sigh i go weak wiv longing every time i sees him then its worth a try just till christmas youd like to be thinner oh i would after a lot of persuading kitty agreed to let lysander help her improve her appearance but not to his hanging around pretending to be keen on her it was realistic wiv georgie and marigold theyre both beautiful not when he took them on said ferdie look id like to lose a bit myself im going on holiday to the algarve on friday i bet you a hundred pounds i lose more than you by the time i get back in the second week in october thats the rest of my runningaway money thought kitty wistfully oh hell it was worth a try all right youre on she said then blushing scarlet dyou fink it might help if i talked more proper marigold suggested elocution lessons like she ad marigold talks so lovely no no said ferdie hastily you dont want to end up talking like mrs thatcher in appalling embarrassment kitty and ferdie were then weighed in with lysander and georgie as witnesses kitty was eleven stone one ferdie over fifteen stone until lysander discovered two jaffa oranges in his blazer pockets thats cheating he shouted shoving ferdie back on the scales youre only fifteen now enter it in the game book he ordered georgie kittys willpower is stronger than mine so she deserved a handicap grumbled ferdie and get that ghastly tight perm cut off he added taking lysander aside and i want her in contact lenses by the time i get back from portugal rannaldini was away for two months filming and guest conducting georgie was working flat out on the album seeing musicians and rehearsing for a concert in london the same week that ferdie got home which left kitty and lysander a lot of spare time he tried to cure her terror of horses by walking her round on arthur who seemed slightly less lame but although kitty liked arthur and took to making him his favourite breadandbutter pudding she still much preferred a fence between the two of them she and lysander also played endless tennis worked out and swam seeing kittys vast thighs inside which the gusset of her black bathing dress practically disappeared lysander wondered if it was all worth it but he carried on because she was so touchingly grateful the drought continued and was now called an indian summer leaves were so dry they clanged down more cows wriggled across the sheep grid into rannaldinis woods one evening lysander sat in the kitchen at valhalla celebrating a large win on rupert campbellblacks horse penscombe pride and watching kitty iron rachel says its a wicked waste of energy ironing underpants and ankies announced kitty but can you imagine rannaldini goin on the rostrum wiv a crumpled ankie why did you marry him i was his secretary i know that it was the wednesday i asked him if i could have the saturday off to go to a wedding thats very inconvenient he said whose wedding is it i said its mine rannaldini he was ever so upset i fink he was worried he wouldnt find nuffing when i was on honeymoon that night he turned up at our ouse at two in the morning mum was opping rannaldini drove me to valhalla dawn was breaking an there was a white dew and all the birds in the air was singin it was so beautiful he was separated from cecilia by then he said i couldnt marry kevin because he was going to marry me just the same way he used to say bring your book in you know how forceful he is christ said lysander in awe what happened to all the presents and the cake

mortal sin to marry a divorced man no im c of e rannaldinis cafflic the vicar at ome was orrified rannaldini got a quickie divorce and married me three weeks later im gobsmacked said lysander was it

dead oh poor kitty lysander got up and hugged her once we get you glammed up hell get really jealous some ope sighed kitty hows georgie suddenly terribly uptight about rachel lysander poured more perrier for kitty and muscadet for himself that guys keen on her asked kitty i expect hes just jealous because georgie likes you so much and rachels so pretty pretty awful said lysander i hate georgie being miserable do you think i should ask her to marry me marry you said kitty in amazement we get on so well id look after her he was so touching in his total seriousness his blueygreen eyes suddenly as vulnerable as maggies his cheeks flushed with sudden excitement that kitty said oh i know you would lucky georgie she thought taking a grey silk shirt from the pile the only problem she went on is i dont fink georgie could cope with your present job hangin round neglected wives i mean she feels safe with me because im not a fret but she had such a shock wiv guy and julia i think her next hubby would need to do somefing which didnt involve women then i must get arthur sound said lysander earnestly and get a proper job how is arfur asked kitty fondly the vets coming tomorrow im terrified hell say he needs another years rest he loved those rock buns you made him dont talk about food im starving moaned kitty youve lost ten pounds encouraged lysander i wish i could climb into the tumbledrier and shrink myself down to a size eight like natashas purple flares rachel doesnt approve of tumbledriers said lysander shed peg you up on the clothesline meanwhile the subject of such intense speculation was wrestling with the fiendish complexities of rachmaninovs third piano concerto the recording was not until late october it was not a work rachel approved of too flash and overtly romantic but she was obsessively determined the london met and rannaldini in particular should find no fault with her she was also desperate for her career to take off again to keep pace with boris whose berlin wall symphony was being premiered in the mozart hall in november and even more with chloe whod just opened in don carlos at the eno to rave reviews rachel was still burying herself in work because apart from her children who got increasingly on her nerves there was little cheer in her life her longing for boris made her vile to him every time he came to pick up the children she couldnt even bring herself to say anything nice about the requiem because chloe had been sitting outside in the car it was she not the poor laboratory animals whom she was always campaigning to save who should have had her vocal cords cut she had had high hopes of lysander as the ideal dalliance but beyond kindness he had shown no interest she had hoped even more of bob who was on her wavelength intellectually when hermione was away theyd taken the children for a picnic by the river fleet bob was the only person who could control the appalling cosmo although yesterday the little fiend had disrupted all the wildlife along the river banks with a new toy speedboat when rachel had tried to explain about noise pollution cosmo had told her to piss off and her own disloyal children had roared with laughter refusing to make daisy chains because they wanted to play with the boat too realizing rachel was worried about whirlpools bob had helped the children dam up one of the little tributaries still running into the fleet so they could paddle and sail their boat im not eating this crap said cosmo when offered carrot cake and cauliflower quiche for tea bob refused more politely honestly rachel darling i never eat tea no wonder he kept that lean taut body bob had also chucked away his cup of tea flavoured with goats milk when she wasnt looking and instead encouraged her to stretch out on the dusty bank with a cold bottle of sancerre after the second glass seeing her children engrossed in their dam rachel had tried over the appalling din of cosmos speedboat to discuss the far more appalling behaviour of rannaldini and hermione but bob had deflected her not on such a lovely day i truly dont want to talk about it but you must feel so humiliated theyre so odiously public you ought to have some outlet you cant dam the libido up for ever rachel started to cry i know i cant ive been celibate for seven months now come over to supper after the kids have gone to bed as if they had a separate life of their own her pale slim fingers walked across the burnt grass and crept into bobs daddee it was little cosmos screech the boats stuck well for christs sake unstick it screeched back rachel but bobs fingers which had not returned the pressure were gently withdrawn as he got up to help wandering home along the river when their eyes werent meeting bob had said sweet of you rachel dear but ive got to go back to london then smiling slightly to soften the snub lets take an acidrain check on this one and the hot flush of mortification had kept sweeping over rachel ever since even rannaldini whod been so disgustingly suggestive at the tennis hadnt been in touch so that she could reject him hoards of men used to run after me thought rachel despairingly as she sunk her sweating aching fingers once more into the keys banging out the doomed infinitely sorrowful opening theme dum dadida dadida da sang rachel noone will ever chase me again except married lechers who get a buzz out of deceiving their wives if only she could transmit the depth of her sadness to her playing but she was hampered by the colossal technical demands of the piece the explosions of notes which must be perfect boris had warned her of the viciousness of rannaldinis criticism horrible man rachel had a vision of his face heartless cold yet the black eyes blazing with lust and sensuality despite the punishing airless heat rachel shivered the church clock striking three brought her back to earth she must collect the children at four lysander had given her a litre of gin some time ago which shed never drunk because she loathed the stuff but had been intending to turn into sloe gin walking over to the tennis tournament at valhalla shed noticed a bumper crop of sloes still green along the footpath which rannaldini had closed to the public they should be ripe now rannaldini was away if she were quick she could make a detour on her way to school she had been concentrating so hard only when she went outside did she realize that it had been raining a brief violent shower which flattened the bleached grass and drenched the trees but made as much impact on the rockhard ground as spitting on an iron as she ran up the forbidden footpath rannaldinis woods lay ahead pulsating and boiling like a jungle incubating insects dark greenygrey beneath a whitehot sun which had already dried the tops of the trees dum dadida dadida da sang rachel breathing in the rank stench of drying nettles which had grown so tall they concealed the first private keep out notice blackberry fronds clawed her bare ankles and arms like importuning creditors she could hear a rattle of distant thunder her head ached from gazing at little black notes all day travellers joy draped acid green leaves and lemonyellow flowers over the no footpath trespassers prosecuted sign nature doesnt care about trespassers thought rachel as she waded through waisthigh grass her shoes filled with water gretel had taken the children to school this morning so rachel had gone straight to the piano without bothering to wash she supposed this was as good a bath as any to her joy the blackthorn copse was groaning with sloes shiny and dark like rannaldinis eyes but softened by the palest powderyblue bloom holding her shopping bag underneath to catch the loot she systematically stripped each branch swearing as the sharp thorns plunged into her fingers she glanced at her watch she must go in ten minutes she only need fill half the bottle the recipe said white sugar but shed get unrefined brown from the apple tree instead just as she was reaching up to a high branch she heard voices and started violently shrieking as a particularly sharp thorn stabbed her arm what was that said rannaldinis voice sharply rachel dropped to the ground burying her face in the soaking grass heart pounding praying hed go away she cringed as a brown slug big as a rat edged towards her how ghastly if rannaldini caught her instead the sinister clive jumped over a small wall just beyond the blackthorn clump and trained his rifle on her dont shoot screamed rachel rannaldini followed at a more leisurely pace i might have guessed he said softly bugger off he added to clive ill handle this lying flat on her face rachel was aware of sloes scattered all round her get up ordered rannaldini leaping down like a great cat he still made sure he was on higher ground when she scrambled raging with embarrassment to her feet cant you read this is private property you stupid bitch youre trespassing as well as stealing the words came out like rifle shots this is a public footpath was snapped rannaldini and the wall was always mine i didnt know you were a thief deliberately he stamped on half a dozen sloes then removing his shiny brown ankle boot showed their wounded crimson flesh rachel winced you bastard looking down she was appalled to see how transparent the wet grass had made her muslin shift and her cheap white rosepatterned trousers she could see the moulded line of her breasts and stickingout nipples the pink flesh of her legs and the dark give way sign of her pubic hair rannaldini however had no intention of giving way today i not bastard i forgeeve them who trespass rachels heart pounded even more painfully but she couldnt move as he reached out testing the pudgy warmth of her breast through the drenched muslin braless in gaza he mocked you certainly advertise your wares he couldnt tell if her thin face was wet with tears or rain as his hand strayed downwards no knickers either i got up first thing to practise stammered rachel then rushed out in a hurry i didnt want to be late picking up the children you left plenty of time to steal my sloes rannaldini clenched and unclenched his fingers with his other hand he drew her to him kissing first her forehead then both her unplucked eyebrows then her mouth no suddenly aware she hadnt cleaned her teeth and loathing herself for minding rachel clamped her lips shut no rannaldini moved away slightly do you have any choice his hand slipped inside her sleeve caressing its way up her arm pulling at her long silky armpit hair before curling round to caress her breasts rachel gave a moan trying to duck her head away as rannaldini ruffled the slight down on her upper lip with his tongue leetle wild thing eet will be like making love to an animal a goat perhaps i hate you no no you ate yourself for wanting me so much mrs levitsky rannaldini relished calling women by the names of the husbands he was cuckolding im not levitsky any more im back to grant now someones coming gasped rachel hearing a snatch of for all the saints sung in a loud baritone rannaldini pushed her back on to the ground crouching beside her holding his hand which smelt faintly of maestro over her mouth until the vicar had gone then when she tried to leap to her feet mouth open in protest rannaldini plunged his tongue inside until she forgot her uncleaned teeth and kissed him back rannaldini wanted to take her now but the vicar might surprise them on his return the kids i must pick them up said rachel fighting to get free back in his tower it was rannaldini who got the number of the school by ringing kitty then he rang the school mrs levitsky is stuck in traffic jam and will be threequarters of an hour late she ask me to ring she is very very sorry but she is not he added switching off the telephone you ought to get out of those wet things he said softly then sliding his hand down inside her trousers and this is the wettest thing that i should eenstantly get into let me undress myself for fucks sake snarled rachel but so overjoyed was rannaldini by the early conquest of something he thought would take him weeks perhaps months that his face assumed a quite uncharacteristic delight and tenderness he also had a water diviners skill in testing the depth of womens loneliness he knew when to be kind you have been so sad and lonely he crooned drawing her into his arms and stroking her hair you deserve some happiness this time it will be queek because of your children but the next time it will be ecstatic in the long mirror as rachel lay back white and slender as a snowdrop against his mahogany chest they looked wonderfully exotic some three inches shorter than her perched on the back of a grey silk chaiselongue it was simplicity for him to slide his ironhard cock slowly in and out of her as he gently caressed her in front with the artistry of a casals playing a cello concerto but the moment she came rachels moans of pleasure turned into wild sobs cry leetle darling purred rannaldini eet is what you need no no wept rachel its the wrong person in the mirror you should be boris on monday morning after guy and larry had left for the london train marigold and georgie had got into a habit of ringing each other to grumble about their respective husbands their moanday session they called it as september dragged on with no break in the drought and the recession deepened marigolds complaints were increasingly of larrys stinginess georgies increasingly of rachel hes stopped may account at harvey nicks announced marigold indignantly the first monday in october and hes cancelled our box at covent garden and he wont let patch have steak any more better than guy whos trying to turn poor dinsdale into a vegan said georgie darkly and hes rigged up a washingline i mean hes never let me hang out clothes even in our brokest days said it was horrifically suburban now his turnbull asser shirts are waving in the lack of wind for all at see he could be trayin to save money rubbish the only thing guy is saving at the moment is the whale and the rain forests but your marriage has been so much better since laysander came on the scene alarmed marigold detected the old obsessive rattle in georgies voice it was until guy started pursuing rachel i cant cope marigold its like going through chemotherapy then finding another lump aym sure youre imaginin things i am not guys started using organic toothpaste and he wont have white paper in the house because the bleach pollutes our waterways and worst of all georgies voice rose hysterically dinsdale came back from a walk smelling of a quite different scent im certain it comes from the body shop perhaps guy wanted to test it on an animal dont make sick jokes ive lost my sense of humour and even even worse because rock stars selling so well overseas your rotten husbands marketing guy and georgie tshirts and key rings and even guy and georgie balloons what happens when people rumble how bad our marriage is they wont unless you tell them and to cap it all guys off to the south of france for three days to look at some private collection and hes picked the week of my concert so i cant go with him i caught him admiring himself in the mirror in his new goggles and flippers yesterday he jumped out of his skin off to save the whales i said the pollutions awful in the med he was livid and went into his are you mad panda you must see a doctor routine two minutes after ringing off she rang marigold back oh darling im sorry to bang on i must still love guy for him to get so much under my skin lysander was so worried about georgie he bought her a diamond necklace a beautiful black backless lycra dress and a book of fred basset cartoons then deciding she was barn sour he tried to take her away for a jaunt to coincide with her concert and guys trip to france kitty had lost over a stone and could be left unsupervised for a few days but georgie was nervous of being recognized and only allowed lysander to join her at the ritz in her room overlooking green park where catchitune had put her up for the night catchitune also sent a limo to collect her from paradise but again to avoid the press she made lysander drive up on his own to join her later in the day having stayed with marigold in the ritz in paris lysander promptly rediscovered the joys of room service georgie once again realized how young he was as he ordered smoked salmon with gauzewrapped halflemons club sandwiches and vast bloody marys then played with the telephone in the bathroom and all the bottles of shampoo and bath gel before discovering a television where he could watch everything from blue movies to donald duck most of all he wanted georgie to romp with him in the big blue jacuzzi and take advantage of a huge double bed flanked by walls of darkened mirrors but all georgie wanted to do before a concert was to crash out with cold eyepads then spend an hour in trancelike silence making herself beautiful bewildered that he hadnt satisfied her properly lysander took her face in his hands georgie darling please leave guy and marry me georgie smiled that is the sweetest offer ive ever had but can you imagine what the scorpion would make of me and my child bridegroom the concert was a massive success georgie sang all her old sixties songs which had just been issued as a cd and were racing up the charts and then ended with rock star having got well tanked up beforehand and during the interval in the private catchitune box lysander nearly died of pride here was his darling georgie who had lain warm and naked in his arms a few hours ago caressed now by thousands of coloured lights skipping dancing round the stage with a great waving cornfield of clapping hands saluting her it was so sexy the way her red hair tumbled down her bare back each time she threw back her head and how she seemed to suck lick and even drink out of the microphone as she belted out these glorious heartbreaking songs in her yelping husky smokefilled voice in his diamonds with her lovely suntanned shoulders rising out of his black dress she looked stunningly beautiful and about twentyfive she was backed by the same musicians whod made rock star and a good deal of money in the past six months and who were delighted to be on stage with her again lysander liked it least when she sang rock star he barracked noisily and had to be shushed when guys handsome manly face was blown up on a screen for georgie to sing to the audience however cheered and yelled so much she had to sing it again and still they wouldnt let her go here is a talent that can cradle an audience in its hands and hold them spellbound and captive for two hours thought lysander how dare rannaldini hermione and most of all rachel patronize her she was going to do an encore as she sat down on the edge of the stage with a guitar slung round her neck a hush fell on the hall one spotlight illuminated her everywhere else was in darkness ladies and gentlemen began georgie in her soft voice with its faint trace of irish id like to try out a new song ive just written this week which i hope will be part of my new album at home i have an old dog whom i love dearly like anyone in this situation i dread the day he dies so i dedicate this song to dinsdale oh shes so clever thought lysander downing another glass of moët i never knew she could play the guitar so well old dog began georgie in her husky voice you break my heart how many days have i left with you your muzzle whitens your steps go slow but your tail still wags and your heart beats true lie in in the morning guard your strength live as long as you possibly can for guys have come and guys will go but youve loved me more than any man the haunting beauty of the melody redeemed the sentimentality of the words and at the end when georgie bowed her head and waited for the storm of cheering lysander wasnt the only one who mopped his eyes it was after midnight before georgie managed to tear herself away from the wellwishers in the green room larry was particularly ecstatic old dog is going to be bigger than rock star he said chewing on his cigar naughty girl to jump the gun but if thats anything like the rest of the album well make a killing we could rush it out as a single ill call you tomorrow pity guy wasnt here hed be so proud said marigold better change that bit about guys have come and guys will go said larry sardonically that was my best bit muttered lysander substitute the word boy or man said larry but its a great number and just the way ay feel about patch said marigold whose mascara had run after a concert georgie felt absolutely drained and preferred to go out for a gentle dinner with her agent or people from the record company whod talk shop praise her and go through every note of her performance just as lysander went through every stroke after a polo game instead because she felt momentarily skyhigh on adrenalin adulation and champagne on a very empty stomach she let lysander bear her off to a party given by some of his friends wont it be over said georgie as they drove through a recessiondarkened knightsbridge it wont have started till after the pubs close said lysander noticing the full moon like a satellite dish topping brompton oratory was it only a month since hed taken kitty on he hoped she was ok in her lonely fortress you could hear the din of the party six hundred yards away the moment georgie entered the big terraced house with its yelling jostling crowd hanging out of every window she knew she had made a dreadful mistake still in her thick stage makeup her diamonds and her backless dress the halter neckline of which barely covered her breasts she was ludicrously overdressed beside all the utterly ravishing girls in their tshirts leggings or occasional microskirt she felt like boiled mutton dressed as lamb without even the aid of caper sauce and if she had been the star of the concert lysander was undeniably the star of the party everyone particularly the girls converged on him shrieking with joy where have you been we thought you were dead londons dire without you lysanders back everyone this is georgie lysander told them all proudly but although he stuck as close as he could friends never stopped fighting their way over to talk to him and whenever he fought his way to the kitchen where a huge table groaned with every drink known to man to fill up their glasses it took him half an hour because everyone waylaid him it was a very wild party most people were wasted with drink or drugs and were already graffiting the walls seizing the aerosol can lysander wrote i luv gorgy and everyone screamed with laughter others were singing along to a karaoke machine and videoing each other everyone wanted to video georgie they were charming to her but in the same way they might gaze in wonder at the taj mahal tick the guide book and move on georgie tried to get into the spirit of things but drink only made her more tired at the end of the sitting room a group round a table were playing a game called cardinal puff in which you recited a very complicated verse with endless subclauses every time you went wrong you had to down a glass of booze lysander being dyslexic and very drunk couldnt get the hang of it at all and kept making mistakes and reducing himself and everyone to hysterical laughter georgie tried to match their mirth but found her jaw aching she longed to go back to her hotel but didnt want to spoil lysanders fun shrieks grew louder next door as a blonde in a bright yellow sequined jacket and not much else rushed in ive just emptied a saucepan of chilli con carne over the complete geek giving the party for not playing our kind of music she shouted then seeing lysander hallo sweet pea and grabbing him she kissed him on the mouth on and on to wild cheers anyone would think he was fucking helen of troy said a very suntanned stocky blond boy who was drinking out of a bottle of vodka and taking alternate slugs out of a carton of orange juice seb in drunken delight lysander tipped the blonde off his knee oh seb this is georgie maguire get her a drink and look after her for a sec while i crack this stupid game seb plays polo for england georgie so does his twin brother dommie where is dommie bonking some slapper upstairs seb filled up georgies glass with vodka and orange juice love your album thanks who owns this house bloke called mark waterlane or rather his father does marks a ghastly host passed out by two in the morning wheres ferdie he asked lysander in the aglarve lysander never got the word right due home any minute i thought he might be here he sent me a postcard saying hed got off with a thirtyyearold wrinkly said the blonde clambering back on to lysanders knee must be pushed georgie tried to be a good sport and return lysanders apologetic grin round the blondes jutting bosom but when she escaped to the to check her own wrinkles it was occupied someones either bonking throwing up or passed out said a brunette in a crimson bodystocking who was painting her mouth rosered in the landing mirror theyre organizing a searchparty to climb in through the window and get whoever it is out joining the girl at the mirror georgie gave a wail of despair beside that smooth fresh face she looked like a raddled old tart of a hundred her heavy makeup sank into the lines round her mouth and emphasized the weary redveined eyes and when she rubbed away a blob of mascara the skin stayed pleated love your album said the brunette i hope i meet a guy like your guy one day hes lush hes not here is he if he was hed adore you said georgie wearily there was a crash and a tinkling of glass as a boy climbing the creeper to rip down the satellite dish put his biker boot through a window the music was deafening to stop complaints the telephones had all been pulled out lysander waited in the hall with his arms out as georgie came downstairs georgie lets get naked a wild boy wearing a baseball cap back to front suddenly rushed up squeezed both her breasts and shouted yippee six the big one what the hell are you doing said georgie crossly tit cricket said the boy with an inane laugh when you squeeze both you get a six leave my woman alone howled lysander his right fist sending the boy crashing to the floor is he all right said georgie anxiously when the boy didnt move fine seb carlisle kicked him gently out of the way he was about due to pass out just going to have a slash in the garden lysander staggered out cannoning off walls mrs seymour georgie jumped out of her skin as she saw her husband staring at her beside him was herself looking twenty years younger then she realized yet another stunning girl was wearing one of catchitunes new guy and georgie tshirts i bought it from tower records piccadilly this evening she said will you sign it will you sign mine too said her even prettier redhaired friend i temped for your husband last year she added hes really sweet every morning he made the same joke bring your book in lottie and do your longhand i want to look at your legs thats my husband said georgie bleakly much later she was having great difficulty holding lysander up on the dance floor when over the din of the record player she heard the wail of sirens quick the pigs seb carlisle seized georgies arm ill get dommie having retrieved his twin brother from upstairs he led georgie and a tottering lysander through a kitchen three inches deep in beer out into a garden the fresh air hit them like a fist the twins had just given georgie a legup over the wall when a policeman ran through the french windows frantically blowing his whistle straddling an old rambler rose that ripped her tights to shreds georgie knew that he knew who she was now wheres my car said lysander scratching his head as he joined them on the pavement you said youd left it in rosary road said seb as they rushed across the road georgie felt an unidentifiable pain i cant see it went on lysander its that bmw you idiot screamed georgie the ferraris being serviced i was scoring with that brunette grumbled dommie carlisle climbing sulkily into the back of all the ungrateful sods said seb climbing in beside him not sure lysanders safe to drive he muttered to georgie i bloody am said lysander backing briskly into a parked mercedes ill drive said georgie panicking the police would catch up with them triggering off some frightful scandal for gods sake move over lysander the twins were now having a punchup in the back i wouldve scored bloody wouldnt would she was a slapper she was not for gods sake stop them georgie screamed at lysander as she set off with a jerk and furious revving i cant im navigating lysander stared fixedly ahead ill be sick if i look round im going back to score dommie leapt defiantly out running straight into the arms of the police as georgie drove towards knightsbridge the gutters were filled with brown plane leaves and the gardens with japanese anemones and shaggy yellow chrysanthemums then she twigged rosary road was where julia had lived in london how often guy must have bowled down the fulham road in excitement and told the taxi to turn left she dropped seb off at sloane square lysander slumped beside her was too far gone to notice the tears streaming down her cheeks all the way back to the hotel just walk in dont look to left or right she hissed as she steered a buckling lysander twice round the swing door good morning miss maguire said the doorman as soon as his head hit the pillow lysander passed out georgie removed her hellish makeup and suddenly icy cold had a long hot bath waving two metaphorical fingers at rachel as she wasted a great deal of water then she removed lysanders flowered tie and took off his only pair of guccis maggie hadnt eaten his brown lashes nearly covered the shadows beneath his eyes there was a sprinkling of freckles on his sunburnt nose and his big mouth was smiling as he reached out in his sleep for her as georgie nuzzled into his neck he smelled as sweet and fresh as violets too exhausted to sleep she saw her bare shoulders her long red hair and pale sad face reflected in the mirror opposite once again it was as though julia was gazing back at her the next day after a leisurely lunch and several alkaseltzers as they set out for angels reach in the bmw lysander handed her a copy of hello to distract you on the journey i used to buy one for mum she was so terrified of my driving he didnt add that it was the anniversary of his mothers death in their separate anguish they didnt confide in each other despite hello georgie had to bite her lip and cling on to the seat as the speedometer reached mph the radio was playing the new tape of her sixties songs turned up fortissimo it gave her a blinding headache even with all the windows open and in spite of the time of year the day was impossibly hot and sticky lysander thought georgie with infinite sadness was adorable but he needed children his own age to play with nor could she transfer her love to him she lacked skins back at angels reach longing to have a bath and change she found a note from mother courage cats been sick downstairs toilet blocked and water packed up got debenham see you later thats all i bloody need hurrah you can come and stay at magpie cottage said lysander ill join you when ive got things together this end said georgie leafing through the post guys sent me a postcard of a ruined abbey is that supposed to symbolize the state hes reduced me to upstairs she turned on the ansaphone hallo panda said guys deep voice been thinking of you hope everything went all right give me a ring miss you the next call was from a jubilant flora whod passed her driving test clever little duck thought georgie fondly but it was going to complicate things having her rolling up unannounced at any time of day the third call was from sabine bottomley saying flora wasnt working the fourth was from guy again saying he missed her and would she ring him back perhaps im imagining things georgie felt suddenly happier then she went into the bathroom and saw guys organic toothpaste craving truth she dialled rachels number if she was at home there was no need to worry she was about to ring off when the telephone was picked up hell thought georgie ill have to ask her to something now hallo rachel no its gretel im just feeding the cat whens rachel coming back tomorrow shes abroad georgie slammed down the telephone hands shaking heart pounding body drenched in sweat she was out of the house in ten minutes then the telephone started ringing and ringing the other man whose mind was very much on the late pippa hawkley on that heavy thundery suffocatingly close afternoon was her husband david putting a bunch of tiger lilies flowers as beautiful and exotic as pippa herself on her grave he had prayed she was resting more in peace than he was in life a year on he was still wracked by anguish and confusion despite overt offers from mrs colman and half the mothers who came to discuss their sons he had remained celibate but a couple of porn magazines confiscated from a boy that morning and shoved in his desk drawer to burn later had reminded him what he was missing glancing at the wanton knowing girls with their tangled hair hillocks of breast and buttock and pink glistening lips he felt as parched sexually as the dusty driedup pitches outside his window slamming the desk drawer shut he grimly turned to catullus a kindly letter from his publisher earlier in the week reminded him that his translation should have been delivered in january an earlier translator had written hard it is to put aside longstanding love his sixth form would have probably put its a bitch to get over a longstanding relationship how can i forget someone i have loved for ever wrote david hawkley catullus might have written the poem specially for him he was roused from his sad dreams by a knock on the door it was mustard with a vase of bronze chrysanthemums thank you said david thinking how pippa had loathed chrysanthemums mrs harefields favourite flowers said mustard reverently who was the most awful starfucker you havent forgotten she and her son cosmo are due in five minutes david had not he even looked forward to hermiones visit her exquisite voice had comforted him through many a long night of insomnia strange that even in the blackest despair one searched for love hermione was searching for a public school for little cosmo having witnessed the dreadful rudeness of flora and natasha she had no intention of subjecting her wunderkind to the coeducational anarchy of bagley hall fleetley had been top of her list because of its high academic record and david hawkleys reputation as a disciplinarian having been ushered into his study by a fawning mustard hermione decided it would be extremely exciting to be disciplined by hatchet hawkley and that he was decidedly attractive in a brilliant implacable high tory way rannaldini had been neglecting her again he never answered her calls hermione was consequently casting around for a new beau this stern handsome widower would fit the bill perfectly and might even allow little cosmo in cheap one look at cosmo who was bursting out of his sailor suit like tom kitten with his sailor hat atop his flowing black curls and his evil black eyes rolling in search of diversion convinced david that this vile child must never enter his school most of our boys are put down at birth he said truthfully then less so im afraid were booked solid until ad come come said hermione skittishly i know that powerful headmasters can always waive the rule for friends and i know you and i are going to be very special friends david knew no such thing as little cosmo proceeded to lay waste to his office overturning files putting sticky fingers on first editions scattering sweet papers and finally pulling a penknife on hesiod the school cat who was sleeping peacefully in a patch of sunlight when chided fondly by his mother cosmo ordered her to piss off cosmo went on hermione is severely gifted so he needs to be stretched on the rack preferably thought david wondering how a woman so beautiful and so gloriously talented could be quite so awful as little cosmo was now applying his penknife to the big oak table david suggested a look round the school that would be fun wouldnt it cosmo cosmo said it wouldnt and raising his mothers skirt asked her why she wasnt wearing any knickers hermione was undeterred in the music room where the choir was rehearsing how lovely are thy dwellings she leapt up on the stage and sang along for a page or two before telling the cringing music master he looked just like paul newman you will be teaching my cosmo she drew her wunderkind forward music is cosmos life your flies are undone said little cosmo loudly instantly the hands of both headmaster and music master flew to their zips april fool said little cosmo giving a maniacal cackle little cosmo has such a sense of humour said a beaming hermione back in davids study mustard was waiting to pour camomile tea and honey or earl grey mrs harefield how very caring hermione clapped her hands and flapjacks too my favourite you have done your homework she turned to david you were going to show me your oxbridge results headmaster mustard had just gone to find the file when little cosmo let out another maniacal cackle having discovered the porn magazines in david hawkleys top drawer he was now leering at the colossal breasts of a blonde in thigh boots and a cowboy hat confiscated at lunchtime spluttered david snatching back the magazine as cosmo gave him a pulltheotherleg smile mrs colman yelled david could you amuse cosmo for a minute or two ah sons sons sighed hermione leaning forward in her pink chanel suit to reveal a bosom just as splendid as the blonde in the porn mag it must be difficult with your exacting career to spend enough time with cosmo observed david quality time i give him quality time murmured hermione ive been meaning to ask you are you any relation of lysander hawkley my youngest son said david warily you must be so proud said hermione who actually disliked lysander intensely i havent discovered what lysander does but such a goodlooking clearly gifted boy he gets all that from you of course but hes lucky to have such a generous father i beg your pardon he must have a massive private income to run a ferrari said hermione with her little laugh and all those polo ponies and hes always buying diamonds for his numerous ladies what delicious flapjacks i just assumed fleetley was doing so well you were able to give him a huge allowance or perhaps hed made a killing on the horses david choked on his earl grey turned purple but made no comment the moment hermione left mustard unaware that little cosmo had emptied his ribena into her word processor came bustling in what a lovely lady she wanted the recipe for my flapjacks and what a dear little lad didnt he look sweet in his sailor hat only if he wore it over his face snapped david you know i never read the tabloids went on mustard in almost orgasmic excitement because of her pathological jealousy of pippa hawkley but matron just showed me this she handed david the evening scorpion with a deep sigh he put on his bifocals across pages four and five were slightly blurred photographs of lysander kissing georgie on the dance floor at last nights party and of georgie showing a lot of leg as she straddled the wall at the bottom of the garden there were clearer photographs of martha winterton and guy and georgie together fall guy said the huge headline hunky hubby of the year guy seymour ran the copy is such a tolerant husband he allows wife singersongwriter georgie maguire to kiss and cuddle in candlelit restaurants night after night with lysander hawkley the man who makes husbands jealous last night they were spotted escaping from a fulham raveup during a drugs raid funloving lysander is the youngest son of hatchet hawkley headmaster of snooty fleetley fees a year with extras with a bellow of rage david scrumpled up the paper lysander must be pushing drugs to make the kind of money hermione was talking about degenerate rock stars like georgie maguire were always into that kind of thing picking up the telephone he dialled the deputy head im desperately sorry headmaster ive seen the article i better take twentyfour hours leave and try and sort things out absolutely well hold the fort till you get back alone at valhalla kitty welcomed the prospect of a free evening she had missed lysander a lot he was so lovely to have around but hed be pleased shed lost another eight pounds and had cheekbones ribs ankles and flapping waistbands for the first time in her life she must keep busy and not weaken she had contracts to go through for hermione rannaldini and now rachel and darling wolfie having sent her a boomerang and a furry duckbilled platypus for her birthday deserved a long chatty letter yesterday in a fit of despair shed taken the scissors to her fiendish perm shorn of its frizzy halo her face looked even thinner and all her features the wide grey eyes still slightly inflamed by the contact lenses the squashed nose and the sweet and generous mouth much bigger peering in the mirror she tugged tendrils of hair over her forehead and down her neck it was dreadfully short what would rannaldini say probably wouldnt notice someone was leaning on the bell on the doorstep stood a distinctly attractive man for you he said handing her a bunch of carrots ferdie squealed kitty in delight oo my goodness you look terrific the prospect of winning a bet had concentrated ferdies mind and willpower amazingly he had lost so much weight he was almost unrecognizable he was also blackbrown from the algarve sun with his dark hair streaked blond and his bone structure reappeared the laughing cavalier was slowly turning into mel gibson oh ferdie sighed kitty you dont look so bad yourself ferdie whistled in amazement as he walked round her your hairs so much better and youve got your contact lenses in oh kittywake were on our way lets have a huge drink to celebrate lysanderd be ever so shocked said kitty ill take care of lysander neither of them had touched alcohol for a month but ferdie persuaded kitty to bring up a bottle of champagne already chilled by the dungeons weve got to weigh ourselves in a minute so its only fair if you drink with me said ferdie thinking how sweet she looked not pretty at all but appealing like his mothers boston terrier by the time kitty had filled him in with local gossip and ferdie had produced his holiday snaps theyd had another glass and kitty who hadnt eaten since breakfast had become incredibly giggly as they danced upstairs for the great weighin they started squabbling over how much their clothes weighed mens clothes are heavier than womens said ferdie removing his shoes not that much said kitty kicking off her white high heels ferdie took off his shirt to reveal a suntanned chest solid as a bull terriers oh ferdie you look like arnie swarts whats it ave you been working out ferdie nodded nearly killed me ive still got love handles he seized two chunks of flesh above his waist but theyre going he filled both their glasses that dress must weigh a lot lets have it off gosh he gasped as after a little persuading kitty pulled her blue shirtwaister over her head youre very voluptuous thats a nice way of saying im fat came a muffled voice its a way of saying youve got gorgeous boobs have i kitty emerged scarlet sure you havent hidden tangerines in your bra ferdie squeezed the ends no blimey its all you kitty screamed with laughter tangerines would make me eavier you dope i want to be lighter than you it was thus giggling hysterically with ferdie down to his ninja turtle boxer shorts and kitty in a very white bra and knickers that lysander dropping in after his jaunt with georgie to check on kittys weight loss found them youve got a fantastic body ferdie was saying admiringly take off your bra it must weigh at least seven pounds lysander was absolutely livid ferdie had always been so stuffy about not bonking clients and here he was almost at first base with kitty only just managing to control his temper he supervised the weighin kitty had lost a stone and a half ferdie a stone and five and a half pounds bloody good ferdie conceded rannaldini will have to eat his words i wonder how many calories there are in them said kitty shrieking with laughter ive won the behet i won the behet you are both plastered said lysander icily as ferdie forgetting what day it was wasted three cheques giving kitty her hundred pounds having no intention of leaving them alone together in this state lysander insisted they come over to magpie cottage for supper im only allowed half a grapefruit and a boiled egg said kitty georgie was thinking of doing a barbecue said lysander knowing georgie would get no further than thinking about it kitty put her blue shirtwaister back on and returning to the kitchen was loading cold chicken tomatoes baking potatoes and a big bag of peaches into a cardboard box when an explosion shook the corridor outside ferdies shot himself for losing the bet cackled kitty but he was only opening another bottle of rannaldinis champagne thats more than ive eaten in a month he said peering into the cardboard box then burst into song join me dancing naked in the rain cover me in ecstasy and started bopping round the kitchen table i love that song said kitty dyou think it will ever rain again outside it was even hotter with finches fluttering over the burnt stubble like fleas crawling on a lions pelt for the first time in her life kitty felt thin enough to sit on someones knee im under ten stone she told herself hazily rest your whole weight encouraged ferdie taking a slug out of his bottle youre as light as a fairy although talking of fairies the vicar must be over seventeen stone why the hell was kitty suddenly finding ferdie so funny thought lysander furiously they were both being too silly and plastered for words it must be tiredness and hangover that made him so down and guilt about not putting flowers on his mothers grave today alone at magpie cottage georgie stepped out of the bath and leaving cannibal footsteps went in search of a towel she found one curled up like a hedgehog under lysanders bed overwhelmed by another fiendish compulsion to snoop she found herself going through the pockets of the trousers shirts and blazer he was wearing last night as a reward she found dozens of cards girls must have slipped him with their telephone numbers with home and office written in brackets one of them georgie noticed indignantly belonged to the catchitune publicity girl another to the girlfriend of one of georgies musicians she started to shake frantically frisking his drawers and cupboards but found nothing im sick she thought i know lysander isnt the answer but i cant bear to think of him with someone else but looking like he does and being so sweet how could he not be propositioned wherever he goes would she always die of jealousy whoever she was with was that the heritage guy had left her detesting herself she started on lysanders wallet and was gratified to find a nice picture of herself and ones of jack maggie and arthur then she was brought up short by a photograph of a heartbreakingly pretty woman laughing and sitting bareback on a big grey horse she breathed again when she found lysander had written mum and arthur on the back the leaves were turning in the photograph it must have been taken just before she died oh poor lysander shoving the photograph back georgie who was dry now draped herself in a sarong covered in huge gold sunflowers which lysander had bought her on his way to london and started to redo her face how restful to return to prejulia days when convinced guy loved her for herself she didnt have to spend her time getting tarted up thunder was rumbling round the hills but despite the punishing heat the smell of moulding leaves and bonfires drifted in through the dusty window season of mistresses thought georgie sadly she could see tiny and arthur waiting by the gate for their masters return standing head to tail they were whisking the flies off each others faces and nibbling the itches out of each others necks symbol of a happy marriage thought georgie even more sadly kitty had drunk enough champagne not to faint over lysanders cottage you had to beat back the nettles to get to the front door inside the place was a shambles with a snowdon of washingup in the sink and maggies rippedup victims shoes cushions and the fox fur lysander had bought at the bricàbrac stall carpeting the floor kitty clutched on to her boomerang and her duckbilled platypus you must have the spider franchise for the west of england said ferdie his arms full of rannaldinis dom perignon hi georgie whatever are marigold and the bestkept village committee going to say wondered kitty as she tried to find a space to unload the goodies from her cardboard box stretched out on the sofa dinsdale opened a bloodshot eye as he smelt chicken in the almost entirely frosted up fridge she found the three tins of pâté rachel had inveighed against when she came to supper listeria leads to hysteria ferdie peered over her shoulder thrusting bottles through the ice like an antarctic dredger come away from this squalor and join me dancing naked in the rain and cover me in ecstasy sang back kitty at least she could replace rannaldinis champagne with ferdies cheque you havent got any buttons on that shirt they popped off when i was fat confessed ferdi but i like the shirt ill sew some on for you lysander was too irritated to praise them for losing all that weight but georgie was delighted i cannot get over how marvellous you both look as the back garden was even more crowded with nettles they dragged the garden table and chairs out into arthurs and tinys field the sun had set leaving a primroseyellow horizon but to the east huge black clouds were gathering putting an arm round georgies shoulders lysander gazed down into paradise if i had a line of coke id fly across the valley instead ferdie produced some really strong dope he had also rigged up an anglepoise lamp with an equally strong bulb which threw their shadows like late arrivals at the cinema on to the trees that reared up at the end of the field above the wood the stars rose like a fountain the radio was blaring out pop music sewing on ferdies buttons between alternate swigs of dom perignon and puffs of ferdies cigarette kitty found for the first time in her life that she wasnt terrified when arthur leant his great whiskery face over her shoulder its getting very dark complained lysander drawing on a joint like a maiden aunt throwing up a window and breathing in the morning air its nighttime you berk it seemed to be getting hotter and closer midges were assaulting their scalps and their ankles the grass was covered in little cobwebs and swarmed with spiders why are they called daddylonglegs asked kitty biting off a thread because daddies need long legs to run away from all the trouble they cause said georgie bitterly and talking of trouble miss bottomley is threatening to suspend flora again the moment flora passed her test she was caught driving four friends off to the pub in rutminster miss bottomley has invited me to lunch to discuss it oh well gomorrah is another day ive never had a woman make a pass at me nor have i said ferdie wistfully everyone giggled you will now said kitty warmly i never recognize lesbians said ferdie do they have moustaches no its gays who have moustaches said georgie the technique with the opposite sex announced lysander refilling everyones glasses is to tell beautiful really stupid people like you said ferdie like me agreed lysander to tell beautiful thick people how clever they are and tell clever plain ones how beautiful they are then they always roll over what appens if theyre both plain and fick like me asked kitty youre not said georgie ferdie and lysander in unison lysander means youve got to find a persons achilles heel and then praise it explained ferdie youve got a wonderful heel mrs rannaldini and hes called rannaldini whoops sorry kitty said lysander they all grew hysterical with laughter at the stupidness of their own jokes when the dom perignon ran out they moved on to peach schnapps having sewn on ferdies buttons kitty was fooling around with him trying to make wolfies boomerang come back every time she threw it it went up in the air once she nearly hit arthur thats a valuable horse i dont mind if you hit tiny shouted lysander who was now beached like a whale across two chairs with his head in georgies lap ferdie was laughing all the time now looking like a chinaman with slit eyes and a huge inane grin against the towering trees their shadows danced like the naughty boys dipped in great agrippas inkwell look how we get smaller as we approach cried kitty waving her arms wish dieting was as easy yelled ferdie arent they sweet together said georgie stroking lysanders forehead ferdies very taken hes as lonely as she is wouldnt it be perfect if he took her off rannaldini even in his present stupor lysander was conscious of a distinct disquiet if ferdie started looking after kitty and kitty after ferdie who would look after him even the boomerang looks stoned he said sulkily will it ever rain again sighed georgie they were all too preoccupied to realize it had clouded over and the stars had rushed in the tape had worked its way round take me dancing naked in the rain and cover me in ecstasy sang blue pearl im under ten stone thought kitty capering round to the music im having fun for the first time in years i havent enjoyed myself so much since i went sharonshagging in benidorm with the cricket xi after a levels said ferdie lighting another joint you probably met me there screamed kitty suddenly she stopped laughing listen everyone at first it sounded like a faint rustle of silk or a distant scream then a rattle of machinegun fire gradually they felt the first drops on their hair soothing the midge bites suddenly as they turned their faces upwards it was like stepping into the shower rain yelled georgie joyfully leaping to her feet its raining our little trees will be saved after all trying to hold her back lysander grabbed her sarong next moment she was naked dancing wildly round the field her writhing body glistening like a seal her wild red mane flattened and dripping down her back see me naked dancing in the rain the glorious husky voice echoed across the valley and cover me with ecstasy letting out tarzan howls lysander and ferdie whipped off their clothes and raced after her they were followed by kitty who removed her shirtwaister but kept on her bra and knickers which bobbed in the halfdarkness like white rabbits off they all charged into the deluge and an ecstatic conga round the field leaping to avoid the thistles jack and maggie frisked round their heels yapping hysterically with dinsdale working off kittys cold chicken which hed just eaten whole waddling behind them arthur and tiny cantered alongside snorting with their tails in the air im not frightened of arthur sang kitty swaying in front of him stroking his whiskery nose see me naked dancing in the rain boobedoo lysander was just noticing what a surprisingly good dancer she was and how sweetly her plump body bounced along like pigwig in pigling bland and how he could see her nipples now her bra had become seethrough when a car screeched up to the cottage its the fuzz giggled georgie no youre the fuzz said lysander tugging at her sodden bush and they all collapsed again finding the house unlocked david hawkley walked straight in the sight that greeted him compounded his worst fears a drunken orgy possibly bestiality and witchcraft led by that decadent hippy georgie maguire who was now bopping with a basset and with that degenerate overweight ruffian ferdie fitzgerald bringing up the rear nor were matters improved by a second car roaring up decanting a deputation from the bestkept village committee including marigold lady chisleden and the vicar to do a spot check on magpie cottage glimpsing naked dancers lady chisleden clapped her hands over the vicars eyes crying dont look percy in a ringing voice whereupon the vicar having seen lysander and a muchimproved ferdie in the buff and being convinced hed finally arrived in heaven tore down lady chisledens fingers crying in an equally ringing voice that the church must face up to its obligations see me naked dancing in the rain sang ferdie waving a nearly empty bottle of peach schnapps come and party you guys and cover me with ecstaseeeeee joined in kitty put on your clothes at once ordered lady chisleden your vicar is present oh piss off said lysander in a bored voice painfully reminded of little cosmo earlier david hawkley lost his temper lysander he thundered stop this disgraceful pantomime at once it was a voice that chilled lysanders blood for a second he froze then gathering up his junior dog and holding her in front of himself like a figleaf he turned to georgie darling i dont think youve met my father the party broke up very quickly after that a frantically giggling kitty ferdie georgie and dinsdale spitting out splinters of boomerang were driven away by a very irate marigold youve really let the sayde down georgie conductin blackmagic orgies you must have realized what a pigstay lysander had reduced magpie cottage to probably contributed to it yourself and you and lysander are plastered all over the scorpion gays been on the phone all day trying to faind you hes standin bay you bay the way ay cant think way and all the press are doorsteppin paradise grange to get the catchitune angle from larry its all larrys fault screamed georgie for putting out mugs and tshirts with guy and me looking loveydovey ill get him under the trade descriptions act and whats all this about the scorpion she couldnt take in what marigold was saying she could only think how embarrassing it was that such a handsome man as david hawkley should have caught her running around all wobbling and naked having discovered that his youngest son was far too drunk to make any sense and refused to explain how hed come by any of these amazing perks david hawkley drove off into the deluge after a few minutes he calmed down and decided to put up at a nearby hotel and try a different tack in the morning as every room within ten miles of paradise was doublebooked by reporters he ended up at the bell in rutminster an old coaching inn overlooking the river fleet the kitchen was closed but noting his pallor and good looks the landlords wife insisted on sending up to his room a bottle of whisky and a plate of welsh rarebit which gave him outlandish dreams of naked ladies frolicking in meadows one of them was georgie maguire white feet dancing on the greensward red hair flying like a maenad but close up she turned into mustard wearing nothing but a piefrill collar and he woke up drenched in sweat shaking in horror next morning the papers were full of the chinks in georgies marriage with lots of jokes about paradise lust and ontherocksstar caring guy was much quoted from the south of france insisting that there was no question of divorce and that lysander hawkley was a friend of the family particularly his daughter flora at least lysander wasnt going to be dragged through some messy court case feeling slightly more cheerful particularly after some excellent kippers and three slices of toast and oxford marmalade david decided to have it out with lysander he found magpie cottage locked and deserted except for arthur and tiny who were standing gloomily by the gate in the continuing downpour paradise village swarmed with reporters splashing round in the flooded high street desperate to find lysander and a story more of them were doorstepping angels reach waiting for georgie to emerge receiving a tipoff from miss cricklade who was unblocking a drain clogged with leaves outside her cottage david approached angels reach from the south side crossing the fleet a mile upstream and walking through the woods the rain had stopped but the downpour continued as the water sifted and worked its way through twigs leaves travellers joy and dog mercury to the leafy floor below the weather was still in the seventies but not stifling like yesterday robins were singing beech masks and acorns crunched beneath his feet like shingle but a drenched blackberry he picked was as tasteless as his life reaching the edge of georgies land he could see the house with its soaring angels turned amber by the rain and the lake flanked with bulrushes glinting in the sunshine beech trees stingingly red as georgies hair after yesterdays deluge trailed their leaves in the water statues gleamed seallike red hips glittered on rose bushes puffed out by their weight of water like enraged tomcats saffron and seagreen lichen on the flagstones as he walked up the path were almost luminous the rain seemed to have given the garden back its youth in a clump of drying lavender he found a page of pink flimsy on which georgie had scribbled some lyrics youre a snake on the make a minx of a sphinx youre a wog im a wop but i cant give you up he read then jumped at a baskerville bay dinsdale trying to look fierce at the front but waving his tail kept looking back at the potting shed here david found georgie she was perched on a garden roller wearing a grey tshirt and yellow trousers reading antony and cleopatra yesterdays downpour had brightened her pale cheeks david thought of lavinia in the aeneid and fluffed up her hair which was tied back with a yellow ribbon how did you get in here miss cricklade rather a fan of lysanders told me a short cut said david removing his flat cap even a red rim across his forehead didnt diminish his fierce dark glamour you dont know where he is over the hills and far away ferdies packed him off to australia on a job we thought it better to get him out of the country until the dust and theres plenty of that in magpie cottage settled hes distraught at going leaving the horses and the dogs and you too presumably thought david look he added brusquely i need your help i beg you to lay off him weve got to get him back and into some drug rehabilitation centre before its too late and with all due respect youre much too old for him that doesnt show respect due or otherwise it isnt funny the deeply etched lines on either side of david hawkleys tightly clamped mouth reminded georgie of an hblock for a second she dickered then said can you keep a huge secret lysanders not peddling drugs he hardly smokes dope at all you cut off his allowance and ordered him to get a job so he got one hes employed by women like me to make their erring husbands jealous and hes making a bomb you mean a sort of gigolo asked david with a shudder no no he just hangs around looking heavenly and rattles our husbands theyre such an unfaithful bunch but they dont like their wives playing the same game so they come to heel georgies eyes suddenly filled with tears hes such a sweet kind boy you should be really proud of him hes saved far more marriages than relate im really sorry the press picked on him and me she went on humbly it must be awful having your name dragged in schoolboys so love that sort of thing i feel desperate about my own children as well shes beautiful thought david touched by her concern pity her eyes were obscured by that thick fringe he itched to trim it with a pair of secateurs are you all right he asked im in hot water sighed georgie but i have none i hoped you were the plumber but at least youre not guy all that sanctimonious claptrap about standing by me particularly when hes out in france bonking his brains out she didnt know for sure but why else would rachel be in france i hope the scorpion catches him she lobbed a bonio at dinsdale i found this david handed her the soaked bit of paper oh lovely i wondered where it had got to whats it for a musical called ant and cleo im trying to think of a word to rhyme with asp look i know that party last night must have looked the last word in decadence but its the first time anything like thats happened and she explained about ferdie and kitty celebrating losing weight and then ferdie producing this amazing dope that boys always been a pernicious influence he is not protested georgie hes saved lysanders life he fusses over him like an old nanny and hes got two horses and two dogs to look after now unable to banish the memory of georgies rainsoaked body david suddenly said im staying at the bell in rutminster youre very welcome to come and have a bath then we could have lunch if youre worried about the press im sure they could fix a private room id like to talk about lysander im not going to bore him by banging on about my marriage vowed georgie half an hour later as she lay in a foot of scented water shaving her legs and downing a large bacardi and coke david was drinking whisky and soda in the lounge when she came down and reading a small black leatherbound book georgie peered at the spine it was catullus odi et amo she said bitterly just like my marriage howve you translated it loving and hating someone at the same time is excruciatingly painful said david but ill have to improve on that the dining room was practically empty the head waiter gave them a table overlooking the river and flooded water meadows like the black tassels of a widows shawl rain was pouring out of approaching clouds people were running over the bridge under buckling umbrellas on the far bank hawthorns groaning with berries rinsed their bloodstained fingers in the water georgie felt heady detached and very much in need of the second bacardi and coke he ordered her she didnt want the mood to slip guy got furious when she dithered over menus so she quickly chose horsdoeuvres and a dover sole because they were the things she saw as she gouged out pink mayonnaise with bits of raw carrot and cauliflower and gazed at the river david noticed her eyes were the same sludgy green as the water and her nipples which had been sticking up through her grey tshirt had retreated after a hot bath unable to stop himself touching her freckled cheek he said why do you look so young because i thought i was loved said georgie sadly and proceeded to tell him all about guy julia and rachel melba toast stiffened in a cooled pink napkin rollmops asparagus egg mayonnaise and tiny sweet corn lay untouched on her plate half an hour later i married a bishops son whos turned into a chess bishop always sliding off at angles sighed georgie now ive been caught out hell feel more justified in catting around than ever david whod finished his oysters ages ago waved to the waiter to remove her plate and fill up their glasses and lysander didnt help not really he jolted guy to begin with but it was like putting bandaid over a boil guy still has the capacity to make me more suicidally unhappy than anyone else then youd better get out david leant back as the waiter placed two huge soles in front of them with the greenflecked pats of butter already melting guy wont change he said when they were alone again he may still love you but hes lost that unqualified adulation hes so dependent on and he wont rest in his search to find it again and youve lost your hero it neednt be the end of the world he added gently divorce may not guarantee you happiness but it might be an end to unhappiness its the duty of prisoners of war to escape youd better start tunnelling you dont have to eat that thinking how surprisingly nice he was and that lysander had got his father totally wrong georgie blurted out its a compliment really i cant eat when i fane i mean find someone attractive david flushed and guy always says im the worst boner of soles she giggled the drink taking effect im a better barer of them ill do it for you pulling her plate towards him he plunged his knife into the crisp brownspeckled skin lovely deft hands thought georgie what about you she asked tentatively as he chucked the transparent bones on to a side plate have you got over pippa at all david handed her back her plate she was the most beautiful woman ive ever known i know georgie hung her head i saw a photograph when i was snooping through lysanders wallet i was madly jealous until i twigged who she was hes got the most gorgeous hair she thought hazily striped grey and black like morningcoat trousers and a gorgeous aquiline nose and even more gorgeous eyes hard and unblinking his only similarity to lysander was the long lustrous curly eyelashes and georgie felt he would have straightened these if he could she was also the most promiscuous what georgie was shaken out of her reverie grindy pepper said the landlords wife brandishing a huge wooden pepperpot frantic to discover if shed heard right georgie waited until they were alone once more promiscuous she repeated incredulously she slept with my elder brother alastair even when she was engaged to me he trained racehorses he was the one who sold that hopeless horse arthur to lysander for such an outlandish price alastair was a constant but she always had several others on the go junior masters senior boys pippa said georgie bewildered she was insatiable said david harshly when i was head of a school in yorkshire before i took over fleetley she left me for a month to live with the local vet all the masters had a whipround for her leaving present a rather expensive fridge the sixth form all sent her a telegram saying whats wrong with us he was perfectly in control of himself except for his hands like rigid claws clamped on his knee oh my god said georgie in horror it was so public how did you cope pride stiff upper lip gritted teeth all the clichés men tend not to dump women do thats their strength georgie shook her head ive dumped too much its a drug i dont believe it she looked so sweet and innocent why didnt you chuck her out everything all right said the head waiter looking at the untouched plates he always wanted to make a pie from the uneaten fish and call it lovers leftovers nixon the hotel cat was going to have a field day for the same reason you dont leave guy said david i suppose i loved her and you had lysander and the other boys christ i was jealous of lysander it was all coming out now georgie felt she ought to be wearing a dog collar and have a grille between them pippa worshipped him muttered david gave him everything when it seemed she gave me nothing she used to cover him with kisses deliberately i was too proud to beg it didnt help lysander alexander and hector beat him up because they were jealous too i sent him to a different school because they were so bright i didnt want them to show him up but he was so unhappy he ran home along the railway track to pippa all the time then in his second term a horsebox rolled up outside the school hed only gone out and bought a racehorse it had to go back of course and he was so heartbroken he ran away again so i let him stay at fleetley i know i was vile to him he hates me and blames me utterly for making his mother miserable it wasnt your fault said georgie indignantly anyway she lied lysander doesnt hate you hes just in awe of you someone must tell him the truth christ no david was really shocked he must have that untarnished image to cling on to but its totally false he ought to be falling for girls his own age this time georgie had eaten most of her sole and davids was untouched seeing shed finished he clashed his knife and fork together dyou mind if i smoke watching two middleaged matrons trying not to water at the mouth as they inspected the pudding trolley georgie was reminded of the way women looked at lysander she wondered why she found his father so much more attractive perhaps lysander was too sweet too easygoing shed never be able to push david around yet pippa obviously had neither of them wanted pudding but georgie was shocked how happy she felt when he ordered two glasses of armagnac should we well be running round the water meadows with nothing on at this rate and all my days are trances and all my nightly dreams are where thy grey eye glances and where thy footstep gleams murmured david i dreamt about you last night flustered absurdly flattered georgie felt able to ask what happened to pippa at the end she fell hook line and stinker david circumcised the end of his cigar with grim relish for our local mfh tommy westerham a terrific womanizer he got bored with her and then had the gall to ring me and tell me to tell her to get off his back his wifes very rich and he was terrified of being kicked out georgies mouth opened in horror oh god i broke it to her as gently as i could but she didnt believe me she thought it was a ruse to stop her seeing him so she rode straight over to his house car backfired on the road horse went up she wasnt wearing a hard hat the flame flickered over his tormented face like hellfire as he tried to hold a match still enough to light his cigar i keep reproaching myself if i hadnt told her then had let things take their course she might be still alive did i want to spare her humiliation or was i secretly enjoying humiliating her by telling her tommy wanted out for a moment he rested his eyes on the balls of his hands you couldnt see the churchyard for flowers at her funeral and the church was full of her lovers clapping kind hands on my shoulder they must have thought me a cold fish hector alexander lysander and i carried her coffin lysander stumbled once it was like christ collapsing under the cross he glared at georgie ive never told anyone this he said slowly because i felt so ashamed but as they lowered her into the grave such a slim coffin i felt only relief that at last she was sleeping alone oh god tears were flooding georgies flushed cheeks im so desperately sorry she put a hand on his and lysander knew nothing nothing he was so on her side he never realized my intransigence stemmed from frustration i should have risen above it but i was straitjacketed into my misery break my heart for i must hold my tongue georgie shook her head lysander was deranged with grief i thought hed drive over a cliff or drink himself to death i didnt know how to comfort him taking a slug of armagnac he choked slightly patting him on the back georgie encountered muscles and fought a temptation to run her hand upwards and stroke his sleek head more coffee miss maguire asked the head waiter whod been reading the scorpion in the kitchen and had put two and two together georgie shook her head seeing a fat woman splashing through the water meadows in the wake of a jolly black labrador she said regretfully i must go home and walk dinsdale shall i come with you oh please georgie beamed up at him my worlds tumbling about my ears why on earth do i feel so happy probably booze said david drily then suddenly he had a horrific vision of having georgie as a daughterinlaw it isnt serious you and lysander georgies ponytail flew as she shook her head no no its utterly platonic were just terrific friends she had conveniently forgotten that lysander had asked her to marry him two days ago and how distraught hed been when hed left for the airport that morning ferdie insisted no bonking from the start she went on lysanders suffering slightly from calflove maybe anyway toy boys are like tadpoles if youre sporting you throw them back at the end of the season all the same he ought to get a proper job said david making a writing sign to the waiter shouldnt give it up too lightly said georgie hes the only person i know making serious money in the recession im still trying to think of a word to rhyme with asp said david getting out his cheque book when was catullus supposed to be handed in january that does make me feel better dyou read poetry not since i picked up herrick the other day and found guy had marked all the poems to julia im sure herrick praised julias leg for being white and hairless because it meant she wasnt always pinching his razor dyou mind coming upstairs a minute asked david as they left the restaurant for a second when he produced a pair of scissors from the dressing table she backed away in terror thinking he was some kind of maniac but he laughed and said he only wanted to cut half an inch off her fringe so he could see her eyes david had had a wretched year of insomnia apathy exhaustion and terrible migraines from bottling up his emotions he was a man who liked to have control of himself and other people he shrank from physical displays of affection was often brusque and offhand to hide his feelings but once smitten he went truly overboard half an hour after georgie got home the telephone rang im not the scorpion said david if you use worm instead of asp there are lots of words that rhyme with it poisonous worm youll end my term goddit said georgie you are marvellous i hope i see you before the end of term its halfterm next weekend said georgie the streams came back to paradise and so did guy seymour he was photographed looking handsome and suntanned at heathrow and repeated his vows to stand by his errant wife adding with a manly slightly crooked smile that as a christian and father he didnt believe in divorce in fact he couldnt afford to be anything but magnanimous his french trip had cost a bomb half the galleries in the west end were going bellyup and he needed financial help from georgie to keep going and utterly perversely georgie had suddenly started looking fantastic and he found himself fancying her rotten once again as lysander was in australia he felt less threatened and that georgie was genuinely trying to save the marriage they got on better than they had in months and the press increasingly preoccupied with the gulf war drifted away as autumn gave way to winter georgie found she was looking at her own and davids horoscope long before guys julias lysanders or even rachels guy was delighted georgie was burying herself in work marvellous tunes floated from her turret room like banners and she sang even more beautiful versions in her bath lysander however was stuck in the outback rattling a sheep farmer whod been cheating on his wife and playing a lot of polo missing georgie constantly he grew increasingly frustrated when she never answered his letters which admittedly were pretty short and always seemed out when he rang if he didnt get her as rannaldini was still away hed ring valhalla kitty kitty kitty it sounds as though im calling a cat in the dark did i wake you what time is it fivethirty oh shit im sorry dont be its the nicest wakeup call ive ever ad now i can read what are you reading a book called loves young dream tell me what its about ive got to page twentyfive of the mill on the floss so you can tell

sure she is well ill be home for christmas ive got you a present to make up for dinsdale chewing up your boomerang bye kitty darling putting back the telephone kitty thought how empty paradise seemed without lysander out in the night a sharp frost was bringing down the last leaves she felt sad there was noone to witness their fall like soldiers dying alone on the battlefield how awful if lysander or wolfie or ferdie got sent to the gulf australia grew hotter and lysander missing arthur and his dogs and having restored the errant sheep farmer to his lovely wife decided to fly home and surprise georgie whom he missed most of all he spent the twentyfourhour flight gazing at her photograph which had grown cracked and faded in his wallet and landed on a bitterly cold morning in the first week in december collecting an ecstatic jack and maggie who seemed to have put on a lot of weight from fulham he found ferdie leaving for work and extremely disapproving you cant go back to paradise the press are still sniffing around everythingll blow up again i must check if arthur and tiny are ok my stuffs all at magpie cottage and im frantic to see georgie well for gods sake ring first you dont want to bump into guy lysander left a message on georgies ansaphone and then played georgies sixties tape which hed nearly scrambled all the way down he was so tired the drive seemed longer than the flight he remembered how after any time apart his mother used to race out of the house arms open wide eyes wet with tears of joy and tug him into a warm scented embrace if he had georgie christmas wouldnt be so bleak stripped of its green leaves paradise was as he remembered it on his first visit crows cawed morosely the stone of the houses had lost its lustre everything was blanketed in mist grey and sullen valhalla had retreated into its trees like a murderer with a gang of retainers the only colour came from the last saffron of the larches and the faded red of the turkey oaks georgies soaring angels looked in need of thermal underwear anxious to get into the house out of the vicious wind lysander parked the ferrari across the drive and loaded himself up with a koala bear a huge bottle of giorgio a pearl necklace and twelve bunches of pale pink roses hed bought on the way dinsdale welcomed him and the dogs with great delight the rover outside as highly polished as an elderly army officers shoes looked vaguely familiar but lysander was in too much of a rush georgie its me he yelled letting himself into the house his heart was hammering with excitement he was so dying to hold her in his arms georgie where are you after too long a pause she came downstairs wrapped in a dark brown towel she looked so terrified that lysander thought for a ghastly second that guy might be at home there was a faint smell of fish she must be cooking charitys cod she wore no makeup except mascara smudged under her eyes and although her hair was tousled she was growing her fringe out and wearing it brushed sideways off her forehead having gazed at a very glamorous photograph of her for two months lysander thought she looked much older i was having a bath she stammered clutching his presents his curls flopping over his bruised eyes his chin resting on massed pink roses lysander looked like some bacchante strayed out of an allnight revel dyou want a drink she said nervously no i want you dropping the presents on the hall table which was so small that half the roses fell to the floor he hugged her lets go to bed god i missed you looking down at her feet bare on the flagstones he felt weak with love youve got chilblains you must wear slippers ill buy you some chilblains means its going to snow ill take you tobogganing you dont seem very pleased to see me he added in bewilderment of course i am i wasnt expecting you thats all and flora drives now and er as shes broken up she might roll up at any minute come on lets have a drink ok you put on something warm ill get a bottle ill get it georgies eyes flickered but as she went towards the kitchen there was a crash and the sound of a window being slammed jack bristled and barked whats that pushing her aside lysander sprinted into the kitchen and froze for out of the banging window he could see a man in his trousers and socks carrying his shoes and jacket and frantically buttoning up his shirt as he hotfooted across the garden round to the rover lysander couldnt move he would recognize that broadshouldered ramrodstraight back anywhere jumping into the rover david hawkley drove off in a flurry of leaves unaware that his son had seen him lysander thought he was suffocating on the kitchen table lay a copy of his fathers translation of ovid flipping it open he saw his father had written on the fly leaf to dearest georgie and followed by some incomprehensible latin tag by the recipe books he found three of his own letters unopened georgie was sitting on the stairs surrounded by pink roses looking sulky dead eyed caught out but not nearly sorry enough tell me this is a bad dream its a bad dream how could you georgie whispered lysander clutching the door for support how could you you were so unhappy i worked and worked to get you over guy and i find you bonking my father like a couple of bloody dinosaurs hes a geriatric for christs sake hes only five years older than me said georgie flaring up hes a bastard guys a saint by comparison youre revolting georgie i dont understand you a combination of guilt at being caught out or fierce protectiveness towards david and blazing jealousy of the dead pippa unleashed georgies legendary irish temper your father is the dearest man in the world and whats more hes been a wonderful father to you bullshit shouted lysander so loud that maggie cringed terrified against the door and jack started to yap hes incapable of love he was diabolical to mum rubbish screamed georgie your mother was a whore dyou know how many lovers she had when she was married to your father at the top of her voice saliva flying face engorging and disintegrating like beetroot in the moulinex she proceeded to scream chapter and worse lysander couldnt stop her hed never been quick enough for back chat he just mouthed at her utterly shattered fists clenched rigid but trembling did you know yelled georgie finally your uncle alastair was her lover for years and she was having an affair with tommy westerham his picture from horse and hound was found in her bag the day she died galloping down the main road to plead with him not to dump her i dont believe you whispered lysander my father told you this to get you on his side to poison you against me and mum the lying lying bastard im going to kill him when i catch up with him for a second as he grabbed georgies shoulders shaking her like a rat his beautiful face contorted into frenzy georgie was terrified he was going to kill her as well then he caught the reek of cod again and recognized the smell of sex and with his father and threw her back against the stairs as he stumbled out trampling the roses underfoot and slamming the front door behind him georgie realized what shed done she tried frantically to trace david who now would never forgive her nor would lysander who would probably kill either himself or his father lysanders only thought was to find someone who had known his parents well enough to refute georgies horrific accusations hurtling out of paradise with jack and maggie huddled together on the seat beside him he frantically punched out numbers on his car telephone repeatedly getting wrong people because he kept misreading his address book and misdialling by the time he had narrowly avoided crashing into several stone walls he had learnt that his brothers were both out of their offices his grandmother was whooping it up at some bridge party and his mothers sister was in the seychelles in despair he decided to drive down to brighton to see uncle alastairs widow dinah a tetchy old soak who spent her life outwitting a succession of companions paid by the family to keep her off the booze if he hurried he might catch her while she was sober enough to make sense brighton looked its least seductive an icy wind savaged the tamarisk bushes along the front a sullen grey sea pummelled the shingle aunt dinahs flat stank of torn cat longterm dirt and stale booze lysander remembered how his mother had referred to her mockingly as an auntiedepressant mrs bingham the paid companion tweedsuited and tightlipped had the same gaolers eyes as mustard mrs hawkleys in the lounge would you care for some refreshment id love a drink mrs bingham offered tea or coffee lysander said hed prefer a large whisky oh we dont keep alcohol in the flat im afraid looking at this wildhaired young man totally inadequately dressed in a fosters lager tshirt and dirty white jeans clutching a koala bear and with shakes even worse than his aunt mrs bingham deduced alcohol must run in the family whos there came aunt dinahs ginsoaked yell lysander found her in the sitting room reading dick francis with a huge magnifying glass with the television roaring she was wearing a grey wool dress so tight it had ridden up to reveal stocking tops and thighs like unbaked suet although her black wig was worn at a rakish angle her oncefine features had collapsed with the booze beneath eyelids swollen like shiny white maggots however her bloodshot eyes had the craftiness of an old hippo a large tabby cat covered most of her lap fear of her dashing husband leaving her had kept her sober and reasonably attractive for thirtyfive years but when he did go albeit to another world she had given up even in his state of shock lysander felt huge pity and wished he had brought her a box of chocolates its lysander aunt dinah as he leant forward to kiss a cheek on which red veins tangled like candy floss he caught a waft of stale sweat and gordons the paid companion wasnt being as efficient as she thought just been watching a flick called the bengal lancers aunt dinah spoke in a very precise voice to conceal the slurring everything wrong as usual they never had pigsticking on the frontier but gary cooper was certainly a dish sorry i cant get up cat on lap im sorry to barge in i need to talk to you she offered you a drink said aunt dinah as the paid companion sidled in plonked her tweed bottom on the sofa and got out her knitting im ok collapsing into the armchair nearest the electric fire lysander noticed a cats earth box beside his aunts chair from the smell it hadnt been cleaned out recently he suppressed a wave of nausea you get more and more like your mother glancing up he was disconcerted to see both dinahs crossed eyes concentrating on him its mum i came to talk about a long sigh ruffled the tabby cats fur i wondered how long it would be lysander turned to mrs bingham look dyou mind awfully if we talk alone my job is to stay with mrs hawkley oh bugger off snarled dinah im not likely to get up to anything with my nephew no doubt you frisked him before he came in as mrs bingham flounced out the cat started to purr common isnt she doesnt like thatcher yelled dinah over the television the one coming next week according to the handout has wide experience with handicapped children she gave a cackle of laughter dyou mind if we turn the television down a bit jane asher was in her kitchen talking about christmas cake she looked so fresh pretty and alien to his current squalid surroundings that lysander wished he could climb into the set with her after turning her face bright orange and changing channels twice dinah found the mute button ramming his hands between his knees to stop them trembling lysander took a deep breath about mum i honestly dont want to upset you but basically dads got a new woman mrs colman ive met her that voice would drive me cuckoo no a newer one basically shes been slagging mum off i dont believe her but i just wanted proof that she was lying what sort of things that that im really sorry that she was having an affaire with alastair ah dinahs dirtynailed fingers stopped stroking the cat and loads of other people outside he could see two gulls and a boat with a red sail battling desperately with the gale the pause seemed to go on for ever she was rather unfaithful said dinah she was lysander was aghast then dad drove her to it hes such a shit your father put up with a lot they were never suited he brought her to stay when they were first engaged he was dotty about her the first afternoon he went to his room to write a review for the spectator and alastair offered to show her the garden looking down from my bedroom i saw them kissing in the orchard all the blossom was out it was like a barbara cartland book jacket i dont believe it hissed lysander its true dinahs words were slurring now i caught them out so many times christmas birthdays your grandfathers funeral even your christening some people even thought no forget that alastair and pippa would be the life and soul of every party but suddenly theyd vanish like gypsies lurchers lysander had put his head in his hands now he looked up his eyes cavernous in horror and bewilderment it was a pity alastair died so suddenly didnt leave his affairs in very good order staggering to her feet tipping the cat on to the carpet dinah lurched towards the desk and after pulling out several drawers took out a salmonpink file on which the words two year olds had been crossed out its all here when i want a masochistic charge of adrenalin late at night i go through it her voice dropped to a whisper and wish they were both alive so i could kill them alastair was crazy about her she went on in the beginning he blamed the male menopause twenty years later pippa was an old mans folly but there were always others she loved collecting scalps then telling him about them opening the file she emptied it out on to a nearby table knocking over a dying cyclamen and a staffordshire dog photographs bills letters fluttered everywhere all over the carpet with a stab of anguish lysander recognized his mothers scrawl on a piece of blue writing paper darling alastair he read laboriously that was the best fuck ive ever had as your father got crosser and grimmer your mother got wilder mumbled dinah picking up the radio times nice lunch party i went to yesterday with even numbers for a change all the men were queer of course but at my age you have to expect queers this isnt happening to me i cant read any more thought lysander here give that back said dinah as he chucked the letter on the electric bars of the fire time for your medication young lady mrs bingham dying to know what was going on marched in with a glass of water and two yellow pills on a plate trying to shield his mother lysander hunched himself over the letters and photographs as he frantically gathered them back into their file for a second they were all distracted by the giant tabby cat lumbering into its earth box scattering cat litter as it rose like a deux chevaux and noisily evacuated then as lysander shoved the file viciously back into the drawer he caught sight of a photograph that had fallen on to the floor and nearly blacked out it showed uncle alastair with a great grin on his face lounging in an armchair with a cigar in one hand and his mother kneeling at his feet and laughing as she held his rampant cock towards her mouth between two fingers as though she were about to smoke it they were both naked lysander gave a sob for a second his distress jolted dinah out of her stupor damn i thought id burnt that one mrs bingham gave a crow of triumph why you naughty naughty girl she gloated for scraping away in his earth box the cat had revealed a green bottle of gordons gin threequarters empty turn up the telly said dinah airily theres william morris on the animal road show lysander only just reached the lavatory in time before he threw up and up and up stumbling down three flights of stairs and rushing out into the street narrowly avoiding being mown down by cars trying to get home before the rush hour he took maggie and jack for a run on the beach at dusk he was acutely conscious of the indifference of the sea as it reared up in a long white wall of foam then collapsed at his feet the pier was already lit up against a darkening sky ahead the little fairground where pippa had often taken him had closed down for the winter the red train rested on its buffers no children whizzed shrieking with delight down the blueandyellow helterskelter the merrygoround horses had been zipped away in their leather covers even the ghouls on the ghost train had fled oh no pleaded lysander as he frantically wiped away the tears oh please mum oh no no no but he knew that his childhood had gone for ever wearily kitty made lists for a christmas she dreaded all rannaldinis christmas cards had to be sent off and presents bought for his numerous children and each member of the london met rannaldini had to compensate for his chronic bloodymindedness somehow even more lavish presents had to be bought for his multitude of mistresses but the london secretary who had better taste dealt with that kitty wondered if flora or rachel had been added to the list hed been away so long she wasnt au fait with the latest developments but the deep freezes still had to be filled rannaldini liked to have cecilia and all his children for christmas and hermione bob and little cosmo came over for christmas dinner kitty was also desperately trying to cover her screen with photographs of rannaldini and the famous and had just cut out one of him gazing admiringly up at princess michael it was nearly midnight on the wildest of nights everything rattled and creaked creepers clawed at the windows the wind moaned down the chimneys like women desperate to get at rannaldini kitty had already had three dropped telephone calls and didnt know if shed rather it were burglars checking anyone was at home or mistresses checking rannaldinis whereabouts shed also had increasingly distraught calls from georgie trying to trace lysander we had a stupid lovers tiff and he stormed off you know how impulsive he is make him ring me at once if he rings or turns up kitty had been jumpy all evening the wind was really wailing now suddenly she heard a jangling of bells and a distant pounding on the front door terrified she seized a saucepan and crept along the dark panelled passages guided by the rough slither of a tapestry or the sharp blade of a hanging sword edging round cannonballs and suits of armour not daring to betray her identity by turning on a light the pounding grew louder and was now accompanied by terrible spinechilling sobbing kitty gasped with terror as she saw an anguished shadowy face at the hall window oh god frantically she crossed herself it was the paradise lad go away she screamed kitty kitty let me in oh fank goodness as she unbolted the door lysander fell inside clutching a koala bear followed by a very subdued maggie and jack he was absolutely plastered and blue with cold beneath his suntan his teeth chattering convulsively his eyes crazy his face drenched with sweat kitty had never seen anyone shake so much help me kitty georgie its her fault not mums shes a bitch and dads a bastard and uncle alastair oh christ putting her arms round him propping him up kitty steered him two steps forward one step sideways or back until knocking over several suits of armour and the screen they finally reached the kitchen where she steered him into an armchair by the aga why did she do it jack maggie i havent fed them oh kitty he started to cry there there my lambkin ill see to them let me run and get one of rannaldinis jumpers then ill make you somefink hot wherever ave you been dont go i wont be a sec but when she came back with jerseys including guys lost free foresters cricket sweater and blankets he had passed out tucking them round him she fed the dogs who appreciated the steak and kidney she was about to freeze for boxing day far more than rannaldinis faddy family ever would she then curled up on the windowseat she didnt want lysander falling into the aga or waking terrified and not knowing where he was he and georgie had plainly had far more than a lovers tiff it was a good thing she stayed two hours later he was awake and screaming the house down and she only got him to the in time where she had to hold his head for the next quarter of an hour until she thought hed heave his entrails out somehow she managed to get him upstairs to bed but he continued to rave and gabble incoherently begging her to stay with him only when she gave him one of rannaldinis mogadons did he finally fall asleep next day kitty abandoned the hundred and one things she had to do including making a dozen sets of angels wings for the annual valhalla nativity play and nursed lysander feeding him dry toast and clear chicken soup and letting him talk she didnt fill in the silences as he frantically tried to get his image of his mother into some kind of shape she was so kind kitty said lysander we had a really awful groom who bullshitted her way into the job she couldnt even ride and she was vaguer than me mum finally screwed up courage to sack her but four hours later mum had said so many nice things to her to soften the blow that the groom thought shed been promoted kind people find it ever so hard to say no said kitty who was cutting out a picture of rannaldini shaking hands with donald duck your mum was so beautiful and so many men must ave wanted her she must ave felt unkind refusing them i expect georgies infatuated with your dad she went on as hes almost as andsome as you i dont blame er and that makes her ever so jealous of your mum i mean you know how huptight she was about rachel and julia shes worse than im kitty pointed to jack who was sitting on the kitchen table glaring at maggie who was now lying like a baby in lysanders arms i dont spect she meant half the fings she told you some people just need extra frills in marriage kitty added sadly as she dipped her brush in glue and pasted donald duck and rannaldini under princess michael christ its a horrible world lysander who was still wearing guys cricket sweater dipped a ginger biscuit in his tea and handed it to jack i dont understand why everyone plays games i loved georgie so much we were having terrific sex twice a day at least but it wasnt enough for her she had to have dad as well as kitty was reflecting that if georgie were working really hard she might have preferred the perhaps lesser sexual demands of david hawkley lysander noticed donald duck god im jealous of rannaldini meeting him did he get donalds autograph this screen is lovely youre brilliant at cutting out can i have a go what dyou really want from life asked kitty passing him the scissors and a picture of rannaldini laughing with pavarotti id like arthur to make a comeback and win the rutminster with me riding him i want a job with horses id like a place of my own a wife who loved me as much as i loved her and he added on reflection id like some kids im bored with racketing around dyou know i asked georgie to marry me and shes bonking my father he started to shake violently again oh christ ive cut rannaldinis head off im sorry i cant do anything right can i possibly stay with you until i get myself together in fact it was highly inconvenient kitty had so much to do and instead had to listen to lysander banging on and on with all the egotism of utter despair and extreme youth as a very truthful person she hated having to lie so much on rannaldinis behalf and now she had to lie for lysander as ferdie marigold an increasingly frantic georgie and even david hawkley and aunt dinah in the morning admittedly rang or rolled up to ask if shed seen or heard from him and then mrs brimscombe whod had to be let into the secret went down with flu so kitty had to cope on her own having hidden lysander in an attic bedroom in the oldest part of the house kitty felt like the monks living at valhalla harbouring some cavalier during the civil war astley perhaps or rupert of the rhine or even charles i with his flopping hair his gentleness and his beauty lysander made the perfect cavalier and would certainly have been dashingly fearless in cavalry charges no cavalier seeking sanctuary however would have had the diversion of the sixtytwo instalments of eastenders and neighbours which kitty had taped for him while he was away after four days almost concentrated viewing some excellent plain cooking and a very good win at lingfield lysander was beginning to perk up at least kitty managed to finish the screen and the angels wings as she listened to him he only left in the end and then reluctantly because natasha was coming home from bagley hall and that had been another of georgies lies that flora had broken up the day hed returned from australia anyway he didnt want that bitch natasha drooling over him and he felt hed traded on kittys hospitality enough within a couple of hours of his departure however he was on the telephone kitty kitty kitty come and have dinner at magpie cottage tomorrow night ow lovely shall i bring natasha god no dont say a thing to her im going to cook you a wonderful dinner alas lysander woke the next morning with a blinding headache and the shakes in fact he ached all over he must have caught mrs brimscombes flu he wanted to collapse into bed but he couldnt let kitty down what followed was not just a chapter but a whole book of accidents the avocados he bought were harder than hand grenades the coq au vin took five hours and tasted disgusting he cooked the spinach early and boiled it away to a grit purée for pudding he tried to make syllabub one just followed a recipe but after hours of whisking and even more hours in the fridge the syllabub separated like everything else in paradise he thought sourly the sink was by this time blocked solid with the food hed chucked out there were saucepans all over the lawn and hed singed his beautiful eyelashes when he realized jack was missing and set out with maggie a spade and a torch into the freezing night to find him after twenty minutes with every fox badger and rabbit for miles around rustling in the wood to distract them a demented maggie finally located some faint yapping and lysander and she spent a further twenty minutes digging jack out after which the little sod wasnt remotely grateful and tried to shoot back down the hole again hearing her masters language maggie fled home in terror following her lysander found the chicken burnt out how did people run restaurants hed have to take kitty out he was feeling so shivery he better have a hot bath all his problems that day had stemmed from feeling he ought not to ring kitty every five minutes to ask her how to do things unfortunately a frantic georgie had just returned from london and seeing lights in magpie cottage chose that moment to ring by the time lysander had told her to fuck off and his father had rung and been told roughly the same thing and ferdie had rung and been told lysander was pushed for time the bath had run over and flooded the light fitting below getting electric shocks every time he touched a switch lysander tried to mend the fuse and blew the lights kitty was so behind with her christmas preparations that she felt dreadfully guilty going out particularly as she was abandoning natasha on her first night home to her amazement natasha couldnt have been more amenable even when they met on the landing both reeking of scented bath oil with their bodies and their newly washed hair wrapped in towels im just popping out natasha have you got a meeting sort of kitty stood on one pink leg have a nice time dont hurry back natasha was also unbelievably complimentary about her appearance saying youve lost so much weight papa wont recognize you that when kitty found magpie cottage in total darkness she suspected some fiendish practical joke to get her out of the house as she stumbled up the overgrown path she was knocked sideways with relief and by the stench of burnt chicken oh kitty kitty talk about coqup au vin nearly in tears lysander greeted her with a candle and was just thinking how sweet she looked despite the awful beige dress when the wind blew the candle out they had just groped their way to the fuse box when the telephone rang ill get it said lysander knocking over a stool its bound to be natasha im desperately sorry i cant make it kitty could hear him saying basically ive got the flu honestly im best on my own im really infectious ill just crash out with a dozen anadin extra see you in a bit you are awful said kitty who had found some matches and was pushing in plugs as the lights came on she saw lysander was once more pouring with sweat and shaking thinking it was probably delayed shock she tucked him up in bed once more ill make it up to you kitty ill take you to miss saigon i know a bloke who can get tickets and he drifted off to sleep but spent most of the night crying out for his mother staggering down the following afternoon he felt woolly legged drained but normal it was as though the devil had left his body the cottage was unrecognizable kitty had unblocked the sink and cleaned everything as jack had been muddy after his tunnelling she had even given him a bath and was drying him in front of a glowing crackling fire as she chatted to arthur who was peering in through the window a delicious smell of shepherds pie reminded lysander he hadnt eaten for two days oh you angel god it looks wonderful and smells even better lysander hugged her i dont know how to thank you but please dont get too thin chanced be a fine fing said kitty blushing putting his fork down after a second helping lysander said what shall we do this afternoon i thought you was ill chided kitty im too ill to do anything i dont want to do if you know what i mean it was the first time hed giggled since hed come back from australia and it was such a lovely sound that kitty giggled too ive got to go back to valhalla she sighed rannaldinis bound to ave rung and ive got so much to do and i promised rachel id pick up her kids from school and keep them overnight poor fings got to go to london to see her solicitor as she waited outside the school playground kitty was overwhelmed with tiredness shed have to spend the evening wrapping up the dozens of overseas presents to be despatched before the last day for posting she could have done without rachels children for someone always banging on about the wickedness of nannies and not bringing up ones own kids rachel was remarkably adept at palming her own off on other people kitty kitty masha emerged from the coloured stream of children flowing out of the gates we learnt about the olden days today you know when jesus was alive and you were a little girl lo kitty said vanya is it ok if cosmo comes to tea as well sighing kitty agreed rachels children had speedily sussed out little cosmos advantages as a companion there was no way hed put up with health foods or building castles out of rolls mummy says weve got to practise our carol for the nativity play said masha as she and vanya got into the back i hate music little cosmo clapped his hands over his ears as he jumped into the front all i hear in my house is fucking music over increasing clamour kitty drove wearily back to valhalla to pick up some cash to get some supper that cosmo would approve of but as she came out of the house lysanders ferrari stormed up the drive and he jumped out clutching an armful of super macs and chips a video of pretty woman and a huge round tin of toffees here you are he said chucking the tin at the children have some quality street time and if youre good you can play football with jack in the chapel they all adored pretty woman lysander alternately roared with laughter wiped his eyes or said bastard bastard how dare he treat her like that but by the end he liked richard gere very much indeed pretty womans rather like mummy said masha it was unfortunate for rachel that on his way home to magpie cottage after the children had been tucked up in bed lysander saw a light ahead in jasmine cottage crawling past because of a car casually parked outside he saw a couple in a clinch in the doorway then the man ran down the steps turning blowing a kiss to the woman he was spotlit for a second in lysanders headlights it was a triumphantly smirking rannaldini having dropped off the three children at school the following morning kitty set out for tescos as she staggered out half an hour later pushing two groaning trolleys of food for supper after the nativity play which she was going to cook and freeze that day she suddenly saw that a big pot of yoghurt was leaking leaning forward to remove it she took her hand from the righthand trolley which veered off with a mind of its own gathering speed it rolled down a small slope and narrowly missing an ancient pensioner with a string bag went slap into a dark green porsche scraping it down one side then toppling over with a sickening crash of broken glass oh god screamed kitty surveying the debris of pastry cases and cracked eggs floating in a disgusting goo of double cream yoghurt hellmanns whisky and red wine its not fair its not bloody fair it took her ages to clear up the chaos then she put a note on the porsches windscreen dear driver im ever so sorry about your car i will pay all damage could you write to me at valhalla paradise yours truly kitty rannaldini thats all my runningaway money and more she was thinking despairingly when the note was whipped away car looks much better that way gives it character said a voice springing round kitty saw lysander mrs brimscombe said you were here he said opening the door of the porsche for her thats not your car stammered kitty garage lent it to me said lysander ferraris got engine trouble honestly it couldnt matter less he was feeling very virtuous finding georgies payingin book under the bed at magpie cottage hed written her a cheque for fifty thousand the sum shed paid him overall for his services and despatched it to her bank he thus cancelled any debt between them look what ive got he waved two tickets for miss saigon you and i are going on a seriously good jaunt i cant rannaldini came ome unexpectedly last night and buzzed off this morning to la leaving me so much more to do anyway she sighed im married i dont fink i should pretend youre going christmas shopping they took the train to paddington the restaurant car attendant was so taken with lysander that he ran them up some bullshots theyre heavenly said kitty taking a great gulp whats in them oh clear soup and tomato juice said lysander conveniently forgetting the huge tots of vodka and sherry have another oh yes please ive never travelled first class before kitty gazed in ecstasy at the silver foam of blackthorn dividing the frozen fields and the furry whiteantlered branches of the trees tossing a glittering yellow sun as it bowled along with the train what was the point of life where she was always rushing and never had time to look at beautiful things she didnt even worry when they bumped into the vicars wife as they got off the train lysander took her straight to harrods im going to buy you a dress he said as he went down the rails pulling out clothes and being gazed at by wayin shop assistants not overbusy because of the recession he finally chose one in dark greygreen wool which matched kittys eyes and showed off her bosom and now somuchslimmer waist but which had a flowing skirt which disguised her still plump hips lovely he said looking at her in delight like ivy clinging to a beautiful statue the dress was followed by black tights and flat black pumps youre never to wear those fleshcoloured horrors again now we better buy something to keep you warm and ignoring her cries of protest he chose her a blanket coat in a rainbow riot of colours three pairs of leggings and two huge sloppy jerseys whisking her past the babywear department you dont want to look at them only depress you itll happen one day i promise he bore her off to the toy department to admire huge stuffed donkeys giraffes tigers lions gorillas and teddy bears they always remind me of a dogs home said lysander i used to try not to catch their eyes when mum brought me here as a child we ought to go to battersea and get you a puppy to protect you at valhalla instead when she was looking at computer games to keep cosmo quiet at christmas he bought her a vast fluffy lifesize collie with a shiny black plastic nose heres lassie to guard you oh lysander kitty was overjoyed you shouldnt ave but i love her in a place that wont let us feel in a life where nothing seems real sang miss saigon as they passed the record department next minute they were brought up short by rannaldinis cold unsmiling face looking out from a montage of his record sleeves as the haunting strains of the first movement of mahlers fourth with its jangling sleighbells swept through the store turning right they saw huge blowups of cecilia and hermione as donna anna and donna elvira and even a cardboard cutout of georgie clutching a rock fucking hell said lysander in outrage and before reality could reassert itself he dragged kitty off to lunch at san lorenzo here her calm sweet unmadeup face and full body were in total contrast to the slender painted beauties around them who all seemed to be wearing scarlet and crimson suits lots of rouge red lipstick and red nails and seemed never to draw breath they were obviously fascinated to see an utterly stunning man with such a nondescript girl theyre all so beautiful thought kitty shes so peaceful thought lysander protectively like a leveret or a female mallard he also noticed as her face used to rannaldinis cold house grew pink in the warm room that her spots had gone i do hope joy hillary tells rannaldini she saw us on the train he said and makes him seriously jealous with a start kitty remembered they were only here because lysander was being paid by georgie and marigold to glam her up how very kind she thought humbly of him to make everything such fun its driving me crazy a blonde paused at their table on the way out what part in eastenders do you play she asked kitty but later when the helicopter landed on the stage of the coliseum she forgot everything except miss saigon as she and lysander cried their eyes out and went through a whole box of kleenex and a box of belgian chocolates that was the best fing ive ever seen she said as they had supper together afterwards in a fulham wine bar i fink this is the nicest day ive ever had shes so sweet to take out thought lysander i wish you werent so terrified of horses then we could ride together im not frightened of arfur said kitty tucking into her cottage cheese salad but the way he drinks coffee and snores wiv one eye open and gets hisself dirty hes not really an orse hes more of a uman i think thats the nicest compliment arthurs ever been paid said lysander gravely thank you kitty they talked so long and drank so many cups of coffee kitty suddenly realized theyd missed the last train well go back to my old pad said lysander ive still got a key ferdies away this evening its all right he added seeing the look of panic on kittys face youre quite safe with me and there are two bedrooms im chaperoned by my own plainness thought kitty sadly noone looking like me could cause talk noone will see us said lysander as the taxi turned into fountain street but as he rushed in to switch off the burglar alarm the gays opposite parted their damask curtains and started waving frantically what a lovely little ouse said kitty thinking how easy it would be to keep a place like this nice and you could put camellias in tubs in the little patio at the back lysander put kitty in ferdies room with the big bay window looking over the street she could see the gays peering in as she drew the curtains lysander had found her a glamorous cream silk nightdress left behind by one of his girlfriends it slithered over her like a skin if only she could take on the beauty of its original owner all the same she thought as she set ferdies alarm clock for sixthirty and snuggled down in bed with the toy lassie stifflegged beside her it had been the nicest day of her life lysander had made her feel like one of the romantic heroines she so loved reading about not a drag nor a dog nor even a brick with a guilty start as she was falling asleep she realized shed forgotten to say her prayers perhaps for once god would forgive her if she did it lying down please god bring lysander happiness and find him a nice girl wholl look after him and not take advantage of his sweet nature unused to london traffic crashing along the end of the street lysander woke at six and was horrified to hear ferdie coming in from a night on the tiles not wanting to get shouted at and still halfasleep he pulled the duvet over his head hoping the trouble would go away he heard ferdies bedroom door open then after a long pause while he waited for an explosion it shut again relieved lysander went back to sleep a couple of hours later aware that they were supposed to get an early train back he staggered downstairs nursing his hangover expecting to find ferdie furious at having to sleep on the sofa probably frozen stiff from not having a duvet but to his horror there was noone there the cushions of the sofa were still smugly plumped up ferdie must have gone to work but opening the sittingroom curtains lysander saw the red ferrari which hed bloody earned for ferdie and ferdies black brogues were sitting on the kitchen table together with the ferraris car keys lysander was appalled kitty was an innocent girl in his care how terrible if ferdie in his new slimline sexual awareness had come home tanked up and taken advantage he remembered how hed caught them halfdressed and giggling together over the weighin at valhalla ferdie had always liked kitty in a fury lysander pinched one of ferdies marlboros and put the kettle on his worst fears were confirmed when his old flatmate came down in a towel showing off a still suntanned and increasingly svelte torso and smirking worse than rannaldini emerging from jasmine cottage black and no sugar for me said ferdie getting a carton of unsweetened grapefruit juice out of the fridge ive got a terrific job coming up for you in brazil in a couple of weeks lysander refused to admit how furious he felt kitty was not the kind of person one got jealous about he was even more irritated at the relief which overwhelmed him when kitty rushed downstairs ten minutes later i feel shockin poor ferdie ad to sleep in the armchair in his room an he must have turned off his alarm clock because weve really overslept when they finally got back to valhalla around midday she found the tape on the answering machine exhausted by increasingly outraged calls from rannaldini where zee fuck are you keety ring me at the beverley wilshire the eenstant you get in zee next time you rush off to your mothers leave a number even thousands of miles away he terrorizes her thought lysander angrily watching the frantically fluttering pages as kitty fumbled through the los angeles telephone directory then she stopped remembering it would be am in la and rannaldini would be asleep or more likely coiled round some female musician the last message on the machine however made lysander forget everything the voice was clipped light drawling and decidedly amused this is rupert campbellblack ringing from venturer television for rannaldini we gather youre doing a nativity play at valhalla we were wondering if we could come and film and put it out on christmas eve lysander gave a tarzan howl of joy at last rupert will have a chance to meet arthur paradise was thrown into a complete tizz suddenly at the prospect of millions of viewers and rupert campbellblack in the audience what hermione airily described as making sweet sacred music together for the delight of a few friends had become a steven spielberg spectacular rannaldini whod always been insanely jealous of ruperts success both with money and women was driven to a frenzy of rivalry the rows were pyrotechnic you cannot put hanging baskets outside the inn in the middle of winter bethlehems not competing for the bestkept village screamed meredith who in charge of sets was now dragging the manger an exciting shade of raspberry pink well your stables more like the braidle suite at the ritz screamed back marigold whod been unusually ratty of late this play is supposed to be topical with a recession on mary and joseph would have been able to get into any hotel they chose snapped meredith twitching the pink damask curtains flanking the stable window into place but were not having those he went on tugging down a washingline and four towelling nappies rachel had strung across the set baby jesus has only just been born in this scene theres no way hed have got through four nappies put those back shouted rachel furiously weve got a chance to tell millions of viewers perhaps twelve million if its networked that disposable nappies take five hundred years to biodegrade whereas cotton towelling ones can be oh shut up screamed marigold and meredith in unison kitty who as usual had to do everything had retreated to the kitchen to retype on recycled paper georgies script which everyone kept changing ten minutes later lysander rushed in hidden inside the front half of the donkey with jack and maggie hanging furiously growling on the uninhabited back half oh kitty kitty he cried despairingly from his furry depths the vicar and meredith and natasha all want to play my back half i dont want to be groped by any of them wrenching off the donkeys head he fumbled for a cigarette even scarlet with indignation his hair all ruffled he looked adorable dont worry kitty handed him a lump of sugar on the flat palm of her hand as he had taught her rannaldinis due back tonight and hell change everyfink oh dear lysanders face fell then it wont be nearly such fun there had also been furious spats over the casting with all the paradise ladies angling for the coveted role of the virgin mary in order to wow rupert campbellblack hermione got the part natch and insisted on four changes of blue silk robe and a becoming gold halo designed by david shilling in the only moment during the entire production when hermione was in agreement with rachel they decided mary must be seen to breastfeed the doll which had been flown down from harrods with the christmas caviar to play baby jesus trust the old tart to grab any chance to flash those great tits in public grumbled meredith rannaldini had turned down the suggested role of herod and was leaving the conducting of the orchestra handpicked members of the london met to bob instead he insisted on riding in on the viciously volatile prince of darkness as the first of the three kings he had coopted rachel because of her long legs and because she looked disturbingly sexy with a cork moustache and beard to play the second king but had vetoed rachels suggestion that she should hand over a freerange turkey instead of frankincense lysander was able temporarily to forgive rannaldini who having cast marigold also because of her great legs as the third king then because of marigolds nervous disposition had signed up arthur to play her horse guy who had a fine bass voice and a lifetime of singing loudly in the church choirs was cast as st joseph which gave him a legitimate excuse to grow a beard and no longer use plastic razors which took even longer than nappies to biodegrade at hermiones suggestion the script had been rewritten to portray joseph as deeply in love with his young wife and now included several long clinches under the mistletoe and guys repeatedly professed delight at being present at the birth why dont you have a bonk and make it really authentic snapped georgie who was playing the chief shepherd and was fed up with her script being messed about if guy was absolutely not hermiones type as hermione had told georgie after the church fête she was concealing her prejudice extremely well larry whod been cast in the key role as the innkeeper kept cutting rehearsals due to the pressure of work which explained marigolds increasing twitchiness the casting of the vicar reduced meredith to more hysterics you cant let that fat queen play gabriel give lysander the part hes got the angels face lysanders tonedeaf and he really cant act said georgie kindly then he can play one of your shepherds said hermione pointedly he and you are such friends not any more spat lysander glaring at georgie it was at this point that he was demoted to the front legs of the donkey lysander in fact was feeling as though his life had been churned up like a ploughed field after the things georgie had said about his mother he couldnt bear to be in the same room with her but he was desperate for rupert to meet arthur and increasingly felt the need to protect kitty from everyone as kitty had predicted rannaldini breezed in that evening completely rewrote the script rearranged the music and taking one look at the furry ox and the donkey whose front legs were doing a softshoe shuffle at the time replaced them with real animals to give the play authenticity by the following day there were also live sheep maggie jack and dinsdale had got parts as sheepdogs and even tabloid was enrolled to guard the inn at rachels prompting chickens and a fearsome turkey were freely ranging the set are we staging st francis of assisi as well grumbled meredith as he trod in a cowpat sacked as the front of the donkey lysander was relegated to turning rachels pages when she played the piano for early rehearsals but he was so distracted by the sight of kitty in the green dress hed bought her that he totally ignored rachels repeated nods and was demoted to shifting scenery bob admired the green dress too kittys getting prettier he observed where said natasha who was fed up with her tiny part in the angelic choir suddenly georgie realized that kitty hadnt got a part ill write you in as the innkeepers wife kittys forte is being a backroom girl said hermione firmly who else could play the innkeepers wife natashas too young and pretty what about mother courage suggested georgie she so longs to get on telly certainly not hermione was shocked lets keep it simple just our set we dont need an innkeepers wife your daily can sit in the audience because the crew are bound to cut to them some time during the play i hope rupert campbellblacks been invited to stay on for supper after the performance she added to bob rupert wont be able to refuse once he sees brickies spread said guy smiling warmly at kitty lully lully breast is best lully lully baby rest sang hermione flashing a blueveined boob at her sleeping harrods doll i still think kitty should be in it said georgie stubbornly kitty is needed at home hissed rannaldini who was trying on a totally anachronistic purple velvet doublet theengs are getting very slack ere there are lights on everywhere plants go unwatered he pressed the earth of a huge ficus the second post hasnt even been opened and i hardly think my study is the right place for a roll of lavatory paper lysanders face tightened with anger as you talk so much shit sir i would have thought it was very appropriate rannaldini looked at lysander in amazement as though the manger had spoken particularly white lavatory paper he went on i told you not to buy white any more keety you know bleach pollutes the rivers hearing rachelspeak coming straight out of his mouth everyone exchanged uneasy glances kitty had gone puce with mortification im sorry rannaldini she stammered dont apologize do better next time said rannaldini chillingly and you still havent sewn up my robes where the ox trod on them grumbled hermione perhaps the kings could give mary a years subscription to the nappy service suggested rachel then they could all wish the holy family a very nappy christmas giggled meredith except its epiphany by the time they roll up stop taking the piss howled rachel shut up meredith ordered rannaldini from the summer parlour next door larry could be heard yelling someone else must have guaranteed the loan for christs sake nice if your husband could put in an appearance except to use my telephone snarled rannaldini nice if you could put in an appearance except to bully everyone sir said lysander putting an arm round a sobbing marigold kitty was amazed how much less she minded rannaldinis tantrums lysander might have been passed up as the angel gabriel but suddenly he seemed to have drawn a halo around her life which became increasingly brighter as he brought in logs for the great hall fire carried her shopping in from the car and nipped down to paradise to get her some anadin extra when she got her period lysander also helped her staple together the retyped scripts even if he did put them all in the wrong order because he was chatting so much and she had to retreat discreetly into the larder to restaple them when he wasnt looking and it was bliss to have someone to amuse everyones children when they were dumped on her and to giggle with when hermione complained kitty had mended her robes with the wrong blue thread or natasha hit the roof about shrunk washing natasha wasnt the only one who noticed how lysanders face and voice softened when he was with kitty you dont need to pay her so much attention when rannaldini isnt here snapped marigold its him youre being paid to rattle two days before dday lysander sat in the back row of the stalls pointedly reading a porn mag to discourage natasha and the vicar who was gallumping around in a long white nightgown from cavendish house trying to secure his halo with velcro hermione about to do the annunciation scene was making a very short list of christmas presents she simply had to get what can i give bob men are so difficult she asked lysander then suddenly remembering her visit to fleetley i forgot to tell you i met your father last term across the gangway georgie clad in the unglamorous robes of chief shepherd stopped writing her christmas cards rather a charmer went on hermione what are you going to give him a bottle of arsenic snapped lysander returning to chantelle good idea said hermione who wasnt listening because kitty had staggered in with a tray of coffee and homemade flapjacks which lysander leapt up to carry for her huddling back in her robes georgie returned to her christmas cards she was fed up with the number of guys parents friends whod all been shown the scorpion by their dailies who sent christmas cards addressed solely to guy with tender messages inside about how they were praying for him wistfully georgie remembered christmases earlier in her marriage when she had signed every card love from guy and georgie with guys name first because men should be deferred to now she just signed her own name under the lining paper in her desk at angels reach was a pretty little victorian card that she was dickering whether to send to david hawkley although lysander totally froze her out now he had behaved honourably he had never sneaked to david admittedly because he couldnt bear to repeat the horrific things georgie had said about pippa but he had bawled david out for stealing georgie the woman he loved and david had been shattered he was mortified that lysander had caught him and georgie virtually in flagrante he had risked bringing scandal on fleetley by dallying with a pop star but worst of all georgie had lied to him as pippa had so often before that her relationship with lysander was platonic thus luring him into cheating on his own son at whatever heartbreak to himself david had refused to see georgie again utterly devastated georgie had thrown herself into work ant and cleo was nearly done and to her great relief larry had stopped nagging her to finish the album guy on the other hand was playing her up again only last night she caught him cleaning st josephs sandals with nontoxic shoe polish and later when she had been so carried away at the moment of orgasm that shed ripped his back with her long nails hed yelled dont do that for christs sake are you worried georgie had yelled back that your mistress might discover you actually sleep with your wife and guy had retreated into his usual orgy of hurt outrage it was december and georgie hadnt bought a single present nor had she done any cooking guy whod taken three days off from the gallery could bloody well do that only her bank statement cheered her opening it this morning she found she was an amazing fifty thousand pounds better off than shed expected it must be more forgotten foreign royalties guy who had snooped and also read georgies bank statement was relieved they wouldnt starve things were desperate at the gallery another backer had gone bellyup last week but unlike georgie he had thumbed through the statement and found one dated december for fifty thousand from lysander and was racking his brains to work out what it was for remembering times past when he had in public studiously ignored women with whom he was having affaires in private he construed lysanders total avoidance of georgie as evidence of an ongoing affaire his suspicions were fuelled that morning when lysander marched in wearing his free foresters jersey matters were not helped by floras return from bagley hall and then jumping on every telephone call because of her ravishing voice bob had persuaded her to give the play a homely touch by appearing from time to time to sing unaccompanied carols flora had only agreed because she was so desperate to see rannaldini again all summer she had basked in the gold sunshine of his love then as relentlessly and inevitably as leaves coming off the trees after boriss success in the requiem he had withheld it now she was stripped bare of all affection rannaldini had never rung her again and apart from the few messages she had left with his london secretary flora had been too proud to pester him she refused to become one of the distraught tearful pleading creatures whom rannaldini got a sadistic charge out of listening to on his answering machine think not for whom the lack of telephone bell tolls sighed flora rannaldini in fact had not become bored with flora he still wanted to reduce her to such abject longing that she would take part in his fiendish games but more importantly the new world phil in new york had come up for grabs rannaldini wanted the job of musical director very badly he had never regained the same ascendancy over the london met after the lovely black eyes incident hermione was still giving him earache he wanted to start a new life in a new country then to his rage he learnt that the new world phil were also considering boris levitsky american orchestras and their social benefactors like their musical directors to live in the city and lead regular lives it was vital for rannaldini therefore to avoid any scandal and present a happily married front with kitty while doing everything he could to prevent boris and rachel getting together again a challenge that appealed to his machiavellian nature he had kicked off by ringing boris with words of warm encouragement i will talk to the right people boris i will smooth your path i am right behind you with a fleek knife said boris slamming down the receiver although rannaldini felt it prudent to softpedal his affaire with rachel he found himself more and more addicted to the demanding crosspatch her ability to massage essential oils into all parts of his body was beyond anything flora whod been trailing them in her fathers car had also noticed rachels increasing dominance over the play and was in a dangerous kamikaze mood only marigold was more miserable than flora she had wrapped all her christmas presents overloaded the deep freeze despatched her cards and decorated the house so early that the mistletoe was already shrivelling under the huge chandelier that was no longer switched on as it wasted precious energy larry was behaving in an increasingly suspicious fashion coming home later and later pouncing on the telephone then shutting the door or going out to his car when he rang out rising early to intercept the post and eating nothing in earlier years he had relished taking part in the christmas play and never missed a rehearsal conducting business in the wings on his mobile this year in the plum part of the innkeeper he had hardly showed up marigold was sure he must be back with nikki or having an affaire with rachel who was looking utterly radiant marigold felt she was having a leg broken and reset without an anaesthetic tempers were not improved during the dress rehearsal by the arrival of a film crew with a sleek glamorous but very aggressive director from venturer television called cameron cook the continual stopping to readjust cameras and microphones threw the entire cast even such old hands as georgie and hermione lights fused lines were forgotten cues missed cameron decided to put two cameras on either side of the hall and one up in the minstrels gallery from which the vicar as the angel gabriel would descend to address mary and later the shepherds the technicians stood around yawning looking bored and tripping over mr brimscombe as he peered into the chapel which had been turned into a womens changing room while he pretended to fiddle with the fuse box lysander had taken refuge at the back of the stalls he was laboriously ploughing through a really sad piece in the express about rupert campbellblack and his wife who had just lost a testtube baby at four months and were both utterly devastated oh poor rupert thought lysander and his wife was so beautiful and not much older than himself he wished he could do something to help them the rows on stage were getting worse dont forget not to look at the camera hermione was hissing at the shepherds with so many cameras one can hardly help it said meredith fretfully the star fused again if it blows on the night larry can leap on to the roof and flash his medallion said flora if he turns up at all said natasha bitchily talk about a neverin keeper marigold burst into tears again dropping a huge bunch of holly kitty ran to comfort her lully lully breast is best sang hermione nearly taking the vaulted roof off you cant say that shit said cameron cook consulting her script and whats a christmas tree doing in the stable they werent invented in those days and why isnt it decorated because its demeaning for trees to be hung with baubles explained rachel earnestly for gods sake snarled cameron now holy joes arrived we better go back and do the annunciation up in the gallery like some vast white bird in his cavendish house nightgown the vicar cleared his throat and straightened his halo hi charismatic mary he called out in his fluting voice ive dropped in from heaven to tell you your pregnancy test is positive how wonderful cried hermione gazing down at her harrods lily joseph will be absolutely absolutely she turned to meredith who instead of prompting was gazing at a butch cameraman joseph will be absolutely repeated hermione snapping her fingers gobsmacked suggested lysander who was still reading about rupert absolutely delighted meredith had found his place im afraid joseph isnt the father said the vicar as he slowly descended on a wire attached to a buckling beam in the ceiling hermione bowed her head it could be no other it is god almighty screamed the vicar as he landed on a freerange hen well i know joseph will make a caring stepfather said hermione launching loudly into behold a virgin shall conceive stop stop who wrote this shit shouted cameron cook this bit handel and jennings said bob helpfully the rest of it is georgies it is not stormed georgie not a line of mines left in id take your name off it sharpish then advised cameron a diversion was created by the arrival of ferdie who had dropped in to discover if natasha still had the power to hurt him and why marigolds last cheque for lysanders services had bounced twice and georgies retainer not been paid at all as larry was still awol ferdie was promptly coopted to play the innkeeper youve lost even more weight said lysander coming through the big door at the back leading arthur looking very smart in a jewelled bridle ive been working out and cleaning up said ferdie giving arthur a polo the gym is packed with bored housewives walking very slowly around the running track so their makeup doesnt run im telling all of them im about to be sent to the gulf and pulling everything in sight heres the script bob handed it to ferdie i dont think larrys up to it even if he does show its not a huge part but key can you learn it by tomorrow ad lib if you like ferdie was brilliant as shylock at school lysander told kitty how are you anyway he asked ferdie exhausted with electricity privatization ive been stagging all week ive been staggering all week moving scenery said lysander but rupert campbellblacks turning up tomorrow and i know he and arthur are going to get on arent you boy he gave arthur a hug whats happening hissed ferdie drawing lysander aside noones paying not a bean out of marigold nor georgie if they dont cough up soon we should cut our losses and pull out the brazil jobs still open and thats serious dosh but lysander was watching kitty who had climbed up a ladder to put pieces of holly around a huge oil of one of rannaldinis alleged ancestors she was wearing the black leggings and huge blackandpurple sloppy jersey hed bought her in wayin hed never seen her in trousers before there was something infinitely touching about her plump little legs as she stretched up he could see threeinch gaps of white calf above her father christmas socks he suddenly longed to touch them just as he always wanted to stroke arthur jack and maggie who was now chewing up a stray shepherds crook he told himself firmly putting down the express he walked over to hold her ladder its lysander not electricity who ought to be privatized drawled flora having exhausted the other ladies of paradise hes moved on to kitty dont be ridiculous snapped rachel hermione and natasha in unison with their deep involvement in rannaldini and lysander they found it impossible as well as unbearable to concede that kitty had any pulling power however often lysander banked up the fire in the great hall it was definitely getting colder peoples breath rose in thick white plumes cameron will be able to send up smoke signals from the back of the hall said meredith to his pal flora i do hope she gets the script back to your mothers version but flora was glaring at a new and splendid fur coat which hermione had put on over her blue robes which could only be a christmas present from rannaldini im going to report her to animal rights she said furiously she also noticed rachel had disappeared and cameron was yelling into a telephone in the summer parlour which was a good thing as neither of them would have enjoyed ferdies début as he welcomed mary and joseph to the inn script in one hand litre of red in the other come in come in he was saying cosily of course we take amex just give me the keys to your donkey and ill park him sign in here the orchestra all in their overcoats were in stitches kitty nearly fell off her ladder laughing ive got the video of dirty dancing murmured lysander handing her up another branch of holly theres a lot of shepherds in the next room who keep ordering pie on room service ferdie was now saying bang on the wall if they get too noisy then handing two room keys to a very disapproving st joseph oh well i better go back to watering the wine oh please dont waste precious water interjected hermione who was revving up for the birth of her harrods doll bob whod been laughing a lot told ferdie in future hed better stick to the script and its about time for you to sing oh come all ye faithful he shouted to flora noones faithful in paradise except you and kitty shouted back flora as were heavily into realism i better sing come both ye faithful that is quite uncalled for thundered guy turning brick red above his blond beard flora strolled towards the stage hands in her pockets oh come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant she sang softly oh wow murmured the leader of the orchestra to a neighbouring oboist eat your stony heart out hermione they had reached the part when the angel gabriel appeared to the shepherds abiding in the fields you ready perce called bob to the vicar in the gallery ready called the vicar adjusting his halo in the window outside it was snowing how very appropriate in the bleak midwinter he was glad he was wearing his thermals under his nightgown chat amongst yourselves shepherds said bob consulting his script what are you doing on new years eve reuben asked meredith who as second shepherd was holding maggie thats not in the script hissed georgie burnous askew as she clung for grim death on to a terrified ewe suddenly like sulphur and brimstone a waft of maestro swept through the great hall far stronger than frankincense or droppings of sheep or donkey instantly the nearest flautist whipped the curly blond wig off rannaldinis bust georgie let go of her ewe which bolted into the wings sending a peeping mr brimscombe flying the star fused again rannaldini the astrakhan collar of his black coat turned up framing a face white with barely controlled fury strolled towards the stage i thought i told you all to be word and note perfect by the time i came back my fault ferdie stubbed out his cigar and stood up in the stalls i was standing in for larry and thought id jazz things up a bit well dont said rannaldini witheringly hermione maestro hermione smiled at him awaiting praise piano for gods sake snarled rannaldini that lullaby would have woken every bambino in judea and babies are fed every four hours not every four minutes so put those boobs away youre playing the virgin not delilah then not giving hermione time to scream at him he turned on guy who was eating a flapjack in the stalls youre even more wooden than that ludicrously overdecorated manger joseph your young wifes having a baby then everyone rolls up bringing him presents and ignoring you show some pride or some jealousy and as for you percy he looked up at the vicar who was still swaying helplessly from his beam talk about fat tum of the opera your bellys too large and your voice too small youre being drowned by hermione and georgie and you couldnt instil mighty dread into any mind troubled or otherwise im afraid youll have to join the angelic choir instead normally suntanned rannaldinis extreme pallor was infinitely more sinister the jetblack eyes glittered like holes into hell but there was an air of purring satisfaction about him not just due to the pleasure of bawling people out ignoring the equal hysterics of the vicar and hermione rannaldini picked up cameron cooks mobile and punched out long distance carissima he launched into a flood of italian only the occasional word like network being comprehensible then with a vicious smile he changed to english so everyone could hear over hermiones squawking it only means arriving a day early for chreestmas the script eees excellent ill get keety to fax you a copy so you can learn it tonight ciao switching off his telephone he turned evilly to face the cast cecilia arrive tomorrow to take over gabriel artistic integrity overcoming terror georgie tore off her headdress the script is not excellent rannaldini she protested well be a laughing stock rachels wrecked it cameron cook agrees with me someones got to tell rachel i will my dear georgie said rannaldini gently to me the scripts are much improved more topical more relevant less trite he turned to the back of the hall well done rachel everyone particularly georgie who thought rachel was miles away jumped out of their skins as rachel drifted through the door she was wearing a very newlooking pale fawn cashmere jersey softer than the belly of a persian kitten and she looked absolutely beautiful as though all her anger had been ironed out christ murmured meredith letting maggie off her lead so she shot back to lysander if rannaldini likes that script he must be hooked i shall be working late in the tower rannaldini called to kitty who up on her ladder was now filling the windowledge with big branches of yew i do not weesh to be disturbed as he walked past rachel like a bat in his black coat he shielded her from the others view only flora stiller than a shadow in the windowseat saw him reach out for rachels breast as rachel put a quick hand on his crotch my leetle quaker whispered rannaldini my leetle earthquaker you will come soon to the tower the moment ive found a babysitter and he was gone the bestlaying plans of maestros and men however can go astray wandering into the kitchen to make arthur a bowl of coffee lysander found rachel writing a note wheres kitty she demanded picking up the note lysander scrumpled it up she cant babysit he said flatly why ever not what else has she got to do shes taking christmas presents over to her mother oh right well perhaps you could the kids adore you so much i couldnt lysanders sweet face hardened like wet clay cast in bronze im not looking after your kids so you can get fucked by rannaldini what dyou mean rachel gave a gasp of horror ive been celibate for nine months not with rannaldini you havent december th wasnt it i was driving home from kittys rannaldini was kissing you on the doorstep your towel was slipping and you told kitty youd gone to see your solicitors soliciting more likely we were discussing cadenzas said rachel frantically casting round for excuses cads a better word said lysander bleakly kitty was so bloody tired that night rachel was shattered by his anger come and have a drink this evening ill explain no thanks and dont ever do that to kitty again poor rannaldini hermione was so livid she decided temporarily to emulate the purity of the virgin that night kitty was in sidcup and rachel was confined to barracks minding her own children faced with the appalling prospect of a loveless evening rannaldini decided to forgive flora ringing up guy and georgie he suggested he dropped by after supper to show them the video of the dress rehearsal and have a lastminute script conference maybe rachel make it a leetle too green it was snowing heavily by the time he arrived at angels reach shivering in the icy wind like a slaughtered ostrich a large christmas tree lay on its side rannaldini was livid to discover that flora had gone out to a party georgie was livid because the video showed guys hand disappearing more than once into the billowing blue depths of hermiones robes its good acting protested guy a pat on the bottom is just the kind of friendly gesture a wife receives from any husband particularly someone elses snapped georgie guy had been twitchy all evening because wretched flora had pinched the car without asking and there was no way he could escape they worked in the kitchen because it was warm by the aga and by the time theyd gone through the script and toned down rachels worst excesses rannaldini had drunk enough red wine to risk dropping in on her on the way home he had just picked up his car keys when flora walked in she betrayed no trace of surprise at seeing him her red hair darkened by snow had grown since last summer a thick strand had blown round her white neck like a leather strap she was wearing a black leather jacket over a gunmetalgrey satin camisole top and black velvet shorts above blackstockinged legs that had lost any trace of puppy fat we were worried about you darling said georgie the roads must be hell was it a good party great flora crouched down beside dinsdale giving him a crumbling sausage roll out of her pocket ask next time you borrow the car said guy angrily i can now get some more red weve got some said georgie theres a crate in the utility room guy jumped as the telephone rang ill take it next door said flora running across the hall into the drawing room to answer it there was something stark and unwelcoming about her parents house not a coloured ball nor a string of tinsel yet in sight hearing the happy tennysons brook sound of continuous laughter guy reflected that at least he wasnt paying for the call its melanie said flora a quarter of an hour later then smiling sweetly at her father shes reversing the charges from a perth callbox somehow guy kept his temper and when georgie rushed off and because rannaldini showed no sign suddenly of leaving he went off to get another bottle bidding a tearful farewell to her adored elder daughter five minutes later georgie noticed the copy of catullus david hawkley had sent her and pulled it out of the bookshelf it is hard to put aside longstanding love she read sadly if only she could see david he was so straight compared with guy a bad sleeper hed probably be awake now his number was engraved on her heart surreptitiously she picked up the second telephone and heard guys voice saying i couldnt get away ju ju flora took the car without asking and georgie suddenly remembered a crate of booze so i had no excuse i darent risk it sweetheart im really sorry ill ring you first thing sleep well my darling which is more than youre fucking going to do screamed georgie down the telephone im sorry i didnt speak to you this afternoon little one murmured rannaldini you sing very well wailing for my demon lover said flora drily outside rannaldini could see the dark snowless shadow under his car and the ostrichs white feathers fluffing up through the gloom a light still shone in rachels cottage he had a vision of rachel in bed with flora languorously smoothing oil into each others bodies growing increasingly slippery inside and out as they waited for him to join in i mees you he said softly wheech is your room out in the hall under the mistletoe she had put up that morning flora could see her parents furiously mouthing at one another oh maestro she said in a tremulous voice i thought you would never forgive me ees good for little girls to be punished sometime i deserved it flora admitted if you go up the stairs and turn left im the fourth door on the right up three small stairs but dont turn on the light as it shines right into mummys and daddys room dont be too long she slid out of the room rannaldini could not keep the grin off his face he felt sure rupert campbellblack couldnt pull seventeen year olds any more as guy bustled in his face redder than the bottle of claret he was carrying rannaldini yawned and said it must be jet lag could he borrow a toothbrush and crash out in the spare room once alone he had a quick wash plucked out a grey hair from his chest rubbed one of the samples of eaudecologne guy had brought back from france into his neck and shoulders and waited half an hour until the house was so quiet you could hear the snow padding like a white cat outside clad in a dark red towel scratchy from mother courages washing he tiptoed along the landing the creaking was awful he jumped as dinsdale in his basket let out a great snore one two three doors rannaldini thought he would explode with lust feeling his way up the three uncarpeted stairs with his bare toes he opened and softly closed the fourth door on the right come to me lovely creature whispered a voice leetle darling it is i answered rannaldini taking a flying leap in the direction of the voice he found that flora had shrunk and grown in the most improbable places next moment he realized his arms were full of naked guy whod been banished to the spare room by an enraged georgie and whod been drunkenly rehearsing his lines guy was sober enough however to be extremely stuffy floras only seventeen how dare you run after schoolgirls like a dirty old man and i saw you coming out of langans with that painter girlfriend of yours on monday spat back rannaldini id keep your trap shut if i were you both rannaldini and guy were furious with flora but had little opportunity to vent their rage on the day of the play members of the cast however continued to spat cecilia in her new role as gabriel had gone off to valentino and bought a seductive but totally inappropriate thighlength gold tunic and an even bigger halo than hermione in revenge hermione spent two hours in makeup leaving little time for anyone else marigold cried all day because larry hadnt come home the previous night he must have gone back to nikki rachel was totally unsympathetic if you have a remotely attractive husband in the nineties she snapped as she buttoned up her second kings velvet tunic you have to be prepared to share him rock star you are the rock the star that guides me sang the wireless shut up you bloody thing screamed georgie but by sixthirty the great hall was decked with greenery and hundreds of candles and camera lights were reflected in the gleaming dark panelling the crew were ready the london met tuned up a vetted collection of villagers a sprinkling of local gentry including lady chisleden the odd talent scout and a crowd of merediths gay friends were among the audience mother courage thrilled at the prospect of appearing on television was holding forth noisily rattledicky stayed the night and guy was furious that flora delapidated herself all over the bath and i only cleaned it yesterday and melanies sending georgie a duckbilled platitude for christmas standing in the wings all dolled up in his red plumes and gemmy bridle arthur was itching to get on stage dont forget to look at the camera lysander urged him and whenever you see rupert wave a hoof im really nervous for him he told cameron cook as arthur rested his head lovingly on his masters shoulder ever thought of becoming an actor asked cameron handing him her card dyou mind sitting in the audience when it starts marigold can look after arthur she was determined to get reaction shots of him whenever they cut to the audience dyou actually know rupert pleaded lysander you could say that is he seriously wonderful cameron thought for a second only if he likes you for christs sake see all the telephones are switched off she added to her pa as her mobile rang bloody hell she whispered to the chief cameraman two minutes later ruperts not coming hes buggered off skiing well dont tell anyone whispered back the chief cameraman we dont want the entire female cast going on strike but at last the cameras were rolling and the london met were appropriately playing like angels enjoying the novelty of the occasion and the relief of being conducted by bob whose bald head gleamed like a bathing cap above the dark river of the orchestra pit everything in fact was going wonderfully neither hermione in her blue robes nor cecilia in her figurehugging mini would have looked so radiant if they had known rupert wasnt going to make it even for brickies spread which included two vats of boeuf bourgignon whose delicious smell was stealing up from the kitchen hail mary full of grace called cecilia who preferred the beauty of the old language thou art with child joseph will be very supportive and present at the birth said hermione who did not kitty caught lysanders eye and giggled theres a christmas tree with nothing on said mother courage as the curtains jerked back on the stable at bethlehem the play was nearing its end although the shepherds and inn staff had been rather too reminiscent of iraqi and saudi agitators in the gulf merediths gay cronies were in ecstasies over the sets and the beauty of little cosmo as a shepherd boy unaccountably trying to strangle hermiones white cat the animals had all behaved impeccably except dinsdale who had lifted his leg twice on the manger flora had sung o come all ye faithful and o little town of bethlehem so magically that she had earned a round of applause each time but the real coup de théâtre was when rannaldini rachel and marigold singing the most ravishing threepart arrangement of we three kings cantered in on their splendid bejewelled horses rannaldini and rachel looked so glamorous that the audience hardly noticed the reddened eyes and streaked moustache of the third king whom arthur carried with such sympathy and gentleness look at the old boy really acting said lysander proudly dont look at the camera arthur will you be quiet hissed lady chisleden the prince of darkness whod had a good win at lingfield the previous week was jumping all over the place as rannaldini perfectly capped teeth flashing above his black beard bent down to hand hermione a gold casket bet hermione pockets it whispered lysander id give that prince of darkness a wild berth if i was er said mother courage as everyone lined up to gaze at the virgin and child hermione brandished a large breast in the direction she imagined rupert to be sitting wasted on us chorused merediths cronies in unison as the kings remounted their horses flora hovering in the wings noticed rachel shoot rannaldini a smile of uncharacteristic lasciviousness for the final tableau flora came forward to sing once in royal davids city she was wearing black jeans and a black poloneck with her hair slicked back off her incredibly pale face playing death and the maiden thought bob raising his baton the poor child looked extraordinarily bleak the orchestra gave her the introductory bars then put down their instruments in anticipation of a treat guy folded his arms happy to claim ownership when flora brought him credit for a second she glanced around waiting for total silence her voice cool as an icicle was so exquisite it was several seconds before anyone took in the words once in rannaldinis watchtower sang flora stood a kingsize double bed where the maestro bonked hermione once her chanel suits shed shed horror amazement and delighted expectation were slowly creeping over the faces of the audience the leader of the orchestra put his head in his hands to hide his laughter stay on camera two for christs sake hissed cameron cook rannaldini drove her wild little cosmo is his child sang flora emphasizing every word and through cosmos wondrous childhood a beatific smile spread over floras face maestro popped in every day just to bonk the fair hermione in whose hulking arms he lay and he bonked his exwife too rachel grants just joined the queue laughing himself sick then suddenly noticing the distress on kittys face lysander took her hand warming it with both his own the otherwise mesmerized paralysis of the entire room was broken by an animal howl of rage from rannaldini cut for christs sake cut this so overwhelmed the overbred prince of darkness that he crapped all over the stage whereupon jack whod been licking his chops took off after hermiones cat followed by an hysterically barking maggie dinsdale and tabloid hermione opened her mouth and screamed and screamed arthur who loved babies as much as hay shuffled forward to inspect the manger and was just about to nudge baby jesus when the harrods doll was snatched up by cecilia halo askew scellerato she yelled laying into rannaldini with it oh sighed a visiting talent scout from virgin records consulting his programme flora seymour has the most beautiful voice i have ever heard as everyone started yelling at flora she burst into tears please dont cry running forward kitty clambered clumsily on to the stage putting her arms round flora and with lysanders and bobs help carried her out through the wings up the steps into the summer parlour where she collapsed on to the blue and white striped sofa on which she had first scorned rannaldinis advances you spoilt our nativity play shouted guy rushing in tearing off josephs headdress then turning to georgie who had followed him now see where your sloppy permissive attitude has led next minute they were joined by meredith and his twittering cronies who swooped on flora trying to comfort her when rannaldini stalked in his face incandescent with rage you bitch he screamed are you talking to us chorused merediths cronies staggering to her feet flora lurched towards rannaldini youre drunk he snarled no pregnant said flora tonelessly and youre the father thats not true screamed natasha how could you flora you lying slut hissed rannaldini how dare you tell such fucking lies its true sobbed flora calmly rannaldini walked over to the telephone get me james bensons number he called over his shoulder to kitty hell soon do a few tests to see whos right kitty paused she knew james bensons number by heart having rung him so often about her own tests but she suddenly felt so sorry for flora as if reading her thoughts flora slumped at rannaldinis feet sobbing that shed made the whole thing up clinging hysterically to his purplestockinged thighs i love you she wept i cant help myself im so sorry kitty its all my fault and youve broken the official secrets act hissed rannaldini viciously wriggling out of her frantic clutches as though she were a pair of tight breeches he seemed oblivious of the crowd around them you should have cut my vocal chords at the beginning said flora falling pitifully to the floor kitty rushing forward to comfort her was almost pushed sideways by georgie oh darling im sorry ive neglected you ive been so worried about work and everything its not your fault lets go home utterly appalled that shed been too locked in over guys philandering and the loss of david hawkley to notice what was going on she started to cry its all your fault you bastard she sobbed at rannaldini guy was longing to castigate rannaldini too but didnt dare in case rannaldini shopped him about julia instead he proceeded to vent his fury on flora look how youve upset your mother not nearly as much as youve upset her screamed back flora shed never have gone to bed with lysander if you hadnt been carrying on with julia all this time dear dear said meredith looking from a speechless georgie to a flabbergasted guy turnbull asser are going to do a roaring trade in hair shirts this christmas very very reluctantly and only because rannaldini threatened to close all the electric gates and doors and imprison them venturer signed a hastily typedout agreement that they would cut floras outburst if rupert hadnt fucked off skiing we couldve made a fight for it said cameron furiously the kings just mounting their horses make a shitty ending very shitty in the prince of darkness case giggled meredith whos talking of endings said rannaldini admiring camerons snarling sexy face lets have dinner in the new year now bugger off everyone if anyone was more distraught than poor flora that evening it was marigold who didnt seem to have taken in any of the dramas all that mattered was that larry hadnt turned up she refused to join meredith his friends various euphoric members of the london met most of the crew and ferdie and lysander in the pearly gates for a pissed mortem as he first had to box arthur back and feed him lysander insisted ferdie drive marigold home ay wish they made husbands laike you arthur marigold said having sobbed off most of her stage makeup into his grey shoulder as they trooped out into the snow they passed hermione completely oblivious that little cosmo whod been at kittys sweet sherry was systematically removing tenners from her bag she was screeching how dare flora call my arms hulking i think the virgin marys suffering from postnatal depression muttered ferdie and what happened to rupert campbellblack demanded hermione id forgotten about him said lysander in dismay as he helped marigold into the car i so wanted him to meet arthur look after her he urged in an undertone as he shut the door against the swirling snow shes worried sick not as worried sick as i am said ferdie scooping up a ball of snow from the top of the car and hurling it at a departing harpist larry or rather marigold owes us thirty thousand pounds forget it said lysander you dont think rannaldini will take it out on kitty do you i didnt get a chance to say goodnight to her promise to go into the house with marigold and see shes ok even ferdie couldnt bring himself to talk finance to such a shuddering desolate wreck ahead through a snowy tunnel of bowed trees paradise grange reared up darkly its great battlements and turrets lit by the wannest of moons since rachel moved in the laights have been goin out all over paradise said marigold sadly aym sure larry gave her that lovely cashmere jumper rachels being bonked by rannaldini said ferdie gently your husbands far too deeply into filthy consumerism to appeal to rachel arent you going to ask me in for a drink he added you shouldnt be on your own ive obviously got to get used to it said marigold she had got through the performance all she wanted to do was crash out in her lonely bed and sob out her broken heart she was amazed to find the front door open she was so off the wall she must have forgotten to put on the burglar alarm when she left that morning as she put down her costume in its carrier bag her gold crown fell on to the floor a symbol that her ritzy life had gone for ever catching sight of her blackened redeyed miners face she went into the downstairs and washed away the streaked mascara and the remains of her cork moustache now wanner than the moon itself she switched on the drawingroom light and gave a scream for there slumped on the sofa was larry he looked utterly wretched he was neatly dressed in a white shirt and a pinstriped suit only his face was unironed and rumpled marigold wanted to yell at him for not showing up for humiliating her for being unfaithful like everyone else in paradise but the words withered on her white lips i tried to grapple back up the tree said larry as though they were in the middle of a conversation but it was like using fungi as andholds they kept givin way as he put his head in his hands she noticed all his gold rings and the bracelets had gone and how grey his dark hair had become i dont know ow to tell you princess but im finished up the spout he croaked i guaranteed a big electronics project borrowed a uge amount of money used some of catchitunes assets as well an it bombed the banks pulled the plug im ruined skint he tugged his empty pockets out of his trousers like a conjurer i didnt want to worry you he gave a groan ive been trying to raise the dough from everywhere but there isnt any about as marigold opened her mouth to speak he put up his hand but i cant blame the recession i was greedy an this afternoon they voted me off the board they cant have said marigold aghast so im broke bellyup ive got nuffink marigold couldnt speak the lump in her throat was so huge the tidal wave of tears ready to smash the lock gates as larry hung his head i understand if you want to leave me princess oh larry larry ay thought youd gone back to nikki incredulously larry looked up all those phone calls sobbed marigold an youve lost so much weight and never turning up to rehearsals she moved towards him with her arms open ay dont mind where ay live so long as its with you ay never really läiked this mansion its a naightmare to clean and ayve never felt comfortable with servants and the boys will be delaighted to leave boardingschool and weve got enough food in the freezer to live on for ever you dont mean it youll stand by me ow princess ow princess oh larry larry said marigold crying and laughing all at once as she flung herself into his arms ay love you so much ayd follow you to the hend of the earth as president gorbachov kept going abroad to distance himself from the growing domestic crises in russia so rannaldini abandoned all thought of christmas at valhalla he knew venturer still had the clip of once in royal davids city and that he couldnt silence blabbermouths like mother courage and lady chisleden harassed by enraged mistresses and a baying press rannaldini decided as a gesture of family solidarity to take kitty and his many children skiing and made sure that a delightful photograph of them all arriving at the airport was circulated worldwide lysander felt sick when he saw it reproduced on the front of the sun he had been appalled the morning after the play to find valhalla deserted except for mrs brimscombe who was sourly freezing boeuf bourgignon and who handed him a christmas present from kitty beautifully wrapped in red paper covered in polo ponies inside were chewsticks for the dogs twix bars for arthur and tiny and a dark blue jersey with donald duck on the front which kitty had knitted for him a card enclosed said dear lysander this is to thank you for your many kindnesses i hope you dont miss your mum and georgie too much over xmas yours sincerely kitty rannaldini lysander was utterly desolate earlier in december kitty had given him an advent calendar now he felt all the doors were closing on him returning to magpie cottage he found ferdie bemoaning his excesses the night before in the pearly gates and examining a green tongue in the mirror on the strength of his success as the innkeeper he had managed to score with miss paradise the barmaid i told her i was off to the gulf too thats bloody dishonest shes a nice girl whats bitten you said ferdie in amazement rannaldinis taken kitty skiing that is terrific said ferdie i have to congratulate you i never dreamt youd get kitty looking that good almost attractive in that green dress the other night and to get rannaldini back as well hes never taken her on holiday before im going to give you a massive christmas bonus he added as lysanders face blackened youre off to brazil bastard coffee billionaire giving his ravishing young wife the runaround heres the ticket ferdie reached for his brief case i dont want to go to brazil said lysander mutinously youll get some seriously good polo after christmas in the extremely fashionable french ski resort of monthaut acquiring a suntan and being photographed on every piste surrounded by children rannaldini was bored rigid and decided to fly home christmas like the snow had temporarily blotted out all gossip natasha left with him to shake her out of her shock at his affaire with flora he despatched her to barbados for a holiday kitty got no such compensation she was to stay on in monthaut over the new year to keep an eye on rannaldinis children and the au pair who was very pretty and expected to go out skiing and clubbing in the evenings leaving kitty in charge at no time had rannaldini apologized in any way for floras revelations wearily kitty drove back from dropping him off at the airport rannaldini had been particularly ratty over christmas in her distress at not being able to say goodbye to lysander kitty had left several scores and clothes that he needed in valhalla although she felt he would have complained whatever she had picked she was desperately short of clothes herself she hadnt brought anything for the evening no ski clothes and no boots for walking on the polished ice so as rannaldini loathed her spending money the drive to the airport was her first outing even with chains on the wheels she had been terrified of the winding treacherous roads she felt safer when she reached monthaut horses with bells jangling on their bridles which reminded her of arthur were pulling sledgefuls of tourists along the high street beautiful girls with vivid brown faces and enviably narrow hips strode purposefully over the frozen pavements the hotel versailles where rannaldini always stayed was the best in monthaut southfacing yellowstoned overlooking the village square with its statue of president de gaulle and a wonderful view of the mountains it was two minutes walk from the main ski lifts snow and icicles glittering from the gables were melting slightly in the sunshine as kitty crept in through the swing doors every table in the foyer was occupied by glamorous chattering sunburnt people it was several seconds before she recognized the most glamorous of them all he was wearing a donald duck jersey and knocked over his glass of kir as he jumped to his feet lysander whispered kitty her delight was so unmistakable that lysander nearly kissed her properly but as she ducked her head in embarrassment he made do with hugging her i fort you was in brazil i got bored and i missed you im going to teach you to ski i avent got any gear ill buy you some i havent given you a christmas present thank you for the donald duck he looked down hes the best present ive ever had i hope he doesnt have to go into quarantine when we go back to england tucking his arm through hers as he led her towards the lift he asked her if she had been given anything nice rannaldini gave me a filing cabinet and hermione some chopstick olders kitty giggled an a red sloppy jumper big enough for a helephant i know you like them baggy kitty ooo i am appy to see you lysander feeling dreadfully guilty about abandoning rannaldinis children to the sulky au pair and feeling embarrassingly ostentatious in a limegreen violet harebellblue and shocking pink ski suit i look like a rinebow ippo kitty took to the slopes you must have lots of protection said lysander rubbing ambre solaire into her pink cheeks and painting her mouth with mauve lipsalve before dropping a kiss on her squashed nose he was looking very flash in a tight daffodilyellow bomber jacket and ski pants and a kingfisherblue sweat band keeping his curls out of his eyes which were covered with black wraparound glasses hed streaked his face and his beautiful big mouth with different coloured lipsalves like an apache behind him dazzling white peaks reared up against a sapphire sky chalet girls pas from knightsbridge glamorous divorcées on the prowl au pairs whod escaped gazed at him in wonder i feel like a newborn foal wiv a banana skin attached to each hoof protested kitty ooooh im going to fall over again no youre not encouraged lysander stand on the edge of your skis thats right now lean forward sticks behind sticks behind dont cross them well done kitty weeee i can do it kitty got so carried away she skiied several yards ow my legs are going elp elp soon her suit of many colours was covered with snow it was true what they said about the mountains making you feel all tingly and excited all her tiredness had vanished lysander had taken her to a comparatively deserted slope and such was his total preoccupation with teaching her and his growing awareness of the delicious curves of her body since shed lost all that weight that neither of them realized that the snow around them had been invaded by photographers and reporters sliding all over the place gabbling into telephones and tape recorders for a horrific moment kitty thought they were on to her and lysander but they were all gazing up the mountain hes on his way down announced a reporter from the daily mail switching off his telephone james whittaker says the kids got a strong american accent so rupert must have got it from texas said a predatory blonde i thought he and taggie were going to adopt from bogota probably decided he wanted something more aryan evidently the kids the spitting image of rupert its amazing how these adoption societies match them up they must have got it very quickly taggies miscarriage was only a few weeks ago said the sun photographer could be an illegit of ruperts hes trying to palm off on taggie suggested the predatory blonde oh beattie you would think that taggie looked miserable last night and she hasnt skiied since shes been out here said beattie johnson of the scorpion shirtily shes just lost a baby stupid if it is ruperts beattie was not to be deflected it means that he has been unfaithful to taggie because nigel says the kid cant be a day over three and hes been married to taggie nearly six years hush here they come the worlds press adjusted their long lenses and switched on their tape recorders as a very blond child in huge dark glasses and a striped blue and white ski suit came whistling down the slope for a second it looked as though he was going slap into an elderly american in fuschiapink who was gingerly picking herself up move your ass grandma yelled the child as he shot past come back eddie for christs sake yelled a voice loud enough to start an avalanche and over the white brow of the slope like a shiver of lightning came a tall man in faded jeans and a thick dark grey jersey slithering to a spectacular halt beside the child he hid them both for a moment in a fountain of snow as they emerged lysander took in the smooth brown forehead the thick gleaming blond hair the beautiful greek nose thrown into relief by the dark glasses and the curling mouth now set like a trap rupert campbellblack he whispered to kitty in wonder just think i come here to see you and hes here as well oh kitty isnt he handsome i fort taggied just had a miscarriage they must have adopted this one isnt he sweet dont you run away from me like that you little sod yelled rupert and you can all fuck off he added as the press closed in with a frenzied clicking of cameras where you get him from rupe demanded the express whats your name darling asked beattie johnson edward bartholomew alderton said the child politely then turning to rupert move your ass grandpa im starved as the howls of laughter subsided and rupert disappeared in a towering rage beattie johnson could be heard saying of course hes perditas child whos she asked paris match whereve you been for the last four years said beattie as they trooped back to their hotels to file copy one of ruperts illegits thats why her kids the spittin image of him she married an american polo player called luke alderton fancy rupert being a grandad said the mirror not very good for his superstud image said beattie in amusement i wonder if i can get grandfather cock into the copy sitting in the bar at the hotel versailles watching the mountains turn from rosepink to glittering electricblue as the gold lights came on in the village square rupert ignored his beautiful wife taggie drank whisky as brown as his face in a mood as black as his name he was trying not to lose his temper with mr pandopoulos the rich greek owner whod flown in specially to complain that his best horse hadnt even been placed in a big race that afternoon in the past rupert had notched up more conquests than don giovanni the press deeply sceptical about his apparent fidelity to taggie were determined to catch him out the scorpion employed two reporters whose sole job was to tail him night and day their last scoop had indeed been four and a half years ago when the tempestuous perdita macleod englands best woman polo player had turned out to be ruperts daughter after passionate initial antagonism rupert had eventually recognized her as his child and given her considerable emotional and financial support since then the paparazzi had had nothing to go on following him warily aware that rupert was rich enough to sue them witless if they stepped out of line but a scoop in the daily express about taggies heartbreak over the miscarriage had triggered all the speculation off again apart from the loss of the baby which had affected him just as badly as taggie rupert had had a pulverizing year even successful ownertrainers had been stymied by the recession ruperts yearlings didnt automatically fetch six figures any more for the first time he was having to put up with indifferent horses if the owner was rich enough to pay for them hence the postmortem today as a founder director of venturer television he should have made a killing but advertising was right down and theyd been forced to layoff staff nor were his three children giving him much joy marcus who was at bagley hall with flora was a wimp whose only ambition egged on by his mother ruperts first wife was to be a concert pianist tabitha with whom rupert had enjoyed an adoring almost too symbiotic relationship had suddenly turned into a brat who questioned ruperts every decision and attitude and who had recently at the age of fourteen fallen madly in love with ruperts tractordriver removed out of temptation to monthaut she had sulked so badly that rupert in a rage had packed her off home to her mother finally perdita with whom rupert had an erratic relationship only her husband luke could really handle her had added a last straw heavier than a crowbar his wife taggie though young enough to be his fourth child adored him and longed to have his children after an almost fatal miscarriage early on in their marriage when she had been told she couldnt have children she had endured several painful and disappointing attempts to have a testtube baby finally getting pregnant to universal rejoicing in august at four months she had had a ghastly and inexplicable miscarriage nothing in the world would bring back the baby dismissing ruperts anguished protestations that he must be bringing taggie bad luck james benson who was also ruperts family doctor told him to take taggie away for a holiday and then go to south america or texas or even romania and adopt there are plenty of babies if you wave your cheque book having endured innumerable sleepless nights worrying about taggie rupert was desperately in need of a break himself a dashing skier all his life the mountains always recharged his batteries and taggie would get brown and strong again then all had been sabotaged by perdita ringing taggie from palm beach she had deliberately chosen the moment just before christmas when rupert was in ireland announcing that it was high time he and taggie got to know their grandchild she asked if she could dump little eddie on them for a fortnight while she and luke flew to kenya to play polo its the chance of a lifetime taggie she had begged all expenses paid luke and i have been working our asses off keeping the barn and the ponies going the recessions been far worse in america we really need to spend some time together and sweet gentle taggie of course had agreed and rupert had returned from ireland to find little eddie in situ totally american utterly adorable but as selfwilled as his grandfather who never stopped asking when mom and dad were coming back outraged with perdita for lumbering taggie with a child when shed just lost her own rupert had promptly employed a french girl to look after eddie but infuriatingly and stubbornly taggie had insisted on caring for him herself getting up in the night whenever he cried even allowing him to come into their bed so there had been no holiday and even less sex he had taken eddie skiing to give taggie a break and the little sod who had learnt to ski before he could crawl had given rupert the slip and showed him up as a grandfather in front of the entire world press the misconstruction industry as he always called them rupert actually liked his new grandchild he knew it was desperately uncool to mind about being a grandfather or even worse to go round saying that he had only been eighteen when perdita had been conceived but at the moment he felt a failure as a grandfather a father a husband and a trainer particularly with mr pandopoulos bellyaching beside him most of all rupert despised himself for biting taggies head off yet again because she had allowed his grandchild to wreck their holiday she looked utterly ravishing this evening in a crimson angora jersey and a straight black sequined skirt showing off legs far more beautiful than any tiresome owners colt rupert was about to take her hand and tell her he loved her and was only livid with himself when he noticed a couple at the next table a plain girl whose pink face clashed with her brilliantly coloured ski suit and a miraculously goodlooking boy whose clear blueygreen eyes were unashamedly gazing in his direction rupert was quite used to admiration from his own sex but the boy didnt look gay so he must be after taggie hardly surprising if one was lumbered with a dog like that five minutes later when kitty went upstairs to read a bedtime story to rannaldinis children lysander paid the bill for arthurs sake he must do it now knees knocking mouth dry unaware of every woman gazing at him hungrily he approached his great hero looking down at the wonderful chiselled features the cold lapislazuli eyes he wanted to give rupert some amazing present to kneel down and kiss his hand instead he stammered excuse me i hope you dont mind my butting in if youre a journalist piss off snapped rupert oh no no no im absolutely not my names lysander hawkley ruperts eyes narrowed in halfrecognition basically i live in paradise went on lysander id hoped to meet you last week at the valhalla nativity play rupert looked fractionally more friendly we were hoping to go said taggie feeling horribly sorry for the poor boy do sit down for a minute and tell us about it she winced as rupert kicked her on the ankle thank you lysander beamed at taggie and nearly knocked over the water jug in his efforts to appear calm i gather georgie maguires daughter last seen throwing up into a trumpet at bagley hall went berserk and listed rannaldinis mistresses said rupert lightly roberto rannaldini this is one of your nine lives cameron said it was seriously funny not for kitty said lysander quickly kitty rannaldinis wife said lysander proudly she was with me just now ah the penny was beginning to drop this must be the boy that cameron had been raving about weve got to sign him up rupert hes to die for what part did you play asked taggie aware of the menace of ruperts mood oh i just shifted scenery but my horse arthur carried the third king he was seriously good in the part but that was only a sideline its arthur i wanted to tell you about he looked at rupert fair and square after five minutes he realized that rupert was yawning and tapping long fingers on the table sorry im talking too much i wouldnt argue with that he sounds really sweet said taggie quickly wishing rupert wouldnt be so vile comforted lysander turned to her god she was lovely with all that cloudy dark hair and her soft pink mouth and her kind silverygrey eyes and sweet shy face youre so much prettier than your picture in the express he stammered and we saw your little boy hes adorable hell be skiing for america soon and he looks just like you odd said rupert coldly hes no relation of tags hes my grandchild thats torn it thought lysander i know it sounds crass he stumbled on but you dont look anything like old enough to be a grandfather little bastard patronizing me thought rupert he doesnt does he taggie put a hand over ruperts clenched one eddies parents are playing polo in kenya so were looking after him for a few days good practice because were hoping to adopt our own baby from south america soon rupert was looking thunderous he didnt like taggie discussing their private life the boy could easily be stringing for the scorpion i spent christmas in south america brazil actually lysander told taggie in an incredible house with a swimmingpool and a polo field running into the sea at one end and the mountains at the other we were drinking on the terrace one evening and i pointed out that the mountain was dotted with stars gina my hostess just laughed your stars are lights from the shacks of the poor she said dont ever grumble about being rich thats really sad said taggie isnt it i thought what the hell am i doing here rupert yawned pointedly one might ask the same question rupert reproved taggie flushing lysander jumped to his feet im really sorry suddenly rupert twigged this must be the boy who had cut such a swathe through the paradise wives there was no way he was leaving him on the loose to run after taggie how well dyou ski he asked lysander ok im a bit rusty ill take you offpiste tomorrow if you like down the chute des fantômes chute denfer descente des diables its got a lot of names we could stop for lunch on the way down and talk about arthur thats seriously kind ill pick you up about ninethirty then lysander went up to his room to find lots of messages then he hung up on georgie because he was still furious with her next marigold rang scolding him for staying out there rannaldinis back in england he doesnt need rattling any more weve got to talk lysander but he had hung up ferdie was even more disapproving why the hell arent you in brazil thats a half a million pound deal he shouted go and sell some more houses snapped lysander the markets dead ginas just called shes hopping you walked out and martha rang remember martha your first success she needs a refresher course because elmers straying again you can go on to florida from brazil gina said it was working fine when you buggered off and office parties at christmas have triggered off lots of unfaithful husbands who need bringing to heel when you get back from marthas loadsamoney boy im not interested this is a partnership said ferdie angrily ive worked my ass off for you i deserve my cut theres no way youll be able to hold down any other job earning this kind of money remember the mess you were in this time last year and you dont want to take on rannaldini hes a dangerous bugger you wont have any kneecaps left and kittys sweet but frankly shes not the right class and certainly not good looking enough you shouldnt be giving her ideas youre always grumbling i never have any and shut up about kitty ill ring you when youre in a better mood outside it had started to snow whitely blurring the gold lamps and windows lighting the town square wrapping the church spire in cotton wool realizing he hadnt been to sleep for fortyeight hours and in need of kittys cheerful company lysander wandered off to the vast president de gaulle suite which rannaldini had taken for his holiday he found her plumping the cushions of a huge dark green velvet sofa and in floods of tears he was appalled the only time hed seen kitty cry was after the tennis tournament when shed discovered she wasnt pregnant perhaps shed just got the curse again hell hed been hoping to get her into bed that evening then he felt furious with himself for being selfish oh lysander im in such a muddle lysander was about to take her in his arms when the telephone rang it was rannaldini in a rage because kitty hadnt cancelled the president de gaulle suite why after hed left should she live in the style befitting a great maestro im sorry rannaldini well move into other rooms first fing lysander was so angry that kitty was being so placatory that he retreated to the vast bathroom next door gazing stonily at the dewy bank of ferns and the red velvet steps leading up to a raspberrypink jacuzzi big enough to accommodate an entire string quartet and the bastard wanted to move kitty into some pokey little hole he was tempted to pick up the telephone and join in the row instead despite kittys frantic waving he pulled the chain noisily and then turned up the television some french rock band far too loud whats that noise asked rannaldini sharply nothing one of the children stammered kitty over the din they should be in bed lysander had sulkily eaten all the strawberries in the fruit bowl and was starting on the nectarines when kitty put down the receiver how dare you make all that noise she said furiously lysander looked up in amazement kitty you can actually be cross and like a bullet between the eyes he realized that he was in love with her i just hate you being so nice to him he mumbled wiping his hands on his jeans he pulled her towards him despite her wriggling away like a piglet he kissed her and she tasted so clean and sweet and her young skin smelt so like a wild rose that he went on kissing her until the wriggling stopped i havent got any knees left catching her off balance he pulled her down on to the green velvet sofa and kissing her again began to explore her body beneath a dress drenched by the childrens bath water he discovered wonderfully full bouncy breasts and a waist no longer belted by spare tyres oh kitty im mad about you then the wriggling started again you dont have to be nice to me sobbed kitty just to rattle rannaldini and give me a sheen this had nothing to do with rannaldini it was lysanders turn to be outraged trapping her face between his hands he forced her to look at him im doing this because i cant not i love you kitty it crept up on me in brazil i was kittysick not homesick from now on youre where i belong then seeing her utter amazement youre as irresistible as cambozola youre he snapped his fingers trying to be really poetic as comforting as a baked potato full of butter on sunday night asasas welcome as a glass of cold water in the middle of the night when the hams been too salty oh kitty i cant say clever things but i want to be the hotwater bottle that melts your frozen heart oh blimey kitty was fighting back the tears as she gazed up at him youre so andsome you oughta be on every mills and boon jacket but the girls the eroes gaze at dont look anyfink like me now it was lysanders turn to grit his jaw of course they dont theyre pretty he ran his hand wonderingly over her blushing squashed little face but youre beautiful and youre beautiful inside too like arthur realizing how huge a compliment this was kitty managed not to laugh encouraged lysander suggested they romp in the jacuzzi but kittys face clouded over we shouldnt im married dont be ridiculous lysander only just stopped himself cataloguing rannaldinis women anyway it was so lovely kissin you sighed kitty i couldnt stop thats the general idea lysander began to unbutton her dress then seeing her apprehension lets discuss it over dinner go and change he yawned i love you kitty but when she came out jet lag had overtaken him he was slumped fast asleep on the sofa red juice running down his chin a halfeaten pomegranate on the floor good night suite prince murmured kitty who had done hamlet at school wrapping her duvet round him she was going to allow herself the luxury of watching him all night at dawn she drifted into a heavy sleep in her armchair and was woken by the telephone she remembered the clipped contemptuous drawl from rannaldinis answering machine i thought lysander was coming offpiste with me said rupert the fact that lysander was apologizing sleepily on the same telephone a few seconds later did nothing to assuage ruperts suspicions lysander could use the money kitty paid him as a gigolo to run after taggie where are you going asked kitty feeding lysander croissant spread with apricot jam as he groggily tugged on his yellow ski pants somewhere he called chute des fantômes shoot to kill i dunno ill ski down as fast as i can at least i can bend ruperts ear about arthur it had snowed heavily in the night blotting out yesterdays footprints and ski tracks putting five inches on the parked cars and president de gaulles cap in the town square glancing out of the window kitty saw ruperts dark blue mercedes draw up getting out he looked as chill and menacing as the day suddenly kitty was frightened please be careful she said brushing crumbs off lysanders chin and handing him his sweat band gazing down a cliff face steep as a lift shaft threequarters of an hour later lysander wondered why the hell hed come deliberately sitting two seats away from lysander in the helicopter on the way up rupert hadnt spoken a word the puttygrey skies liverishly tinged with yellow presaged further heavy snow a howling blizzard chucked glass splinters in their faces below the skein of ski runs and the fir trees herringboning the side of the valley blurred as the visibility grew worse far far down the houses of the village one of them containing darling kitty lay like ants on the snow lysanders yellow ski clothes were the only note of colour in the blackandwhite magpie landscape ruperts slit eyes through his dark glasses were anything but friendly ok he asked lysander lysander nodded teeth chattering far more from terror than the bitter cold ill lead the way and rupert was off hissing down the valley like a falling meteor hidden in a permanent spray of snow i love you kitty shouted lysander to the whirling snowflakes dear god take me back safe to her and he was off careering after rupert crouched like a jockey so low over his skis that his hands were higher than his face furiously stabbing with his poles as he tried to recapture his old skill and adjust to the rhythm within seconds as lysander streaked past him rupert realized he was outclassed although once almost olympic standard he was now nearly twenty years older and lacked the boys suppleness extreme fitness and splitsecond timing rupert really had to force himself to keep up and all the time was aware of going far too fast as trees rushed to meet him and crevasses loomed below only by straining every muscle did he avoid catapulting to his death almost more goading was that once in his stride lysander started enjoying himself showing off his miraculous control by going into a series of long bounding jumps like a lurcher trying to see over the barley each time landing perfectly going so fast round the final bend he lost a ski and carried on with one shooting straight into the bar threequarters of the way down the mountain he was waiting when rupert arrived giggling with nervous hysteria his cheeks flushed his hands round a glass of kir jesus that was hairy i thought the wind was going to pound me to bits thank christ were in one piece i got you a whisky rupert was absolutely furious with himself he might never have seen taggie the children or his dogs again just because he wanted to scare the daffodilyellow pants out of this cocky little sod you come down the ghost valley today asked the barman incredulously putting a bowl of pretzels between them mad englishmen and dogs you know why eet called that lysander shook his head because so many people been keeled at night their ghosts ski down mountain local people no go near it the sun was hot now melting the snow which splodged every fir tree like soap suds rupert clutched his glass of whisky to stop his hand shaking the boys languid beauty his rumpled brown curls his big generous mouth emphasized by white lipsalve his endless legs up on the wooden table only increased ruperts dislike and jealousy not understanding why rupert was looking marginally less friendly than a rattlesnake with a hangover but desperate to placate him lysander said i thought taggie i mean mrs campbellblack was seriously beautiful which is more than can be said for mrs rannaldini refusing to be goaded lysander gazed into his glass mistaking stillness for passivity rupert became almost chatty your hotels dripping with gigolo fodder surely you could have found someone more glamorous than that cow to pick up your bills i appreciate theres a recession on and you have to take what you can get draining his glass rupert waved to the barman to refill their glasses adding to lysander its ok the rest of the runs a doddle im amazed rannaldinis married the drawl was becoming slower and bitchier to such a boot did her face get stuck in a lift door no wonder he doesnt let her out before sunset still i suppose theres no accounting for lack of taste next minute rupert found himself on his back on the floor of the bar dont ever speak about kitty like that again yelled lysander shes the nicest sweetest loveliest woman ive ever met as rupert fingered his jaw and pondered whether to throw lysander out of the window down the precipice he decided there was no way lysander could be after taggie if he leapt to kittys defence like that after that rupert and lysander skiied down the rest of the mountain and in the course of getting rather drunk together rupert even confessed to his reservations about being a grandfather and cramping taggies style i feel ive stolen her youth but i hate any man that looks at her i wanted to kill you this morning thats ok said lysander id have killed you if youd gone on bitching about kitty or tried to take her off me did you really think i was after taggie you couldnt stop staring at her last night i was staring at you lysander blushed furiously ive always heroworshipped you even more than donald duck look what kitty made me proudly he unzipped his yellow jacket to show off his jersey anyway to go back to you my parents had a terrible row because my father thought i was too young to be allowed to stay up and watch you win your bronze in the middle of the night at colombia how old were you seven gee thanks said rupert wryly swearing rupert to secrecy lysander explained in his confiding way how he had amassed quite a fortune admittedly totally masterminded by ferdie making husbands jealous but now im in love with kitty ive got to find a proper job so i can support her you could be a presenter at venturer said rupert all you have to do is to read an autocue lysander shook his head youre really kind but im dyslexic it takes me all morning to read the runners in the sun or do not disturb notices on hotel bedrooms rupert was touched taggie was dyslexic and he knew what heroic efforts she had made to overcome it what i really want to do is work with horses went on lysander im going to get arthur sound and have one more crack at the rutminster penscombe prides going to win that said rupert but arthur was a good horse i remember him winning in ireland he still gets fan mail and twix bars in the post the sun was setting as rupert dropped lysander off at the hotel versailles the next moment he was knocked sideways by kitty blue with cold and hysterical with worry shooting across the icy pavements into his arms i was so worried you was so long i fort you might have been killed fousands of people ave died in ghost valley and she kissed him over and over again i was so worried rupert took you there deliberately no no hes been wonderful and so are you delighted with her response lysander pulled kitty through the revolving doors kissing her on and on until the porters the receptionists and all the glamorous people grouped round the tables stopped chattering and drinking and gave them a round of applause i should have rung oblivious of the attention they were causing lysander led her towards the lift i didnt mean to frighten you lets go and try out that jacuzzi before i stiffen up in a place that wont let us feel in a life where nothing seems real i have found you i have found you sang lysander tunelessly as he lay in eighteen inches of warm scented churning water soaping kittys breasts as they gently juddered above the surface at first she had been desperately embarrassed because rannaldini had shaved off her pubic hair i was the only person ere for im to sleep wiv she confessed the au pairs father works for le monde so he couldnt risk it lysander hid his anger by saying she looked adorable and more like a little piglet than ever and rannaldini was obviously obsessed with strimming paths to exciting places kitty then said rachel would disapprove of such deforestation and laughed and felt better glancing in the darkened mirrors lining the wall she felt almost beautiful for the first time in her life and put her hand under the water its no good i have stiffened up admitted lysander as his rampant cock reared above the surface its like a periscope said kitty stroking it looking for its target come on rising out of the bath he carried her dripping next door drenching the pink chintz roses as he dropped her gently on to the counterpane of the huge fourposter they didnt bother to draw the curtains outside duckegggreen shadows lay on the snow the stars were brilliant in the clear frosty night the ring of silent blue mountains beyond seemed to protect them i love you murmured lysander as he slowly stroked her pink wet body into a state of ecstasy then as he sat up and drew her between his thighs and slithered inside her aaaah ooo its heaven like the soft pink fingers of a milkmaid squeezing me oh help he wailed i can never hold out if i really fancy someone and i want you more than anyone ever oh god oh help im sorry kitty darling the difference between rannaldini and lysander reflected kitty was that although rannaldini played with her and kept going for hours she always felt he was like a pianist polishing his technique for a big concert which wouldnt be with her with lysander she felt she was the big occasion he had practised for all his life oh kitty he echoed her thoughts ive fucked so many times in my life but this is truly the first time ive ever made love now its my turn to give you pleasure promise to tell me exactly what you like then when she was embarrassed he said i always wanted to be a brickielayer when i grew up and collapsed with such laughter that she joined in too and started to relax afterwards she said truthfully that was ubsolutely mudgic lysunder lets do it all over again at the gallop he said kissing her but if were not going to die of rheumatism we better sleep in one of the other beds im just going to have a pee tottering dizzy with love into the bathroom five minutes later kitty saw that lysander had taken the hideous crimson lipstick cecilia had given her for christmas and scrawled across the mirror kitty is for lyfe not just for kristmass next door a fiveeighth moon with a white wistful nuns face was peering in through the window at the sprawled naked beauty of a waiting lysander running into the room kitty flung herself on him burying her face in his silvery chest all my life she whispered ive longed to have moonlight and someone i loved at the same time i keep wanting to ring mum and tell her how wonderful you are said lysander but as shakespeares lysander pointed out four hundred years before the course of true love never did run smooth the press trailing rupert and clocking everyone who spent time with him took photographs of lysander kissing kitty in the foyer plied with a fat bribe the hotel porter revealed that the president de gaulle suite was now being paid for by a mr l hawkley the picturedesk promptly identified lysander as the man making husbands jealous and kitty from her brief appearance at the airport as rannaldinis wife coming out of the abbey road recording studios with rachel the following evening after theyd recorded the taxing first movement of brahms first piano concerto rannaldini was confronted by a reporter and a photographer mr rannaldini we wondered what you thought about these photographs of your wife in france a swift inspection was enough what paper are you from exploded rannaldini today rannaldini raised his fist youll be from yesterday if youre not careful shoving them furiously aside he dived into the waiting mercedes clive whod had plenty of practice slammed the doors and racing round to the driving seat took off into the night leaving rachel with hardly a penny to get home in monthaut kitty was reading pigling bland to rannaldinis children very slowly so they could understand the english lysander lounged at the end of the bed listening he had always loved the story which his mother had often read him and he thought how alike were kitty and pig wig the little black pig heroine with her double chin and her blueflowered smock how nice if he and kitty could escape to freedom together away from rannaldini over the county boundary he wished he was as noble a character as pigling bland over the hills and far away she danced with pigling bland read kitty closing the book now you must all try and go to sleep as she kissed each of them lysander wandered back into the sitting room and without thinking picked up a ringing telephone whos that yelled rannaldini lysander hung up who was that who answered demanded rannaldini when he rang a second time noone you must have dialled the wrong number shes learning thought lysander but as he sloshed vodka into two glasses he could hear rannaldinis tantrum right across the room and as kitty clumsily replaced the receiver and glared at him in anguish he could hear the slither of magic carpet crashing back to earth ive got to go back its all over the papers so what it doesnt matter were what matters youre natashas boyfriend bullshit i hate her ive never paid her the slightest attention thats rannaldini stirring it and i am is wife you cant stay with him aghast lysander bounded across the room but as he took her in his arms he could feel her distancing hes old and evil he needs me kitty took a tangerine from the fruit bowl and having peeled it threw the pigs into the wastepaper basket and started to eat the peel youre like that spare blanket in the cupboard taking the peel from her lysander shoved a vodka into her shaking hand rannaldini gets you down when hes cold ill look after you kitty we can run over the hills and far away i know you love me her face when he forced it upwards was as pale and filled with longing as last nights moon that was infatuation no it wasnt why did you waste an entire suitcase bringing lassie out here triumphantly lysander pulled a case from under the bed and unearthed the collie hed bought her in harrods toy department kitty went scarlet i fort the kids might like to play wiv her why havent they then ive got to go home tomorrow whispered kitty then im coming with you he wished rupert hadnt flown back to england or he would have enlisted his help to persuade kitty not to return the journey home was crucifixion worse than going back to school worse than his mother dying surrounded by children incensed to be going home four days early aware of the press everywhere kitty and lysander didnt touch each other and exchanged not a word both grey beneath their suntan neither had slept in dutyfree lysander bought a large bottle of diorissimo despite the number of times hed bought it he still pronounced it diorimisso and the girl behind the counter smiled because he was so handsome it was mums favourite scent he said handing it to kitty i want you to wear it because his voice broke because now i love you more even than i loved her after the champagne air and the dazzling white and blue of the mountains heathrow was grey and bitterly cold a vicious wind whipped kittys green dress over her head as she stepped out of the plane she was trembling so badly lysander gave her his coat worst of all the customs men took one look at lysanders polo sticks and the mass of chattering italian children and opening everything finally discovered lassie oh please not whispered kitty funny thing to hide in a suitcase said a brutishlooking customs man i gave it to mrs rannaldini snapped lysander pull the other leg leave it fucking alone dont you get lippy with me sunshine the customs man took out a penknife and with relish plunged it into lassies defenceless fluffy white throat and proceeded slowly to rip her brownandwhite body to bits finally even cutting off her shiny leather nose and gouging out her eyes rannaldinis children were all screaming hysterically lysander thought kitty was going to faint only her desperate pleading stopped him leaping across the table and beating the customs man to a pulp particularly when without a word of apology he handed back lassies remains ill get you another one to replace her and ill get you you bastard lysander was nearly in tears too oh kitty please dont go back to rannaldini lets get a taxi to fountain street out in the airport they went slap into a cauldron of press seething for a story but the ubiquitous clive was waiting to pounce and soon had bundled kitty and the children into a suitably funerealblack limousine and out on to the m rannaldini had had a nasty shock he had never imagined anyone fancying kitty but in the photographs plastered all over today and in the later editions of most of the papers he noticed her gazing up at that winsome little snake with such happiness that she looked almost pretty he felt his publicity getting worse and worse he was sure that shit campbellblack wouldnt be able to resist circulating the pirate version of once in royal davids city he knew he was favourite for the new york job but boris levitskys symphony had just won a prize for the bestorchestral work of the year and boris had conducted it himself at the mozart hall to ecstatic reviews and puzzled but enthusiastic applause while rannaldini had been skiing according to clive boris had also been over twice to see rachel and the children the last thing rannaldini wanted was these two getting together if he was going to clinch the new york job he must mend his marriage at once he therefore curbed his initial instinct which was to beat kitty up on her return and when she came through the front door just holding back the tears and waiting trembling violently for the tolling of the punishment bell rannaldini promptly despatched the children to mrs brimscombe and roast chicken and chips in the kitchen and drew her into the red morning room after the bleak bitter day nothing could have been more welcoming apple logs crackled merrily in the grate side lamps cast soft light on huge dark blue bowls of white hyacinths and on the soft red roses and peonies of the aubusson which flowed over the entire floor instead of the usual deafening stockhausen or shostakovitch the stereo was playing my fair lady even rannaldini himself looked more approachable in old brown cords a yellowchecked shirt and a dark brown cashmere jersey which seemed to bring out softer brown flecks in the hard black eyes and he was smiling at her with such tenderness im ever so sorry rannaldini kittys teeth were chattering so frantically she could hardly get the words out hush hush all that matters is that you are home come here my lovely child taking her blue frozen hands he drew her close gently stroking her cheek which was rigid with tension as she waited for the first blow from the back of his hand im so sorry about the press and fings what does the stupid press matter sighed rannaldini seeing you in lysanders arms bring me to my senses i ave the worst twentyfour hours of my life expecting screaming abuse the thumbscrew the stapler punched through the hand kitty looked up in bewilderment ive grown accustomed to her face she seems to make the day begin sang rex harrison my sentiments entirely said rannaldini kissing her forehead and then her trembling lips youre not angry only with myself for neglecting you all my cheeldren adore you even natasha she reeng me in such distress this morning papa dont let kitty go she is very upset of course lysander ave often tell her he love her and keep ringing up from switzerland that hurts her thought rannaldini with satisfaction seeing kitty flinch of course he chase natasha he went on she will be very rich woman eef i die so will you kitty and that ees not so impossible he waved away her protests theenking you might not come back i contemplate ending it all pulling open a desk drawer he pointed to a black pistol oh no rannaldini kitty was horrified you mustnt do anyfing like that not eef i have you banging the drawer shut rannaldini went to the drinks table and poured kitty a large brandy but i have many problems catchitune have gone bellyup larry is ruined oh poor larry and poor marigold poor me said rannaldini fretfully catchitune owe me meelions of pounds we will have to find a new record company theenk of the new contracts to be drawn up then seeing the exhaustion on kittys face but forget that theenk only of us my keety and come with me to the tower his hand slid round her waist sliding upwards to caress her breast with infinite gentleness then down to stroke her bottom giving it a quick vicious pinch you are made for love keety and now perhaps a leetle punishment for being such a naughty girl drink up your brandy and i will blot out all memory of that promiscuous greedy little gigolo hes not gasped kitty oh my dear picking up a woodlice crawling across the hearth rannaldini tossed it into the fire dont make me shatter any more of your illusions you must promise never to see him again even worse was lysanders return to magpie cottage paradise had never looked bleaker a sadistic east wind whipped the last leaves across the sallow fields the frantically threshing branches of the trees tangled like antlers rannaldini the wily old buck was despatching the young pretender into the forest he never should have let kitty go it was his fault if hed been able to keep his hands off her in public theyd have got away with it he was terrified of rannaldinis vengeance and for a sickening moment over the wind and rain thought he could hear the punishment bell tolling at valhalla then realized it was only the church clock striking twelve it seemed like midnight how could he get through the rest of his life the cottage smelt damp and sour the doormat was covered in letters mostly brown envelopes in the fridge he found a halfeaten pheasant crawling with maggots and shuddering threw it in the bin pouring himself the dregs of a bottle of vodka he topped it with tonic as flat as his life and only bothered to open three letters each of which plunged him into deeper despair the first was from the vet saying he was per cent sure arthur had contracted navicular disease which meant he was a writeoff for racing oh poor darling arthur but lysander couldnt really absorb such a bodyblow in his present shellshocked condition the second letter didnt need a stamp marigold wrote dearest lysander im terribly sorry but poor larrys been voted off the catchitune board so we wont be able to pay you your monthly retainer any more but i hope georgie is still paying you and weve got to put the grange and magpie cottage on the market at once you can stay until we sell it but please try to keep it tidy because agents will be showing people round dont worry about larry and me were ok on a happier note although i cant afford the bonus congratulations on getting rannaldini back for kitty he was really rocked by those pictures in today larry who saw him afterwards said he minded much more about them than catchitune going bellyup and you managed to look really in love with kitty you are a good actor rannaldinis so jumpy hell be dropping all his mistresses soon even that old bat hermione hope to see you at rachels party tomorrow evening love marigold rain was sweeping down the valley like a ghost cavalry charge lysander started to shake all his old insecurities came hurtling back he had lost his true love if he moved out of the cottage where would all the animals and hopefully kitty live poor marigold too going up the spout hed had a lot of money from her his trembling hand had great difficulty in writing her a cheque for thirty thousand pounds he didnt want to be paid a bean for saving kittys marriage hed better ring his bank sometime and find out how much hed got left or perhaps ferdie could do that for him he must ring up and get the dogs back and talk of the devil here was a letter from ferdie how odd ferdie never wrote letters and his handwriting on the envelope looked really crazy dear lysander im afraid maggies dead lysander gave a moan of horror she wasnt getting fat like we thought she was pregnant and pining so much for you she wouldnt eat she had no strength and died giving birth to three puppies two were still born im feeding the third with a bottle oh god whispered lysander he read on i just want you to know that you cant go on fucking up people and animals like this and dodging your responsibilities you plucked maggie out of hell made her fall in love with you and dumped her and from those pix in today youve done the same to kitty im fed up with picking up the pieces ill leave jack with marigold i dont want to see you any more youre on your own lysander was distraught poor darling little maggie the most adorable dog in the world whod given him nothing but love starving herself to death and sweet darling kitty and ferdie his dearest friend whom hed totally taken for granted how could he have behaved so appallingly to all of them shivering he threw himself down on the damp grey sheets and sobbed himself to sleep waking two hours later the light was already fading and he felt so desolate he dialled valhalla even though hed promised not to at first he thought kitty was a recording machine her voice was so high stilted and unnatural i cant see you any more i cant live without you he jibbered in panic and maggies dead oh lysander for a second kittys voice faltered im ever so sorry but i still cant see you rannaldinis forgiven me ive got to save my marriage what marriage youre married to saddam hussein hes frettening to kill hisself if i leaves im fank you for everyfink god bless you and im sorry about maggie it took lysander five dials to get ruperts number right oh rupert rupert im really sorry to bother you but kitty wont see me any more and rannaldinis threatening suicide that old trick said rupert scornfully no doubt hell get kitty to run off suicide notes on her word processor for all his mistresses ive just been watching the tape of the nativity play christ its funny i must send flora some flowers and arthurs got navicular said lysander despairingly bring him over tomorrow ill have a look are you sure dyou mind having tiny as well shes such a bitch but arthur pines without her the only reason lysander went to rachels party was in the hope of seeing kitty it was another mean night black ice gripped the winding rutshire roads a savage wind chivvied woolly sepia clouds across the stars rachels barrel of rainwater was frozen solid although jasmine cottage was if anything colder in than out the party gave an initial illusion of success because the twentyfive odd guests crammed into a small room dominated by a large black grand piano had to yell to be heard particularly as rachel had turned up rannaldinis cd of shostakovichs fifth fortissimo thank god youve come i need spare men shouted rachel her welcome vanishing when she saw jack tucked inside lysanders coat i hope that beast wont chase scarlatti cant he stay in the car hed freeze to death happy birthday said lysander unable to meet her eyes he disliked her so much as he handed over a bottle of moët you spoil me said rachel mockingly ive had so much booze anyone would think i had a drink problem lysanders hopes that he might get one decent drink were dashed when she promptly put the moët in the cupboard with the other bottles saying shed keep it for special occasions your next bonk with rannaldini thought lysander in disgust he was sure that the huge brown mohair jersey and the thigh boots in softest mushroompink leather she was looking so good in were more presents from the maestro glancing round the room he noticed an elaborate new stereo system shelves filled with rannaldinis tapes and records and a piano stool exquisitely embroidered with yellow pansies and poor darling kitty got a filing cabinet for christmas hot apple punch or exotic fruit cup asked rachel brandishing a ladle whichevers the strongest people seem to prefer the cup rachel handed him a green glass of fruit salad come and meet some of my london friends such a description presupposed some degree of glamour and sophistication but lysander found himself faced by a row of alltime dinginess anita brookner heroines with long pale faces and longer pale cardigans desperately trying to warm dirndlskirted bottoms in front of a desperately anaemic fire this is the local stud i told you about rachel whispered already dominating the group was guy still high on his television success as st joseph he had received stacks of fan mail and been the subject of an independent profile comparing the ways joseph took mary away privily and guy the rock star had stood by georgie you made so many statements in nativity green said one of rachels friends displaying armpit hair that was a positive fire hazard as she reached for her glass i liked the bit when you calmly changed baby jesuss nappy during the shepherds visit guy smiled in acknowledgement then turning to lysander towards whom he now felt quite well disposed since he had proof he wasnt after georgie how was skiing lovely dont you feel guilty reproved another london friend about the way skiing disrupts the ecological balance i didnt know it did said lysander longing to spit out his first mouthful of fruit cup skiers hurtling down the mountains trigger off avalanches and disturb the wildlife he was told earnestly not to mention deforestation deforestation with a stab of anguish lysander remembered giggling over kittys shaved bush he hated all these long pale supercilious faces for not being round pink and smiling like hers have some blotting paper interrupted rachel handing round sausage rolls thanks lysander broke one in half giving it to jack are you sure they dont contain meat asked a london friend nervously jack promptly confirmed this by spitting his all over the carpet excuse me said lysander i must go and talk to meredith who with his airborne curls and merry blue eyes seemed the nearest thing to kitty in the room hallo baby boy said meredith i go to parties to dance and get wasted sighed lysander what the hells in this drink most of rachels body shop concoctions i should think certainly no booze christ i wondered why i was getting lower hallo you sweet thing meredith stroked jacks rough white head but the little dog could hardly wag his tail hes pissed off to him parties mean chops chicken and sausages proper human food hell eat rachels cat in a minute im sorry about maggie poor old you lysander nodded not trusting himself to speak hows arthur i took him over to rupert campbellblacks yard this afternoon did you now whats it like seriously impressive swimmingbaths solarium computers a resident blood analyst and such terrific horses i actually patted penscombe pride god what a beautiful horse but hes really small ruperts going to try and sort arthur out lucky arthur sighed meredith ruperts to die for and dye for he patted his blond curls in the mirror he can be quite fierce said lysander oh i love that treat em mean keep em keen taggie ruperts wife was really sweet she made arthur a bowl of coffee to make him feel at home but he still sulked dreadfully when i left i dont think im very good at making anything happy he added dolefully mrs rannaldini looked pretty cheerful in today said meredith noticing the way lysanders bloodshot eyes kept darting towards the door she is coming this evening isnt she well hermione and bob have just arrived said meredith and madam wouldnt grace a grisly jaunt like this unless she was expecting maestro christ its cold said lysander no wonder rachel doesnt bother with a deep freeze here are the lovers said meredith as a battered marigold and larry entered hand in hand go anywhere for a free drink these days all the same its sad to see the for sale sign outside paradise grange your friend ferdies got his board up already whoever buys it cant not want to redecorate it i better get in there early and give ferdie a ring lysander couldnt bear to talk about ferdie either he missed him dreadfully and was trying to screw up courage to ring him and apologize oh god here was hermione hallo mary said guy turning from the admiring circle of london friends to waylay her hallo joseph said hermione skittishly ive just been talking to the independent about me and my cat what a coincidence laughed guy ive just done a long interview with the guardian on me and my work station i am going to leave guy hissed georgie to marigold hes been so uppity since the play look at him being drooled over by all those dreary friends of rachels well he is charming protested marigold hows flora desperately low oh marigold i made a new years resolution to look after her and make my marriage better and id broken it by christmas eve when guy insisted a little unsigned victorian love note on his desk had come from some picture framers i made a new years resolution not to maind about not havin any money sighed marigold but the boys have decided they rather like boardingschool and every taime i see the for sale sign swinging outside paradise grange ay burst into tears i cant think why youre making such a fuss marigold hermione who was still wearing rannaldinis mink christmas present and quite oblivious of the glares of rachels green friends barged between them you were always telling me how blissfully happy you and larry were when you were poor its far worse for me having to renegotiate all my contracts larry might have warned us he was going bankrupt if you and rannaldini hadnt screwed such vast advances out of him never maind the jets and the tenstar hotels it maight never have happened said marigold furiously oh dont overreact sighed hermione then turning to georgie i must tell you what a wonderful man guy is so caring and supportive he was certainly supporting your bum pretty often in the video of the nativity play snarled georgie a hot apple punchup was avoided by rachel staggering in with a huge casserole dish all the husbands except guy who was too frightened of georgie leapt to her assistance bob got there first looks good what is it organic oat risotto said rachel with artichokes and haricot beans take a plate meredith im ok at the moment replied meredith who was blue with cold when its a tossup he murmured to lysander between dying of hypothermia and farting like a drayhorse all night i choose the former shall i get some more logs rachel im as warm as toast said hermione smugly ive got my thermals on and i had a nice hot bath before i came out baths are a waste of water snapped rachel piling food on to plates you should have a shower or share the bath water with someone id share a bath with you any time rachie joked guy getting a black look from georgie youve got a terrific crowd here oh people are so bored with cooking over christmas theyll go anywhere for a free meal said hermone airily fascinated by lysanders beauty a london friend edged forward to stroke jack i suppose you use him for digging out foxes no only for fouling footpaths and childrens playgrounds said meredith cheer up it may never happen lysander thats what im frightened of said lysander dolefully im off to raid that drinks cupboard meredith lowered his voice like captain organic oates i may be gone some time keep our hostess occupied but lysander didnt have to bother for as meredith sidled off rannaldini walked in he looked feral and aggressively decadent in a black shirt and cords which matched his predatory eyes and a vast almost floorlength coat made of wolf pelts which seemed an extension of his hair and set off his monthaut suntan and like a wolf entering the fold he mesmerized the room i cant wait for everyone to go thought rachel then he can make love with me in front of the fire rannaldini nodded at hermione and bob then running his eyes over the longfaced carecrows from london found nothing to interest him wheres your much better half rannaldini asked meredith sliding a cup of neat whisky into lysanders grateful hand in bed is brickie ill asked guy just pleasantly exhausted she sent her apologies rannaldini smiled evilly at lysander all keety need was a leetle loving jack gave a yelp then understandingly licked lysanders face when his master apologized for gripping him so hard its disgusting the way they boil the roots of christmas trees so they cant be replanted chuntered a london friend looking at lysander so white and distraught bob remembered the larky radiant young blood whod stopped even the music in its tracks at georgies rock star party come and have supper one day this week he put a hand on lysanders arm hermiones off to rome thanks but i gotta go lysander emptied his cup of whisky through in the kitchen he could see scarlatti scraping his litter tray and reminded of aunt dinah nearly blacked out next moment jack had wriggled out of his grasp and scattering cat litter chased scarlatti out through the cat flap thats no way to save planet earth box giggled meredith shall i open a window and let in a little hot air theres a bit of a pong i told you not to bring that dog snapped rachel you cant go yet the party hasnt started sorry ive got to bye bob bye meredith bye marigold muttered lysander and gathering up his long coat from the hall chair he rushed off into the night well we know who he likes said rachel furious at losing her only heterosexual spare man although it was good rannaldini had come on his own not that kitty ever really inhibited him im not going to drink this goats piss said rannaldini pouring his exotic fruit cup over a depressedlooking yucca get me a whisky rachel then turning to larry how are things i assume your tiny assets are frozen feeling neglected because rannaldini hadnt even come over and kissed her hermione decided to check her face before approaching him crossing the hall as she went upstairs to the bathroom she found a letter on the carpet which a distraught lysander had dropped on the way out seeing the letterhead paradise grange she read on ignoring the posters about banning additives from school dinners and protecting the natterjack toad she sat down on the edge of the bath a smile spread over her face and a glow suffused her body as she read hermione had always been irked and mystified that lysander had never made a pass at her nor even chatted her up now she knew why she was about the only wife in paradise who hadnt paid him to stepping into the bath she used the shower to wash between her legs and cleaned her teeth with rachels organic toothpaste returning to the party she whispered in rannaldinis ear then turning to rachel triumphantly lovely do darling must go ive got work to do on wozzeck see you later bobbie almost immediately to rachels fury she was followed by rannaldini half an hour later in the blissful warmth of the tower hermione sipped a glass of krug and watched rannaldini reading marigolds letter to lysander for the second time well done he said softly as conflicting emotions of fury excitement passion hatred and jealousy flickered across his face what a very silly letter to drop so georgie and marigold paid little mr hawkley to retrieve their husbands and martha winterton as well presumably it always puzzled me how he lives so well georgie and marigold must have paid him a fortune to make up to kitty said hermione smugly i mean the others are at least attractive and just to make you jealous but kitty must have collaborated that was naughty said rannaldini like cavaradossi keety must be tortured noone makes a fool of me unplugging himself from hermione after a rather perfunctory coupling he plugged in his telephone he was going to enjoy this game machiavellian as ever rannaldini planned an orgy at valhalla january was such a dreary month and everyone was so worried about impending war in the gulf that they needed distraction first he sent out the invitations mrs roberto rannaldini at home on twelfth night for a fin de siècle toga party then he offered hermione the part of lady macbeth in his next film if she succeeded in seducing lysander during the evening rannaldini was not an unperceptive man lysander might have been paid vast sums to pretend to be in love with kitty but it was clear from his increasingly desperate messages on the ansaphone and his illiterate passionate faxes which spewed out of the machine like tapeworm that the boy was utterly infatuated nor was there any doubt that kitty was smitten too yesterday she had singed his best shirt when they played miss saigon on the radio and typing out the list of acceptances which didnt include lysander she misspelt half the names and changed several peoples sexes even though caterers and florists had been hired to save her work she cleaned obsessively so the place would be sufficiently spick and span more tellingly rannaldini had failed to bring her to orgasm since her return and helpless tears gushed out of her eyes throughout his digital wife was on the blink rannaldini did not upbraid her he realized increasingly how dependent on her he was for his comfort and what other wife would run his life so efficiently and allow him such freedom certainly not hermione just doing the seating plan together made him want to throttle her i want you to look pretty and enjoy yourself this evening and leave everything to me he told kitty on the afternoon of the party as he watched her dazedly digging up a poinsettia some fan had sent him and freeing its roots from the cruelly constricting plastic cage before repotting it i want to make a beeg sum of money over to you keety he went on the royalties on fidelio perhaps to give you independence i know i urt you horrible in the past but let us try again in the states we will leave all the eediots in paradise behind and eef you cannot ave children no matter we will adopt which made poor kitty feel more confused and guilty than ever over at magpie cottage a despairing lysander saw helicopters bringing krug and most of harrods food hall landing all day as he kept his binoculars trained on valhalla by dusk snow was falling thickly turning georgies blond willows grey before his eyes icing rannaldinis maze and weighing down his fruit nets like trampolines like a black tie of mourning the dark waters of the river fleet halved the white valley unable to remember when hed last eaten lysander opened a tin of sweetcorn then after a spoonful put it in the fridge for the thousandth time he checked if the telephone was on the hook jumping violently at a pounding on the front door he prayed as he never stopped praying that it might be kitty instead in marched the next best thing oh ferdie lysander stumbled forward flinging his arms round his friend drawing comfort from his solid bulk im sorry ive been such a shit i didnt mean to use you poor darling little maggie his voice broke my fault ferdie patted lysanders shoulder shocked how bony it was then bending down to scoop up an hysterically excited yapping jack came on too strong choked about maggie had to take it out on someone everything you said was right i just couldnt bear not to see you any more ive missed you so much did maggie suffer terribly no lied ferdie and her puppys doing really well for a second lysanders haggard face lit up hes still alive that must be an omen its a bitch ferdie opened the fridge christ dont you ever have any food my mothers got her this weekend bottlefeeding her on goats milk but mums got to go back to work on monday ill take her ill give her to kitty to replace his voice faltered again oh ferdie what am i going to do and the story of his great love came pouring out kitty and me are an item its the real thing he said finally you said that about georgie said ferdie reduced to putting the kettle on as there was no drink in the house georgie said lysander outraged that boring selfpitying slag i even remember kittys postcode its the same as yours said ferdie unimpressed is it asked lysander in surprise i dont know mine i cant concentrate on eastenders and i havent had a bet since i came back my god said ferdie in alarm ladbrokes will go into receivership ill give you my opinion of this situation after the orgy tonight what are you going as nfi said lysander sulkily then when ferdie raised his eyebrows not fucking invited you sure ferdie rifled through the post which lysander hadnt bothered to open because none of it contained kittys neat round handwriting but which included several letters marked private and confidential from his bank and three marked urgent from david hawkley here you are ferdie slit open the thick cream envelope mrs roberto rannaldini at home noone could feel at home at valhalla shuddered lysander youve got to dress up as a roman said ferdie preferably a decadent one most peoplell go in sheets and duotan i loathe fancy dress lysander had gone whiter than the snow outside at the thought of seeing kitty again and ive got a zit first time in your life i cant see it then as lysander lifted the curls off his forehead thats nothing its massive if i stood in paradise high street id stop the traffic you better start eating i cant i must go into rutminster and get kitty some flowers before the shops close you could go in the buff as an ancient brit suggested ferdie youll be so blue with cold at valhalla you wont have to bother with woad the thunder and surge of schoenberg could be heard all the way down the valley which glittered in the icy light of a moon hardly softened by a rusty halo presaging storm outside valhalla the press stamped their feet desperate for the latest on kitty and lysander but determined to prevent any drawbridge crashers rannaldini had posted a fleet of minions and guarddogs on every gate only guests with invitations were allowed in and directed by mr brimscombe who was almost more desperate to join the orgy than the press to park their cars and helicopters on the lawn rannaldini had laid his plans with care the scarlet morning room and the yellow summer parlour were radiant with candles and carpeted with pink rosepetals the central heating most uncharacteristically was turned up to tropical huge banked logs smouldered like the fires of hell in every grate so anyone who had turned up in anything hotter than a toga was soon stripping off great vases of lilies roses and jasmine poured forth their overpoweringly voluptuous scents recalling rannaldinis garden during last summers heatwave the air was blue with many kinds of smoke as soothsayers slaves emperors mercurys in tinhats and figleaves and goddesses holding in their tummies and wishing theyd cut down on the turkey leftovers got stuck into the krug having frozen at rachels party larry had made the mistake of wearing a lions costume and was now twitching a yellow tail as he yelled into his mobile hes trying to set up a new business with some japs explained marigold whod come as minerva having fallen asleep under the sun lamp she was redder in the face than percival hillary who as julius caesar had recycled his cavendish house nightgown and put a laurel wreath on his wispy grey curls julius seizehim more likely giggled meredith lissom in a beige tunic rannaldini is not promiscuous marigold just terribly terribly frightened of the dark so he cannot sleep alone what are you on about said marigold adjusting the owl on her shoulder ive come as a christian said meredith folding his hands piously so i cant bitch about anyone isnt hermione a sweet person hasnt percy got lovely breath doesnt rachel cheer one up how the hell did gwendolyn chisleden wangle an invite she could have come as caligulas horse without dressing up whoops ive sinned again ay think gwendolyn looks very dignified in that midnaightblue shirtwaister signed marigold ay wish ay hadnt bothered with fancy dress most chillingly sinister of all was rannaldini as janus the twofaced roman god guardian of the gateways and appropriately of january a bestselling item at music shops round the country was a rannaldini mask so lifelike that musicians crossed themselves when they suddenly encountered it tonight rannaldini had attached this second face to the back of his head so wherever you were in the room the black hypnotic eyes seemed to follow you with his smooth brown torso black loincloth and thick gold snake coiled round his arm he looked menacing and terrifyingly sexy belle of the ball however was definitely hermione as the botticelli venus with her glorious figure barely disguised by a fleshcoloured body stocking and her serenely beautiful face framed by a long curling strawberryblond wig looped back with a silver ribbon you can count every hair on her pubes silly old tart fumed meredith i dont know why she didnt come as herself shes so lifted noone would have recognized her doesnt bobby look divine as brutus the nobbliest roman of them all said bob deprecatingly looking down at his bare knees christ its hot in here shouldnt someone open a window poor georgie had felt absolutely stunning in gold robes and a black wig as cleopatra until natasha rolled up totally unexpectedly after ten days in barbados as an infinitely more seductive version in her mothers angel gabriel gold tunic and with her own dark curls straightened and cut in a fringe two cleos you should have come as georgies daughter said hermione laughing heartily bags i be your asp said guy who was showing off his splendid legs as a centurion unlike most fathers rannaldini was not remotely inhibited by his daughters presence seeing a miserable utterly upstaged georgie retreating into an alcove he went over to fill up her glass hallo georgie oh hi rannaldini god im unhappy i screwed up courage to go to relate in rutminster last night and came home full of resolutions to be nicer to guy only to find hed gone round to see rachel and what is more georgie rannaldini cut into her monologue mockingly i only came to say hallo talk of zee devil leaving georgie squirming with humiliation he sauntered across the room to kiss rachel who having been to a candlelit peace vigil to protest against the gulf war had arrived in an embattled mood dressed as ben hur she was brandishing a large whip ah dolores lady of pain he said softly sliding a brief caressing hand inside her thighs just below her tunic let me pull your chariot i loathe fancy dress snarled rachel but she had lost her audience because lysander had just walked in and as usual brought the room to a halt he wore ripped jeans a dark blue shirt and kittys donald duck jersey his deathly pallor set off by the dark stubble and the purple shadows beneath the cavernous eyes which searched endlessly for kitty only made him stand out more from the gaudy yelling revellers swarming around him hi trouble said meredith tossing a handful of rosepetals over him calves in ancient rome were always garlanded with flowers before they were sacrificed lysander was followed by a tottering leering ferdie who as bacchus had draped himself in a winestained tablecloth his mouth was smeared dark purple with one of lysanders lipsalves and a wreath of plastic vine leaves borrowed from the pearly gates fell over his nose hie said ferdie lifting a flagon of red to his lips haec hoc added meredith hermione should have come as frontus any moment guy will tumble down her cleavage kitty was so used to staying in the background that rannaldini had the greatest difficulty in dragging her out of the kitchen he certainly didnt want lysander sloping off there because she had no idea lysander was coming she had listlessly acquiesced when rannaldini insisted on dressing her as a vestal virgin in clinging pleated white which only emphasized her lack of colour her swollen reddened eyes and her dumpy little figure now she was carrying a big terracotta bowl loaded with green grapes and crimson cherries past the red morning room along to the dining room kitty darling how are you let me take that called out bob but next minute he had been waylaid by the leader of the orchestra whod come plus fiddle as nero and who was already halfcut wheres this famous toy boy who got off with kitty he demanded not realizing she was within earshot i want to shake him by the hand for rattling that shit ive never known him so histrionic screaming down the telephone about deps at four oclock this morning those were completely deeferent musicians to zee ones i saw in rehearsal so i said its not surprising rannaldini the first lot were so fucking frightened of being shouted at that must be him in the donald duck sweater jesus what a beauty its going to be like the first day of the sales once we start orgying hearing this kitty shot into the room and found herself looking straight at lysander he was clutching jack and a huge bunch of snowdrops next minute the terracotta bowl crashed into the rosepetals oh lysander she whispered unable to speak lysander stumbled forward thrusting the snowdrops into her hands closing her fingers round them and stroking them for a second they gazed at each other stunned by the devastation both had wrought i cant go on stammered lysander welcome to the underworld orpheus murmured rannaldini gliding up then snapping his fingers at a couple of waitresses to clear up the broken pieces he turned to kitty i want you to come and meet rudolpho whos going to play macbeth dropping her snowdrops contemptuously on a side table he frogmarched her across the room i thought youd promised to geeve up lysander he hissed squeezing her arm till she gasped with pain switching to purring conciliation he introduced her to a very fat tenor covered in white makeup and his harpist boyfriend whose costume consisted of brown curling leaves they had come as decline and fall rudolpho caro i would like you to meet my wife keety wholl be sorting out your contract ring her eef you have any problem from then on kitty kept her eyes firmly down deliberately avoiding looking at lysander who had collapsed dolefully on the sofa muttering to jack i assume youd rather talk to that dog than me said hermione archly yes i would snapped lysander holding out his glass to an admiring waitress for a refill the party was hotting up glucks orphée was pouring out of the speakers ravishing female musicians and handsome gay opera stars realizing that spare heterosexual beefcake was in short supply hovered hungrily around lysander hoping hed tread on their togas i wouldnt mind a house down here said rudolpho the very fat tenor i have secret information said ferdie in an undertone that paradise grange across the valley might be coming on to the market i could show you around tomorrow if you like goodness thats nice he added as a stunning blonde inadequately clad in a pale blue cot sheet appeared in the doorway perhaps she could jolt lysander out of his despair thats chloe boris levitskys girlfriend said rudolpho i did aïda in cardiff with her marvellous voice chloe carissima rannaldini dropped a kiss on her bare brown shoulder licking off wild strawberry and rosehip body lotion how did you give boris the slip hes working on his requiem said chloe petulantly he didnt even notice id gone out silly boy to neglect something so exquisite beckoning to a waitress rannaldini put a beaker of krug in each of chloes little hands you ave catching up to do we are about to dine im not sitting next to rachel no next to me that will upset everyone kittys snowdrops gave a long despairing hiss as he tossed them into the fire dinner was served in the blue diningroom which was more intimate than the great hall guests lounged on multicoloured silk cushions piled round low tables on which was arranged suitably roman fare great fishes swimming in herbs and butter lobsters barbecued geese sucking pigs great flagons of wine and big bowls spilling over with grapes cherries and pomegranates wrapped in imperial purple paper beside each gold plate was a condom and an ecstasy pill rannaldinis version of ravels bolero said to be the sexiest ever was pulsating out of the speakers like a great heartbeat with the leader of the orchestra playing along i wish rannaldini would spend as much on church flowers grumbled joy hillary glaring at the cliffs of freesias who did the seating plan grumbled georgie who was stuck between the vicar and rudolpho rannaldini and i said hermione smugly ive put guy next to the two prettiest women in the room rachel and natasha is your phone out of order by the way i saw guy coming out of the call box in paradise high street this afternoon then suddenly furious what the hells chloe doing next to rannaldini she must have gatecrashed he was supposed to have gwendolyn chisleden on his right lysander who was already absolutely plastered found himself between hermione and a really ugly female doublebass player whod come as caesars wife calpurnia wouldnt get a chance to be anything else but above suspicion with a face like that said meredith who was sitting opposite and sucking a lobster claw at the same table were guy rachel natasha whose cats eyes beneath her black fringe were devouring lysander and ferdie on her right who was depressed that he still wanted her so desperately rannaldini who had deliberately put kitty at his side had also arranged it so that lysander was gazing straight at the back of kittys head with the evil mocking janus mask beside it throughout dinner rannaldini deliberately caressed his wife stroking her very clean neck as though he was an executioner pondering where to drop the axe fondling her breasts and her back as though he were working in suntan oil and all the time kissing her and whispering in her ear lysander had to exert every ounce of selfcontrol not to get up and hit rannaldini across the room looking washedout and not remotely pretty kitty moved him more than ever putting the ecstasy pill in his mouth he washed it down with half a pint of krug you dont seem very happy lysander said hermione putting a hand on his leg im not said lysander removing it kittys gone back to rannaldini and shes the only truly good person apart from arthur ive ever met thats because shes young and hasnt experienced life said hermione dismissively it isnt furiously lysander pulled off a piece of goose and gave it to jack shes good because shes good your friend isnt in a very cheerful mood hermione shouted across to ferdie not wanting to blow themselves out before orgying people were drinking more than eating already openly necking and beginning to undress one another as the ecstasy struck home hermione engineered the conversation on to favourite fantasies id like to be playing desdemona to domingos otello at covent garden she began and to charm him into making love to me instead of killing me in front of a huge audience thats quite a rewrite said meredith id like to be raped by mel gibson very slowly id like to see three gorgeous women making love guy smiled at hermione rachel and natasha and be invited to join in natasha who was chucking grapes at lysander to rouse him from his black gloom said shed like to be abducted and seduced by a highwayman my names turpin call me dick offered ferdie topping up her golden goblet even natasha laughed whats yours then she asked id like to have a woman in love with me said ferdie simply aaaaah said everyone at the table except rachel who now was staring at rannaldinis table with as much horror as lysander whats chloe doing here she whispered to guy although rannaldini was publicly stroking kitty with his left hand his right hand had disappeared under the table and whats your secret fantasy lysander asked hermione no secret i want to marry kitty said lysander flatly there was a pause then natasha led the howls of derisive mirth youre beautiful sighed ferdie unable to keep his eyes off natashas soft gold thighs marry me then taunted natasha as lysander only lusts after married women its the one way ill get him into bed georgie got lower and lower on her right rudolpho and his boyfriend were busy pulling grey hairs out of each others heads like chimpanzees and the only man whod come dressed as anthony was a countertenor who displayed a cock the size of a threeyearold boy when his toga fell open she was only too aware of the shrieks of laughter coming from guys table to her right the vicar was gazing at lysander who was looking so grim that he reminded her for an agonizing second of david hawkley if only david would forgive her across the table lady chisleden was getting very uncorked and had undone nearly all the buttons of her midnightblue shirtwaister i want to go somewhere that will give me new horizons and widen my experience in life she was telling bob why not try bexley heath said meredith plonking himself down between them drunken dining was followed by even more drunken dancing hermione opened the ball with guy rocking and rolling just to show the younger generation that theyd invented the dance and when guy hoisted hermione in the air she clasped him with her bodystockinged legs hermiones smug smile was wiped off her face however when rannaldini led kitty on to the floor a mesmerizing serpentine dancer he was soon practically raping her his body writhing against her kissing her shoulders and then her mouth sticking his tongue down her throat until she nearly gagged letting his hands wander over her body yet his feet never losing the rhythm of the music deliberately he danced past lysander so close that the hem of kittys pleated skirt brushed lysanders foot and he could smell her hot frightened body and caught a faint agonizing waft of the diorissimo he had given her at the airport a scent he would now associate even more with loss oh mum oh christ oh kitty oh maggie he muttered hopelessly and drunkenly daring to glance at him kitty thought how desperately ill and diminished he looked his jeans were ripped everywhere there were buttons off his shirt the tip had been eaten off one of his shoes he needs me she thought in anguish not feeling rannaldinis fingers until they were pinching really hard unable to bear any more lysander stumbled from the room nows my chance thought natasha leaping up for a second kitty dropped her guard you dont think hes going to blow his brains out with that little brain sneered rannaldini hed have to be a bloody good shot the orgy roared on toga toga burning bright shrieked marigold tossing her sheet into the morningroom fire and rushing pinkly up the stairs pursued by a man in a neil kinnock mask it didnt occur to any of the guests as they charged in and out of bedrooms that there was something odd about mr brimscombe pruning the valhalla honeysuckle in the middle of winter downstairs rannaldini was dancing with rachel bopping through the rosepetals and fixing her with his deadly stare utterly suicidal kitty was being lugged round the floor by the vicar the hostess with the leastest if shed known lysander was coming shed have tried to look prettier but at least hed brought her snowdrops if she were truthful what she dreaded most was his no longer loving her last thing at night when she lost control of her thoughts she dreamt she was a little mole with its blind eyes pink hands and lack of waist the two of them had a lot in common and she was tunnelling under the gates of valhalla beneath the river fleet not stopping until she joined the other molehills on the lawn of magpie cottage seeing rannaldini had disappeared kitty left the vicar in midfoxtrot and escaped to the summer parlour unable to find lysanders snowdrops to put them in water she crept up the main stairs tripping over entwined couples and her own long skirt praying she might bump into lysander through a landing window she noticed the moons increasing halo mother of pearl now and ringed with darkened rainbow colours kitty was reminded of lysander who shone like an angel in her dreams next moment lady chisleden rushed shrieking past in her bra and rollon pursued by a man wearing lysanders donkey head take me dancing naked in the rain roared the loud speaker and cover me in ecstasy suddenly it was october again and she was dancing round the field at magpie cottage it was no good shed have to find lysander mrs rannaldini a defeatedlooking caterer called up the stairs theres a policeman down here come to complain about the noise hooray a spare man at last called back kitty if hes handsome introduce him to rachel or the vicar giggling hysterically she felt light with happiness she and lysander loved each other nothing else mattered take me dancing naked in the rain sang kitty as she rocked down the gloomy landing she could hear terrible sobbing but to hell with peoples problems then she realized it was coming from natashas room tiptoeing to the doorway she found her stepdaughter crying so hysterically that her whole bed seemed to heave sweeteart whats the matter everything im going to die youll be pleased because it means dad and hermione are caput as natasha looked up cleopatras kohl and mascara were streaked down her face like a yashmak oh kitty i cant bear it i love him so much poor lambkin seizing a handful of pink tissues kitty put an arm round natashas shuddering shoulders drying her eyes and glad to be allowed for once to comfort what is it tell me lysanders fucking hermione what did you say the pink tissues fell like rosepetals from kittys hand making love if you prefer it howled natasha i dont believe it kitty sat down very suddenly on the bed her lips were trembling so much she could only mumble lllysander lloathes hhhermione funny way of showing it go into papas dressing room theyre all watching him narrowly avoiding crashing into the open door sending a big vase of dried poppies flying kitty stumbled along endless winding passages up and down stone steps cold beneath her bare feet the ride of the valkyrie was now pounding out of a different set of speakers more and more menacing it couldnt be true it couldnt for a terrifying second she thought rannaldini was defying her to enter his dressing room then she realized it was his mask and that he and bob who was using a video camera and meredith who was dabbing maestro behind his ears and rudolpho and his boyfriend who were both down to their boxer shorts were all gazing excitedly through a twoway mirror moving closer clinging on to a bust of schubert kitty could now see lysander and hermione both naked in rannaldinis big pale grey fourposter with the little renoir and watteau girls looking indifferently down from the faded cherryred damask walls jack beadily glaring at his master had taken up sentry duty in an armchair rannaldini turned smiling viciously come een kitty twoway mirror on the wall giggled meredith who is the fairest of us all no doubt about that said rudolpho taking hold of his boyfriends cock can we have him next rannaldini hell did you ever see anything so beautiful collapsing against the mirror kitty was amazed her anguish didnt shatter the glass how could lysander not see her although entwined with hermione there was a slumped utterly defeated look about his pale body on those silken red sheets oh god please help me she whispered peety you mees a wonderful performance said rannaldini your boyfriend make love with all the brio of a youth orchestra a few wrong notes but such energy its the paradise lad thought kitty in horror as hermione slid down lysanders still body and took his limp cock between her beautiful smiling lips screaming kitty fled to her bedroom where she found lady chisleden lying on her flowerpatterned duvet doing exactly the same thing to a man in a donkeys headdress slamming the door kitty leant against it for a second trying to ride the pain which was far far worse than anything shed suffered from rannaldinis infidelities of all his mistresses hermione had used abused patronized and humiliated her the most and now she had calmly stolen lysander the only man kitty knew now that she had ever loved you could stop torturers by telling them what they wanted but there was no way to end this agony ive never known such breakages one of the caterers was scratching her head over the broken glass which glittered among the trampled rosepetals as kitty rushed out into the snow she was dimly aware of the vicar followed by a trail of screaming bacchantes chasing a panicstricken police constable naked except for his helmet into the valhalla maze but as she looked up at the moon howling in anguish she noticed that like lysander it had lost its halo the party showed no sign of abating salt lay like patches of snow over the wine stains even worse howls came from lady chisleden when she discovered that the man in the donkeys head whom shed enjoyed for the last hour was none other than a leering mr brimscombe joy hillary whod been kept very busy failing to stop couples coupling stiffened with delight as she saw marigold disappear giggling into the broom cupboard followed by the naked man in a neil kinnock mask wrenching open the door she chucked the contents of a rusty fire bucket over them crying how can you bring such disrepute on the parish council marigold aym makin love to may husband you stupid cow shrieked marigold who was straddling a drenched larry whod received most of the deluge but he came in as a lion said joy in bewilderment and hes not goin out laike a lamb said marigold and throwing a dustpan at joy kicked the door shut i want my mother sobbed natasha where is she said ferdie stroking her teardrenched hair in new york i think ill take you to her said ferdie the moment ive shown rudolpho over paradise grange if i were you gwendolyn said joy hillary trying to regain some ascendancy id get that nice shirtwaister dry cleaned over in his tower lying in his other huge bed surrounded by cheering opera crowds as he listened to his own recording of salome rannaldini drew heavily on a joint according to sade he murmured enjoyment increases in proportion to the intensity of the sensations the imagination receives the most intense sensation he groaned in ecstasy as chloe plunged a longnailed finger deep inside him ees produced by pain the true voluptuary will impose the greatest amount of pain he smiled round at chloe drawing on the joint until it glowed then placing its burning end within a millimetre of her smooth brown face dont be frightened he said softly as she winced away listen straining her ears chloe could hear the faint tolling of a bell how would you like to play lady macbeth chloe asked rannaldini lysander woke around ten with a murderous headache groaning he tried to focus on a strawberryblond wig flowing down from one of the posts of a big double bed there was jack asleep on his donald duck jersey and several pink nude girls looking down at him from the pictures and a strong scent that boded evil slowly his aching eyes took in scarlet toenails smooth brown waxed legs swelling to plump cushiony thighs and glossy brown pubic hair trimmed in the shape of a heart like a massive electric shock he realized something was dreadfully wrong kittys bush had been shaved in france and would now only be sprouting stubble dragging his eyes laboriously up over billowing breasts he reached hermiones smug satisfied face a fat tabby who had just wolfed a side of smoked salmon what in hell happened we made love hermione stroked his forehead and it was wonderful it couldnt have been you must have spiked my drink ive never wanted to go to bed with you i like bob too much anyway how ungallant hermione still smiled but her nails raked savagely across lysanders scalp ouch dont i love kitty oh come we all know you were being paid the love was real damn you and did she say afterwards that was ubsolutely mudgic lysunder whadyamean lysander totally awake now leant up on his elbow glaring into hermiones lovely spiteful face thats what kitty always says thut was mudgic rannaldini youve been putting a lot of marriages asunder lysunder suddenly frightened she waved a hand in front of his murderous bloodshot eyes dyou mean rannaldini tells you about him and kitty in bed the bastard how horrible that kitty should say rannaldini was mudgic too oh come pillow talk rannaldini doesnt pretend to be a gentleman he loves stories and he adored watching you and me through the twoway mirror last night she gave her deadly little laugh so did kitty kitty lysander froze kitty the poor angel what did she say shell be ok said hermione irritated by his sudden desperate concern the workingclasses dont feel pain like we do i cant think why youre making such a fuss you must have made a fortune out of the whole thing come on she patted the red silk sheets enticingly lets try again now youre sober youll soon forget kitty revolted lysander leapt out of bed clutching his head as waves of nausea almost floored him and tugging on his jeans ripped them even further hermione lost her temper why should kitty leave rannaldini she hissed look at this beautiful house and all this beautiful land out of the narrow windows lysander could see snowcovered chimneys soaring to a brilliant blue sky across the valley like a brueghel people were already skiing and tobogganing in the sloping fields below paradise grange hurtling downhill with dogs barking joyously after them a scene so reminiscent of monthaut and kitty that lysander had to cling on to the windowledge think of her thrilling lifestyle married to a man of genius hermiones voice was now tolling like the punishment bell think of her future in new york what the hell have you got to offer her only my heart with hermiones mocking laughter ringing in his ears he went in search of kitty the landing was deserted except for the odd bra and pair of knickers downstairs wading through sandals daggers laurel wreaths fallen figleaves place cards cigarette ends condoms and burst balloons lysander breathed in a stench of sex stale tobacco and halffull glasses not wishing to wake the vicar who was stretched out on a sofa with a bunch of dried poppies in his arms lysander finally stumbled on a cheerful blearyeyed group having a postmortem round the kitchen table i never knew gwendolyn chisleden had had a tummy tuck said georgie who was actually holding hands with guy and the first decent bonk in forty years said meredith then noticing lysander hallo duckie how are you seeing bob at the end of the table deep in the music pages of the observer lysander went scarlet and mumbled wheres kitty not herself poor lamb she put salt in all our coffee then when i asked her very politely for some butter for our croissants she got two pounds out of the freezer and chucked them down on the table like bullion i should think you larry and i are the only people who didnt catch aids last night said marigold pushing kitty into a chair against the aga and handing her a cup of black coffee to warm her numb frozen hands her teeth were rattling between blue lips she was wearing an old sheepskin coat over her torn vestal virgin dress the few maiden ladies waiting in vain in all saints paradise for the vicar to take matins had been electrified instead by the sight of poor little mrs rannaldini always so quiet and retiring wandering in in a white ball dress with bleeding feet and collapsing in a back pew piteously sobbing oh please god help me help me miss cricklade had run out to ring marigold from the telephone box much used by paradise adulterers begging her to come and collect kitty i think the poor little souls finally gone off her head now marigold was halftidying up as rudolpho the tenor was due to see over paradise grange in a minute it did look beautiful with the big rooms lit up by the snow if only all the pictures hadnt gone off to sothebys larry was fast asleep upstairs they both agreed they hadnt enjoyed a party so much in ages relieved that kitty seemed calmer marigold was now being very practical ay know lysander went to bed with you kitty dear he laikes you very much but he also went to bed with georgie and me yes aym afraid he did he just cant resist a bonk and yes hes a genius in bed he makes you feel so desirable and funny and well beautiful aware that kitty was flinching at every adjective marigold felt one had to be cruel to be kind and he was about to go to bed with rachel and he did with martha in palm beach and god knows who else when working away from paradise and now hermione i know its a shock but lets face it hes a playboy out for what he can get and whom he can bonk kitty took a gulp of coffee so scalding her eyes watered i fort hed changed men dont change said marigold except their partners lysander wouldnt be any more faithful than rannaldini but at least if you stay put you live in luxury kitty started to cry but i love him marigold because he was so kaind thats another thing he gets ladies not just by the saize of his winkle but by his ears because hes so good at listening restored to rannaldinis arms later in the day kitty was allowed one incoming telephone call it was all she needed go away she screamed cutting through lysanders hysterical pleadings youre worse than all the uvvers all you fink about is sex leave me in peace i never want to see you no more half an hour later lysanders hopes flared for a second as he heard steps coming up the path of magpie cottage but when he ran to the door he found only a note in the porch from bob summoning him to lunch in london the following day you and i have to do some serious talking about hermione sick with terror lysander rolled up at radnor walk the following day was bob going to cite him as corespondent or to call him out for bonking hermione the house was absolutely beautiful inside and seemed far too subtly decorated to be hermiones taste the drawing room had burntorange curtains a big white carpet strewn with blue flowers and drained blue walls covered with musical books scores hermiones records and tapes a mournful picasso clown not unlike bob and a cotman of a soft gold wood in autumn a huge portrait of hermione as donna elvira was reflected in the big gilt mirror over the fireplace lysander turned his back on both of her but couldnt avoid photographs of the awful old bitch everywhere delicious smells of wine and herbs drifted from the kitchen despite the bitter cold of the day the house inside was warm enough for bob to be wearing a grey striped shirt tucked into jeans showing off the flattest stomach and neatest hips in gloucestershire lysander who seemed to have been cold for days felt a passionate almost tearful relief at the equal warmth of bobs welcome come in dear boy you look frozen and in need of a whole fur of the dog morning jack put him down there arent any cats pushing lysander towards a pale orange and blue striped armchair beside a crackling leaping fire he opened a bottle of pink champagne how were the roads awful until i got to rutminster and theyd started gritting more gritted teeth than roads the other night observed bob as he carefully eased the cork out what a remarkable evening i had terrible problems getting the orchestra sobered up in time for todays rehearsal were playing a fiendishly difficult piece by villalobos at the festival hall this evening chloe was supposed to be singing les nuits dété but shes done in her back or so she says bob gave lysander his weary charming smile as he handed him a glass you enjoy yourself no idly bob straightened the yellow chinese silk shawl draped over the piano and removed a browning flower from a bowl of light blue hyacinths then sitting down opposite lysander he raised his glass to my deliverer this should really be dom perignon rosé because its such a redletter day i cannot tell you how grateful i am ive been praying for someone to take hermione off my hands for fifteen years lysanders jaw clanged like a gangplank rannaldinis always been far too fly to offer the old thing marriage bob carefully smoothed out the gold paper of the champagne cork with a beautifully manicured thumb anyway he is my musical director and if i cited him as corespondent hed probably fire me and the orchestra doesnt need any more scandal beside he added gently ive got you and hermione on video so im home and dry oh my god lysander choked on a huge gulp of champagne basically i dont think hermione and i would suit shes a terrific singer and a terrificlooking woman and all but honestly shed find me such a thicko and hopelessly unmusical and i doubt if i could afford her you should have thought about that bob said suddenly cold hermione could certainly afford you youd never have to work again and youd be a much more arresting accessory than a chain handbag on her arm and shes sensational in bed as of course you know lysander had gone green his face glistened with sweat i dont remember i promise you bob i was set up one of the reasons i feel dreadful is youve always been seriously nice to me i never wanted to bonk her so youre telling me youve got no intention of standing by her nno please not bleated lysander after youve compromised her so appallingly you realize she can afford the toughest lawyers in the world for a long moment bob glared at lysanders terrified face then he started to shake with laughter what a pity i suppose ill have to hang in there she couldnt cope on her own and cosmo does need a putative father but i thought you adored her said lysander in utter bewilderment i take care of her said bob flatly getting up smoothing his remaining blond hair in the mirror he perched on the arm of lysanders chair the other night when you and hermione were in bed you reminded me of matthew arnolds white violets plucked by the little children then when the nurse calls them home thrown down to die on the woodland floor youre wasting yourself on women you know bob added softly lysanders eyes widened he felt himself blushing and tried to make himself as small as possible even so bob was seriously close glancing up he noticed the smoothness of bobs recent shave his hairless nostrils above the long wide upper lip the big kind almost lashless eyes you were probably too drunk to remember anything about your performance the other night bob put a light hand on lysanders hair but i promise you it was the most exciting thing ive ever seen slowly he stroked lysanders rigid cheek with the other hand i know youd be turned on to watch yourself on the video i bloody would not lysander jumped to his feet so fast he nearly tipped bob on to the floor jack stopped inspecting a stuffed bear in the corner and barked furiously are you quite quite sure righting himself bob moved towards his quarry quite backing away panicstricken lysander was blocked by the piano what a shame sighed bob youd find men so much more rewarding and far less hassle oh well we better have lunch meredith he shouted through to the kitchen and in bustled meredith swamped in a butcherboy apron he was bearing a big blue delft dish of lobster pancakes smothered in the palest white wine and anchovy sauce collapsing on to the keyboard with a crash of notes lysander opened his eyes the widest ever you and him he mumbled incredulously bob nodded filling up a glass for meredith been going on for fourteen years id never have survived marriage to hermione if it hadnt been for meredith does hermione know course not silly bitch shes so unobservant and selfobsessed said meredith can you get the bread from the oven and the salad bobbie im sure youd enjoy the video lysander he went on cosily i loved it youre so photogenic youd make a fortune in blue movies you really are kind starting to giggle in relief lysander found he couldnt stop until they all joined in until the tears were pouring down their cheeks im so sorry gasped lysander finally wiping his eyes on his sleeve its so nice to laugh but i love kitty tush tush chided meredith theres a world of possibility out there he tapped the window called london three thousand miles away theres new york with those godgiven looks why throw yourself away on a plain jane she is not who is married to someone else went on meredith laying a blue napkin across lysanders thighs who is determined not to relinquish her i must rescue her you wont duckie now eat up that pancake before it gets cold youre much too thin dont worry he added when lysander drooped like one of kittys snowdrops youve got to move out of paradise and give it time kittys doing time with that shit how can i abandon her when i know how happy i can make her shes a treasure agreed bob forking radicchio and cèpes shining with tarragon dressing on to lysanders side plate but shell never leave rannaldini he terrorizes her and appeals to her conscience a lethal combination hes got her mother into an expensive home which kitty couldnt afford on her own as it is she sends her money every week i could pay for that said lysander quickly kittys mother could live with us then it wouldnt be so expensive well youd better abandon this gigolo lark and win her properly i find it mystifying said meredith gobbling up the untouched threequarters of lysanders pancake as he loaded up the machine whats kitty got that we havent shes touched his heart said bob lysanders quite uncomplicated despite those wondrous looks like papageno all he wants is enough to eat and the woman of his choice fightings not his business natasha had been so distraught she had fled valhalla while ferdie was showing rudolpho over paradise grange and sought sanctuary with a girlfriends parents in pimlico she left her address with kitty just in case lysander asked for it the worst part of the nightmare for natasha was that her own father had actually been drooling over lysander and hermione in bed together papa knew i was crazy about lysander she sobbed to kitty how could he do that to me and get a buzz out of it and how could lysander bonk that gross old wrinkly deranged with grief herself kitty had comforted natasha as best she could and although neither rannaldini nor lysander had shown the slightest interest in natashas whereabouts the fifth time ferdie rang valhalla kitty had given him the pimlico address two days later having bored the girlfriend and her parents rigid with her obsessive monologue natasha was forced to return to valhalla as she was due back at bagley hall that evening she and flora would be like war casualties at least kitty would have packed her trunk since the orgy natasha had decided there was something definitely to be said for her stepmother arriving at paddington she bought kitty a box of black magic and a book on tapestry but as she slouched miserably along the platform thinking of mocks in two weeks and all the holiday work she hadnt done and how unbearable bagley hall would be if she couldnt while away lessons dreaming of lysander she felt a hand picking up her suitcase swinging round she found herself looking into the square blushing face of ferdie oh go away you remind me of lysander im sorry ferdie that was bitchy but the bottoms fallen out of my world the worlds fallen out of my bottom grumbled ferdie i should never have eaten that curry last night a slight smile lifted natashas big mournful red mouth youre a dickhead what are you doing here anyway ive been put on commission only i thought id come and see you off you better find yourself a rich girlfriend ive got one in my sights said ferdie taking her arm now lets find you a seat for reasons best known to themselves british rail had scrapped the normal openplan express and replaced it with an oldfashioned train with small carriages and even worse no bar or heating somehow with a fat tip ferdie managed to inveigle a large brandy out of a diningcar waiter on the nextdoor train thisll warm you up he told natasha emptying the bottle into a paper cup and heres tatier and hello thank you said natasha listlessly ill come and take you out from school if you like and ill write natasha felt so low and was so determined not to break down that she didnt even look up and wave to ferdie as the train pulled out slumped in her seat to avoid the lowangled sun she noticed the train had the same hoot as the first notes of the last movement of beethovens violin concerto next door to her a pale girl was writing an essay on the future of marriage opposite a fat woman seemed to be deriving far more enjoyment from maeve binchy and the rest of the carriage was occupied by three lawyers in black and white on their way to the court at swindon talking most indiscreetly about their cases natasha tried to read hello but on page twelve found a big piece on bobs and hermiones marriage so she put it away gazing out of the window at the cheerless landscape and the leafless trees she started to cry and found she couldnt stop even when the door slid open and a voice said tickets please i dont know where mine is sobbed natasha in your coat pocket on top of the rack said the voice oh ferdie howled natasha go away charmingly relentless ferdie ordered everyone out of the carriage getting down the fat womans suitcase explaining that there had been a death in the family then sitting beside natasha he emptied another bottle of brandy into her paper cup im such a bitch how can you possibly still love me the torch i carry for you has a rechargeable battery im thinking of signing up for the gulf natasha looked up suddenly oh please dont would you mind ferdie started to wipe away her tears with a british rail napkin i would said natasha in amazement actually i seriously would ferdie got out his wallet and handed her two hundred pounds in cash whats that for it says penalty for improper use and i want to use you improperly oh natasha my darling said ferdie taking her in his arms by the time lysander returned to magpie cottage the rosy dreams of winning kitty induced largely by bobs dom perignon had faded and he collapsed into a deep despairing sleep woken by his alarm clock set for two in the afternoon so he could back hannahs uncle in the he was outraged to find his ladbrokes account had been suspended transferred to the accounts department he learned that his december cheque had bounced only utter disbelief induced him to open one of the numerous letters from his bank whereupon he nearly died of shock he was on to ferdie in a trice does od at the bottom of the page always mean ones overdrawn or overdosing it certainly does by twenty thousand pounds jesus did you buy paradise grange or something you had a hundred grand in there in november look at your cheques laboriously lysander started to decipher them well theres fifty thousand to georgie georgie she was supposed to be paying you i hate her so much i paid her back i didnt want to be be whatever it is to her anyway i didnt get her husband back sale and no return sighed ferdie carry on and thirty grand back to marigold no shes honestly on her uppers and i had to pay my return fare from brazil and give gina a diamond bracelet because id walked out on her oh lysander said ferdie wearily and ten thousand for the hotel de versailles christ thats steep you were only there three days i know but rannaldini wanted kitty to move into a pokey little room so i picked up the tab for her suite the jacuzzi was sensational hang on ill ring you back theres someone at the door in fact quite a crowd had gathered stamping their feet on the snowy doorstep including the owner of the heavenly host who hadnt been paid for four months a man in a dufflecoat with a drop on the end of his red nose and marigold swollen with indignation and a blue puffa who was accompanied by a disdainful camelfaced couple in barbours oh marigold lysander pulled her like a lifebelt into the cottage is kitty ok please put in a good word for me you keep away from kitty whispered marigold furiously youll only upset her and ay dont think this is funny she thrust a large sign saying bottle bank which ferdie had put in the porch into his hand ay left a note sayin ay was bringing gwendolyn chisledens nephew and his fiancée to see over the cottage theyre getting married in april you mayte have shaved and got dressed then she gave a gasp of horror as she took in the chaos behind him overflowing ashtrays glasses on every table a floor littered with clothes chewsticks and newspapers turned to the racing pages and washingup rising out of the sink and along the windowsill to meet an army of mouldy green milk bottles worst of all poor jack unable to contain himself after a long nights confinement had crapped extensively in the kitchen doorway you promised to keep the place taydy it wasnt jacks fault you know how good its your fault you aydle lad for oversleeping look im really sorry have a drink everyone lysander called over marigolds shoulder no actually i havent got any why dont you all go down to the pearly gates and chalk up a stiff one on my account while i get dressed and clean the place up no thanks im driving said the man in the dufflecoat ive come to repossess your tv and video machine im about to watch the said lysander furiously and theres eastenders and the bill this evening look if youre popping down to the pearly gates you can put twenty quid on hannahs uncle he yelled after the camelfaced couple who were belting down the path to their car after theyd all departed lysander was reduced to listening to the race over the telephone which cost a bomb because hannahs uncle wouldnt go into the starting gates for ages before storming home five lengths clear at lysander was about to ring up ladbrokes and shout at them that he could practically have settled his account if hed been allowed his bet when he was distracted by a photograph of arthur on the mantelpiece hed been so miserable about kitty that hed forgotten to ring rupert to find out how poor dear arthur and utterly bloody tiny were getting on as lysander drove through penscombe past greyblond houses and a little norman church where generations of campbellblacks were buried he noticed a betting shop rare in such a tiny village it was no doubt patronized by all the locals putting their shirts on ruperts horses in the villagestore window was a poster advertising a british legion cheeseandwine party to raise money for the gulf lysander knew he ought to take an interest the radio banged on and on about the liberation of kuwait but he was only interested in liberating kitty below ruperts beautiful blond house with its halo of magnificent beech trees a long lake like mother of pearl in the falling sunshine was freezing at the edges across his rolling fields patches of snow lay like the spilt milk over which there was no use crying all the birds were singing trying to disguise the dull constant roar high above the clouds of bs carrying bombs south from raf fairford rupert was not surviving the recession and alarming setbacks at lloyds by altruism alone although beguiled by lysander in monthaut he had noticed the boys effortless extravagance by smiling at the receptionist at the hotel versailles rupert had also ascertained that lysander was picking up the massive bill for the president de gaulle suite the reason therefore that rupert had offered to get arthur sound was because he regarded lysander as an engaging dolt awash with cash who could easily be coaxed into buying other much younger horses for rupert to train rupert loathed droppersin even the richest owners disturbed the horses routine he was not running a harley street nursing home but when lysander rolled up shivering uncontrollably with donald duck glaring out between the lapels of his long dark blue dogfurmatted overcoat rupert actually stopped placating mr pandopoulos whose horse hadnt been placed last week either leaving the apoplectic greek to dizzy his extremely glamorous head girl rupert bore lysander off to the yard kitchen for a cup of tea put him down said rupert as a pack of dogs swarmed round trying to reach a bristling jack theyre quite safe and the two jack russells are bitches enviously lysander examined the photographs which crowded the walls of rupert and his daughters perdita and tabitha winning world championships at show jumping brandishing polo cups and leading in winners on the flat and over fences im really sorry not to ring first he mumbled but my telephones stopped working hug the aga said rupert putting on the kettle you look frozen you could tell when a horse was in pain by its eyes lysanders were bright red but the pupils and the irises were drab and lifeless he was as pale as the christmas roses taggie had arranged in a dark green vase on the table jeans skintight when he was skiing were really baggy now hows arthur asked lysander king arthur of the round belly said rupert god he was cross when i cut down his rations he ate every blade of straw so ive put him on shredded newspaper i expect he and tiny are busily piecing together lurid stories about you and mrs rannaldini how is she oh rupert once more with all the egotism of heartbreak lysander launched into his tale of woe how can i convince her that im serious he pleaded finally as he dipped a fifth piece of shortbread into his tea before handing it to a slavering jack id like to get a medal in the gulf to show her im not just a cheap gigolo the yanks are paying people a thousand pounds a week just to put up tents i thought you were paid ten times as much as that for erections in england said rupert whod been doing the entries for next weeks races and working out who was going to ride out which horse tomorrow morning as he listened all right joke joke he added as lysanders face blackened anyway ive got news for you bunny the vet and i think weve sussed arthurs problem rupert halfrose to look out of the window thats her now arthur as usual was lying flat out snoring with his eyes wide open to get attention i ought to move penscombe pride from the nextdoor box said rupert as he opened the halfdoor he isnt getting any sleep with that racket going on but hes got a bit of a crush on arthur arthur lurched to his feet in delight when he heard his masters voice whickering like vesuvius he nudged lysander in the belly grumbling about the dreadful starvation diet to which hed been subjected as usual he looked like nothing on earth his face back and quarters smeared with green his mane and tail strewn with pieces of pink financial times like confetti having tried to eat donald duck he went sharply into reverse and shook ostentatiously when he saw bunny the vet hes a terrible drip said lysander apologetically a programme seller in a white coat has him all of a tremble rounded sweet and smiling with long soft brown hair and a gentle comforting voice bunny reminded lysander for a fleeting agonizing moment of kitty weve discounted navicular she told lysander its easy to make a mistake on an xray but those lesions are actually normal synovial recesses oh right said lysander not knowing if that was good and hanging tightly on to arthurs headcollar as he kept trying to edge away will you trot him up now asked bunny even arthurs delight at putting as many yards as possible between himself and bunny soon disappeared as pain overwhelmed him miserably he stumbled across the yard lysander could hardly bear to look arthur seemed worse than ever hes certainly lame on both front legs said bunny when they had both returned but i think the pains coming from his coffin joints arthur she added picking up his nearfore has abnormally shaped feet with very long toes sounds like lady chisleden said lysander giggling out of nerves bunny raised her eyes to heaven i have the misfortune to look after her lunatic arabs she sighed having clipped back the hair and scrubbed both arthurs front feet she filled a syringe with local anaesthetic im going to do a nerve block in the nearfore coffin joint she explained as she plunged the needle into the front of a wincing arthurs foot in his brief stay at penscombe arthur had endeared himself to everyone now all ruperts grooms left their charges stopped sweeping up and cleaning tack to gather round they were soon joined by farm workers gardeners the estate carpenter a man delivering feed and mr and mrs bodkin the ancient couple who seemed to have always looked after rupert snow was drifting down as though it had all the time in the world even when lysander lit a cigarette which was strictly forbidden in the yard the autocratic rupert didnt snap at him ok it should be dead now trot him up said bunny tail whisking pleased to have an audience arthur once again shambled off up the yard after lysander who was running backwards in order to look down at his legs hes only lame on the offfore now said rupert trot him back it took all lysanders strength to stop arthur taking off towards the house hed had enough of vets and his disapproval turned to megasulks when bunny plunged another needle into his offfore coffin joint if he trots out sound now she told lysander it means all the pains inside the joints and we can cure him with a combination of intraarticular injections and corrective shoeing it seemed the longest ten minutes of lysanders life penscombe was very high up in winter ruperts horses wore dark blue hoods at night and often three rugs against the cold now sensing something was up like medieval chargers waiting for the start of agincourt they leant over their halfdoors the yard had fallen silent except for the sweet liquid carolling of a single robin and the occasional outraged protest of tiny who was being held out of the way by a nervous stable lad lysander lit another cigarette the girl grooms grew closer arthurs master was even more adorable than arthur rupert lounged deceptively still against the lichened wall of the tack room only jack oblivious for once of the tension was wagging his little tail and raising his ginger ears as he stepped round taggies blackandwhite mongrel gertrude please god make arthur sound pleaded lysander i promise ill get up in the morning and drink less a lot less arthur bored tried to eat bunnys rolex i need that to tell the time she cuffed him gently on his green nose all right if youd like to trot him up the yard in a straight line as arthur set off jack streaked after him and tiny broke away from her stable lad like outriders they flanked arthur as he shambled through the snowflakes first gingerly testing his offfore anticipating pain then putting it down again no it really didnt hurt any more nor miraculously did the other one then joyfully he was striding out clattering up the cobbled yard growing more and more confident then out on to the gravel path until he reached the beech hedge round the tennis court swinging him round with a tarzan howl of joy lysander trotted him back running backwards nearly toppling over an uneven stone as he gazed in ecstasy at arthurs great platey feet shooting out sparks as they flew over the ground oh rupert hes sound hes fucking fucking sound a huge cheer went up from the crowd which sent all the horses neighing and the dogs barking with excitement i cannot believe it lysander wiped his eyes with the back of his hand just one more time arthur turning he sprinted back to the beech hedge and arthur bounded after him even putting in a gallumphing buck of delight oh thank you lysander kissed bunny all the grooms ancient mrs bodkin and very nearly rupert before flinging his arms round arthur and kissing the bits of his great ugly face that werent green jack yapped excitedly round their feet until lysander plonked him on to arthurs back where he balanced still yapping to even louder cheers and screams of laughter as lysander trotted him up and down one more time arthur has a bilateral coffin joint problem due to poor foot balance explained bunny as rupert opened a bottle of champagne so hell need eggbar shoes which are closed up in a circle where the heel ought to be then the heel will grow youll gradually be able to cut the toes back and his feet will become a normal shape again lysander hugged her again its a miracle i cant tell you how grateful i am could arthur have a small glass of champagne rupert he really likes it ouch he yelled as tiny bit him and can this bitch have one too when he and lysander were back at the house in ruperts office rupert got out the whisky decanter lets have a proper drink its things like this that make the job worthwhile i must say arthurs a sweet horse hes so clever lysander admired the sleek stubbs horses over the fireplace and hoped as he smelt taggies boeuf provençal drifting from the kitchen that he might be asked to stay for supper and hes brilliant at getting himself out of trouble which is more than can be said for you thought rupert as he reached for the soda syphon aloud he said if youre on lets give him one more crack at the rutminster lysander swung round dyou think theres time course there is hell need a month on the roads then well start cantering and doing a bit of jumping by the end of the second month then galloping for the last month slowly building him up weve got till the beginning of april rupert flipped back the calendar april to be exact oh my goodness gazing at ruperts wonderfully handsome face with the skiing tan heightened by the cold the sleek blond hair darkened by melting snowflakes and the cornflowerblue eyes for once gentle and without mockery lysander felt a wave of adoration once again he wanted to kneel down and kiss ruperts hand and to win his approval almost as much as kittys love god he was turning into a wimp dyou mind awfully if i ring kitty he said reeling euphorically towards the telephone well have to get the right jockey said rupert handing lysander a glass arthur needs cajoling but not too much in horror lysander came reeling back again but im going to ride he protested but rupert was glancing from his diary to the list of horses on the wall and wondering who to send to lingfield later in the week if youre pouring out all this money for training you might as well have an experienced jockey he said then added christ what a day tabitha my daughter is supposed to be going back to school this evening and shes buggered off with a ghastly bearded animalrights tractordriver who thinks trainers are something one wears on ones extremely dirty feet and taggies already paid the school fees honestly with children at boardingschool youre talking about wrapping a new bmw round a tree every six months and walking away from it glancing up he saw lysander was mouthing desperately trying to get out the words look basically rupert i think were at cross purposes i honestly didnt mean to mislead you but i cant possibly afford to put arthur into training it was as though the whisky was sliding right back into the decanter basically stammered lysander i opened my bank statement this morning it was surprisingly depressing i thought i had seventyfive grand but actually i dont rather the reverse so what do you have in mind said rupert softly his long fingers curling round his glass of whisky eyes narrowed every trace of friendliness gone from his face lysander was suddenly aware of the explosive menace of the man arthurs been staying here ten days went on rupert which is almost more expensive than the hotel versailles not to mention that maneating shetland the vets bills alone have been astronomical this isnt donkey rescue he added bitchily i can see that lysander put up a placating hand but i have won point to points and my uncle alastair that drunken lech lysander winced he knew about horses he said i could ride anything and take anyone for a ride ruperts cold dead face and icy bullying voice reminded lysander of his father and made him stammer worse than ever bbbasically if you give me a job riding your horses at work and in races ill do it for free ill even clean tack although im not very gggood at it i always put on too much saddle soap and if we get arthur sound and i win the rutminster on him kitty would realize i wasnt just a playboy and i could afford to marry her it took a lot to silence rupert the clock ticked the fax machine squeaked and regurgitated his secretary rattled away next door there was a faint whirr from the kitchen as taggie turned on the mixer a ginger tom crashed through the cat door a car drew up outside and a door banged before rupert said this is the top yard in the country and you expect me to train some clappedout dinosaur for nothing and pay its entry fees i thought you might lysander stared at his bittenoff toes a big win would be good for your yard people will be impressed that youve got arthur he still gets christmas cards and he got a jar of humbugs only last week i can ride i promise you youve got to be joking theres no way ill let an airhead like you loose on my horses were busy he added with unusual sharpness as taggie popped her head round the door im sorry she blushed but tabs home let me get my hands on her rupert drained his whisky no you dont he howled as a blue streak topped by ruffled blond curls hurtled past the door catching his daughter as she reached the bottom of the stairs rupert dragged her snarling like a jack russell into the office im not going back to bagley hall screamed tabitha i hate you how dare you sneak off with that bloody leftie if ashley was the son of a duke you wouldnt give a stuff yelled back tabitha youre such a snob when you were young you pulled everything dizzy podge marion there wasnt a groom unbonked in the south of england and what about perdita the world must be strewn with your illegits tabitha had erupted into the room like a catherine wheel eyes narrower and bluer than ruperts skin the thick creaminess of elderflowers blond curls bouncing off the same smooth forehead her face delicately modelled despite the huge screaming mouth lysander had never witnessed such rage such bristling antagonism such passion between two people any moment theyd set fire to each other jack allergic to rows started yapping you ought to write your autobiography and call it the stud book taunted tabitha shut up yelled rupert and dont you start laughing he turned on lysander get out and shut that fucking dog up as lysander and jack slid out into the hall they found taggie clutching her head oh dear oh dear hi lysander kissed her on both cheeks oh wow i dont blame the tractordriver ruperts under a lot of pressure said taggie defensively hes worried about the war having been in the army he feels he ought to be out there and hes worried about business the saudis and kuwaitis own a lot of his horses lovely house said lysander admiring the yellow flagstones the tapestries and the huge oil of a rotund black labrador when its quiet said taggie the screaming was escalating dont you touch me ill ring esther rantzen and get you for child battering ive had to live through one lousy newspaper scandal after another no wonder im disturbed ashley says i ought to be in therapy you ought to be in a chastity belt yelled rupert youve always had everything you wanted sove you mostly women not since taggie and you know it she doesnt trust you an inch thats why she tags ha bloody ha along to everything never lets you out of her sight i used to see something of you before you married her putting her hands over her ears taggie ran back to the kitchen shut up rupert was shaking tabitha like a rat youve gone too far this time you can go and live with your mother and ill sell frankié sorrel and biscuit this was the redhot poker on tabithas back you wouldnt dare she sobbed hysterically ill report you to the rspca and the ns whats it you promised biscuit could end her days here you promised she was banging her fists frantically against ruperts chest if you ever see that hairy little wimp again and you dont go back to bagley hall tonight biscuitll be in a can or shipped abroad for horse meat rupert had always insisted on an office with two doors so he could escape from importuning women in the old days and now from tiresome owners bastard tabitha ran screaming through the door leading upstairs lysander jumped guiltily and fell into the office as rupert opened the second door his face was expressionless but there was a glint in his eyes where were we he said amiably oh yes you wanted to race ride for me picking up the telephone he dialled the yard dizzy darling can you tack up meutrier lysander could hear dizzys squawk of disapproval down the telephone but he was too excited about proving himself to notice horses their blazes and stars gleaming in the dusk hung out of their boxes whickering in delight as the grooms put scoops of oats and nuts in each manger meutrier a beautiful chestnut showing a crescent of white below both eyes came out with a clatter not amused at having to postpone his supper hang on hes as quick as lightning muttered dizzy in defiance of her boss and his mouths gone and hes got a horrific stop noone asked your opinion snapped rupert as he gave lysander a leg up i ride long said lysander gathering up his reins not on my horses you dont rupert tugged up the stirrups until lysanders long thighs were level with meutriers back goodbye world giggled lysander like a jewelled hairnet he could see the lights of penscombe tangling with the bare trees this is a beautiful horse rupert he said as he rode off why dyou put him on meutrier asked dizzy furiously hes a sweet boy and needs hacking down to size having bawled her head off in her room incensed that not even taggie whom she really adored had come up to comfort her tabitha stopped crying she couldnt go back to bagley hall shed never see ashley again and feel the tickle of his beard she wished he washed more but he despised deodorants thinking the skin ought to be allowed to breathe looking out of the window she saw her father and dizzy walking towards the allweather track that ran for a mile and a half over ruperts rolling fields they were following a rider on christ it was meutrier no other horse walked with that fluid grace or that innocence tab picked up her binoculars she couldnt identify who was on his back but he rode wonderfully shed never seen anyone move so naturally with a horse for meutrier it must have been like dancing with fred astaire in gratitude the big vicious chestnut put in a terrifying buck the rider grabbed his mane but didnt shift in the saddle then he swung the horse towards the floodlit track and he was off hurtling towards the first fence meutriers ears were flat to the head he was taking off too near meutrier was going to stop tab gripped her binoculars in horror the rider would be killed going at that speed then amazingly meutrier put in a terrific cat jump and sailed over kicking his feet out of the stirrups stretching his legs the rider was over the next fence his body folding beautifully as he disappeared over the brow of the hill down by the finish dizzy forgot the cold and the racing snowflakes and gave a cry of relief as lysander appeared round the corner coming up to the last fence he dropped his reins and folded his arms laughing as meutrier hoisted himself upwards and cleared the birch twigs by a foot as lysander pulled up for a second ruperts antagonism overdrafts unemployment even the loss of kitty were forgotten this is the most wonderful horse ive ever ridden im sure hed stay twice the distance id give anything to ride him at cheltenham at that moment taggie came slipping and sliding down the snowy path she hadnt even bothered to put on a jacket rupert you didnt put lysander on meutrier he was going back tomorrow well he may not now said rupert his rage had subsided but not prepared to be conciliatory he stalked ahead of them back to the house lysander was sitting at the scrubbed kitchen table eating miraculously light cheesestraws hot from the oven when tabitha slid round the door like a cat took one incredulous look at him and shot out again then as taggie handed him a glass of whisky and settled herself on the windowseat opposite tabithas amazed face reappeared outside the window he couldnt be real thought tabitha he couldnt such thick brown curls such a wonderful curving mouth pulled upwards by the short upper lip and such big kind laughing eyes oooooooh she wailed has anyone seen horse and hound she muttered as she slid back round the kitchen door a minute later hi darling said taggie help yourself to a drink thanks tab reached for a sherry glass and filled it up with coke so it spilled over and over as she gazed at lysander come and sit down taggie patted the seat beside her sorry muttered tabitha sliding in beside her stepmother and putting her chin on taggies shoulder didnt mean it i know you didnt taggie hugged her you two havent been introduced have you not properly said lysander you look just like your father dyou ride as well as he does urn tab had gone crimson and opened her mouth and shut it when rupert marched in dangling the cordless telephone between finger and thumb its ashley he said softly there was a long tense pause tell him im not here stammered tabitha that ive gone back to school make up something arthurs fantastic she turned adoringly back to lysander all thoughts of tractordrivers forgotten can i do him when i come back at weekends looking from tab to lysander rupert gave taggie the faintest smile all right youre on he told lysander after he had dealt with ashley three months trial but if you step out of line just once youre fired you can ride out for me and if any of the other jockeys dont want a ride in a race you can have it youll need ten wins or places to qualify for the rutminster tabitha got up and hugged her father i love you daddy oh gosh thank you so much thats seriously seriously kind lysander was able to stammer out at last youll have to lose a stone which you can ill afford so youll have to build yourself up at the same time and remember no booze lysander turned green surely the odd glass of wine wouldnt matter it would be odd if you stopped at one said rupert not a drop till after the rutminster lysander was so unhappy that the weight dropped off him he had never been up at six in the morning before unless hed been partying all night nor had he ever been worked so hard rupert immediately moved him into penscombe putting him up in a little room under the eaves with low beams one cant concuss him more than he is already a patchwork quilt and paintings of ruperts old ponies on the whitewashed wall im not having you mooning around in magpie cottage with your bins trained on valhalla he told lysander i want you here where i can keep an eye on you lysander would never have survived without ruperts girl grooms once they realized they werent going to get him into bed and he rejected their offers so sweetly they stopped squabbling over him and covered up for him instead every morning they would shake him awake practically dressing him forcing extra jerseys over his diminishing frame frogmarching him to whatever difficult horse lysander could never remember that rupert had earmarked for him the night before but however difficult the horse he seemed to steal into its head and heart before arriving somewhat to his amazement on its back horses really wanted to go well for him and seemed delighted by their own capabilities his problem was concentration if he started thinking of kitty when he was three lengths clear in a gallop hed be trailing the field in a matter of seconds he was also a chatterbox talking constantly on the gallops and even when jumping fences if a jockey or a horse had a fall he had to pull up instantly to see if they were all right and walking arthur round the gloucestershire lanes took hours because he stopped to chat to everyone anything to avoid going back to clean mountains of tack or spend hours dunking hay in icy water to get rid of the dust having lost an efficient if truculent tractordriver in tabithas boyfriend ashley rupert made an early mistake of handing over the job to lysander flying home the following evening rupert was appalled to see lines that should have flowed straight over the rich brown earth tangled together like a kittens ball of string a very harrowing experience admitted rupert when hed regained his sense of humour and put lysander back to cleaning tack taggie was the person who really saved lysanders life if he hadnt been so hopelessly in love with kitty he would have certainly been smitten worried about his pallor and dramatic weight loss while the other riders were joyously guzzling fried eggs sausages and bacon sandwiches after the gallops taggie tried to tempt lysander with grilled soles or steaks dripping with herbs and butter she put slimming biscuits in a flowered tin in his bedroom and made him hot chocolate with skimmed milk at night to help him sleep which he surreptitiously emptied down the sink because he couldnt stand the stuff and taggie listened when he banged on about kitty the grooms restricted him to five minutes an hour still numb at the loss of her own baby when she was not cooking for ruperts staff she was always bottlerearing calves and lambs or feeding hens and ducks or ruperts dogs or topping up the birdtable or smuggling forbidden toast and marmalade to arthur when he hung forlornly out of his cheweddown halfdoor owners bored rupert but taggie was always ready with a sympathetic ear a cup of tea and homemade chocolate cake this led to problems checking on arthur one afternoon lysander was amazed to discover taggie cringing at the back of the box stroking an outraged tiny what are you doing hush taggie went scarlet mr pandopoulos is here and he keeps groping me if rupert found out hed hit him across the yard and tell him to take his horses away and we really cant afford it at the moment lysanders face fell and ruperts keeping me and arthur and tiny for nothing oh whens he going to let me race ride so i can start earning my keep youre doing that already ruperts really pleased with the way the horses have improved being tough is the only way he feels he can get results lysander had never met a couple so aware of each other as they drifted together watching touching like each others shadows their love filled lysander with envy but rupert was very tricky lysander had to be careful not to be too friendly to taggie the only thing male and beautiful rupert really wanted in his yard was horses lysander hardly noticed the war as bulletins came and went on the tackroom radio but reeling from one of ruperts tonguelashings he often felt like baghdad after a nights bombardment in the second week in february he was just schooling a vastly improved but still cussed meutrier over a row of fences the setting sun like an exploding ball of flame rising into a thick black nuclear cloud seemed to symbolize everyones worries over the approaching land war planes had roared overhead all day rupert who was in a particularly foul mood because king hussein a fellow old harrovian appeared to be supporting the iraqis called lysander over why the fuck dont you use your whip my uncle alastair said it was a lazy way of riding said lysander quaking but defiant meutrier was really trying so its stupid to hit him and when horses are exhausted it only slows them down honestly rupert it makes me sick to see jockeys flogging horses theres no need to hit them so hard this was an oblique reference to jimmy jardine ruperts second jockey whod just begun a fortnights suspension for excessive use of the whip probably at ruperts instructions so you think jimmys had nearly ninety winners this season just by feeding his horses sugar lumps if you ride for me you use your whip for a second they glared at each other lysander lowered his eyes first he couldnt face that cold dismissive contempt swinging meutrier round he rode wearily back to the yard overtaking them in the landrover rupert was on the tackroom telephone when lysander got back ok marcia jimmys been suspended but im not sure he and hopeless were twin souls anyway im putting a new boy lysander hawkley up on him youll like him marcia hes betterlooking than jimmy yes the tomorrow maiden hurdle worcester putting back the telephone rupert saw lysander mouthing helplessly in the doorway hanging for support from meutriers sweating chestnut neck you heard me said rupert and youd better take a whip or you wont get hopeless off the starting line unplaced in her last eight races hopeless was an appropriately named chestnut mare with spindly legs wild eyes and a punk mane too sparse even to plait her owner marcia melling a glamorous but ageing divorcée only kept the horse in training because she had a massive crush on rupert who in turn only trained the horse and then with minimum effort because he charged marcia three times as much as any other owner it was not with any hopes of victory that lysander set out with samantha and maura two of the girl grooms in ruperts lorry on the thirtyfive mile drive to worcester the following morning to distract him from his desperate nerves rupert had given him the responsibility of loading the five runners and their tack it was a beautiful day with soft brown trees sunlit against the khaki fields catkins hanging like golden tiffany lamps and coltsfoot exploding in a sulphur haze on the verges arthur always enjoys being read to said lysander as he turned the lorry towards the motorway he likes the sun better than the independent but he likes dear deirdre best dear deirdre i am in love with a married woman who will not leave her husband arthur must be quite sick of that one said samantha handing lysander her last cigarette you cant stop here she said in horror as lysander screeched to a halt to much honking and fistwaving ive got to i took half a bottle of cascara last night to lose the last three pounds and im about to explode open the fucking door lysander leapt across them out of the lorry and bounded up the hard shoulder rupert and taggie were flying to worcester from london with mr pandopoulos and freddie jones the coowner of penscombe pride tabitha back for halfterm was being given a lift by dizzy ruperts tough blond glamorous head girl who had recently returned to work for him after getting a divorce racing into the yard tabitha greeted her own ponies then armed with a twix rushed off to see arthur coming out of his box just avoiding tinys teeth she gave a gasp for in the next box rugged bandaged plaited up and fast asleep was penscombe pride dizzy screamed tab banging on the grooms flat window what is it said dizzy who rather fancied mr pandopoulos as a sugar daddy turning off the hair drier isnt pridie running in the certainly is he should be halfway to worcester by now the hell he is hes still in his box jesus dizzy dropped the hairdrier that stupid fucker must have forgotten to load him sam and maura are so in love with him they wouldnt have noticed weve got to get him there said tabitha in panic daddyll boot lysander straight out if he finds out one of ruperts lorries was in for a service the other had gone to folkestone there only remained the trailer used for ferrying pigs calves and tabs ponies around transport illfitting the winner of the cotchester gold cup two years running and the yards biggest earner i darent risk it said dizzy we could borrow one of ricky francelynchs lorries ten miles in the wrong direction urged tab pridiell enjoy the fresh air and at least his tacks gone on already im going to be sick said tabitha hanging out of the window as the speedometer hit sixty miles an hour along the narrow winding highbanked country lanes im going to be sacked said dizzy is pridie still there hes fine leaning round tabitha could see his lovely dark bay head with the instantly recognizable zigzag blaze and large wideset eyes looking over the top of the trailer at the russet cottages and orchards as they rattled through pershore two women with shopping bags cheered in amazed excitement as they hit raceday traffic more and more people started laughing and waving to see little pridie so close like the pope in his popemobile giggled tab ive backed that horse in the so get a move on said a man in a jaguar drawing alongside them at some trafficlights what are you two doing for dinner tonight someones bound to tell daddy said tab despairingly he nearly killed lysander for forgetting mr sparkys bridle last week said dizzy drawing the attention of the man on the gate to the green trainers badge on the windscreen if only lysander werent so lush sighed tab dyou think theres any hope for me doubt it said dizzy bumping over the muddy track seems so set on this kitty hes determined to practise being faithful my brother marcus only practises the piano for eight hours a day oh thank god theres dads lorry ahead beside horse boxes belonging to martin pipe and jenny pitman was parked the familiar dark blue lorry with rupert campbellblack in large letters on the side stamping could be heard from within with the cough and viruses about rupert preferred to leave horses in the lorry which was about as luxurious inside as the ritz if we can reload pridie we might get away with it said dizzy leaping out oh hell theres lysander muttered tab have you got a comb and some blusher dizz leaning against ruperts lorry as white and elongated as a piece of spaghetti tested on a wall lysander was chatting to penscombe prides champion jockey bluey charteris tough as hell you couldnt kill him with a machinegun bluey worked hard and played hard hi tab called out lysander you got here quickly weve only just arrived not a bush unleapt behind he patted his concave belly blueys giving me a few tips tab trotted a skittishly leaping penscombe pride right up to lysanders nose who the hells this she said accusingly as pridie whickered and left white dribble on lysanders blue overcoat its pridie lysander scratched his head how did he get out you forgot to load him you asshole omigod lysander looked from bluey to tab in horror then started to giggle how did he get here dizzys trying to hide the trailer kerrist the grin was wiped off bluey charteris swarthy cadaverous features as he shot round the horse feeling his legs you fuckwit lysander he liked the fresh air like a day at the seaside said tab and whats rupert going to say demanded bluey say about what everyone jumped it was rupert in a pale brown overcoat with a dark brown velvet collar and with a brown trilby tipped over his greek nose with him was taggie ravishing as ever in a pale grey trench coat shiny black boots and a scarlet beret and freddie jones the electronics billionaire who had red hair and a jaunty smile and was the most popular owner in the yard rupert never minded freddie dropping in allo pridie freddie greeted his very famous prize winner with affection allo tab allo lysander gather youve got your first race in a minute what is it maiden hurdle said lysander starting to shake lysanders principal hurdle is a married woman said rupert acidly what the hells pridie doing out of the lorry he sweated up we were just walking him out tabitha returned her fathers blueeyed stare blandly he does look well doesnt he id better get changed said lysander anxious to escape interrogation fortunately rupert was sidetracked by the arrival of mr pandopoulos leering in a massive belted camelhair coat together with hopelesss owner marcia melling wafting joy hallo rupert she said petulantly leaving crimson lipstick on both sides of his face im a bit choked youve put a complete novice on hopeless this is lysander said taggie quickly oh oh oooo suddenly marcia looked as delighted as a large bear let loose in barbara cartlands larder my word arent you tall for a jock lysander dyou say mystic meg said only this week that luck would come from a man whose name began with l megs brilliant lysander smiled weakly how dyou do must go and he fled to the changingroom lavatories what a charming intelligent face said a bemused marcia hasnt he said rupert makes a battery hen look like stephen hawking in the same race as lysander bluey charteris was riding a brilliant five year old called turkish hustler whom rupert had brought off the flat and who was oddson favourite hopeless was lives up to her name said timeform succinctly the crowds hanging over the paddock railings studying their racecards and sporting life laughed at hopeless even wearing the thick blue rug with the initials rcb on the side which generally inspired terror in the most phlegmatic bookie hopeless looked like a child dressing up in her mothers overcoat lysander weighingout in the tiny chair beside the huge red clock discovered hed lost three pounds overnight which was nice and light for hopeless and meant he hadnt anything left to throw up he had spent last night pouring over videos of hopelesss earlier races an inexperienced horse she was not used to being in front and weaved all over the place he must keep her straight and behind turkish hustler to the last moment he wished he could wear his donald duck jersey instead of marcias olivegreen colours which he supposed matched his face hed got to be brave for kittys and arthurs sake even if he were only placed it would help notch up his quota of races needed to qualify for the rutminster in the paddock taggie put her coat round his shuddering shoulders as rupert gave him lastminute instructions start slowly shes most unlikely to last the distance and build up he added finally and id get down to the start as early as possible she gets upset if horses come thundering past her rupert wants her out of the paddock as quickly as possible poor old hopeless thought lysander indignantly well show him rupert turned to bluey who was eyeing a redhead in a group clustered round the second favourite i dont need to tell you anything bluey just sit on his back lets go and have a drink he added to freddie this race is a foregone conclusion i put two pounds on hopeless said tab rupert was busy discussing viewing figures with freddie who was also a director of venturer when he heard the flat patrician voice of the course commentator echoing round the ground and hopeless jumped that extremely well and is moving up to join the leaders running to the balcony choking on a turkey sandwich rupert looked through his binoculars at the shimmering garland of colours moving above the rails and the centipede of frantically galloping legs below as they came to the second hurdle from home hopeless was in fourth place making it look really easy and lysander was riding beautifully his hands almost touching the horses flickering orange ears urging her on his body moving with her like a lovers encouraging her every inch of the way only a grey gelding and a fence were between hopeless and the finishing post as she caught up with turkish hustler and bluey together they cleared the last hurdle hang on youre going a bit quick dont want to wear her out called across bluey theres a long run up wide and emeraldgreen the course loomed ahead as the grey geldings tail drew nearer and nearer bluey picked up his whip only allowed ten whacks before the finishingpost crack crack crack down they came on brave hustlers heaving flanks come on hopeless shouted lysander good girl go for it turkish hustler hurtled forward galvanized but frightened hopelesss competitive spirit flared she must keep up with her stablemate scrawny mane and tail flying spindly legs flailing galloping her nolongertimid heart out she chased hustler past the grey then hustler seemed to tire and go backwards as hopeless shot forward go on angel begged lysander pick up your bat you stupid fucker yelled rupert from the balcony marcia blue mascara streaming was too excited to speak hes going to do it shrieked tabitha ive won two hundred fucking pounds as hopeless slid past the post a quarter of a length ahead down they all surged into the winners enclosure a huge cheer and much laughter went up as lysander rode in with a great grin spread across his face leaving white stripes of foam on a bemused but happy hopelesss chestnut coat as he patted her over and over again marcia couldnt stop kissing lysander and only relinquished him when taggie turned up to give him a big hug oh that was wonderful im so proud of you and darling hopeless ecstatically lysander hugged her back there were photographers everywhere i made two hundred pounds said tab feeding hopeless a polo it was a toss up between a bet and a packet of fags over taggies shoulder lysanders eyes met ruperts you didnt obey a single instruction he said coldly basically lysander edged away from taggie i thought she needed encouraging im really sorry but rupert suddenly laughed and clapped him on the shoulder fucking marvellous only another nine races and you qualify for the rutminster and dont go drinking champagne now said bluey adding his congratulations if youve been wasting youre better off with a cup of tea it was ruperts day meutrier won by three lengths penscombe pride by ten mr sparky came second but only after a photofinish afterwards bluey took rupert aside i dont like competition but that boy is bloody good meutriers improved out of all recognition since hes been working on him mr sparkys a different horse hes loving it he can see a stride marcia feels the same said rupert she wants to buy lysander over at valhalla the following morning rannaldini who hadnt liked lysander having such a powerful ally as rupert delightedly handed the scorpion to kitty your little friends up to his tricks again on page three was a large picture of lysander and taggie embracing ecstatically has rupert taken in a trojan horse said the caption rupert pretended not to mind the picture in the scorpion but he was livid underneath and took it out on everyone particularly taggie lysander made himself as scarce as possible dusk saw rupert howling round the house in search of yesterdays racing post some bloody idiots chucked it out how many times do i have to tell you i need to keep them its probably in the study snapped taggie who was exhausted ive looked go and look again clenching his fists rupert stormed out then paused in the hall in front of the huge oil of his beloved late labrador badger badger would have understood how he felt about the scorpion providing solid silent black sympathy then rupert heard the crash of the pedal dustbin followed by a rustling noise and sidled back towards the kitchen as he opened the door very slowly he found taggie frantically wiping baked beans off the front of yesterdays racing post gotcha rupert grabbed her from behind you startled me jumping like a kangaroo taggie turned crimson someone must have i mean i must have thrown it away we cant keep everything she said defensively turning her round rupert glared down for a second of course we cant he pulled her towards him if you werent here he said roughly the entire house would disappear in a mountain of rubbish in a week im only terrified youll throw me out one day as he took her tired dirty unpainted face between his hands her hair smelt of bonfire smoke looking down he noticed blood all over her clothes what have you done he asked in horror are you ok yes yes taggie smiled proudly passion went into labour i pulled her calf out all by myself you shouldnt said rupert appalled you might have strained yourself or got knocked over im fine and its the sweetest little calf come and see it i know sweeter calves rupert ran his hands down her thighs im sorry ive been such a shit tomorrows valentines day i know i love you so much and were going to paris tonight wow squeaked taggie in excitement can we leave the yard of course we can for thirtysix hours have i got time to wash my hair and have a bath more important weve got time to go to bed murmured rupert peering round the door lysander felt a great wave of longing and loneliness as he saw them locked in each others arms they looked so beautiful straight out of dynasty in the corner jack was sharing a basket with gertrude the mongrel so besotted he could hardly bear to leave her to sleep on lysanders bed at night everyones shacked up but me thought lysander hed just posted a second valentine to kitty because he couldnt remember if hed posted the first rupert was going away tomorrow lysander had a brainwave clive rannaldinis leatherclad henchman intercepted both valentines which lysander had drawn himself the first was of a leopard with tears pouring down its face as it tried to scrub off its spots in the second the same leopard tried desperately to climb into a washing machine clive hid them in a file with all lysanders other letters hed whipped and any press cuttings that had appeared about him rannaldini had instructed him to tail kitty so on valentines day he followed her into rutminster when she did the weeks shopping the moment rupert and taggie left for paris lysander sloped off to london where he picked up maggies puppy and enlisted ferdies help in writing kitty a letter next morning valentines day he had to crawl back to rutshire because the whole west of england was blanketed in fog risking his neck by missing the mornings gallops he prayed that none of the grooms would grass on him as he reached paradise his heart started jumping and his hands became so sticky he could hardly swing the wheel enough to navigate the winding lanes a florists van was parked outside rachels cottage delivering rannaldinis roses thought lysander savagely avoiding the electric gates and guarddogs at the main entrance to valhalla he bumped up a littleused ride through the woods stretching a hand back to steady the little creature on the back seat beside jack only the passionate hope that one day he and kitty would be together enabled him to part with maggies puppy pale fawn striped like a tiger she had a white belly speckled paws and a sweet frowning striped face with a very direct stare despite long legs her tail practically trailed on the ground a cross between a flying fish a bird and a deer she glided into rooms and leapt on to chairs with the grace of a ballet dancer it was clear that neither jack nor dinsdale nor even tabloid had a paw in her parentage lysander put his money on a greyhound youre going to cheer up my kitty he told the puppy who cocked her head on one side for not having a baby and dont let her get pregnant sleep on her bed and bite rannaldinis willy whenever he comes near her the silence was eerie valhalla was strangled by thick veils of floating grey fog at the edge of the park lysander could distinguish rusty iron railings and ancient trees looming up like bison or great horned stags his heart was pounding his rib cage a lunatic trying to escape from a padded cell then jack and the puppy started yapping furiously as the fearsome prince of darkness in a new zealand rug galloped out of the mist and thundered away ahead the woods reared up like cliffs treacherous to mariners and there was the house greyer than the fog itself with its gables tall chimneys and small secretive windows as though the stonework between the panes formed prison bars gathering up the puppy lysander went up to the great front door resting against it for a second before setting the rusty bell jangling mournfully if kitty answered the door he was tempted to kidnap her but the nose that peered out was long and redveined for a second mrs brinscombes face lit up then she looked terrified you mustnt come here its more than my lifes worth oh the sweet little duck she put up a red roughened hand to stroke the puppy wheres kitty please please mrs b ive got to see her shes gone shopping in rutminster then ill wait no she shrank from him clives being paid to follow her and hes a villain please dont risk it rannaldinill sack me and mr b and hell take it out on kitty is she ok mrs brimscombe loved lysander and hated to see him so thin and ghostpale she had endured enough of mr brimscombes indiscriminate lechery to have huge sympathy with kitty shes all right on the surface mrs brimscombe thought for a second but she reminds me of one of those prisoners of war that saddam hussein keeps parading on tv that looks all bruised and beaten and dazed but keeps on telling you what a good man saddam is and how wicked the allies are to fight him she dont seem natural oh god lysander was frantic poor little kitty is he bullying her no thats what dont seem natural either hes being so nice well give her this and this lysander shoved the puppy and his letter into mrs brimscombes unwelcoming hands tell clive shes a stray wandered in from the wood but please see that kitty gets her stumbling in despair back to his car he reminded mrs brimscombe of one of those poor wretched seabirds helpless and paralysed by oil in the gulf with no other thought but oblivion lysander headed for the pearly gates returning from rutminster kitty was greeted by a very overexcited mrs b who managed to slip her the letter put it in yer bra mduck and whispered that the puppy came from lysander before clive walked in buckling under the two trays of bounce for rannaldinis guarddogs whats this he said as the puppy padded trustfully towards him gorgeous little thing he put out a hand ringed like a knuckleduster wheres it come from its a stray mrs b found it wanderin outside said kitty quickly doesnt look like one the puppy yelped as clive picked it up by the scruff of the neck its well fed and its paws arent marked ill pop it down to the local rescue kennels no you wont said kitty with surprising sharpness youre scared of dogs said clive rudely not this one give it to me rannaldini dont like dogs in the house clives pale fleshless face was alight with malice his pale grey eyes had the innocence of a psychopath canine dogs that is ill deal with rannaldini kitty was fired with sudden courage and it over now clear off as she grabbed the puppy from clive it covered her face with little licks shutting her eyes kitty breathed in its sweet fresh oatmeal smell it was the first valentine shed ever had only when the puppy had been fed and watered and theyd both retreated to the safety of her bedroom did she open lysanders letter kindly dictated by ferdie she read darling kitty this is maggies puppy lassie ii to replace the one from harrods those bastards at customs ripped open unless you have a dog that needs taking out you never get out at night but when you look up at the moon and the great bear and orion the hunter with his dogs think of them looking down on me and jack who both love you lysander kitty gave a sob her dark little room which faced north into the wood was lightened today by sheets of snowdrops which reminded her unbearably of the nursery slopes at monthaut she should have burnt lysanders letter but she read it over and over again before hiding it under the lining paper of her tights drawer jumping at the knock on the door she shoved the drawer shut just in time it was clive bearing a huge bunch of dark red roses and a jewel box wrapped in shiny red paper inside was a ruby brooch in the shape of a heart to my valentine said the card whose price is far above rubies with all my love rannaldini marigold was in despair although larry was trying frantically to build up some kind of business again you dont go from p to ten million by stroking the cat was one of his favourite sayings noone wanted to buy paradise grange or magpie cottage or the villa in france and all the pictures had gone for knockdown prices but far far worse larry hadnt sent her a valentine last year when hed been with nikki was the only other year hed forgotten maybe hed gone back to her to boost his ego marigold had so little confidence any little thing triggered off the panic she must keep calm but when larry rang just before lunch she found herself shouting at him i thought we were traying to mend our marriage you beast then she burst into noisy sobs princess princess when larry finally could get a word in he said rather smugly if you go and ave a butchers beind the mirror in the all rushing out marigold found a large box of chocolates a card with a red heart on the front and a page of kisses inside there was also a letter dear mr lockton read marigold incredulously and felt the blush of joy creeping slowly over her down the telephone larry could hear her scream of delight oh ay love you sir laurence she said in a choked voice as she picked up the telephone noone deserves a knaighthood more i thought youd be pleased lady lockton but mums the word till its in the papers behaving like the ideal husband on the surface rannaldini put a coded valentine message in the independent little wild thing the big leopard longs for you as he called all his mistresses little wild thing hermione chloe rachel cecilia even for a giddy second flora and most of the ladies of the london met thought rannaldini was sending secret signals to them returning from the highlands where he had been looking for locations for macbeth with cameron cook rannaldini was decidedly unamused to find lassie in situ she had already made herself thoroughly at home romping along the passages after kitty and peeing everywhere let her go to the stables with clive no shes mine kittys eyes were terrified lassie got up and stretched turning her toes backwards trailing along then attacking the redandyellow rosepatterned aubusson in the morning room and shaking it furiously stop that snapped rannaldini aiming a kick at her instantly lassie flattened her ears and seemed to become half her breadth as she fled to kittys side having already read lysanders letter which clive had tracked down and photostated while kitty popped out to the post rannaldini suspected the hand of rupert campbellblack according to the ubiquitous clive who frequently bunged the rutminster florists the roses sent to rachel that morning had come from boris who had just returned from a successful tour of his homeland the new york job wasnt in the bag yet so even when kitty forgot to provide him with a white gardenia for the gulf concert that evening rannaldini didnt bawl her out and lassie was allowed to stay returning from an equally successful but nerveracking tour of israel where shed expected to be flattened by a scud missile in the middle of a piano concerto rachel felt horribly depressed the war grew more dreadful only the night before the allies had bombed a bunker full of civilians the americans intended to use napalm to ignite the iraqi oil ditches on the front lines and the iraqi hospitals had no electricity so the baby incubators couldnt function and syringes were having to be used several times rachel knew she ought to go straight out that evening to a peace vigil in rutminster but she felt so tired and the children whom she had to collect from gretel would kick up if she left them again perhaps the most nightmarish part of being a single parent was that she had noone to tell things to to boast that she had taken seven bows last night i had to take these in for you said gretel handing rachel a huge bunch of the palest peachypink roses rannaldini or guy thought rachel wearily then read dearest rachel happy seventh wedding anniversary all love boris to gretels amazement rachel burst into a flood of tears oh gretel he remembered she sobbed he really really remembered rising late on valentines day after a long stint the night before georgie wandered round the garden the lake was as flat and grey as washingup water in the tub outside the kitchen window a lone mudspattered daffodil swayed in the wind she and guy had been getting on so much better since the orgy hed shaved off his beard so she didnt think he was pursuing rachel any more but suddenly last friday he was up to his old tricks again coming back to paradise early to go to the doctor about his headaches returning to angels reach an hour and a half later he explained that the surgery queue had been so long that he couldnt be bothered to wait but he had the jubilant air of an aircrew flying in from a successful raid over iraq without loss georgie simply couldnt cope with a return to the old uncertainties shed got to get out ant and cleo was so nearly finished then shed make plans looking at the kitchen clock she decided to start work soon but shed promised to mince up the remains of sundays leg of lamb for a shepherds pie she felt she ought to practise wifely duties for when she was living alone or shacked up one day with someone less domesticated than guy at first she didnt hear the telephone over the moulinex georgie its david hawkley hallo hallo are you there just stammered georgie wiping her hands on her jeans thank you for your valentine card it was sweet you did send it didnt you unless you know some other georgie look im really sorry i lied to you about me and lysander but i was so frightened of losing you its ok hows lysander i havent seen him but hes in love shes married and even more common than me but at least shes the same age as him and got the sweetest nature i cant get him on the telephone and magpie cottage is deserted georgie felt an air of gloom david must have visited paradise without coming to see her he was only ringing to pump her about lysander wheres he living with rupert campbellblack good god exploded david thats worse than peddling dope he won a good race yesterday didnt you see the scorpion i dont read the scorpion said david tartly then he started to stammer i miss you a lot lets have lunch in a daze of happiness georgie watched dinsdale remove the leg of lamb from the kitchen table are you still there id adore to how about the end of next week she needed the time to give up booze lose seven pounds and finish ant and cleo fine where dyou want to go what about lescargot it was a restaurant guy and she had frequented when they were first married good idea ill book dyou know rupert campbellblacks address it was still pitch black when dizzys alarm clock went off the following morning cocks were crowing through the mist horses knocking over their buckets as she staggered into the yard going from box to box she felt each horses legs for fullness or bumps before giving it a bucket of fresh water and a scoop of racehorse nuts when he was at home rupert preferred to perform this duty and decide which horses should be pulled from the gallops and merely walked round the village or rested in their boxes he was due back from london at midday taggie had arrived from paris very starryeyed last night at seventhirty the rest of the grooms would arrive to muck out and tack up the horses for everyone to ride out at eight but long before the grooms taggie had erupted into the yard wearing nothing but a red silk kimono covered in gold dragons oh dizzy lysanders bed hasnt been slept in and he didnt come home last night and men are missing intoned dizzy echoing the gulf war bulletins what the hells rupert going to say she went on we had enough trouble covering up for him yesterday and when he left pridie behind at worcester hes a fucking liability dizzy slammed penscombe prides stabledoor shut but such a sweet one pleaded taggie and hes been such an interest and a morale boost for rupert rupert was desperately upset about the baby stammered taggie i know dizzy put an arm round taggies shivering silk shoulders but rupertll have to sack him if he doesnt turn up he cant risk such irresponsibility with the horses then noticing taggies blue bare feet get dressed ill finish feeding the horses then well look for him they both jumped as deafening snores rent the air from the direction of arthurs box both doors were bolted to stop arthur chewing them opening the top one dizzy and taggie found both arthur and lysander stretched out lysander was asleep arthur was not and was snoring to get attention and breakfast giving a great rumbling whicker he waved a hoof at them arthur was so lazy and pretended to be exhausted by all the trotting up and down the gloucestershire hills that he often managed to persuade the grooms to feed him his racehorse nuts and even his bucket of water lying down from the back of the stable tiny glared down on such debauchery with more disapproval than the vicars wife at the valhalla orgy i hope hes not ill from all that wasting hes awfully still said taggie alarmed dizzy sniffed not ill drunk and passed out cold wake up you stupid fucker when shaking lysander had no effect dizzy turned the hose on him go and get some warm clothes and some black coffee she urged taggie weve got to try and sober him up enough to ride out kitty wont leave rannaldini mumbled lysander cant say i blame her if you carry on like this said dizzy tartly it was a pity that ruperts helicopter had engine trouble so noone was alerted by the chug chug chug of his approach instead arriving in the dark blue aston martin he was mistaken for jimmy jardine or bluey charteris rolling up to ride out his first sight was of his beautiful wife still wearing nothing but a drenched gaping red kimono frantically trying to dress a halfnaked paralytically drunk lysander in the kitchen rupert had no option but to sack him on the spot rupert spent the afternoon venting his rage on owners who owed him nearly a million and whose alleged chequesinthepost would rival the mail on valentines day he had already received tearful deputations from every groom and estate worker mr and mrs bodkin even jimmy and bluey and his own sweet wife who was now sobbing into the batter she was about to freeze for shrove tuesday pancakes any moment beaver gertrude jack and the rest of the dogs the stable cat and all the horses would troop out of the twilight waving banners in some candlelit protest march he was brought back to earth by taggie knocking on the door you magazine are just going to press they want to know what youre giving up for lent lysander hawkley howled rupert then as taggie burst into tears oh for christs sake are you and my entire staff and livestock bewitched by this cretin no sobbed taggie its just that he hasnt got a mother any more and his fathers a pig to him and hes nowhere to go if we chuck him out shooting across the room knocking over his outtray rupert took her in his arms there sweetheart im sorry of course he can stay pulling her head against his shoulder he stroked her hair shed been so incredibly brave since the baby died she needed something to fuss over and lysander had been such an interest and a morale boost for her i love him too he muttered but hes such a dickhead at that moment lysander appeared round the door hanging his head clutching a large bottle of whisky as a peace offering he could hardly move for hangover and misery im sorry rupert ive made such a fool of myself get out said rupert irritably then as lysander shuffled desolately out again go to bed i want you on parade at eight tomorrow morning lysander turned in desperate hope pridie needs more work rupert went on and arthurs come on so well he can start on the gallops tomorrow with a huge lump in her throat georgie wrote the end in capital letters on the score of ant and cleo she had a faint faint hope that it was the best thing she had ever done her head her hand and her back ached dreadfully but not for once her heart at least tomorrow she could go up to london to meet david with a clear conscience tonight she would spend several hours deslagging herself having steeped her hair in coconut oil waiting for a mud pack to dry on her face she noticed that the rain which had been lashing the windows all day had finally stopped outside the sun had broken through behind the woods and flooded the opposite side of paradise in rosy gold light turning the fields a brilliant leaping emeraldgreen and a lone grey horse and the departing clouds the softest pink then as she watched a rainbow soared between the clouds my life is on the up thought georgie picking up the telephone she rang relate im terribly sorry i cant make it this evening youve been so kind im sorry ive talked so much about myself thats fifteen pounds saved she thought in jubilation i can buy a new tshirt from miss selfridge something clinging and sludgy to match my eyes money was dreadful at the moment it was a good thing she hadnt bothered to finish the album for larry catchitune were in such deep trouble despite the new board that they would never have paid the rest of the advance on it but as she was leaving for the station her agent telephoned saying that dancer maitland was interested in playing ant and could they see an early score then guy rang delighted that shed finished well celebrate this evening panda he was having lunch at the athenaeum with his father he said thats far enough away from lescargot thought georgie floating off to london arriving at paddington on the next train after georgie david hawkley felt the need to stretch his legs a headmasters favourite phrase and decided to walk to soho the first daffodils waving at him from hyde park put a spring in his step overtaking a traffic jam in oxford street he was amused to pass a taxi in which georgie was frantically powdering combing scenting and trying to reassure herself in a tiny smudged handmirror that her new khaki tshirt wasnt too juvenile all the girls in miss selfridge had been so sweet about her records feeling happy and excited for the first time in months david bought an evening standard and a bunch of daffodils and followed a trail of giorgio into lescargot having been told that his lunch guest had gone to the ladies he sat down at the table ordered a glass of sherry and was soon engrossed in the racing pages which described lysander as campbellblacks golden boy and suggested people put their money on him and mr sparky the next day torn between pride disapproval and sudden sharp envy of rupert he turned to the front pages and the war the land battle was about to start any minute all kuwait was aflame burning the midnight and the midday oil david was so engrossed he didnt notice a charming redhead sit down in an alcove round the corner and then everything was forgotten because georgie arrived with the price tag still on her tshirt but looking as beautiful scented and shining as a woman in love how gorgeous she took the daffodils from him not as gorgeous as you cursing himself for being corny david kissed her warm scented freckled cheek im manic ive just finished ant and cleo oh eastern star that calls for champagne david waved to a waiter although a place had been laid for her opposite him georgie wriggled between the tables so she could sit down on the benchseat beside him sod being recognized oh its lovely to see you isnt the war terrifying do you think the israelis will retaliate david shook his head the americans have paid them too much money mother courage was so funny this morning oh mrs seymour the iraqis are copulating david laughed his face losing all its daunting sternness i liked duckbilled platitude best you remembered i remember everything about you look he brought a little silver box out of his pocket and for a worried moment georgie thought he was about to inhale snuff instead she saw it was full of hair do you remember the day i cut your fringe putting the box away he broke a roll in half but didnt eat it hows guy not great we lie side by side at night not touching like apples in the attic because were so frightened of bruising sounds like sappho did you finish catullus yup hows flora absolutely devastated and she told him about the affair with rannaldini hes destroyed her she said finally i wish you two could meet we will soon flooded with happiness georgie felt they were talking in certainties tell me about mrs rannaldini i assume she was that plump little thing bouncing around like a rubber ball in a bra and pants last october georgie laughed shes so sweet david took her hand im so glad you sent me that valentine card it arrived during a staff meeting i had to rush out and ring you i was about to ring you at christmas but when i picked up the telephone guy was talking to julia my poor darling but as she leant sideways to kiss him she suddenly heard a familiar voice saying darling im so sorry im late the traffics appalling and as painful as electrolysis on the bikini line she realized it was guy and he was speaking to julia who had leapt out of the alcove as beautiful scented and shining as herself to embrace him the proprietor coming over to ask if theyd chosen yet turned green but was too late to warn guy as over julias shoulder he caught sight of georgie and the tender smile froze on his handsome face its guy whispered georgie rock star in person said david acidly and with great presence of mind he downed his glass of sherry gave the waiter a tenner and whisked georgie down the road and took a room at the mountbatten guy said he was lunching at the athenaeum with his father sobbed georgie as they entered the lift as david led them into a room that had framed photographs of lord mountbatten playing polo all over the walls georgie turned to face him taking her hand he pulled her down on to the bed im not going to assault you its all right please dont cry georgie felt buttons against her face there was something comfortingly upright about a man who wore a waistcoat now guy knows about us its all in the open are we an us asked georgie i think so dont you that night because it was friday out of habit both georgie and guy returned to paradise you took him to our favourite restaurant said guy furiously so did you snapped georgie and id just struggled to pay the poll tax and you go squandering money on julia you bought a new tshirt out of my relate money anyway it was the first time ive ever lunched with him she lied its the first time ive had lunch with julia since christmas lied guy who is he anyway im not going to tell you hissed georgie alas there was a feature in the daily telegraph the following day on the headmasters of the top schools in england with a large picture of david looking stern and handsome devastated how jealous he felt guy rushed off to play squash with rannaldini who was feeling very smug because he was behaving comparatively well at present what am i going to do georgies having an affair with lysanders father hes got two inches in whos who and presumably eight inches in georgie said rannaldini evilly i thought she was looking good but headmasters shouldnt behave like that spluttered guy rannaldini laughed like father like son if georgie can keep her head when all about her are losing theirs oh shut up julia thinks that lets me off the hook but i cant afford to leave georgie another backer went bellyup last week anyway i dont want to you should have thought of that before have you heard the latest saddam hussein story dizzy asked lysander at the beginning of march as they drove home after another highly successful day at sandown what do saddam hussein and nylon knickers have in common i dont care they both rub bush the wrong way ha ha ha have you totally lost your sense of humour totally i dont care if the war is over stormin norman should have been allowed to go in and crucify saddam hussein for starving all the kuwaiti bloodstock to death a lot of them came from this yard and if allied prisoners of war are being released why cant rannaldini release kitty still pinching herself with joy at the prospect of being the future lady lockton marigold was also delighted to see boriss clappedout fiesta parked at an angle outside rachels cottage perhaps as was rumoured they were getting together again on the other hand marigold was getting increasingly worried about kitty whom shed just bumped into outside the village shop kitty had been wearing odd shoes and her coat was done up all wrong she was also as white as a sheet but explained it away as a tummy upset kitty in fact was almost certain she was pregnant although she hadnt dared go to james benson she had missed three periods but the thing she had longed for most in the world had only brought her desperate worry and unhappiness because she had no idea if the baby was lysanders or rannaldinis she felt overwhelmed with guilt what would happen if the baby popped out in september another little virgo like herself but with lysanders wide blue eyes she couldnt stop crying and she was feeling appallingly sick thank goodness rannaldini was too tied up with macbeth and the machinations of the new york job which still hadnt been confirmed to notice like a pickpocket kittys hand kept edging towards the telephone longing to dial ruperts number just to hear lysanders voice she was watching him win a small race at cheltenham that afternoon when clive marched in so she hurriedly switched over to an australian soap opera lassie was her only comfort getting up in the middle of every night to carry her outside feeling the little creature covering her face with gentle licks as she lay warm and sleepy in her arms kitty thought she had never loved anything except lysander so much at night lassie curled up against her on her counterpane running her hand along the tigerstriped back as smooth and silky as a banister kitty dreamt of racing down the great valhalla staircase out of the front door across the valley into lysanders arms in the second week in march doughty little penscombe pride trounced the prince of darkness in the cotchester cup by ten lengths bringing great glory to the yard and putting a welcome forty thousand pounds into ruperts pocket rannaldini whod watched the race on satellite while attempting to hammer out terms with the new world phil was so furious he promptly faxed his trainer to say he was taking the prince of darkness and his other horses away and would also be seeking a new jockey the two equine titans were due to meet next in the rutminster gold cup in the first week in april arthur who had been reluctantly heaving his whalelike bulk over ruperts fences had also been entered but not declared it was still a question of lysander having enough races in the bag to qualify spirits at penscombe plummeted when ten days before the race he had a punishing fall from mr sparky putting his shoulder out and breaking a front tooth laid off for a week he was nearly sacked on the saturday before mothering sunday his mind was so much on pippa as well as kitty that he forgot to pack the colours with only fortyeight hours left to qualify however he exonerated himself by winning a selling plate at leicester so brilliantly that the owner was forced to buy the horse back for three times what hed paid for it then he came third in the and finally notched up his quota by finishing as he thought second in the handicap hurdle but he was so elated he raised a clenched fist to punch the air whereupon a startled hopeless thinking he was going to whack her shot past the dark brown gelding in front to win by a nose the only person in the yard not overjoyed was rupert how many times have i told you to get past before you start waving your arms about like a fucking politician he yelled at lysander as he caught up with him on the way to the winners enclosure and where was your head during the first circuit between mrs rannaldinis fat legs i suppose a very nasty punchup was averted when a pretty brunette from the scorpion shoved her tape recorder under ruperts nose is penscombe pride going to beat the prince of darkness on saturday not a question of whether hell beat him snapped rupert but by how many lengths is he the best horse youve ever had yes now buzz off the prettier the reporter the more rupert distrusted them we do have another runner in the race protested tabitha indignantly as she gave hopeless a congratulatory hug oh right king arthur the brunette consulted her notebook what had timeform said about him that morning campbellblacks white elephant gigantic grey gelding of little account fucking hell lysander on his way to being weighed in swung round glaring at the brunette over hopelesss saddle how dare they hes your horse lysander she said slyly how dyou rate his chances negligible if he rides like he did just now snapped rupert then turning to lysander piss off and get weighed in people are saying the rutminsters a grudge match between you and rannaldini the brunette quailed slightly under ruperts chilling iceblue glare for taking lysander under your wing so you were in monthaut with lysander and kitty rannaldini dont you say anything against kitty said lysander coming back again fuck off hissed rupert why are you entering lysander on a nohoper just to irritate rannaldini asked the brunette delighted at what shed stirred up as lysander opened his mouth desperate to think of a really crushing reply rupert spoke first arthur isnt a nohoper he said coldly hes a stayer he stays even longer than my motherinlaw dont worry tabitha whispered to lysander daddys always in strop before a big race daddy got stroppier on the last gallops before the rutminster little penscombe pride was so well and above himself that he carted bluey off the end of the allweather track across two fields of barley on to the penscombechalford road in the rush hour arthur by contrast didnt try at all slopping along at the back of the field listening to the larks singing in a cloudless sky he was still outraged that because caffeine was a banned substance rupert had stopped his morning cup of coffee far worse having despatched lysander to the dentist yesterday to get his tooth capped rupert had taken the opportunity to sharpen arthur up himself giving the old horse a good hiding when he refused to jump a row of fences at the gallop lysander was in despair as he rode back to the yard the cracks in the paths were as bad as last summer rain which would make the going soft enough for arthur had been forecast for days but showed no sign of appearing wild garlic was spreading over the floor of the wood like a thousand green hangover tongues lysander hadnt had a hangover since the morning after valentines day nor a drink nor any dope nor magic mushrooms nor even a fuck last night he had reached his target weight of nine stone six but what was the point of all this selfdenial if rupert wasnt going to declare arthur he glanced at his watch it would be too late in half an hour in the distance he could hear tiny yelling her head off because arthur had deserted her shed give him hell when he got back cant someone strangle that fucking shetland rupert stalked into the kitchen where taggie was turning sausages and frying eggs there are about thirty press messages on the machine she said desperately asking if youre going to run arthur not after the way he went this morning snapped rupert pouring himself a cup of black coffee and disappearing into his office the mornings papers didnt make lysander any happier there was a lot of guff about ruperts rutminster raiding party and how many winners he would get during the meeting the tabloids all concentrated on the contrast between penscombe pride and arthur beauty and the beast said the mail david with an exocet faces goliath with a sling quipped the sun why do the handsomest men choose the ugliest horse wrote the brunette from the scorpion how dare they pick on arthur lysander was practically in tears ill sue them hush shoving a piece of fried bread spread with marmalade into lysanders protesting mouth taggie led him to the door of ruperts office just listen its race rupert was saying in his flat drawl rutminster gold cup king arthur owned by lysander hawkley ridden by lysander hawkley thats right you still dont know whos riding the prince of darkness yet coming out of his office on his way to a venturer board meeting back at the house he found lysander leaning against the wall fighting back the tears again thank you rupert i wont let you down ive declared him but i wont run him unless it rains and go and have a haircut you cant ride in the rutminster with a ponytail everyone grew increasingly tense danny penscombe prides irish lad had been throwing up all morning even taggie was shouting at the press rupert in his board meeting was trying to concentrate on plummeting advertising revenue when there was a thundering on the door and lysander barged in whitefaced oh rupert arthurs lame hes going short on the offfore probably knocked himself this morning just poultice him now get out said rupert curtly just come and see him perlease so the entire board trooped down to the yard to have a look only to find arthur dramatically recovered hes winding you up dizzy chided lysander he does it to get sympathy and polos now although the yard was running down at the end of the season and most of the young horses had been turned out rupert hadnt wanted to waste a valuable stablelad on arthur to keep tabitha out of mischief he let her do the horse she had proved both responsible and efficient wearing a navyblue jersey which brought out the famous campbellblack eyes but was already coated with white hairs she stood on a bucket that afternoon to wash arthurs mane weve got to stop you rolling and getting yourself mucky before tomorrow she told him as arthur nudged her jeans pocket hopefully looking for polos lysander sitting on the edge of a stone tub of white narcissi holding arthurs lead rope with jack on his knee had been laboriously reading ivor herberts life of red rum to inspire arthur but had given up with the effort trapped in her stable tiny watched them beadily arthur has a look of rummy said lysander i wonder how many more stableboys the prince of darkness has eaten i tried to help one of the grooms at valhalla clip him once jesus he went apeshit i jumped on to the manger the groom shot out of the door i want to know whos going to ride him i bet rannaldinis got some nasty surprise god i hope he lets kitty come to rutminster tomorrow he was really upset that unlike most of paradise kitty hadnt sent him a goodluck card he had even driven over to magpie cottage in the lunch hour to check have you got a picture of her its a bit cracked lysander took a photograph out of his trouser pocket after a long pause tabitha said kindly i expect she looks better in the flesh lysander scratched his head no she doesnt really jacks very plain particularly on his whiteeyed side but hes got such a dear little face and arthur isnt classically beautiful either although i hate the press saying it but i love him to bits too but you dont want to go to bed with jack and arthur said tabitha shut your eyes darling she added as she hosed the soap out of arthurs forelock not bedbed i mean i suppose youre beautiful enough for two i feel safe with kitty confessed lysander since i lost weight im always cold the only thing that could make me warm would be her arms around me suddenly noticing the expression of desolation on tabs face lysander realized how tactless he was being taking her grubby little hands he pulled her off her bucket if i wasnt so hopelessly hooked on kitty id fall madly for you tab there isnt a single man in the world that wont slit his throat for you in a year or two like your father youre irresistible not to you said tabitha dolefully i got you a present it was a silver horseshoe brooch and he pinned it on her jersey oh thank you its lovely its going to bring you special luck mystic meg said your destiny was linked with the initial i god im nervous about seeing kitty returning at dusk from the second day of the rutminster meeting with two wins and a couple of places rupert was in a much better mood the raiding party was turning into a rout but the smile was wiped off his face when he went into the tackroom and found dizzy danny and the stable cat poring over the evening scorpion they all jumped when they saw him youre not going to like this said dizzy warily bloody beatties dumped again rannaldinis revenge said the frontpage headline once again rupert campbellblacks past has come back to haunt him and perhaps rob him of a third victory in the rutminster cup tomorrow ran the copy in it continued top showjumper jake lovell shocked the world by running off with the charismatic trainers beautiful first wife helen in the middle of the olympics eleven years later ruperts neighbour jetsetting conductor roberto rannaldini has brought jake lovells twentyyearold son isaac over from ireland to ride the brilliant but vicious prince of darkness in tomorrows race i was impressed by isaac when i saw him winning a race recently in ireland enthused the machiavellian maestro from valhalla his rutshire mansion he and the prince of darkness will annihilate penscombe pride without a word rupert turned to page three in a mafiaesque move worthy of his latin ancestors rannaldini could be paying back rupert for taking lysander hawkley under his wing funloving lysander son of hatchet hawkley headmaster of posh fleetley fees a year nicknamed the man who made husbands jealous because of a string of relationships with married women was caught cuddling and kissing rannaldinis much younger wife kitty in monthaut in december rupert was deceptively calm and as the stable cat who loved newspapers padded across the page he gently removed her so he could read on but as tab wandered in putting her arm round his shoulder to see what he was reading she caught a glimpse of isaac lovells thick dark sombre gypsys face and gave a moan of wonder wowwee he is gorgeous turning on her like a cobra rupert grabbed her shoulders shaking her until her bones rattled like castanets if you ever have anything to do with that little shit he hissed youre disinherited out of here never coming back see i dont see at all said tabitha flaring up you never approve of the men i like then as rupert stormed out is he worse than ashley much worse sighed dizzy ill tell you about it bastard bastard bastard eyes narrowed to slits rupert paced up and down the bedroom neat whisky in one hand cigar in the other helpless in the face of such volcanic fury taggie lay on the faded patchwork counterpane of the huge jacobean fourposter in which rupert had made love for so many years to his beautiful first wife pridiell win it with two legs tied together she stammered a new jockey wont make any difference youre the best trainer in the world noones heard of isaac lovell over here rupert got hopelessly uptight on the eve of big races it affected the whole yard he had hardly ever been nervous when he was showjumping because he was so confident of his own riding but now he could only mount the best jockeys on the best horses and pray it was the one time when he had to be kept really calm it all happened such a long time ago muttered taggie youre the most utterly ggorgeous glamorous faintmaking mmman in the world jake lovells a little squit sos rannaldini ill probably trip over both of them in the paddock taggie never bitched about anyone rupert looked down at her in amazement as she stood up and putting her hands on both sides of his rigidly clenched face pulled his mouth down to meet hers kiss me i love you so so much oh tag groaned rupert burying his face in her thick dark hair thank god for you youre absolutely right its all in the past jake did me such a good turn im such a boring old reactionary and im so against divorce id probably still be miserably unhappy with helen if he hadnt walked off with her and never married you and been so divinely happy it just destroys me because he beat me in the olympics and sex if you know what i mean but if i lost the war i won the peace pulling her down on the bed beside him he reached inside his jacket pocket ive got something for you he handed her two openended firstclass tickets to bogotá were going babyhunting then when taggie looked up in incredulous hope the nuns have accepted our application if we fly out to colombia and stay there for six weeks really convincing them were serious about wanting a baby theyll find us one taggie couldnt speak like the moons reflection in a lake ruffled by a wakeful carp her pale face suddenly disintegrated rupert could feel her tears as she covered his face with kisses oh i love you a real baby i cant believe it oh dyou think theyll like us enough theyll like you ill have to behave myself and give them a fat cheque thought rupert i wonder if itll be a he or a she blond or black hair oh rupert itll certainly be black market said rupert our little blackmarket baby and six weeks together what bliss but i hope you wont be too bored she added anxiously whatll you do i can think of one thing rupert slowly unbuttoned her harebellblue cardigan and unhooked her bra so like cream boiling over her wonderful breasts spilled out putting his lips to one nipple he sucked gently just as desperate for her attention and love as any baby he thought wryly im terribly sweaty and unwashed mumbled taggie as he pushed up her scarlet skirt and burrowed under the dark purple tights and skimpy knickers rejoicing that he could get her that wet so quickly after five years of marriage finding it always as exciting as pulling a groom in the back of a loose box for the first time rupert moved his fingers upwards as taggies hands fumbled with his zip naked whiteskinned utterly gorgeous her dark hair tickling his belly she kissed him everywhere her tongue as delicate and subtle as a lurchers oh my angel wriggling down he slid inside her hearing her gasp of joy as he warmed her with his body and constantly moving hands oh rupert rupert rupert rupert rupert rupert taggies voice had suddenly got deeper and was accompanied he realized by someone hammering on the door and then good god opening it rupert im really sorry to bother you oh christ lysander clapped his hands over his eyes i mean really sorry but i think arthurs been nobbled he keeps yawning and he hasnt eaten his last feed ill nobble you you little fucker howled rupert scooping up a shoe from the carpet and hurling it in lysanders direction get out get out arthurs exhausted because you keep waking him up to see if hes ok and hes not hungry because the entire press have been stuffing him with polos in the end chivvied by taggie rupert tugged on a pair of jeans and ran barefoot across the parched lawn to the yard in his box he found arthur lying flat out waving a huge foot in the air snoring loudly one eye open seeing his tormentor however he lumbered up and hid behind tiny shivering with terror in the corner his newly washed coat and particularly his mane once more stained with green oh dear lysander blushed hes made a lightning recovery i do think he went on hastily arthur ought to have a security guard tomorrow pridies got a guard and closedcircuit television in his box and the prince of darknessll have all rannaldinis hoods around him hes got tiny said rupert avoiding the shetlands darting teeth and deciding not to blow his top now will you please stop wasting my time im sorry lysander hung his head i gather all this isaac lovell business has upset you bloody unfair cant make head nor tail of it myself who is isaac lovell anyway his father ran off with my first wife bastard like you want to run off with kitty rannaldini said rupert bolting the halfdoor not at all said lysander indignantly rannaldinis an utter shit and a bully who beats up horses and women and never stops humiliating poor darling kitty by screwing around you were never like that hum your faith in me is touching you didnt know me in the old days old days is old days lysander blushed again i used to be a bit of a stud myself in the past but i want you to know you and taggie have really restored my faith in marriage as an institution ta very much said rupert i had better go back and er institute it what are you going to do with yourself this evening watch the video of last years rutminster again and then play poker with danny and dizzy were teaching tab shell beat you all said rupert but i want you in bed early lysander slept fitfully and woke at a quarterpast three in twelve hours exactly if by some miracle he got to ride theyd be lining up at the start in twelve hours ten minutes it would all be over and after tomorrow would rupert kick him out despite his misery over kitty hed been happier living at penscombe than anywhere else desperate for some sign of rain he opened the window and was mocked by a million stars the lawn was lit by daffodils and a clump of white cherry trees already in bloom it had been so mild the constellation of leo the lion was romping off to his lair in the west but any moment lysander expected his great shaggy face to appear back over the top of ruperts beechwood to bite the great bear in the bum longing as never before for kittys arms he collapsed into an armchair he must have drifted off again for the next minute he was galloping up ruperts track and arthur was going gloriously and he could hear far more menacing than rannaldinis tympani the thunder of hoofs behind him but noone was going to catch arthur the stands were rising to cheer him go on go on go on yelled lysander lysander lysander wake up its tipping down it was a few seconds before he realized tabitha was shaking him and the thunder of hoofs was torrential rain machinegunning the roof leaning out of the window into niagara he could see the downpour flattening the daffodils stripping the white cherries flooding the gutters sluicing the valley yippee yippee arthurs in with a chance lysander let out a great tarzan howl hugging tab until she screamed for mercy and jack began yapping with excitement when you come back to earth announced tab the tooth fairys been under lysanders pillow still in its polythene wrapping lay a vast blue rug braided with emerald green and with the initials rcb which always brought bookmakers out in a cold sweat embroidered in the corner daddy had it made up specially any of the normal rugs look like saddle blankets on arthur then as lysander buried the balls of his thumbs in his eyes its ok daddy really likes you lysander few would have thought it later in the morning as rupert shouted at everyone in the yard danny was throwing up in the even bluey was silent and preoccupied during the gallops on which rupert had insisted to give an air of normality to the day only arthur was unmoved as he breakfasted on carrots oats and a handful of dandelions newly picked by taggie have you got arthurs passport and your medical card nagged tabitha lysander was packing his bag putting in pain killers because his shoulder was still giving him hell and his own beautiful colours which hed chosen himself white sleeves blackandwhite body and brown cap because they were the same colours as jack he was wearing his donald duck jersey which taggie had finally dragged off his back yesterday and hand washed the morning seemed endless but at last the lorry containing penscombe pride arthur tiny and three younger horses splashed down the drive splitting the pack of press outside the gates with their barbours over their cameras charlies going to do a runner said tabitha as they passed penscombes betting shop everyones put so much money on pridie and on arthur for a place his odds have shortened from to and you should see the champagne theyve got on ice for a mega pissup this evening at the goat and boots im going to be sick again hanging out of the window danny came back inside absolutely drenched if it rains any more its going to be too wet for pridie water was pouring in a tidal wave down the high street ouch grumbled lysander as he bit his cheek instead of his chewing gum im injured before i get to the course he felt even worse as he read the horoscopes in the sun arthurs going to have a good day for shopping i hope that isnt a misprint for stopping said tab the ancient town of rutminster with its splendid cathedral and russet queen anne close lay in a bowl of hills covered in thick raindrenched woodland in a sensible marriage of secular and ecclesiastical the racecourse was only divided from the cathedral water meadows by the river fleet which was rising steadily as rupert and lysander walked the course despite the relentless downpour and the lurking fog it was very mild and the ground was already filling up helicopters were constantly landing and the bookies were doing excellent business under their coloured umbrellas lysander never dreamt the fences would be so huge not for nothing was the rutminster called the grand national of the south down by the start rupert turned up the collar of his barbour you must push arthur on noone misses the beat youve got a very short run up to the first fence if youre not at the front at this stage you can get boxed in or squeezed out from then on your best bet is to hunt arthur round in the middle letting the leaders exhaust themselves trying to pass pridie this is a sod he went on as they stopped at five foot of closely stacked birch and gorse with a huge ditch on the other side if you hit it below six inches arthurll turn over if he drops his legs in the water itll slow him up meet it right and you wont know hes jumped it i wish arthur were walking the course sighed lysander hes got a better memory than me give him a breather here said rupert as they climbed a steep hill to a fence lysander could hardly see over and you must stand back at this one its known as the ambush because theres a terrific drop on the other side yummy yuppy unshipped his jockey here last year he tried to pop over on a short stride and bellied into it piss off he snapped as two men approached with a camera could you take a picture of us beside this fence said the first in a strong irish accent no we cant as lysander reached out for the camera rupert hustled him on concentrate for christs sake they had reached the top of the course now and threequarters of a mile away could see the stands and the cathedral spire soaring above its scaffolding if a favourite moves up here you can hear a great cheer from the crowd its quite eerie and ive got to go round twice said lysander in a hollow voice as they squelched down to the bottom of the hill this is where you fork right for the final run in explained rupert and the horse sees the crowd in all its yelling glory for the first time paddywack lost the race here last year his head came up he saw the crowd and jimmy jardine felt him coming back pridie passed him and it cost jimmy the race so keep a hold of arthur arthur loves crowds hell accelerate if he gets this far this is a tricky fence said rupert as they rounded the bend into the home straight if you go flat out youll turn over take a pull and you lose momentum jump it wide and youll lose a few vital yards that could cost you the race blueyll be taking the paint off the rails from now on if arthurs still on his big feet its a chance of surviving home blueys so experienced hell be on automatic pilot now but youre likely to tense up with nerves and miss a vital gap if bluey comes to a bottleneck he just pushes his way through freeze for a second and youve had it and if you come up on the inside even blueyll squeeze you out glancing at lysanders vacant stare the shadows under his eyes the pale translucent skin not even tinged with pink by the lashing rain rupert was worried hed pushed him too hard what have i just said that even a mate like bluey will try and squeeze arthur out good boy for eleven thousand pounds in his pocket any jockey will kill his mother all that matters from here is to get your whip out and your head down and go like hell youll hear a roar like youve never heard youll ride into a tunnel of yelling faces and youll think the post will never come but dont let up till youre past the post when you hear tab screaming with relief in the stablelads stand youll know youre ok thank you rupert lysander felt overwhelmed with gratitude that rupert should take the whole thing so seriously we wont let you down then as an ambulance screeched by when i was at the dentists the other day i popped into a solicitors and made a will its in my bedroom drawer if i dont come back id like tab to have arthur and you to have jack hes had such a ball since hes been at penscombe as long as you leave tiny to rannaldini said rupert rannaldini had a household staying for the rutminster including the chairman of the board of the new world phil a squat jolly businessman called graydon gluckstein whom he was determined to impress as a result kitty had hardly had a moment to think having bought a donald duck goodluck card for lysander she had torn it up it was immoral to send it if she were trying to save her marriage having not been allowed to see the scorpion she hadnt realized the connection between rupert and the pale watchful jockey isaac lovell whom rannaldini had singled out to wrestle with the prince of darkness he had dropped in for a drink last night all that matters is that you annihilate bluey charteris and penscombe pride she heard rannaldini saying as he shut the door on them both kitty longed to look her best on the day of the race but as shed been wracked with morning sickness worse than danny and the rain that suited arthur only crinkled the hair shed blowdried straight there wasnt much hope although rutminster was only fifteen miles away rannaldini insisted on ferrying his party which also included hermione and bob meredith and rachel and guy and georgie by helicopter terrified of throwing up over the dovegrey suede upholstery kitty pleaded lastminute shopping in rutminster for the celebration party the utterly confident rannaldini was planning for that evening when everyone would drink krug out of the rutminster cup having bought some homemade pâté and a side of smoked salmon from a delicatessen in the high street kitty drove past the russet houses of the close peering out behind their fans of magnolia grandiflora and parking her car popped in to the cathedral the numbers of the hymns were up for palm sunday tomorrow in a side chapel pinned to a green baize screen kitty noticed childrens drawings of jesus riding into jerusalem on donkeys even more outlandishly shaped than arthur would the baby inside her which could so easily be lysanders one day draw pictures like that she thought despairingly as she sunk to her knees on a faded crimson hassock please please dear god pleaded kitty let him get round i dont care if he wins just let him come back safe hes so brave and reckless surely it wasnt adultery to pray for someones safety through the clearglass lattice window to her right fringes of rain were falling out of dark purple clouds on to the palest green leaves just emerging from the chestnut trees rains good for arfur god but please dont let him slip beside her lay the stone effigy of robert lord rutminster who died in the crusades he had puddingbasin hair and his nose broken off but he was flanked by stone angels with a little dog like jack at his feet kitty ran a finger down his pale battered translucent face oh let angels ride on lysanders shoulders too wiping away the tears she quickly lit a candle for him walking towards the door she saw a man standing beneath the tattered colours of the local regiments he looked vaguely familiar so she smiled then went absolutely scarlet as she realized the last time shed seen him shed been in her bra and knickers bopping in the rain as she scuttled out however she looked round good luck she stammered good luck kitty said david hawkley any comfort she might have felt evaporated as clive slid forward out of nowhere to open the door of the mini to take her to the races rutminster racecourse on the final day of the meeting had never been fuller anticipating victory for rupert who was a huge local hero and forgetting the recession the multitude were drowning their sorrows penscombe pride would get them out of trouble pay their mortgage arrears their poll tax and their daughters wedding as the beautiful little bay with his bright questing eyes and his zig zag blaze who had never fallen in his life or lost in his last eight races strutted round the paddock like a bantam cock noone would have thought he carried top weight and the expectation of hundreds of thousands of punters tendeep they gathered round the rails to admire him he was followed at a respectable distance by the prince of darkness who was a hand bigger he looked magnificent with his bloodred rug rolled back to show rippling muscle worthy of a black middleweight champion but his evil eye rolled and his jaws strained against his muzzle and everyone kept clear of his hoofs because he could lash out with all four of them of the thirty other runners the most serious contenders were camomile lawn a fleet chestnut mare so flashy tab said she ought to wear an ankle bracelet male nurse a stocky brown gelding who jumped and stayed well yummy yuppy the handsome dark bay who had fallen last year blarney stone who had won the irish grand national paddywack who was third to penscombe pride and the prince of darkness last year and fräulein mahler rannaldinis second horse whom lysander had ridden into the lake last summer a ripple of delighted laughter ran through the crowd as arthur entered the paddock a hand bigger than any other horse shambling round like a great circus elephant his coat gleaming like an iceberg he was plainly delighted at the attention he was causing the crowd particularly the men admired his slim blond stablegirl with her exquisite bone structure and arrogant eyes and seeing rcb on arthurs new blue rug made the connection and nodded wisely that horse couldnt win if it started last week yelled a wag on the steps dont be so fucking sure yelled back tabitha the crowd roared in no doubt now that she was ruperts daughter and they were delighted when georgie maguire ravishing in a suit of grassgreen silk sheltered by a pink peonypatterned umbrella gave tab the twohundredpound prize for the best turnedout horse up in the private boxes after excellent lunches the rich and sometimes famous and their satellite freeloaders looked down on the runners the noisiest most glamorous throng inhabited the venturer television box they included freddie jones pridies coowner as plump and as jolly as his writer wife lizzie and taggies parents declan and maud ohara who hadnt forgiven rupert for his crack about arthur staying longer than she did billy lloydfoxe ruperts old showjumping crony who was doing the commentary for venturer and his wanton blond wife janey who was covering the race for the daily post and finally ricky francelynch polo captain of england whod had lysanders ponies at livery and his adorably pretty painter wife daisy who was busy sketching everything in sight by ghastly irony rannaldinis box was bang next door and rannaldini ignored them icily but he couldnt stop freddie jones gossiping to larry about the way the recession had stymied the electronics business nor meredith and hermione radiant in squashy blond furs casting covetous eyes at rupert nor the chairman of the new world phil who was enjoying the hospitality more than the horses gazing at taggie who echoed ruperts colours in a dark blue suit with an emeraldgreen turban and whose navybluestockinged legs were longer than any of the horses i fancy male nurse said meredith taking his eyes off rupert for a second to study his racecard that figures said guy i fancy busty beauty that figures too thought georgie georgie didnt care because shed had glorious sex with guy that morning because people had shoved hermione aside to mob her and get her autograph when shed arrived at the course and because shed been asked to present the turnout prize and because down below on the grass watching his son go round the paddock looking aloof and byronic stood david hawkley they had just managed to avoid the press and snatch a blissful two minutes together behind the hot dog stand why therefore was she so upset when she caught guy giving julias friend daisy francelynch a discreet wave had ricky and daisy had cosy foursomes with julia and guy oh look meredith broke into her reverie rannaldini and divine rupert have both come into the paddock very dirty of rannaldini to have raked up isa lovell perhaps rupert will challenge him to a duel weighed out dressed in his black white and brown colours lysander huddled in the jockeys changing room trying to keep down half a cup of sweet tea his knees were knocking his mind a blank he couldnt remember any of ruperts instructions around him jockeys hid their nerves in hectic skylarking rushing to the lavatory when he arrived he had found a note pinned to the door in blueys handwriting this bog is reserved for lysander hawkley for the next two hours and smiled feebly but he couldnt join in all he could think was that he might see kitty again in a minute but she was probably too frightened of horses to venture into the paddock and he mustnt let rupert tab and arthur down at least this mornings shaving cuts had stopped bleeding as tense as a sprung trap in the woods rupert didnt hear a word freddie jones was saying as he waited for isaac lovell to come out with the other jockeys he was trying to be rational but in his head he was back in with isas father jake winning his silver and rupert coming nowhere on the most expensive showjumper in the world there was that shit rannaldini in his black astrakhan coat and poor little kitty looking as bombed as a stuffed fox in a glass case and there rupert gave a hiss was isa lovell a couple of inches taller than rannaldini but with the same dark gypsy stillness as his father which always captivated women and horses for a second ruperts eyes met isas then slid away as he felt all the old black murderous churning he is a little squit whispered taggie squeezing her hand until she winced rupert was relieved when the other jockeys spilled out as if from a conjurers coloured handkerchief into the paddock the safety pin holding lysanders high black collar had come undone taggie refastened it like arthur he towered over his rivals but he was thinner than any of them even his browntopped boots were loose like scarlett ohara being laced into her stays arthur groaned as his girths were tightened its all right darling tabitha kissed him on his whiskery nose tomorrow youll be turned out to get fat and eat as much grass as you like having seen bluey safely mounted on pridie rupert came over to give lysander a leg up indignant at being ignored by his master who was desperately scanning the private boxes for a glimpse of kitty arthur deliberately stood on lysanders toe fucking hell arthur after all ive done for you lysander gathered up the reins stop looking for mrs rannaldini or ill put you in blinkers chided rupert checking arthurs girths now take it slowly although you havent got much option on arthur and remember no black power salutes until youre ten yards past the post and dont forget but lysander never heard what he was going to say because arthur who never forgot a hand that fed him had given his great vesuvius whicker and carted his master and tab hauling helplessly on his lead rope across the paddock to lay his great hairy face against kittys and start eating her racecard oh arfur kitty hugged the only horse in the world of whom she wasnt terrified for a second she and lysander gazed at each other her little pug face was flushed from the hospitality tent there were raindrops in her hair which crinkled unbecomingly her eyes were red but to lysander she had never looked more adorable kitty only noticed how the weight lysander had lost showed off his beautiful bone structure his huge eyes and his long brown curly eyelashes and how his hips had gone to nothing but his shoulders were still wide stunned by the intensity of their passion neither of them could speak tab meanwhile was gazing at isa lovell who was as dark and slender as a tuscany cypress in the moonlight and who was about to mount a plunging prince of darkness swinging round rannaldini was temporarily distracted by her disdainful beauty the little campbellblack child would be an amusing conquest he was about to introduce her to isa lovell which would be an even more amusing one when suddenly he caught sight of lysander and heard him mutter me and arthur are trying to win this race for you kitty thats very unlikely interrupted rannaldini with your track record youll be lucky to get off at the start and this must be arthur i didnt know rupert was reduced to training carthorses lysander would have ridden arthur into him if rupert hadnt called him back good luck lysander come ome safe and arfur too cried kitty defiantly arthur gazed back at her most reproachfully for not producing any breadandbutter pudding lysander looked so thin and pale on the great white horse that for a second david hawkley was reminded of the skeleton death in durers etching of the four horsemen of the apocalypse good luck god bless you he called as his son clattered past but the wind and rain swept his words away tabitha gave arthur a last hug as she released him on to the course please come back safely she said shakily then smiling exactly like her father and in front im off to put all my turnout money on arthur leaving the paddock rupert nearly collided with isa lovell pale and expressionless and now astride the fearsome leaping prince of darkness he could have been the jake rupert had first battled with on the showjumping circuit twenty years ago hallo isa he drawled i owe your father actually then turning to taggie stunning in her slim blue suit dont you think i got the better bargain i gather jakes still lumbered with the same clappedout model rupert said taggie in horror isa would have had no scruples about riding the prince into rupert but he had a race to win instead hissing a gypsy curse he spat neatly at ruperts feet before thundering after the others the press were going berserk the jockeys as was traditional showed their horses the first fence a rampantly impatient penscombe pride nearly jumped it as it was a long time since breakfast arthur started to eat it a pratinahat then brayed through the downpour for the jockeys to line up the prince of darkness lashing his tail like an angry cat flattened his ears and tried to take a chunk out of arthur i wouldnt lysander lifted his whip you shouldnt take up so much room mocked isa lovell in his flat birmingham accent a summer meadowful of butterflies was fluttering in lysanders belly his black brown and white colours were drenched with rain and sweat the reins slipped through his stiff trembling fingers the rain drummed impatient fingers on his helmet what the hell had rupert said about the first fence gigantic gelding of little account white elephant nohoper carthorse he thought furiously well show them arthur noone could see anything beyond the second fence several overeager runners including pridie and the prince of darkness were pushing their noses over the tape turn round jockeys get back brayed the pratinahat i cant get it up thats nothing new you asshole muttered bluey as they all swung round and realigned starting to giggle lysander was petrified he wouldnt be able to stop they were all bunched together snap went the tape and the rutminster cup was under way lysander never dreamt it would be so fast the light brigade hurtling into the valley of death didnt have to stop and jump huge fences his face and colours were instantly caked with mud kicked back from horses in front but heeding ruperts words he managed to keep up with the hurtling barging leaders over the first fence and then as they fanned out and rattled over the rutminster cheltenham road he and arthur settled into an easy stride bowling along in the middle of the field meanwhile little penscombe pride who loathed being overtaken had set off at a cracking pace but as he took the lead over the first fence fräulein mahler the princes stablemate who never lasted more than a mile and a half revved up beside him forcing pridie to go even faster unsettling and muddling him so he hit the second fence hard fucking hell muttered rupert he stood apart from the others in the box tense as a waiting leopard cigar between his long first and second fingers binoculars flattening his dark blond eyelashes taggie knew better than to talk until the race was over penscombe pride was still out in front but having seen off fräulein mahler who had dropped back the gutsy little bay was now being challenged by the prince of darkness which denied him a breather as he climbed the hill forcing him to gallop on isa lovell sat absolutely still and let his horse have its head just the same technique as his father thought rupert savagely the prince was going really well rupert chewed on his cigar all this would rattle pridie and wear him out he winced as that most careful of jumpers hit the ambush hard that would shake his confidence even more and now the prince was dropping back for a rest and fräulein was storming down with the last of her strength to challenge and rattle again shit thought rupert in outrage these were just the sort of spoiling tactics with which hed won races himself lysander hoped arthur wasnt going too fast he seemed to be enjoying himself it was like a jigsaw you saw a gap and slotted in when you could now the big ditch was racing towards him he searched his brains what had rupert said take off about eight feet away he steadied arthur who flew over like a huge white swan beside him blarney stone only realized there was a ditch when he was on top of the fence dropping his legs in it and knocking the stuffing out of himself rupert was right arthur had nearly reached the next fence by the time blarney stone had recovered youre doing brilliantly arthur said lysander arthur flapped his ears relishing the cheers of the drenched crowds at each fence coming up to the ambush five solid feet of birch and gorse with a drop on the other side which had caught out yummy yuppy last year and so shaken pridie first time round lysander stood back again but camomile lawn half a length behind was encouraged to take off at the same time hit the fence smack on the way down and slipped on landing rolling over and over bad luck you ok shouted lysander he was able to give arthur a breather as instructed as they climbed the now hopelessly churnedup hill so he was able to gallop down like a three year old they must be lying about fifteenth now over the road and into the second circuit but alas the fog reluctant to miss such an exciting race had come down lysander couldnt see more than a fence in front better put your fog lamps on arthur no sign of lysander said hermione with her horrid laugh she was bored by racing for seven minutes all the attention was focused on someone else peering through the fog at the riders colours bobbing along the rail like a longtailed chinese new year dragon kitty strained her eyes to identify lysander and strained her ears which were full of water from washing her hair to hear the commentary every so often she glanced fearfully back at the monitor which was now showing penscombe pride and the prince of darkness slogging it out about ten fences from home oh guy i know hes fallen she whispered oh god look she froze with terror as a loose horse appeared out of the mist and circumnavigating helicopters and ambulances hurtled across the centre of the course theres lysander lying about thirteenth said guy look hes going really well come on lysander you wouldnt recognize him nor arthur said georgie theyre both covered in mud arthur was always a mudlark said kitty in a shaky voice then aware of her husband glaring at her she added meekly the prince is going very well too isa lovell had been brought up to detest rupert campbellblack he couldnt overtake penscombe pride but he knew the horse was tiring bluey had shifted him on to a different leg to wake him up and he wasnt running totally straight now they were coming up for the second time to the ambush only six fences from home pridie was very tired unsettled and encased in fog with rain lashing his face but he didnt stop battling glancing round bluey saw isa lovells white and mudspattered face blazing with hatred and almost crossed himself pridie was aware of a dark shape stealing up on the rails sinister as a shadow on the lung concentration flickering he took off too late half a ton of horseflesh hit the massed panel of gorse and birch six inches too low penscombe pride and the punters of rutshire and gloucester gave a grunt of pain as he went head over heels for the first time in his life next moment as the prince overtook them yummy yuppy was in the air he swivelled to the left to avoid pridie landing awkwardly and crashed with a sickening thud busty beauty paddywack and the following horses joined the pileup a second later the fog was thickened with swearing horses legs thrashed the air bits of gorse and birch lay everywhere fräulein exhausted anyway took one look at the pandemonium on the other side of the fence and decided enough was enough as the closedcircuit television picked up the disaster with not very good pictures rupert was absolutely stunned i do not believe this he said very slowly tearing up his betting slips then turning to a distraught and tearful freddie jones we were fucking robbed im going to object good old boy clever old arthur blithely unaware of this catastrophe lysander came trundling through the fog into what indeed looked like the remains of the light brigade with mudcoated horses and riders picking themselves out of the quagmire with varying degrees of success holding arthur steady standing back once again lysander jumped to the right seeing a huddled jockey motionless beneath him arthur veered to the left in midair like a zeppelin changing course and though pecking on landing was brilliantly picked up by lysander as arthur flatfooted carefully through the chaos lysander was aware of a grimy drenched figure running along beside him bluey lysander shouted in horror are you ok sure pridies buggered off home go get that fucker on the prince of darkness we will thought lysander as he cantered arthur up the hill waiting for the great roar from the crowd which would tell him that the leaders had emerged from the fog but it never came they couldnt be too far ahead sock it to them it was jimmy jardine cadging a cigarette from someone in the crowd as he walked an utterly knackered blarney stone back home come on arthur urged lysander weve got a train to catch the further the old horse galloped the better he seemed to go like a volvo that needed a long run dying with pride lysander was riding like a dream now sitting very quietly letting arthur choose his own pace and the place to jump his great stride devouring the ground then lysander gave a strangled whoop of joy as through the mist he glimpsed isa lovells bloodred colours and the sleek black rump of the prince of darkness only a fence ahead male nurse was beside him harrying him giving him a taste of his own medicine hitting the next fence the prince of darkness veered to the right went wide round the corner and lost a few yards as arthur pounded up on the inside hugging the rails male nurse was at last in the lead but just as rupert had predicted he was a young horse and when he saw this huge yelling mass of faces waving their arms and making more noise than hed ever heard his head came up and his jockey felt him coming back and both arthur and the prince of darkness passed him arthur loved crowds now was the time for a bit of showing off but the prince was still three lengths ahead they were into the home straight with two fences to go lysander could see the hoof marks of earlier runners he must keep his nerve ahead the prince furious at being challenged was looming over from the right determined to squeeze him out if he froze for a second it would cost him the race for a second isa lovell glanced round his face torn with hatred campbellblacks bumboy he hissed that did it remembering the rideoffs in polo lysander asked arthur to push through white elephants dont forget not wanting to be bitten again arthur put on an incredible burst of speed just grazing the prince as they drew alongside thundering neck and neck to the last fence meeting it spoton arthur took a great kangaroo leap that must put us two lengths ahead thought lysander but soon the princell rally and catch up oh go on arthur he begged and arthur gallantly slogged on up the hill as fast as his great raking stride would take him but now there were only the ghosts of previous winners to challenge him because the prince of darkness had fallen brought down by the last fence may i borrow your binoculars kitty asked hermione this bit looks rather exciting no you may not said kitty snatching them back her hands were shaking so much she could hardly hold them still oblivious of rannaldinis howl of rage when the prince had fallen she was now screaming her head off with excitement arthur cleared the last fence and with a vigour utterly belying his thirteen years gallumphed towards the post lysander had no need to pick up his whip david hawkley thought his heart would burst with pride and there was never such a roar of amazed delight at rutminster as arthur came up the straight his great feet splaying out rolling along like the bull terrier at the end of the incredible journey lop ears flapping to catch every word his young master was saying my christ said rupert whod completely recovered his good temper putting his arm round a joyfully sobbing taggie is that the same old donkey who was always last on the gallops come on arthur hes fucking going to do it god the boy rides like an angel said ricky francelynch in delight as if someone had tossed a match into a box of fireworks the entire venturer box erupted in ecstasy come on arfur you can fucking do it screamed kitty to the amazement of hermione and the chairman of the new world phil and the whitefaced quivering fury of rannaldini come on lysander howled guy and georgie clutching each other glancing round lysander saw male nurse ebbing away in the distance realizing it was in the bag and with the post only fifty yards away he gave a great tarzan howl of joy that was drowned in the deafening roar of the crowd weve done it arthur he yelled and completely forgetting ruperts warning he punched a fist in the air this seemed to startle and unbalance arthur whod always veered to the left when he was tired suddenly he stumbled and to the collective horror of the crowd he reeled utterly punchdrunk for a second then lurched quite out of control towards the rails crashing into them he hurled lysander over his head within a yard of the finishing post for a moment lysander lay still then dragging himself groggily to his feet he staggered over to arthur collapsing on top of him flinging his arms round the horses great white motionless body he pummelled at him with his fists sobbing his heart out the racecourse fell silent there was hardly a cheer as male nurse slid wearily past the post it was as though the mute button had been pressed on the whole crowd utterly appalled many in tears they watched the sorecently joyful and youthful conqueror blood and phlegm pouring from his nose on to his muddy shirt and breeches as he slumped crying piteously over the huge ugly horse whose gallant best in the end had not been enough the next moment tabitha had raced up from the stablelads stand and collapsing sobbed dementedly beside lysander oh arthur darling arthur wake up i dont believe it walking quietly back leading a shaken but unharmed prince of darkness isa lovell dropped a sympathetic hand briefly on her shoulder as he passed before rannaldini could stop her kitty had fled from the box clattering down the grey stone steps shoving her way through the boiling cauldron of crowd what appened me darlin asked an irishman arfurs dead broken his neck sobbed kitty it seemed to take hours to battle her way round the paddock where arthur had shambled so jauntily only half an hour ago barging into the changing room she pushed past jockeys in various stages of undress and some with just coloured towels round their hips but all utterly shocked as they looked on helplessly lysander sat huddled in a chair his head in his hands rupert in a mad rage was yelling at him you fucking bloody idiot goofing off like that if youd kept him straight hed never have crashed into the rails why didnt you bloody listen to me shut up rupert yelled kitty back it werent lysanders fault lysander looked up his face was a chaos of tears blood and mud oh kitty i let him down no you didnt my lambkin kitty flung her arms round lysanders frantically shuddering body cradling his head against her breasts you rode the most wonderful race in the world they forget winners in a week but arfurll be remembered for ever he won really his great eart just gave out dont be fatuous roared rupert he broke his fucking neck how dyou know it was that you great bully screamed kitty it might have been his eart or his legs givin out and then he broke his neck fallin into the rails there hasnt been a postmortem its all right pet it wasnt your fault she clung to lysander trying to warm him and still his sobs what the hells going on a chill had entered the room a waft of maestro mingled with the stench of sweat and antiseptic beneath his icy calm such was the gale force of rannaldinis fury that the jockeys drew back do you want to make a complete fool of yourself he hissed at kitty then nodding icily at rupert sorry about the horse it was bad luck to lose like that come kitty you are needed in the box we have guests to entertain lysander looked up in bewilderment dont go he said hanging on to kitty in anguish please dont leave me clamping kittys arm like a vice rannaldini almost dragged her out of the changing room on the way they passed david hawkley wheres lysander in there please look after im begged kitty he needs you so badly for a second david took her rough frozen hands you ok yes yes sobbed kitty but i should ave lighted a candle for arfur as well only when they were outside among the crowds did rannaldini let rip a lethal lava of invective far worse than any of his screaming tantrums to the london met hypnotized by his frenziedly yelling mouth his blackmaddened flashing eyes sickened by the smell of frying hamburgers and the animal reek of wet sheepskin coats all round her kitty started to sway suddenly she crumpled and was sent flying by a fractious crowd deprived of the result they wanted and pushing through to watch the next race as she was trampled underfoot she lost consciousness desolately empty of arthur ruperts lorry rolled back to penscombe in respect of such a death the curtains had been drawn along penscombe high street the streamers bunting and flags had been put back in their boxes for once charlie the bookmaker was heartbroken to make a killing everyone had got to know and love arthur as hed shambled along the lanes at the goat and boots where he had stopped for his daily pint the champagne had gone back to the cellar stonyfaced the stablelads and girls unloaded the remaining horses taggie tried to comfort an inconsolable tab who lay on her bed sobbing arthur arthur over and over again sacked by rupert lysander was so deranged with grief he had to be given a shot by the course vet now crashed out at magpie cottage where hed been put to bed by his father he lay curled up with a watchful worried jack in his arms having tidied up the mess as best he could david made himself as comfortable as possible in an armchair and waited for his son to wake unable to sleep rupert padded down to the yard to check pridie who was a bit stiff but would live to despatch any opposition another day but he seemed cast down at the loss of his wise old friend none of the horses would get any sleep with that shetland keeping up such a din hardly able to bring himself to go into arthurs box rupert found tiny crouched in a far corner the picture of furious hysterical desolation come on said rupert gently stretching out a hand then hastily withdrawing it as tiny let out a squeal of misery and lunged at him bloody minded when unhappy just like me thought rupert having got rid of his guests rannaldini remembered his role of faithful loving husband and rolled up to see kitty where she had been kept overnight at rutminster hospital he was greeted by dr benson who was in an excellent mood having had a thousand pounds each way on male nurse how is she asked rannaldini as james drew him into matrons office for a drink shaken and a bit bruised for a start she needs rest and she shouldnt lose any more weight been overdoing things anything else the matter with her asked rannaldini irritably thinking of the new york job where kitty would need all her energy well this should be champagne said james handing rannaldini a glass of red kittys pregnant congratulations what it was like the first great crash in the verdi requiem about three months id say james smiled happily best thing that could happen to her been longing for a baby since you two got married endured all those tests always felt inadequate when all your other wives dropped children so effortlessly sweet girl worth ten of all the rest if you dont mind my saying then seeing rannaldinis utterly bleak expression dont need me to tell you women need a lot of love at times like this but were probably moving to new york next month no problem just see youre well insured dear boy rannaldini was a seriously rattled man he was furious at not winning the gold cup and at the very public humiliation of lysander and kitty clinging to each other in front of rupert and all those jockeys he needed kitty as never before to smooth the path for him if he were to conquer new york and tame the toughest orchestra in the world but not with a squawling brat around he left his glass of red he needed a clear head youre right james he said jumping to his feet kitty is a wonderful girl i ate being without her eef i wrap her in cotton wool can i take her ome this evening i dont see why not james was delighted by this unexpected display of affection following rannaldini into kittys little room where she lay whiter than her pillow he was further gratified to see rannaldini take kittys hand and stroke her forehead my darleeng youre coming ome with me so i can look after you there was no way he was going to leave her vulnerable in hospital with lysander hawkley on the prowl leaping and pirouetting in delight lassie greeted her mistress when they got back to valhalla rannaldini instantly sat kitty down on the blue and white striped sofa in the summer parlour banked up the fire poured her a glass of brandy and turned on hansel and gretel pianissimo which he knew she loved he didnt even kick up when lassie joined her on the sofa there were more important issues like persuading kitty to have an abortion but i couldnt itd be wicked she whispered in horror rannaldini sat down beside her stroking her hair it is wonderful news that we know you can get pregnant he said soothingly it means we can have loads of other cheeldren later my keety but i do not know eef this kid is mine or lysanders i am machoman he shrugged engagingly but menacingly i would find it hoplessly deeficult to love another mans child or at least to be in doubt and what about your pack of children that ive tried and tried to love thought kitty bitterly i cant ave an abortion she said trembling at her own courage well discuss it some other time at least promise not to tell anyone about the baby until we decide what to do said rannaldini sharply then changing tack and becoming conciliatory you are cold you must ave a nice hot bath and i weel come and dry you like a leetle girl oh please please no thought kitty in horror fortunately rannaldini was distracted by the telephone emerging from the quickest bath in history kitty found that lassie had shredded a roll of lavatory paper all over the landing carpet white horses on an olivegreen sea very pleased with herself she bounced up to kitty seizing the bottom of her dressing gown and tugged it open to reveal her mistress still wet and naked my child rannaldini moved forward to touch her no kitty shrank away i still feel queer of course i just wanted to old you in my arms i bring you sleeping pill sulphuryellow it lay on the palm of his hands i dont like takin those fings my dear james said complete rest kitty longed for time alone to mourn the passing of arthur but within a couple of minutes sleep engulfed her downstairs rannaldini planned his next move the sooner kitty was removed from lysanders clutches the better but maddeningly graydon gluckstein had whizzed back to new york at rannaldinis expense without confirming his appointment having made himself a smokedsalmon sandwich rannaldini choked on his glass of pouilly fumé as catching up with the papers he discovered a large piece in the weekend times on the relative merits of his and boriss candidacies the damaging implication was that while rannaldinis fame and explosive personality would draw the crowds boris was a far more interesting and creative musician how could they possibly think that fumed rannaldini as he turned up the new cd of fidelio noone else made brass sing like that the pictures accompanying the weekend times piece were even more damaging rannaldini marvellously lit in perfect profile and exquisitely cut tails was conducting on the rostrum boris looking twenty years younger had been photographed without a tie with his arm round rachel each holding a happy child by the hand in a fury rannaldini scrumpled up the page and flipping through his address book punched out a number beattie my leetle wild thing we need to talk lying in boriss arms the following thursday rachel slowly came back to earth i must get up she buried her lips in her husbands shoulder no no he held her tightly i must practise for saturday she had a concert at a girls boardingschool in sussex she was going to play chopin and schumanns scenes from childhood play them for me now as you are with the curtains drawn and one lamp casting a golden glow over his wifes body which was as smooth and as ivory as the keys over which she was running her fingers boris felt totally happy dreaming the song of the reaper soldiers march little orphan child falling asleep the rockinghorse knight they were the charming little pieces his mother had played to him as a child go on please the merry peasants been retitled the happy farmer said rachel flicking over the pages quite right peasant is much too demeaning and merry has connotations of alcohol theyll all know that one said boris there was a new passion to rachels playing that rannaldini must have unleashed his wife boris decided had the most beautiful body in the world the longest neck the slenderest waist the softest bottom swelling out over the pansyembroidered piano stool he could see the gleam of her unpainted toenails as she worked the pedals chloe always painted hers boris hadnt told rachel but on the way to heathrow this evening he was going to pop in on chloe to pick up some clothes and a pile of scores he hadnt seen her since they broke up several weeks ago he knew she was in a bad way and she needed compassion and consideration but he was determined not to start the affaire up again chloe was beautiful and would soon find someone else rachel had launched into important event which entailed vigorous staccato octaves in the bass with the right hand going right down below middle c this meant she had to turn sideways and he could see her breasts jiggling in the firelight appropriately rachel moved straight on to by the fireside but she got no further than the opening bars boris had pulled her down on to the carpet i swear i vill nevair love anyone else but you pleese one more time before i leave for the airport the following evening beattie johnson sat in her large office at the scorpion flipping through some photographs of boris going into chloes flat and embracing her tenderly on the doorstep as he left then she dialled a number and flicked on the recording machine hallo her voice thickened slightly rachel levitsky im sorry i know you like to call yourself rachel grant its the scorpion here ok ok i understand but before you ring off i wonder if youve got any comment about a story that your husbands gone back to chloe oh dear shes hung up beattie turned to the goodlooking boy perched on her desk ok rod you ring her now ask the same question and pretend to be the mirror give it five minutes and you pretend to be the mail kev then you can put on a posh voice and be the sunday times mandy and finally ill do my refined islington twang and be the independent thats her favourite paper thatll really rattle her shell soon crack under pressure rachel hadnt cracked but she hadnt been able to get boris in italy because hed checked out of his hotel and was obviously on his way to israel despite a sleepless night she didnt really believe the papers they were just chasing old rumours until she came out of jasmine cottage with the children on her way to sussex it was one of those perfect daffodillit mornings when the cuckoo might make his first appearance breathing in the sweet air rachel suddenly noticed a bugeyed blonde getting out of a car rachel grant can we have a chat no go away said rachel shoving the children and her music case into the back of her car which unfortunately was cold and took a bit of time to start what dyou think of this story about your husband and chloe the girl thrust the scorpion through the window cheating boris fakes happy marriage to clinch new york job read rachel its not true she whispered driving off with a squeal of tyres look at the pictures yelled the blonde half a mile away in valhalla kitty was in an increasing turmoil for a week now she had been cut off from the outside world as james benson had prescribed complete rest rannaldini had employed a temp a miss bates who had very nice ankles and who fielded all telephone calls and visits now up and dressed for the first time kitty sat in an armchair in the summer parlour gazing listlessly at a little copse of young poplars thrusting their acidgreen branches upwards in victory salutes and reminding her agonizingly of lysander out in the park in their new zealand rugs all rannaldinis horses except the prince of darkness who was still confined to box rest were enjoying the spring grass but not arthur thought kitty in despair and wondered for the millionth time whether lysander was all right lassie was her one comfort already in trouble that morning for having pinched mr brimscombes paintbrush peed on rannaldinis aubusson and chewed one of miss batess green suede shoes she had now collapsed in front of the fire and was showing off her white belly with her speckled paws folded over like a model wearing smart new gloves as the front door banged she rose with a lot of woofing shot between kittys legs then bounded forward pirouetting with joy as her old friend ferdie walked in with natasha kitty you poor thing natasha ran across the room and kissed her weve only just found out how ill youve been are you ok you look so pale and thin she thrust a vast bunch of red tulips into kittys hands and weve brought you some mags and some scent hasnt lassie grown leaving kitty she crouched down beside the puppy who was still trying to lick ferdie to death kitty had never seen such a change in two people natasha looked utterly ravishing in a clinging campionpink shorts suit and highheeled black shoes the heavy makeup had gone darklashes and sparkle were enough and what was the point of lipstick when it kept being kissed off and the beady calculating deadpan ferdie was grinning from ear to ear which were mostly hidden by a curly new cherubs haircut i took him to schumis said natasha proudly doesnt he look gorgeous wonderful you both do said kitty in amazement and so thin ferdie forget special k and lean cuisine said ferdie patting his concave gut loves the answer you dont think hes too thin asked natasha anxiously no no when did you two get togevver beginning of last term natasha collapsed on the sofa and pulling ferdie down beside her started nibbling his ear ferdie started taking me out from bagley hall papas stopped bothering now hes bored with flora oh christ sorry kitty im sorry we didnt take you out i fort when you didnt come ome kitty blushed you preferred it that way oh i did natasha was ruffling ferdies hair ive always grumbled about papa and mama neglecting me now i realize how wonderful it is ferdie and i have just had the most gorgeous ten days in france we fort you was with cecilia said kitty mama thought i was with you giggled natasha noone checked and ferdie takes care of me so much better than either of them oh hi papa she edged closer to ferdie as she noticed rannaldini in the doorway i thought you were with your mother he snapped basically no shes got a new boyfriend you can read all about it natasha waved hello the last thing she wants is me around and what about your a levels said rannaldini coldly natasha smiled well ferdies been helping me with business studies and even more with human biology and as for ancient history i ought to study lysander rannaldini was looking thunderous but fortunately rushed back to his study to answer the telephone he was expecting confirmation from new york any second just for a second colour spilled over kittys grey face hows lysander she whispered the moment hed gone absolutely miserable whispered back ferdie thrusting a letter into the pocket of her grey cardigan almost as miserable as tiny who never stops crying and running to the gate looking for arthur so most of the time lysander lets her into the house hes back at magpie cottage by the way marigold rolled up with some prospective buyers and was not amused to find tiny eating carrots in front of the fire lysanders still wiped out about the rutminster added natasha who was entwining her fingers with ferdie he blames himself totally it wasnt his fault flared up kitty course it wasnt ruperts had to apologize said ferdie who was very shaken by kittys appearance they did a postmortem arthur had a massive heart attack from what i gather some old worm larvae got into the gut and migrated through the wall of the artery into the aorta and died there leaving a lesion which couldnt cope with all that blood racing round you are clever to explain said natasha fondly so theyve decided arthur crashed into the railing and broke his neck as a result of the heart attack so lysanders in the clear oh fank goodness kittys eyes filled with tears im so frilled but poor arfur wonderful way to go said ferdie leading the field by twenty lengths cheers echoing in his ears his beloved master in ecstasy he wouldnt have known anything are you quite sure kitty gave a sob lysander loved him so much he loves you much more said ferdie with a furtive glance at the door hes lost his eurydice kitty was about to ask him to explain when rannaldini marched in singularly unamused to see natasha still wrapped round ferdie who was no doubt acting as a gobetween for lysander you better push off now he said coldly kitty gets very tired she looks terrible said natasha have you been feeding her on paraquat dont be infantile hissed rannaldini so evilly that even ferdie shivered lassie was barking again there was a knock on the door it was miss bates with her normally bold grey eyes cast down dr benson to see you mrs rannaldini before rannaldini could stop him james had swept in natasha he said kissing her on both cheeks i havent seen you for years youve grown even more lovely than your mother why thanks this is my boyfriend ferdie fitzgerald said natasha proudly lucky guy james shook ferdies hand then glancing from this glowing buxom child to her desperately pale redeyed stepmother arent you pleased about the new addition to the family natasha looked blank hes talking about lassie cut in rannaldini now buzz off you two and have a drink in the morning room i wasnt talking about lassie said james benson smoothly hasnt your father told you that your stepmothers expecting a baby she cant be whispered natasha utterly aghast then fielding a laserbeam of warning from rannaldini i mean thats great how very exciting she added in a strange high voice were not telling anyone said rannaldini grimly not until the new york jobs in the bag now bugger off you two james wants to look at kitty he hasnt got all day natasha seemed so shattered that she walked out without even saying goodbye look after yourself said ferdie hugging kitty seriously worried he hated leaving her natasha cant bear my having her fathers child thought kitty hopelessly oh god another dreadful complication rannaldini jumped up and rushed out as the telephone rang he had been unbelievably edgy all morning a long time talking he met james benson on his way out not very happy about kitty james told him not responding at all well almost clinically depressed ive put her on antidepressants and some iron and vitamins to boost her up but i cannot recommend tlc too strongly rannaldini she needs a proper holiday she has one said rannaldini who was quite incapable of controlling his orgasmic elation that call confirm the new world phil job it is all i have dreamt of and worked for well done great said james brilliant but thats hardly a holiday for kitty itll be a change of scenery most uncharacteristically rannaldini kissed his doctor on both cheeks if youll forgeeve me james i must break the news to kitty that will be the best tonic what a victory he wanted to shout to the rooftops as he bounded upstairs how dare that little russian upstart challenge his throne the best man had won even if he had had to fax the scorpion piece on boris and chloe anonymously to graydon gluckstein the moment it came off the press itll be a new eaven and a new earth my kitten he told her joyfully the early afternoon sun flooding his face made him look young and extraordinarily handsome we will leave our problems behind and start our marriage again you will adore new york it pulsates like an animal cecilia lives in new york thought kitty bleakly and once shes dumped this latest boyfriend shell want rannaldini back and me as a dogsbody and if i go to the states and want to come back lassie will have to go into quarantine for six months and hermione will come and stay for ages and little cosmo will break the place up at least in england they live in their own house they are so delighted to ave me rannaldini was saying they ave already release the news worldwide next week we can fly over and look at ouses oh sheet as his mobile rang again why cant people leave us alone allo allo his face went utterly still so instantly drained of colour and joy that for a second kitty thought the job had been withdrawn for a couple of minutes he listened just interjecting the occasional sí then he said it was good of you to let me know well talk later ciao he switched off the telephone only then did the rage erupt as he launched into a stream of latin expletives whats the matter kitty clung to a cringing lassie the stupid stupid beetch screamed rannaldini driving over a fucking cliff and weve only recorded the first two movements of the emperor what are you talking about rachel she kill herself driving off the road kitty gave a moan oh my god poor rachel ow terrible what appened did the brakes fail it couldnt have been suicide rannaldini shrugged she was found clutching a copy of the scorpion theyd run a piece about boris going back to chloe oh no i cant bear it oh the poor liel kids rachel left them with gretel stupid selfish beetch oh poor boris does he know ees in eesrael said rannaldini contemptuously that was bob hes trying to trace him oh my god kittys face crumpled up with tears she was probably just distracted by the orrible article and drove off the road groping in her pocket for a handkerchief she nearly pulled out lysanders letter she dropped me a line only this week sayin ow appy she and boris was again the telephone went the telegraph having been tipped off was ringing to congratulate rannaldini about new york and wanting a comment on rachels death one of the most tragic losses to the music world kitty could hear him saying as he walked back to his study rachel grant had an individual talent which i personally guessing he would be tied up for some time frantically brushing away the tears kitty took the note out of her cardigan pocket it was full of crossings out a demented lysander had clearly struggled over it himself without any help from ferdie or rupert darling kitty i wonnted to proove i cud do sumthing well arthur and i allmost did i havent got a big howse or a jetset life but i give you my hart wych feals as if its been trarnsplarnted withowt any annisetik please wring i am dieing of missery your luvving lysander kitty felt as though the jagged teeth of a steel trap had closed into her leg holding her back darling sweet lysander how could she ever even respect let alone love rannaldini after hed been so monstrously insensitive about rachel mrs rannaldini whatever was wrong with miss bates shed been so bossy and uppity yesterday now she couldnt meet kittys eyes as she handed her the second cordless telephone mr rannaldinis still on the other line its natasha she says its desperately urgent allo said kitty steeling herself for abuse are you alone promise you wont leave papa natashas italianamerican accent was coming in gasps wolfie wont come back to valhalla because

quick hell be back in a second your baby isnt papas its lysanders how dyou know whispered kitty i slept with your dad the night before lysander came out to france and the night i got back she shuddered as she remembered rannaldinis icecold anger as he practically raped her i only slept wiv lysander twice papa has had a vasectomy he what when just after he married you he didnt want any more children what with seven of us and buckets of illegits he was fed up with the expense and the hassle but theres a per cent chance of reversing the operation so you still could have babies together kitty kitty are you still there yes are you sure certain he had the op in america not even james benson knows oh my god kitty gave a sob you will go on being my friend even if you leave him pleaded natasha but try not to he loves you in his funny way and he needs you youre the best wife hes ever had ive got to go mumbled kitty switching off the telephone and slumping back on the blueandyellow cushions clutching lassie who stretched up long pink tongue frantically trying to staunch her mistresss tears outside rannaldinis horses were lying down in a patch of sunlight close together to keep warm folding up one after another like camels kitty couldnt stop crying as she remembered the way rannaldini had complained so bitterly when she had all those horribly embarrassing and often painful tests not to mention the devastating disappointment each time her period came now he was bullying her nonstop to have an abortion and all the time hed made her bear the full guilt and humiliation of being the infertile one the stupid bitch drove off the road she muttered an weve only recorded two movements oh poor rachel oh dear god kitty had no idea how long she sat her thoughts churning but suddenly the door flew open and in bounced hermione smothered in leopard skin come on brickie were off to the bird sanctuary at slimbridge weve always vowed wed go such a lovely day and what better way of celebrating rannaldinis wonderful new job he must have rung to tell her straight away thought kitty dully you must wrap up warm marigold following hermione into the room thought how really ill kitty looked but what about rachel said kitty bewildered its terrible were all devastated said hermione briskly bob was crying when he rang from london to tell me but crying wont bring her back well all have to rally round boris and the children gretels being a tower of strength mind you spare men are lucky they get snapped up very fast we cant go on a jaunt said kitty in horror not when shes just passed away rachel was mad about conservation said marigold gently its a sort of memorial to her if we go come on kitty itll do you good so off they went in two cars marigold and larry georgie and guy rode in the first hermione reluctantly accompanied by meredith because bob was still in london coping with the ramifications of rachels death drove with kitty and rannaldini who was resplendent in a new long palefawn cashmere coat from ralph lauren the clouds had rolled away primroses violets and blue hazes of speedwell crowded the hedgerows from which the first green flames of hawthorn and wild rose were flickering brightly dark glasses and head scarves chaps said hermione tying a rust silk square over her dark hair we dont want to be mobbed by autograph hunters there was hassle even before they got inside slimbridge when ignoring a sign saying no entry for furs made from spotted cats or tigers hermione tried to force her way through the turnstile is that coat fake leopardskin asked the girl on the till certainly not said hermione in outrage im afraid you cant come in so hermione threw a moody and as rannaldini showed no signs of relinquishing his splendid new cashmere kind guy had to lend her his old army greatcoat it looks better on a man joked guy as he did up the brass buttons dyou remember that advertisement brickie kitty didnt she was thinking of the contrast between the noisy selfconfident sophistication of the paradise party excluding herself of course and the scruffy excited crowds mostly parents and children in anoraks retired couples or earnest men in shorts and hung with cameras and binoculars dreadfully suburban shuddered meredith as he whisked kitty past bright pink double cherries weeping willows little concrete ponds and pebbledash islands crowded with birds i fink its beautiful said kitty admiring the little teals with their glossy blue green and chestnut heads and the black swans whose necks unfurled like ferns ooo ow sweet she bent down to stroke the little brown striped hawaiian geese who wandered round soliciting bread and rubbing against peoples legs tame as lassie that bird with a white collar looks just like percy said meredith its called the common shoveller marigold was eager to show off her ornithological knowledge guy whod been a keen birdwatcher during the walking tours of his youth was equally eager the courtship of the ruddy duck is absolutely fascinating he was telling larry seeing a notice which said go quietly tread gently kitty thought it sounded like a prayer there must be a god to produce such a marvellous variety of different coloured birds and what a wonderful quacking and honking and hooting they make from every bush came scuffling like a teenage party interior designers could pick up a few tips meredith was studying the black rust and white plumage of a passing eider duck listen to what it says about the courtship pattern of the great whistler cried marigold putting on her spectacles to read another notice the male arches his body and neck flinging up droplets followed by head up tail up usually several males frantically display before one female sounds like the husbands of paradise showing off to rachel said georgie sourly oh my god i forgot she was dead noticing kittys glazed eyes suddenly spilling over with tears meredith mouthed to marigold is she ok i dont think so mouthed back marigold picking up this exchange hermione turned to rannaldini wouldnt it be wonderful if kitty could adopt a canada goose theyve got a scheme here it would give her an interest ill go and jolly her up showing off her deeply caring nature and her charmingly curved legs she moved forward putting her arm through kittys im so delighted about rannaldinis new job i know hes been a naughty boy but when you think of stags stallions and male dogs and how much more glamorously the male birds are kitted out than the females its no wonder men are different bitches does and female birds are gentle sit on their nests and stay at home sex really isnt that important it is with lysander thought kitty sulkily she noticed a mallard his emerald head gleaming in the sunshine as his tabby wife nestled beside him in married contentment like lysander and me thought kitty im plain and tabby hes beautiful and resplendent but he loves me i know youve still got a crush on lysander marigold took kittys other arm hes so sweet we all had one on him once just like the flu some of us still do sighed meredith admiring the blond hairy legs of a hulking german tourist dont be silly meredith reproved marigold and dont be rash kitty valhallas a beautiful place and rannaldinill buy some gorgeous apartment for you in new york its no fun lowering ones standard of living marigold sighed even more deeply and think of the travelling youll do and the packing thought kitty wearily he will not always say what you would have him say sung hermione warmly so crowds turned and gawped at her but now and then hell say something wonderful theyre holding an infertility workshop in rutminster next week she went on why dont you go along kitty a problem shared is a problem solved surging ahead larry guy and rannaldini turned off to look at the flamingos soft orange and barbara cartlandpink they stood about on one leg making a very unmelodic jangling din sounds like one of boriss symphonies said rannaldini bitchily poor bastard said larry but rannaldini was deep in thought anticipating the wonderful tussle he would have knocking those bolshie but stunningly talented new york musicians into shape the concert at which hed raised so much money for the gulf had been good for his image before he left he might do the same for the royal society for the preservation of birds they could do an ornithological programme there were so many composers delius respighi sibelius to choose from in the tower was a serenade to the lost birds of italy which hed written in his youth hed get it out and have a look this evening guy is such a pig georgie was now whispering to marigold a girlfriend rang me yesterday to say i must read love in the time of cholera because its whole premise is that you can only keep a wife happy by lying and lying to her and that was the bloody book julia gave guy for his birthday at least she comforted herself guy was being really sweet to her at the moment and david had rung while guy was out getting the papers and presumably ringing julia this morning and she and david were having dinner on monday im so lucky with darling bob said hemione smugly as they moved towards a small wood he is so devoted oh arent those coots sweet i wonder if coots really are queer i want to go to the wild goose hideaway giggled meredith bounding up some steps into a wooden hut well perhaps i dont he said shooting out on discovering a lot of bearded men with knobbly knees peering through binoculars but the paradise party whod already started up the steps pushed him jovially back into the hideaway inside wide windows looked on to the severn estuary which stretched out like a great white luminous stop sign in front little lakes were dotted with birds to the right on the far shore pylons and cranes rose out of a smoky haze look at the canada geese cried marigold theres a beautiful bewick swan observed guy then raising his voice for the benefit of the cognoscenti the bewicks call during flight is tong tong tong bong bong ongong ongong jourdain describes the call as a varied din of honking notes volunteered one of the men with knobbly knees kitty caught merediths eye and in order not to laugh turned to examine a wall chart listing sightings together with descriptions of the species and the numbers seen running her eyes down the list which included greatcrested grebes all kinds of swans ducks and geese herons and even a kingfisher she suddenly started to shake with helpless laughter until she was gasping and clutching her sides whatevers the matter asked marigold alarmed look kitty pointed to halfway down the list where in a very round hand someone had written donald duck as a description they had put blue coat yellow beak and under the number recorded they had written sadly none thats not really funny brickie reproved guy people take birdwatching very seriously lysander could have been here kitty wiped her eyes on her sleeve having started laughing she found she couldnt stop better take her home whispered marigold come on old girl larry put his arm round her shoulders dont want to overdo it off her trolley mouthed guy to meredith wouldnt you be said meredith with unusual sharpness if you were married to that he nodded at rannaldini and hermione who were straightening their clothes and smirking as they emerged from the goose observation tower next door the birds look so happy thought kitty meekly allowing larry to lead her back theyve done their bonking and now theyve got their little families she watched a drake and a duck striking out from the shore proudly leading a convoy of tiny fluffy ducklings they had sanctuary here at slimbridge but they could leave when they want to suddenly she remembered the cow loose in the barley during the drought last summer who had rolled its way over the cattlegrid it had looked so carefree anyone could get out if they wanted to enough tong tong tong bong bong ongong ongong muttered kitty larry glanced at her nervously ill take over whispered georgie taking kittys arm david hawkley is so attractive she told kitty lowering her voice if you can imagine a macho intellectual lysander lysanders perfect as he is said kitty indignantly a sharp breeze was already scattering pink cherry blossom over the dark water like confetti you know i really love guy admitted georgie the most important thing in marriage is companionship and a huge bit on the side to cheer one through the bad patches divorce is so damaging for children they were passing the slimbridge shop which still had a mothering sunday sticker in the window i dont want no bits on the side and ill never even have children to damage if i stay married to rannaldini thought kitty numbly and a canada goose that flies in and out of a bird sanctuary isnt enough a pretty young mother was coming out of the shop she had a sweet child who was trailing a black toy pig by the hand over the hills and far away she danced with pigling bland thought kitty biting her lip to stop herself crying the most important thing hermione came up on the left is that rannaldini needs you its wonderful to feel you are indispensable to a genius bob must find it a huge comfort snapped georgie hermione bowed her head he does he does im not their age thought kitty i dont remember advertisements about things looking better on a man im still young and i love lysander rannaldini guy georgie and hermione bored with anonymity were not displeased when a big party of foreign tourists stopped them for autographs where foreigners had rushed in the shy english were not slow to follow we really must go laughed hermione five minutes later i love lysander he is the father of my child thought kitty rannaldini had lied and cheated and betrayed her and been utterly utterly reprehensible now he was asking a busty swedish girl her name so he could personally inscribe her autograph book were having our sixteenth anniversary in october marigold was saying ay suppose we should be awfully grateful to lysander we maight not be havin it at all if he hadnt made larry so jealous home for tea at valhalla said rannaldini putting a warm caressing hand on the back of kittys neck as they walked towards the cars what a lovely afternoon cried hermione smirking as he stroked her bottom with the other hand lets make a regular thing of it georgie shivered its getting cold how dyou think i feel with no coat murmured guy then smiling at kitty the best part is going home to crumpets and brickies chocolate cake they were all smiling at her now some of them realizing the extent of her unhappiness and trying to boost her spirits you look tired kitty said rannaldini when they got back to valhalla miss bates will get tea you sit by the fire come and see my new toy he added to the others they all trooped off to admire rannaldinis new helicopter as kitty went wearily into the house lassie danced towards her striped body weaving and snaking blackrimmed eyes full of love peeing on the flagstones in her delight i cant leave her thought kitty not even pausing to wipe up the puddle she ran down the dark passage outside rannaldinis boot room lassie had chewed up what kitty first thought was a twig then she realized it was the baton toscanini had given rannaldini on his death bed itll be your deaff bed lassie if we dont get out of here gathering up the puppy in panic and rushing into the kitchen she found miss bates still looking dreadfully embarrassed mrs rannaldini theres something i must tell you then ill get you all tea youve looked after rannaldini and me so well stammered kitty terrified of any delay were so griteful cant it wait till tomorrow no miss bates was so insistent that in the end kitty sat her down at the kitchen table mrs rannaldini said miss bates frantically rotating the gold bracelet on her slender wrist i have to tell you that while you were fast asleep in bed knocked out by one of mr rannaldinis sleeping pills i went to bed with mr rannaldini her voice faltered im desperately sorry hes just so attractive for a minute kitty looked at miss bates incredulously then she burst out laughing is that all for an orrible moment i fort you was going to and in your notice promise to stay and look after im in the utility room kitty found an ancient cat basket and wiping it down shut a quaking lassie inside who was convinced she was going to the vet bong bong bong tong tong ongong ongong this is the flight call of the female rannaldini shrieking with helpless laughter kitty raced across the lawn past the glowering maze and turned left to the stables as the garage was next to rannaldinis helicopter pad she couldnt steal off unobserved by car the only answer was the kindest horse in the yard bong bong bong tong tong nuffink venture nuffink win she was already shaking with nerves worse than lassie she must try and keep her courage up but as she ran into the yard she gasped with horror shed forgotten that all the horses had been turned out except the prince of darkness who glowered out of his box as sinister as his name evil eyes rolling as he scraped and gnawed at his halfdoor hell go for me if i try and put a bridle on him thought kitty almost fainting with terror then froze as the door of the grooms cottage opened but instead of clive janice the head groom emerged janice was very fond of kitty she might not shop at valentino like cecilia but she always saw that the grooms were paid on the nail you do look poorly you shouldnt be up she said noticing kittys violent shakes and her face grey and glistening with sweat could you please tack up the prince stammered kitty kicking lassies cat basket behind the mounting block rannaldini wants to ride him at this hour janice looked at her watch hes got friends over and he wants to show off janice sniffed and i was just off to get the other horses in what was that she paused at a piteous whine from lassie nuffink spect its a bird we was at slimbridge today said kitty desperately more like one of the rottweilers got stuck in somewhere janice glanced round the yard please tack up the prince kitty tried to disguise her panic the wait seemed interminable particularly as she had to keep up a tuneless singing to drown lassies increasingly aggrieved whining but at last janice put her head over the halfdoor god hes a dangerous bugger where dyou want him taken leave him for a sec rannaldini fort he left his silvertopped whip in the tack room said kitty she would rot in hell for such awful lies ill look said janice kitty was nearly frantic with terror please god take care of us she prayed taking a huge breath she unbolted the princes door and just grabbed his reins as he shot out like an exocet not giving herself time to have doubts she gathered up lassies basket clambered on to the mounting block and somehow scrambled astride the vast black back which was pitching like a top deck in a force ten gale with a manic clatter the prince tore out of the yard down the rough track in search of his friends at least he couldnt savage her if she was on his back alarmed by janices screams to come back however he broke into a gallop oooh its worse than the big dipper moaned kitty twining her fingers in the thick mane as trees bushes and telegraph poles flashed by all this jolting must be bad for the baby but far far worse kitty gave a sob if it had ended up a bloody mangled foetus on the abortionists table the thought made her cling on even tighter oh heavens she suddenly remembered she was hurtling towards the west gate which was chained and bolted if she had to get off the prince to undo it shed never get on again thundering towards a clearing on her left she loosened her grip on the mane to tug the nearside rein miraculously the big horse cornered at rutminster cup speed into a woodland ride oh good boy prince please keep straight begged kitty if he carted her under the branches shed had it the wind was lifting her hair tugging at her grey cardigan and her old grey check skirt to right and left on the woodland floor bluebells battled to push through the dog mercury little primroses were stifled by brambles and palefaced anemones were being drowned like bathers in a rising sea of garlic which gave off pungent wafts of aioli as it was pounded by the princes flying feet they had reached open fields now again kitty knew she was finished if the princes stablemates came pounding down to join him but ahead like the berlin wall lay the river fleet and freedom go on prince yelled kitty as they slithered down the bank only baulking for a second the brave black horse plunged into the swirling brown water a terrified whine reminded kitty that if she slid off or let go of the cat basket lassie was as good as drowned our farver which art in eaven cried kitty allowed by thy name for a nightmarish few seconds the prince was out of his depth swimming boldly battling with the crosscurrents then he was lurching up the other side oh fank you good old boy cried kitty it was as though magpie cottage was pulling them towards it staying on going up hill was much easier the south side of paradise was far less advanced the trees brushing the clouds were still bare they were tearing past great banks of blackthorn that looked as though theyd been dipped in flour and there was poor rachels cottage an flights of angels sing thee to thy rest thought kitty but the present was more important glancing back fearful of seeing rannaldinis helicopter rising like a malignant hornet kitty wondered how much longer she could cling on then like the heavenly city she saw the paradise road which passed magpie cottage again untwining her aching fingers from the princes mane she tugged the offside rein and the horse swung to the right i can ride called out kitty in ecstasy but nothing prepared her for galloping along tarmac at a breakneck speed what happened if they met a car she ducked to avoid a lowhanging sycamore branch having lost both her shoes she felt she was about to lose her teeth as she tried to swing left up lysanders track she and the prince parted company the lures of paradise were too strong for him and he kept on going kitty landed gently amid the white violets on the verge all her life she would associate their sweet smell with relief that she wasnt hurt and even greater relief when she opened the cat basket and lassie jumped out pirouetting in glee raking her mistresss legs with her striped paws quick quick my lamb urging them both on kitty panted up the lane oblivious of the sharp stones ripping her soaked tights then she gave a cry of despair the curtains were drawn three days milk hadnt been taken in the for sale sign shivered despondently in the chilly wind heart crashing gasping frantically for breath she raced up the path and pounded on the door no answer she pounded again nothing perhaps lysander was in bed cheering up some sad beautiful girl whose husband was about to become jealous oh lassie what will become of us wept kitty in answer came a shrill outraged yap pushing open the door kitty tripped over a mountain of post lysander hawkley owner of arthur england was written on one of the top envelopes jack who from his caked brown nose had been rabbiting greeted her in noisy ecstasy he then discovered lassie timidly hovering on the threshold strutted round her on poker legs sniffing and assessing realizing she was female he started to twitch his stumpy tail then ran into the sitting room barking importantly lysander sat slumped on the old blue corduroy sofa staring hopelessly into space oblivious of a wildly exciting photofinish on the television there was a quarter of an inch of stubble on his haggard cheeks and black black halfcircles beneath his eyes his donald duck jersey was inside out and he was wearing odd socks lysander kitty could hardly get the word out he looked round dully then started incredulously lysander its me she whispered shakily holding her hands out over the ills and far away she danced with piglin bland as though struggling from the bottom of the sea lysander staggered to his feet are you a mirage or a miracle he mumbled im me i love you sobbed kitty im sorry to barge in i cant live wiv rannaldini no longer lysanders stubbly jaw dropped his bloodshot eyes opened wider and wider as he gazed at her then a great smile split his face and he gave a great whoop of joy and vaulting over the sofa fell into her arms kissing all the life out of her but only for a few seconds because they were both so gasping and breathless they had to come up for air for an enraptured moment lysander touched kittys windswept hair and ran his hands wonderingly over her pale frozen little face to prove he wasnt dreaming i thought id never see you again his voice broke then reluctant to let her go for even a second he dragged the hefty bishops chair across the room and shoved it against the front door were not letting rannaldini in here he collapsed into the chair pulling kitty onto his knee you escaped oh kitty darling you really escaped you are brave kissing her between sentences he said i got you an engagement ring just in case its in a case actually he giggled helplessly and leaning back scrabbled amid the chaos of the desk drawer and produced a little crimson leather box containing an enormous diamond its a bit flash but diamonds are for ever who said that shakespeare they were both shaking so much it took a long time for him to slide the ring on to her finger its eavenly breathed kitty ow lysander you shouldnt i mean it mustve cost hush lysander put his lips on her forehead georgie gave me back the diamond necklace i gave her to get the clasp fixed so i flogged it you and me are what matters how the hell did you break out of valhalla i rode the prince of darkness said kitty proudly you what said lysander utterly aghast oh kitty you couldnt have youre so frightened of horses and id be petrified of riding him i was more frightened of not getting to you confessed kitty but youre soaking lysander suddenly took in her dripping skirt and her ripped tights oh my god you didnt come over the river you could have been drowned you did that for me oh kitty darling youre so brave i cant believe it wheres the prince now dunno kitty shrugged pushed off to paradise he needed some fun probably öpenin an account at the apple tree or havin a sherry at the pearly gates or wiv any luck wrecking percys garden kitty said lysander in awe i never thought you were capable of such irresponsibility oh i love you tipping her head back he buried his mouth in hers kissing her more and more passionately and his stubble lacerating her cheeks was the sweetest pain shed ever felt i cant believe this is happening to me lets go to bed i just desperately need to prove youre real dazedly he started to undo her grey cardigan but kitty couldnt give in to joy just yet theres somefink ive got to tell you taking in her lack of suitcases lysander began to tremble you only came for a few minutes he grasped her hands until she winced youre going back i cant handle it honestly i cant its not that i dont want to trap you but im expecting a baby i dont believe it lysanders face was flooded with relief and happiness thats fantastic ill take care of both of you i love babies doesnt matter if its rannaldinis if we bring it up itll be ours kitty was frantically wiping her eyes its yours she whispered mine said lysander incredulously how can you tell rannaldinis ad a vasectomy so it can only be yours lysander gazed at her gradually absorbing the enormity of the truth horrified disapproval battling with overriding pleasure and pride my baby god thats great but that bastard rannaldini letting you think you couldnt have kids christ the bastard ill give him an iraqi manicure then ill kill him dyou mean its really my child i mean our child as he took her hands kissing each finger she could feel his tears you could have lost it he said in a choked voice you might have had a fall on the road like mum oh thank god youre safe it was nuffink i wasnt frightened once we got going because you was at the end of it you mustnt cry lysander reached for his handkerchief and dried both their eyes then he said slowly its our baby god i feel fantastic shall we ring dad no lets open a bottle first he was so desperately thin that kitty couldnt wait to feed him up with jam rolypoly and treacle pudding i can work right up until the birf she said not wanting him to feel pressured financially and afterwards i can take up typing you will not lysander stuck out his chest ive got a proper job starting on monday working for rupert breaking and schooling horses for him he thought it was too much hassle me keeping the weight down so hes going to try me on eventing or even showjumping thats wonderful said kitty overjoyed ill forgive im for being so orrible hes been wonderful hes actually taken tiny back to live with pridie because both of them were missing arthur so

lassie and jack had curled up in the dog basket together and jack was busy licking lassies eyes and nose jack shall have jill naught shall go ill kittys voice broke again hell need a step ladder when she reaches her full size said lysander an ill need a social ladder marryin you giggled kitty dont be ridiculous he said furiously youre so good and so far above me kitty i really will be the man who made husbands jealous now because every man in the worlds going to die of envy because ive got you he kissed her small squashed nose id forgotten how beautiful you are then suddenly his flawless brow wrinkled i cant figure it out basically twenty minutes ago i was going to shoot myself now im the happiest man in the world and im going to be a father when the tarzan howls had finally subsided kitty said timidly i fort if it was a little girl we could call her pippa after your mum for a few seconds lysander couldnt speak then he said shed have loved that and if hes a boy well call him arthur the end
