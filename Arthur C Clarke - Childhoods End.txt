childhoods end by arthur c clarke earth and the overlords the volcano that had reared taratua up from the pacific depths had been sleeping now for half a million years yet in a little while thought reinhold the island would be bathed with fires fiercer than any that had attended its birth he glanced towards the launching site and his gaze dimbed the pyramid of scaffolding that still surrounded the columbus two hundred feet above the ground the ships prow was catching the last rays of the descending sun this was one of the last nights it would ever know soon it would be floating in the eternal sunahine of space it was quiet here beneath the palms high up on the rocky spine of the island the only sound from the project was the occasional yammering of an air compressor or the faint shout of a workman reinhold had grown fond of these clustered palms almost every evening he had come here to survey his little empire it saddened him to think that they would be blasted to atoms when the columbus rose in flame and fury to the stars a mile beyond the reef the james forrestal had switched on her searchlights and was sweeping the dark waters the sun had now vanished completely and the swift tropical night was racing in from the east reinhold wondered a little sardonically if the carrier expected to find russian submarines so close to shore the thought of russia turned his mind as it always did to konrad and that morning in the cataclysmic spring of more than thirty years had passed but the memory of those last days when the reich was crumbling beneath the waves from the east and from the west had never faded he could still see konrads tired blue eyes and the golden stubble on his chin as they shook hands and parted in that ruined prussian village while the refugees streamed endlessly past it was a parting that symbolized everything that had since happened to the worldthe cleavage between east and west for konrad chose the road to moscow reinhold had thought him a fool but now he was not so sure for thirty years he had assumed that konrad was dead it was only a week ago that colonel sandmeyer of technical intelligence had given him the news he didnt like sandmeyer and he was sure the feeling was mutual but neither let that interfere with business mr hoffmann the colonel had begun in his best official manner ive just had some alarming information from washington its top secret of course but weve decided to break it to the engineering staff so that theyll realize the necessity fbr speed he paused for effect but the gesture was wasted on reinhold somehow he already knew what was coming the russians are nearly level with us theyve got some kind of atomic driveit may even be more efficient than ours and theyre building a ship on the shores of lake baikal we dont know how far theyve got but intelligence believe it may be launched this year you know what that means yes thought reinhold i know the race is onand we may not win it do you know whos running their team he had asked not really expecting an answer to his surprise colonel sandmeyer had pushed across a typewritten sheetand there at its head was the name konrad schneider you knew a lot of these men at peenemonde didnt you said the colonel that may give us some insight into their methods id like you to let me have notes on as many of them as you cantheir specialities the bright ideas they had and so on i know its asking a lot after all this timebut see what you can do konrad schneider is the only one who matters reinhold had answered he was brilliantthe others are just competent engineers heaven only knows what hes done in thirty years rememberhes probably seen all our results and we havent any of his that gives him a decided advantage he hadnt meant this as a criticism of intelligence but for a moment is seemed as if sandmeyer was going to be offended then the colonel shrugged his shoulders it works both waysyouve told me that yourself our free exchange of information means swifter progress even if we do give away a few secrets the russian research departments probably dont know what their own people are doing half the time well show them that democracy can get to the moon first democracynuts thought reinhold but knew better than to say it one konrad schneider was worth a million names on an electoral roll and what had konrad done by this time with all the resources of the ussr behind him perhaps even now his ship was already outward bound from earth the sun which had deserted taratua was still high above lake baikal when konrad schneider and the assistant commissar for nuclear science walked slowly back from the motor test rig their ears were still throbbing painfully though the last thunderous echoes had died out across the lake ten minutes before why the long face asked grigorievitch suddenly you should be happy now in another month well be on our way and the yankees will be choking themselves with rage youre an optimist as usual said schneider even though the motor works its not as easy as that true i cant see any serious obstacles nowbut im worried about the reports from taratua ive told you how good hoffmann is and hes got billions of dollars behind him those photographs of his ship arent very clear but it looks as if its not far from completion and we know he tested his motor five weeks ago dont worry laughed grigorievitch theyre the ones who are going to have the big surprise rememberthey dont know a thing about us schneider wondered if that was true but decided it was much safer to express no doubts that might start grigorievitchs mind exploring far too many tortuous channels and if there had been a leak he would find it hard enough to clear hiinself the guard saluted as he reentered the administration buildmg there were nearly as many soldiers here he thought grimly as technicians but that was how the russians did things and as long as they kept out of his way he had no complaints on the wholewith exasperating exceptionsevents bad turned out very much as he had hoped only the future could tell if he or reinhold had made the better choice he was already at work on his final report when the sound of shouting voices disturbed hint for a moment he sat motionless at his desk wondering what conceivable event could have disturbed the rigid discipline of the camp then he walked to the windowand for the first time in his life he knew despair the stars were all around him as reinhold descended the little hill out at sea the forrestal was still sweeping the water with her fingers of light while further along the beach the scaffolding round the columbus had transformed itself into an illuminated christmas tree only the projecting prow of the ship lay like a dark shadow across the stars a radio was blaring dancemusic from the living quarters and unconsciously reinholds feet accelerated to the rhythm he had almost reached the narrow road along the edge of the sands when some premonition some halfglimpsed movement made him stop puzzled he glanced from land to sea and back again it was some little time before he thought of looking at the sky then reinhold hoffmann knew as did konrad schneider at this same moment that he had lost his race and he knew that he had lost it not by the few weeks or months that he had feared but by millennia the huge and silent shadows driving across the stars more miles above his head than he dared to guess were as far beyond his little columbus as it surpassed the log canoes of paleolithic man for a moment that seemed to last forever reinhold watched as all the world was watching while the great ships descended in their overwhelming majestyuntil at last he could hear the faint scream of their passage through the thin air of the tratosphere he felt no regrets as the work of a lifetime was swept away he had laboured to take men to the stars and in the moment of success the starsthe aloof indifferent starshad come to him this was the moment when history held its breath and the present sheared asunder from the past as an iceberg splits from its frozen parent cliffs and goes sailing out to sea in lonely pride all that the past ages had achieved was as nothbig now only one thought echoed and reechoed through reinholds brain the human race was no longer alone tii secretarygeneral of the united nations stood motionless by the great window staring down at the crawling traffic on rd street he sometimes wondered if it was a good thing for any man to work at such an altitude above his fellow humans detachment was all very well but it could change so easily to indifference or was he merely trying to rationalize his dislike of skyscrapers still unabated after twenty years in new york he heard the door open behind him but did not turn his head as pieter van ryberg came into the room there was the inevitable pause as pieter looked disapprovingly at the thermostat for it was a standing joke that the secretarygeneral liked living in an icebox stormgren waited until his assistant joined hint at the window then tore his gaze away from the familiar yet always fascinating panorama below theyre late he said wainwright should have been here five minutes ago ive just heard from the police hes got quite a procession with him and its snarled up the traffic he should be here any moment now van ryberg paused then added abruptly are you still sure its a good idea to see him im afraid its a little late to back out of it now after all ive agreedthough as you know it was never my idea in the first place stormgren had walked to his desk and was fidgeting with his famous uranium paperweight he was not nervous merely undecided he was also glad that wainwright was late for that would give him a slight moral advantage when the interview opened such trivialities played a greater part in human affairs than anyone who set much store on logic and reason might wish here they are said van ryberg suddenly pressing his face against the window theyre coming along the avenue a good three thousand id say stormgren picked up his notebook and rejoined his assistant half amile away a small but determined crowd was moving slowly towards the secretariat building it carried banners that were indecipherable at this distance but stormgren knew their message well enough presently he could hear rising above the sound of the traffic the ominous rhythm of chanting voices he felt a sudden wave of disgust sweep over him surely the world had had enough of marching mobs and angry slogans the crowd had now come abreast of the building it must know that he was watching for here and there fists were being shaken rather selfconsciously in the air they were not defying him though the gesture was doubtless meant for stormgren to see as pygmies may threaten a giant so those angry fists were directed against the sky fifty kilometres above his headagainst the gleaming silver cloud that was the flagship of the overlord fleet and very probably thought stormgren karellen was watching the whole thing and enjoying himself hugely for this meeting would never have taken place except at the supervisors instigation this was the first time that stormgren had ever met the head of the freedom league he had ceased to wonder if the action was wise for kareilens plans were often too subtle for merely human understanding at the worst stormgren did not see that any positive harm could be done if he had refused to see wainwright the lague would have used the fact as ammunition against him alexander wainwright was a tall handsome man in the late forties he was stormgren knew completely honest and therefore doubly dangerous yet his obvious sincerity made it hard to dislike him whatever views one might have about the cause for which he stoodand some of the followers he had attracted stormgren wasted no time after van rybergs brief and somewhat strained introductions i suppose he began the chief object of your visit is to register a formal protest against the federation scheme am i correct wainwright nodded gravely that is my main protest mr secretary as you know for the last five years we have tried to awaken the human race to the danger that confronts it the task has been a difficult one for the majority of people seem content to let the overlords run the world as they please nevertheless more than five million patriots in every country have signed our petition that is not a very impressive figure out of two and a half billion it is a figure that cannot be ignored and for every person who has signed there are many who feel grave doubts about the wisdom not to mention the rightness of this federation plan even supervisor karellen for all his powers cannot wipe out a thousand years of history at the stroke of a pen what does anyone know of karellens powers retorted stormgren when i was a boy the federation of europe was a dreambut when i grew to manhood it had become reality and that was before the arrival of the overlords kardlen is merely finishing the work we had begun europe was a cultural and geographical entity the world is notthat is the difference to the overlords replied stormgren sarcastically the earth is probably a great deal smaller than europe seemed to our fathersand their outlook i submit is more mature than ours i do not necessarily quarrel with federation as an ulti mate objectivethough many of my supporters might not agree but it must come from withinnot be superimposed from without we must work out our own destiny there must be no more interference in human affairs stormgren sighed all this he had heard a hundred times before and he knew that he could only give the old answer that the freedom league had refused to accept he had faith in karellen and they had not that was the fundamental difference and there was nothing he could do about it luckily there was nothing that the freedom league could do either let me ask you a few questions he said can you deny that the overlords have brought security peace and prosperity to the world that is true but they have taken our liberty man does not live by bread alone yes i knowbut this is the first age in which every man was sure of getting even that in any case what freedom have we lost compared with that which the overlords have given us for the first time in human history freedom to control our own lives under gods guidance at last thought stormgren weve got to the point basically the conflict is a religious one however much it may be disguised wainwright never let you forget he was a dergyman though he no longer wore a derical collar somehow one always got the impression it was still there last month pointed out stormgren a hundred bishops cardinals and rabbis signed a joint declaration pledging their support for the supervisors policy the worldsreigions are against you wainwright shook his head in angry denial many of the leaders are blind they have been corrupted by the overlords when they realize the danger it may be too late hinmrnity will have lost its initiative and become a subject race there was silence for a moment then stormgren replied in three days i will be meeting the supervisor again i will explain your objections to him since it is my duty to represent the views of the world but it will alter nothingi can assure you of that there is one other point said wainwright slowly we have many objections to the overlordsbut above all we detest their secretiveness you are the only human being who has ever spoken with karellen and even you have never seen him is it surprising that we doubt his motives despite all that he has done for humanity yesdespite that i do not know which we resent more karellens omnipotence or his secrecy if he has nothing to hide why will he never reveal himself next time you speak with the supervisor mr stormgren ask him that stormgren was silent there was nothing he could say to thisnothing at any rate that would convince the other he sometimes wondered if he had really convinced himself it was of course only a very small operation from their point of view but to earth it was the biggest thing that had ever happened there had been no warning when the great ships came pouring out of the unknown depths of space countless times this day had been described in fiction but noone had really believed that it would ever come now it had dawned at last the gleaming silent shapes hanging over every land were the symbol of a science man could not hope to match for centuries for six days they floated motionless above his cities giving no hint they knew of his existence but none was needed not by chance alone could those mighty ships have come to rest so precisely over new york london paris moscow rome cape town tokyo canberra even before the ending of those heartfreezing days some men had guessed the truth this was not the first tentative contact by a race which knew nothing of man within those silent unmoving ships master psychologists were studying humanitys reactions when the curve of tension had reached its peak they would act and on the sixth day karellen supervisor for earth made himself known to the world in a broadcast that blanketed every radio frequency he spoke in english so perfect that the controversy it began was to rage across the atlantic for a generation but the context of the speech was more staggering even than its delivery by any standards it was a work of superlative genius showing a complete and absolute mastery of human affairs there could be no doubt that its scholarship and virtuosity its tantaliing glimpses of knowledge still untapped were deliberately designed to convince mankind that it was in the presence of overwhelming intellectual power when karellen had finished the nations of earth knew that their days of precarious sovereignty had ended local internal governments would still retain their powers but in the wider field of international affairs the supreme decisions had passed from human hands argumentsprotestsall were futile it was hardly to be expected that all the nations of the world would submit tamely to such a limitation of their powers yet active resistance presented baffling difficulties for the destruction of the overlords ships even if it could be achieved would annihilate the cities beneath them nevertheless one major power had made the attempt perhaps those responsible hoped to kill two birds with one atomic missile for their target was floating above the capital of an adjoining and unfriendly nation as the great ships image had expanded on the television screen in the secret control room the little group of officers and technicians must have been torn by many emotions if they succeededwhat action would the remaining ships take could they also be destroyed leaving humanity to go its own way once more or would kardllen wreak some frightful vengeance upon those who had attacked him the screen became suddenly blank as the missile destroyed itself on impact and the picture switched immediately to an airborne camera many miles away in the fraction of a second that had elapsed the fireball should already have formed and should be filling the sky with its solar flame yet nothing whatsoever had happened the great ship floated unharmed bathed in the raw sunlight at the edge of space not only had the bomb failed to touch it but noone could ever decide what had happened to the missile moreover karellen took no action against those responsible or even indicated that he had known of the attack he ignored them contemptuously leaving them to worry over a vengeance that never came it was a more effective and more demoralizing treatment than any punitive action could have been the government responsible collapsed completely in mutual recrimination a few weeks later there had also been some passive resistance to the policy of the overlords usually karellen had been able to deal with it by letting those concerned have their own way until they had discovered that they were only hurting themselves by their refusal to cooperate only once had he taken any direct action against a recalcitrant government for more than a hundred years the republic of south africa had been the centre of social strife men of good will on both sides had tried to build a bridge but in vainfears and prejudices were too deeply ingrained to permit any cooperation successive governments had differed only by the degree of their intolerance the land was poisoned with hate and the aftermath of civil war when it became clear that no attempt would be made to end discrimination karellen gave his warning it merely named a date and timeno more there was apprehension but little fear or panic for noone believed that the overlords would take any violent or destructive action which would involve innocent and guilty alike nor did they all that happened was that as the sun passed the meridian at cape townit went out there remained visible merely a pale purple ghost giving no heat or light somehow out in space the light of the sun had been polarized by two crossed fields so that no radiation could pass the area affected was five hundred kilometres across and perfectly circular the demonstration lasted thirty minutes it was sufficient the next day the government of south africa announced that full civil rights would be restored to the white minority apart from such isolated incidents the human race had accepted the overlords as part of the natural order of things in a surprisingly short time the initial shock had worn off and the world went about its business again the greatest change a suddenly awakened rip van winkle would have noticed was a hushed expectancy a mental glancingovertheshoulder as mankind waited for the overlords to show themselves and to step down from their gleaming ships five years later it was still waiting that thought stormgren was the cause of all the trouble there was the usual circle of sightseers cameras at the ready as stormgrens car drove on to the launchingfield the secretarygeneral exchanged a few final words with his assistant collected his briefcase and walked through the ring of spectators karellen never kept him waiting for long there was a sudden oh from the crowd and a silver bubble expanded with breathtaking speed in the sky above a gust of air tore at stormgrens clothes as the tiny ship came to rest fifty metres away floating delicately a few centimetres above the ground as if it feared contamination with earth as he walked slowly forward stormgren saw that familiar puckering of the seamless metallic hull and in a moment the opening that had so baffled the worlds best scientists appeared before him he stepped through it into the ships single softlylit room the entrance sealed itself as if it had never been shutting out all sound and sight it opened again five minutes later there had been no sensation of movement but stormgren knew that he was now fifty kilometres above the earth deep in the heart of karellens ship be was in the world of the overlords all around him they were going about their mysterious business he had come nearer to them than had any other man yet he knew no more of their physical nature than did any of the millions on the world below the little conference room at the end of the short connecting corridor was unfurnished apart from the single chair and the table beneath the vision screen as was intended it told absolutely nothing of the creatures who had built it the vision screen was empty now as it had always been sometimes in his dreams stormgren had imagined that it had suddenly flashed into life revealing the secret that tormented all the world but the dream had never come true behind that rectangle of darkness lay utter mystery yet there also lay power and wisdom an immense and tolerant understanding of mankindand most unexpected of all a humorous affection fbr the little creatures crawling on the planet beneath from the hidden grille came that calm neverhurried voice that stormgren knew so well though the world had heard it only once in history its depth and resonance gave the single clue that existed in karellens physical nature fbr it left an overwhelming impression of sheer size karellen was large perhaps much larger than a man it was true that some scientists after analyzing the record of his only speech had suggested that the voice was that of a machine this was something that stormgren could never believe yes rikki i was listening to your little interview what did you make of mr wainwright hes an honest man even if many of his supporters arent what are we going to do about him the league itself isnt dangerousbut some of its extremists are openly advocating violence ive been wondering if i should put a guard on my house but i hope it isnt necessary kardlien evaded the point in the annoying way he sometimes had the details of the world federation have been out for a month now has there been a substantial increase in the seven per cent who dont approve of meor the twelve per cent who dont know not yet but thats of no importance what does worry me is a general feeling even among your supporters that its time this secrecy came to an end karellens sigh was technically perfect yet somehow lacked conviction thats your feeling too isnt it the question was so rhetorical that stormgren did not bother to answer it i wonder if you really appreciate he continued earnestly how difficult this state of affairs makes my job it doesnt exactly help mine replied karellen with some spirit i wish people would stop thinking of me as a dictator and remember im only a civil servant trying to administer a colonial policy in whose shaping i had no hand that thought stormgren was quite an engaging description he wondered just how much truth it held cant you at least give us some reason for your concealment because we dont understand it it annoys us and gives rise to endless rumours karellen gave that rich deep laugh of his just too resonant to be altogether human what am i supposed to be now does the robot theory still hold the field id rather be a mass of electron tubes than a thing like a centipedeoh yes ive seen that cartoon in yesterdays chicago times im thinking of requesting the original stormgren pursed his lips primly there were times he thought when karellen took his duties too lightly this is serious he said reprovingly my dear rikki karellen retorted its only by not taking the human race seriously that i retain what fragments of my once considerable mental powers i still possess despite himself stormgren smiled that doesnt help me a great deal does it i have to go down there and convince my fellow men that although you wont show yourself youve got nothing to hide its not an easy job curiosity is one of the most dominant of human characteristics you cant defy it forever of all the problems that faced us when we came to earth this was the most difficult admitted karellen you have trusted our wisdom in other matterssurely you can trust us in this i trust you said stormgren but wainwright doesnt nor do his supporters can you really blame them if they put a bad interpretation on your unwillingness to show yourselves there was silence for a moment then stormgren heard that faint sound that might have been caused by the supervisor moving his body slightly you know why wainwright and his type fear me dont you asked karellen his voice was sombre now like a great organ rolling its notes from a high cathedral nave you will find men like him in all the worlds religions they know that we represent reason and science and however confident they may be in their beliefs they fear that we will overthrow their gods not necessarily through any deliberate act but in a subtler fashion science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets noone ever demonstrated so far as i am aware the nonexistence of zeus or thorbut they have few followers now the wainwrights fear too that we know the truth about the origins of their faiths how long they wonder have we been observing humanity have we watched mohammed begin the hegira or moses giving the jews their laws do we know all that is false in the stories they believe and do you whispered stormgren half to himsell that rikki is the fear that torments them even though they will never admit it openly believe me it gives us no pleasure to destroy mens faiths but all the worlds religions cannot be rightand they know it sooner or later man has to learn the truth but that time is not yet as for our secrecy which you are correct in saying aggravates our problems that is a matter beyond our control i regret the need for this concealment as much as you do but the reasons are sufficient however i will try and get a statement from mysuperiors which may satisfy you and perhaps placate the freedom league now please can we return to the agenda and start recording again well asked van ryberg anxiously did you have any luck i dont know stormgren replied wearily as he threw the files down on his desk and collapsed into the seat karellens consulting his superiors now whoever or whatever they may be he wont make any promises listen said pieter abruptly ive just thought of something what reason have we for believing that there is anyone beyond karellen suppose all the overlords as weve christened them are right here on earth in these ships of theirs they may have nowhere else to go but theyre hiding the fact from us its an ingenious theory grinned stormgren but it clashes with what little i knowor think i knowabout karellens background and how much is that well he often refers to his position here as something temporary hindering him from getting on with his real work which i think is some form of mathematics once i mentioned actons quotation about power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely i wanted to see how hed react to that he gave that cavernous laugh of his and said theres no danger of that happening to me in the first case the sooner i finish my work here the sooner i can get back to where i belong a good many lightyears from here and secondly i dont have absolute power by any means im justsupervisor of course he may have been misleading me i can never be sure of that hes immortal isnt he yes by our standards though theres something in the future he seems to fear i cant imagine what it is and thats really all i know about him it isnt very conclusive my theory is that his little fleets lost in space and is looking for a new home he doesnt want us to know how few he and his comrades are perhaps all those other ships are automatic and theres noone in any of them theyre just an imposing faзade you said stormgren have been reading too much sciencefiction van ryberg grinned a little sheepishly the invasion from space didnt turn out quite as expected did it my theory would certainly explain why karellen never shows himself he doesnt want us to learn that there arent any more overlords stormgren shook his head in amused disagreement your explanation as usual is much too ingenious to be true though we can only infer its existence there must be a great civilization behind the supervisorand one thats known about man for a very long time karellen himself must have been studying us for centuries look at his command of english for example he taught me how to speak it idiomatically have you ever discovered anything he doesnt know oh yes quite oftenbut only on trivial points i think he has an absolutely perfect memory but there are some things he hasnt bothered to learn for instance english is the only language he understands completely though in the last two years hes picked up a good deal of finnish just to tease me and one doesnt learn finnish in a hurry he can quote great slabs of the kalevala whereas im ashamed to say i know only a few lines he also knows the biographies of all living statesmen and sometimes i can identify the references hes used his knowledge of history and science seems complete you know how much weve already learned from him yet taken one at a time i dont think his mental gifts are quite outside the range ot human achievement but no man could possibly do all the things he does thats more or less what ive decided already agreed van ryberg we can argue round karellen forever but in the end we always come back to the same questionwhy the devil wont he show himself until he does ill go on theorizing and the freedom league will go on fulminating he cocked a rebellious eye at the ceiling one dark night mr supervisor i hope some reporter takes a rocket up to your ship and climbs in through the backdoor with a camera what a scoop that would be if karellen was listening be gave no sign but of course he never did in the first year of their coming the advent of the overlords had made less difference to the pattern of human life than might have been expected their shadow was everywhere but it was an unobtrusive shadow though there were few great cities on earth where men could not see one of the silver ships glittering against the zenith after a little while they were taken as much for granted as the sun moon or clouds most men were probably only dimly aware that their steadily rising standards of living were due to the overlords when they stopped to think of itwhich was seldomthey realized that those silent ships had brought peace to all the world for the first time in history and were duly grateful but these were negative and unspectacular benefits accepted and soon forgotten the overlords remained aloof hiding their faces from mankind karellen could command respect and admiration he could win nothing deeper so long as he pursued his present policy it was hard not to feel resentment against these olympians who spoke to man only over the radioteleprinter circuits at united nations headquarters what took place between karellen and stormgren was never publicly revealed and sometimes stormgren himself wondered why the supervisor found these interviews necessary perhaps he felt the need of direct contact with one human being at least perhaps he realized that stormgren needed this form of personal support if this was the explanation the secretarygeneral appreciated it he did not mind if the freedom league referred to him contemptuously as karellens officeboy the overlords had never had any dealings with individual states and governments they bad taken the united nations organization as they found it given instructions for installing the necessary radio equipment and issued their orders through the mouth of the secretarygeneral the soviet delegate had quite correctly pointed out at considerable length and upon innumerable occasions that this was not in accordance with the charter karellen did not seem to worry it was amazing that so many abuses follies and evils could be dispelled by those messages from the sky with the arrival of the overlords nations knew that they need no longer fear each other and they guessedeven befbre the experiment was madethat their existing weapons were certainly impotent against a civilization that could bridge the stars so at once the greatest single obstacle to the happiness of mankind had been removed the overlords seemed largely indifferent to forms of government provided that they were not oppressive or corrupt earth still possessed democracies monarchies benevolent dictatorships communism and capitalism this was a source of great surprise to many simple souls who were quite convinced that theirs was the only possible way of life others believed that karellen was merely waiting to introduce a system that would sweep away all existing forms of society and so had not bothered with minor political reforms but this like all other speculations concerning the overlords was pure guesswork noone knew their motives and noone knew towards what future they were shepherding mankind stormoren was sleeping badly these nights which was strange since soon he would be putting aside the cares of ofilce forever he had served mankind for forty years and its masters for five and few men could look back upon a life that had seen so manyof its ambitions achieved perhaps that was the trouble in the years of retirement however many they might be he would have no further goals to give any zest to life since martha had died and the children had established their own families his ties with the world seemed to have weakened it might be too that he was beginning to identify himself with the overlords and thus become detached from humanity this was another of those restless nights when his brain went on turning like a machine whose governor had failed he knew better than to woo sleep any further and reluctantly climbed out of bed throwing on his dressinggown he strolled out on to the roof garden of his modest flat there was not one of his direct subordinates who did not possess much more luxurious quarters but this place was ample for stormgrens needs he had reached the position where neither personal possessions nor official ceremony could add anything to his stature the night was warm almost oppressive but the sky was clear and a brilliant moon hung low in the southwest ten kilometres away the lights of new york glowed on the skyline like a dawn frozen in the act of breaking stormgren raised his eyes above the sleeping city climbing again the heights that he alone of living men had scaled far away though it was he could see the hull of karellens ship glinting in the moonlight he wondered what the supervisor was doing for he did not believe that the overlords ever slept high above a meteor thrust its shining spear through the dome of the sky the luminous trail glowed faintly for a while then it died away leaving only the stars the reminder was brutal in a hundred years karellen would still be leading mankind towards the goal that he alone could see but four months from now another man would be secretarygeneral that in itself stormgren was far from mindingbut it meant that little time was left if he ever hoped to learn what lay behind that thickened screen only in the last few days had he dared to admit that the overlords secretiveness was beginning to obsess him until recently his faith in karellen had kept him free from doubts but now he thought a little wryly the protests of the freedom league were beginning to have their effect upon him it was true that the propaganda about mans enslavement was no more than propaganda few people seriously believed it or really wished for a return to the old days men had grown accustomed to karellens imperceptible rulebut they were becoming impatient to know who ruled them and how could they be blamed though it was much the largest the freedom league was only one of the organizations that opposed karellenand consequently the humans who cooperated with the overlords the objзctions and policies of these groups varied enormously some took the religious viewpoint while others were merely expressing a sense of inferiority they felt with good reason much as a cultured indian of the nineteenth century must have done as he contemplated the british raj the invaders had brought peace and prosperity to earthbut who knew what the cost might be history was not reassuring even the most peaceable of contacts between races at very different cultural levels had often resulted in the obliteration of the more backward society nations as well as individuals could lose their spirit when confronted by a challenge which they could not meet and the civilization of the overlords veiled in mystery though it might be was the greatest challenge man had ever faced there was a faint click from the facsimile machine in the adjoining room as it ejected the hourly summary sent out by central news stormgren wandered indoors and ruffled halfheartedly through the sheets on the other side of the world the freedom league had inspired a notveryoriginal headline is man ruled by monsters asked the paper and went on to quote addressing a meeting in madras today dr c v krishnan president of the eastern division of the freedom league said the explanation of the overlords behaviour is quiet simple their physical form is so alien and repulsive that they dare not show themselves to humanity i challenge the supervisor to deny this stormgren threw down the sheet in disgust even if the charge were true did it really matter the idea was an old one but it had never worried him he did not believe that there was my biological form however strange which he could not accept lii time and perhaps even find beautiful the mind not the body was all that mattered if only he could convince karellen of this the overlords might change their policy it was certain that they could not be half as hideous as the imaginative drawings that had filled the papers soon after their coming to earth yet it was not stormgren knew entirely consideration for his successor that made him anxious to see the end of this state of affairs he was honest enough to admit that in the final analysis his main motive was simple human curiosity he bad grown to know karellen as a person and he would never be satisfied until he had also discovered what kind of creature he might be when stormgren fiiiled to arrive at his usual time next morning pieter van ryberg was surprised and a little annoyed though the secretary general often made a number of calls before reaching his own office he invariably left word that he was doing so this morning to make matters worse there had been several urgent messages for stormgren van ryberg rang haifa dozen departments to try and locate him then gave it up in disgust by noon he had become alarmed and sent a car to stormgrens house ten minutes later he was startled by the scream of a siren and a police patrol came racing up roosevelt drive the news agencies must have had friends in that vehicle for even as van ryberg watched it approach the radio was telling the world that he was no longer merely assistantbut actingsecretarygeneral of the united nations had van ryberg fewer troubles on his hands he would have found it entertaining to study the press reactions to stormgrens disappearance for the past month the worlds papers had divided themselves into two sharply defined groups the western press on the whole approved of karllens plan to make all men citizens of the world the eastern countries on the other hand were undergoing violent but largely synthetic spasms of national pride some of them had been independent for little more than a generation and felt that they bad been cheated out of their gains criticism of the overlords was widespread and energetic after an initial period of extreme caution the press had quickly found that it could be as rude to karellen as it liked and nothing would happen now it was excelling itself most of these attacks though very vocal were not representative of the great mass of the people along the frontiers that would soon be gone forever the guards had been doubled but the soldiers eyed each other with a still inarticulate friendliness the politicians and the generals might storm and rave but the silently waiting millions felt that none too soon a long and bloody chapter of history was coming to an end and now stormgren had gone noone knew where the tumult suddenly subsided as the world realized that it had lost the only man through whom the overlords for their own strange reasons would speak to earth a paralysis seemed to descend upon the press and radio commentators but in the silence could be heard the voice of the freedom league anxiously protesting its innocence it was utterly dark when stormgren awoke for a moment he was too sleepy to realize how strange that was then as full consciousness dawned he sat up with a start and felt for the switch beside his bed in the darkness his hand encountered a bare stone wall cold to the touch he froze instantly mind and body paralysed by the impact of the unexpected then scarcely believing his senses he kneeled on the bed and began to explore with his fingertips that shockingly unfamiliar wall he had been doing this only for a moment when there was a sudden click and a section of the darkness slid aside he caught a glimpse of a man silhouetted against a dimly lit background then the door closed again and the darkness returned it happened so swiftly that he had no chance to see anything of the room in which he was lying an instant later he was dazzled by the light of a powerful electric torch the beam ffickered across his face held him steadily for a moment then dipped to illuminate the whole bed which was he now saw nothing more than a mattress supported on rough planks out of the darkness a soft voice spoke to him in excellent english but with an accent which stormgren could not at first identif au mr secretaryim glad to see youre awake i hope you feel quite all right there was something about the last sentence that caught stormgrens attention so that the angry questions he had been about to ask died upon his lips he stared back into the darkness then replied calmly how long have i been uflcofl scious the other chuckled several days we were promised thered be no aftereffects im glad to see its true partly to gain time partly to test his own reactions stormgren swung his legs over the side of the bed he was sqil wearing his nightclothes but they were badly crumpled and seemed to have gathered considerable dirt as he moved he felt a slight dizzinessnot enough to be unpleasant but sufficient to convince him that he had indeed been drugged he turned towards the light where am i he said sharply does wainwright know about this now dont get excited replied the shadowy figure we wont talk about that sort of thing yet i guess youre pretty hungry get dressed and come along to dinner the oval of light slipped across the room and for the first time stormgren had an idea of its dimensions it was scarcely a room at all for the walls seemed bare rock roughly smoothed into shape he realized that he was underground possibly at a great depth and if he had been unconscious for several days he might be anywhere on earth the torchlight illuminated a pile of clothes draped over a packingcase this should be enough for you said the voice from the darkness laundrys rather a problem here so we grabbed a couple of your suits and half a dozen shirts that said stormgren without humour was very considerate of you were sorry about the absence of furniture and electric light this place is convenient in some ways but it rather lacks amenities convenient for what asked stormgren as he climbed into a shirt the feel of the familiar cloth beneath his fingers was strangely reassuring justconvenient said the voice and by the way since were likely to spend a good deal of time together youd better call me joe despite your nationality retorted stormgren youre eolish arent youi think i could pronounce your real name et wont be worse than many finnish ones there was a slight pause and the light flickered for an distant well i should have expected it said joe resignedly you must have plenty of practice at this sort of thing its a useful hobby for a man in my position at a guess i ihould say you were brought up in the united states but didnt eave poland until that said joe firmly is quite enough as you seem to save finished dressingthank you the door opened as stormgren walked towards it feeling nildly elated by his small victory as joe stood aside to let aim pass he wondered if his captor was armed almost cerainly he would be and in any case he would have friends around the corridor was dimly lit by oil lamps at intervals and for the first time stormgren could see joe clearly he was a man df about fifty and must have weighed well over two hundred pounds everything about him was outsize from the stained battledress that might have come from any of half a dozen armed forces to the startlingly large signet ring on his left band a man built on this scale probably would not bother to carry a gun it should not be difficult to trace him thought stormgren if he ever got out of this place he was a little de pressed to realize that joe must also be perfectly well aware of this fact the walls around them though occasionally faced with concrete were mostly bare rock it was dear to stormgren that he was in some disused mine and he could think of few more effective prisons until now the fact of his kidnapping had failed to worry him greatly he had felt that whatever happened the immense resources of the overlords would soon locate and rescue him now he was not so sure he had already been gone several daysand nothing had happened there must be a limit even to karellens power and if he were indeed buried in some remote continent all the science of the overlords might be unable to trace him there were two other men sitting at the table in the bare dimly lit room they looked up with intercst and more than a little respect as stormgren entered one of them pushed across a bundle of sandwiches which stormgren accepted eagerly though he felt extremely hungry he could have done with a more interesting meal but it was probable that his captors had dined no better as he ate he glanced quickly at the three men around him oe was by far the most outstanding character and not merely in the matter of physical bulk the others were clearly his assistantsnondescript individuals whose origins stormgren would be able to place when he heard them talk some wine had been produced in a nottooaseptic glass and stormgren washed down the last of the sandwiches feeling now more fully in command of the situation he turned to the huge pole well he said evenly perhaps youll tell me what all this is about and just what you hope to get out of it joe cleared his throat id like to make one thing straight he said this is nothing to do with wainwright hell be as surprised as anyone stormgren had half expected this though he wondered why joe was confirming his suspicions he had long suspected the existence of an extremist movement insideor on the frontiers ofthe freedom league as a matter of interest he said how did you kidnap me he hardly expected a reply to this and was somewhat taken aback by the others readinesseven eagernessto answer it was all rather like a hollywood thriller said joe cheerfully we werent sure if karellen kept a watch on you so we took somewhat elaborate precautions you were knocked out by gas in the airconditionerthat was easy then we carried you out into the carno trouble at all all this i might say wasnt done by any of our people we hirederprofessionals fur the job karellen may get themin fact hes supposed to but hell be no wiser when it left your house the car drove into a long road tunnel not a thousand kilometres from new york it came out again on schedule at the opposite end still carrying a drugged man extraordinarily like the secretarygeneral quite a while later a large truck loaded with metal cases emerged in the opposite direction and drove to a certain airfield where the cases were loaded aboard a freighter on perfectly legitimate business im sure the owners of those cases would be horrified to know how we employed them meanwhile the car that had actually done the job continued elaborate evasive action towards the canadian border perhaps karellens caught it by now i dont know or care as youll ieei do hope you appreciate my franknessour whole plan depended on one thing were pretty sure that karellen can ee and hear everything that happens on the surface of the earthbut unless he uses magic not science he cant see mderneath it so he wont know about the transfer in the tunnelat least until its too late naturally weve taken a risk but there were also oneor two other safeguards i wont go into aow we may want to use them again and it would be a pity to give them away joe had related the whole story with such obvious gusto that stormgren could hardly help smiling yet he also felt very iisturbed the plan was an ingenious one and it was quite possible that karellen had been deceived stormgren was not even certain that the overlord kept any form of protective rnrveillance over him nor clearly was joe perhaps that was why he had been so frankhe wanted to test stormgrens reactions well he would try and appear confident whatever his real feelings might be you must be a lot of fools said stormgren scornfully if you think you can trick the overlords as easily as this in any case what conceivable good will it do joe offered him a cigarette which stormgren refused then it one himself and sat on the edge of the table there was an ominous creaking and he jumped off hastily our motives he began should be pretty obvious weve found arguments useless so we have to take other measures there have been underground movements before and even karellen whatever powers hes got wont find it easy to deal with us were out to fight for our independence dont misunderstand me therell be nothing violentat hat anywaybut the overlords have to use human agents and we can make it mighty uncomfortable for them starting with me i suppose thought stormgren he wondered if the other had given him more than a fraction of the whole story did they really think that these gangster methods would influence karellen in the slightest on the ther hand it was quite true that a wellorganized resistance movement could make life very difficult for joe had put his luger on the one weak spot in the overlords rule ultimately all their orders were carried out by human agents if these were terrorized into disobedience the whole system might collapse it was only a faint possibility for stormgren felt confident that karellen would soon find some solution what do you intend to do with me asked stormgren at length am i a hostage or what dont worrywell look after you we expect some visitors in a few days and until then well entertain you as well as we can he added some words in his own language and one of the others produced a brandnew pack of cards we got these especially fur you explained joe i read in time the other day that you were a good poker player his voice suddenly became grave i hope theres plenty of cash in your wallet he said anxiously we never thought of looking after all we can hardly accept cheques quite overcome stormgren stared blankly at his captors then as the true humour of the situation sank into his mind it suddenly seemed to him that all the cares and worries of office had lifted from his shoulders from now on it was van rybergs show whatever happened there was absolutely nothing he could do about itand now these fantastic criminals were anxiously waiting to play poker with him abruptly he threw back his head and laughed as he had not done for years there was no doubt thought van ryberg morosely that wainwright was telling the truth he might have his suspicions but he did not know who hadkidnapped stormgren nor did he approve of the kidnapping itself van ryberg had a shrewd idea that for some tune extremists in the freedom league had been putting pressure on wainwright to make him adopt a more active policy now they were taking matters into their own hands the kidnapping had been beautifully organized there was no doubt of that stormgren might be anywhere on earth and there seemed little hope of tracing him yet something must be done decided van ryberg and done quickly despite the jest he had so often made his real feeling towards karellen was one of overwhelming awe the thought of approaching the supervisor directly filled him with dismay but there seemed no alternative the communications section occupied the entire top floor of the great building lines of facsimile machines some silent some clicking busily stretched away into the distance through them poured endless streams of statisticsproduction figures census returns and all the bookkeeping of a world economic system somewhere up in karellens ship must lie the equivalent of this great roomand van ryberg wondered with a tingling of the spine what shapes moved to and fro collecting the messages that earth was sending to the overlords but today he was not interested in these machines and the routine business they handled he walked to the little private room that only stormgren was supposed to enter at his instructions the lock had been forced and the chief communications officer was waiting there for him its an ordinary teleprinterstandard typewriter keyboard he was told theres a facsimile machine as well if you want to send any pictures or tabular informationbut you said you wouldnt be needing that van ryberg nodded absently lhats all thanks he said i dont expect to be here very long then get the place locked up again and give me all the keys he waited until the communications officer had left and then sat down at the machine it was he knew very seldom used since nearly all business between karellen and stormgren was dealt with at their weekly meetings since this was something of an emergency circuit he expected a reply fairly quickly after a moments hesitation he began to tap out his message with unpractised fingers the machine purred away quietly and the words gleamed for a few seconds on the darkened screen then he leaned back and waited for the answer scarcely a minute later the machine started to whirr again not for the first time van ryberg wondered if the supervisor ever slept the message was as brief as it was unhelpful no information leave matters entirely to your discretion k rather bitterly and without any satisfaction at all van ryberg realized how much greatness had been thrust upon him during the past three days stormgren had analysed his captors with some thoroughness joe was the only one of any importance the others were nonentitiesthe riffraff one would expect any illegal movement to gather round itself the ideals of the freedom league meant nothing to them their only concern was earning a living with the minimum of work joe was an altogether more complex individual though sometimes he reminded stormgren of an overgrown baby their interminable poker games were punctuated with violent political arguments and it soon became obvious to stormgren that the big pole had never thought seriously about the causes for which he was fighting emotion and extreme conservatism clouded all his judgments his countrys long struggle for independence had conditioned him so completely that ie still lived in the past he was a picturesque survival one of those who had no use for an ordered way of life when his type vanished if it ever did the world would be a safer but lessinteresting place there was now little doubt as far as storingren was concerned that karellen had failed to locate him he had tried to blufl but his captors were unconvinced he was fairly certain that they had been holding him here to see if karellen would act and now that nothing had happened they could proceed with their plans stormgren was not surprised when four days after his capture joe told him to expect visitors for some time the little group had shown increasing nervousness and the prisoner guessed that the leaders of the movement having seen that the coast was dear were at last coming to collect him they were already waiting gathered round the rickety table when joe waved him politely into the living room stormgren was amused to note that his jailer was now wearing very ostentatiously a huge pistol that had never been in evidence before the two thugs had vanished and even joe seemed somewhat restrained stormgren could see at once that he was now confronted by men of a much higher calibre and the group opposite him reminded him strongly of a picture he had once seen of lenin and his associates in the first days of the russian revolution there was the same intellectual force iron determination and ruthlessness in these six men joe and his kind were harmless here were the real brains behind the organization with a curt nod stormgren moved over to the only vacant seat and tried to look selfpossessed as he approached the elderly thickset man on the far side of the table leaned forward and stared at him with piercing grey eyes they made stormgren so uncomfortable that he spoke firstsomething he had not intended to do i suppose youve come to discuss terms whats my ransom he noticed that in the background someone was taking down his words in a shorthand notebook it was all very businesslike the leader replied in a musical welsh accent you could put it that way mr secretarygenera but were interested in information not cash so that was it thought stormgren he was a prisoner of war and this was his interrogation you know what our motives are continued the other in his softly lilting voice call us a resistance movement if you like we believe that sooner or later earth will have to fight for its independencebut we realize that the struggle can only be by indirect methods such as sabotage and disobedience we kidnapped you partly to show karellen that we mean business and are well organized but largely because you are the only man who can tell us anything of the overlords youre a reasonable man mr stormgren give us your cooperation and you can have your freedom exactly what do you wish to know asked stormgren cautiously those extraordinary eyes seemed to search his mind to its depths they were unlike any that stormgren had ever seen in his life then the singsong voice replied do you know who or what the overlords really are stormgren almost smiled believe me he said im quite as anxious as you to discover that then youll answer our questions i make no promises but i may there was a slight sigh of relief from joe and a rustle of anticipation ran round the room we have a general idea continued the other of the circumstances in which you meet karellen but perhaps you would describe them carefully leaving out nothing of importance that was harmless enough thought storingren he had done it many times before and it would give the appearance of cooperation there were acute minds here and perhaps they could uncover something new they were welcome to any fresh information they could extract from himso long as they shared it that it could harm karellen in any way he did not fur a moment believe stormgren felt in his pockets and produced a pencil and an old envelope sketching rapidly while he spoke he began you know of course that a small flying machine with no obvious means of propulsion calls for me at regular intervals and takes me up to karellens ship it enters the hulland youve doubtless seen the telescopic films that have been taken of that operation the door opens againif you can call it a doorand i go into a small room with a table a chair and a vision screen the layout is something like this he pushed the plan across to the old welshrnan but the strange eyes never turned towards it they were still fixed on stormgrens face and as he watched them something seemed to change in their depths the room had become completely silent but behind him he heard joe take a sudden indrawn breath puzzled and annoyed stormgren stared back at the other and as he did so understanding slowly dawned in his confusion he crumpled the envelope into a ball of paper and ground it underfoot he knew now why those grey eyes had affected him so strangely the man opposite him was blind van ryberg had made no further attempts to contact karellen much of his departments workthe forwarding of statistical information the abstracting of the worlds press and the likehad continued automatically in paris the lawyers were still wrangling over the proposed world constitution but that was none of his business for the moment it was a fortnight before the supervisor wanted the final draft if it was not ready by then no doubt karellen would take what action he thought fit and there was still no news of stormgren van ryberg was dictating when the emergency only telephone started to ring he grabbed the receiver and listened with mounting astonishment then threw it down and rushed to the open window in the distance cries of anlazement were rising from the streets and traffic was slowing to a halt it was true karellens ship that neverchanging symbol of the overlords was no longer in the sky he searched the heavens as far as he could see and found no trace of it then suddenly it seemed as if night had swiftly fallen coming down from the north its shadowed underbelly black as a thundercloud the great ship was racing low over the towers of new york involuntarily van ryberg shrank away from the onrushing monster he had always known how huge the ship of the overlords really werebut it was one thing to see them far away in space and quite another to watch them passing overhead like demondriven clouds in the darkness of that partial eclipse he watched until the ship and its monstrous shadow had vanished into the south there was no sound not even the whisper of air and van ryberg realized that despite its apparent nearness the ship had passed at least a kilometre above his head then the building shuddered once as the shock wave struck it and from somewhere came the tinkling of broken glass as a window blew inwards in the office behind him all the telephones had started to ring but van ryberg did not move he remained leaning against the window ledge still staring into the south paralysed by the presence of illimitable power as stormgren talked it seemed to him that his mind was operating on two levels simultaneously on the one hand he was trying to defy the men who had captured him yet on the other he was hoping that they might help him unravel karellens secret it was a dangerous game yet to his surprise he was enjoying it the blind weishman had conducted most of the interrogation it was fascinating to watch that agile mind trying one opening after another testing and rejecting all the theories that stormgren himself had abandoned long ago presently he leaned back with a sigh were getting nowhere he said resignedly we want more facts and that means action not argument the sightless eyes seemed to stare thoughtfully at stormgren for a moment he tapped nervously on the tableit was the first sign of uncertainty that stormgren had noticed then he continued im a little surprised mr secretary that youve never made any effort to learn more about the overlords what do you suggest asked stormgren coldly trying to disguise his interest ive told you that theres only one way out of the room in which i have my talks with karellenand that leads straight back to earth it might be possible mused the other to devise instruments which could teach us something im no scientist but we can look into the matter if we give you your freedom would you be willing to assist with such a plan once and fur all said stormgren angrily let me make my position perfectly clear karellen is working for a united world and ill do nothing to help his enemies what his ultimate plans may be i dont know but i believe that they are good what real proof have we of that all his actions ever since his ships appeared in our skies i defy you to mention one act that in the ultimate analysis hasnt been beneficial stormgren paused for a moment letting his mind run back thrpugh the past years then he smiled if you want a single proof of the essentialhow shall i put itbenevolence of the overlords think of that crueltytoanimals order which they made within a month of their arrival if i had any doubts about karellen before that banished them even though that order baa caused me more trouble than anything else hes ever done that was scarcely an exaggeration stormgren thought the whole incident had been an extraordinary one the first revelation of the overlords hatred of cruelty that and their passion for justice and order seemed to be the dominant emotions in their livesas far as one could judge them by their actions and it was the only time karellen bad shown anger or at least the appearance of anger you may kill one another if you wish the message had gone and that is a matter between you and your own laws but if you slay except for food or in selfdefence the beasts that share your world with youthen you may be answerable to me no one knew exactly how comprehensive this ban was supposed to be or what karellen would do to enforce it they had not long to wait the plaza de toros was full when the matadors and their attendants began their professional entry everything seemed normal the brilliant sunlight blazed harshly on the traditional costumes the great crowd greeted its favourites as it had a hundred times before yet here and there faces were turned anxiously towards the sky to the aloof silver shape fifty kilometres above madrid then the picadors bad taken up their places and the bull had come snorting out into the arena the skinny horses nostrils wide with terror had wheeled in the sunlight as their riders forced them to meet their enemy the first lance flashedmade contactand at that moment came a sound that had never been heard on earth befbre it was the sound often thousand people screaming with the pain of the same woundten thousand people who when they bad recovered from the shock found themselves completely unharmed but that was the end of that bullfight and indeed of all bullfighting for the news spread rapidly it is worth recording that the aficionados were so shaken that only one in ten asked for their money back and also that the london daily mirror made matters much worse by suggesting that the spaniards adopt cricket as a new national sport you may be correct the old weishman replied possibly the motives of the overlords are goodaccording to their standards which may sometimes be the same as ours but they are interloperswe never asked them to come here and turn our world upsidedown destroying idealsyes and nationsthat generations of men have fought to protect i come from a small nation that had to fight for its liberties retorted stormgren yet i am for kareilen you may annoy him you may even delay the achievement of his aims but it will make no difference m the end doubtless you are sincere in believing as you do i can understand your fear that the traditions and cultures of little countries will be overwhelmed when the world state arrives but you are wrong it is useless to cling to the past even before the overlords came to earth the sovereign state was dying they have merely hastened its end no one can save it nowand no one should try there was no answer the man opppsite neither moved nor spoke he sat with his lips half open his eyes now lifeless as well as blind around hint the others were equally motionless frozen in strained unnatural attitudes with a gasp of pure horror stormgren rose to his feet and backed away towards the door as he did so the silence was suddenly broken that was a nice speech rikki thank you now i think we can go stormgren spun on his heels and stared into the shadowed corridor floating there at eyelevel was a small featureless spherethe source no doubt of whatever mysterious force the overlords had brought into action it was hard to be sure but stormgren imagined that be could hear a faint humming as of a hive of bees on a drowsy summer day karellen thank god but what have you done dont worryj theyre quite all right you can call it a paralysis but its much subtler than that theyre simply living a few thousand years more slowly than normal when weve gone theyll never know what happened youll leave them here until the police come no ive a much better plan im letting them go stormgren felt a surprising sense of relief he gave a last valedictory glance at the little room and its frozen occupants joe was standing on one foot staring very stupidly at nothing suddenly stormgren laughed and fumbled in his pockets thanks for the hospitality joe he said i think ill leave a souvenir he ruffled through the scraps of paper until he had found the figures he wanted then on a reasonably clean sheet he wrote carefully bu of manhattan pay joe the sum of one hundred thirtyfive dollars and fifty cents r stormgren as he laid the strip of paper beside the pole karellens voice enquired exactly what are you doing we stormgrens always pay our debts the other two cheated but joe played fair at least i never caught him out he felt very gay and lightheaded and quite forty years younger as he walked to the door the metal sphere moved aside to let him pass he assumed that it was some kind of robot and it explained how karellen had been able to reach him through the unknown layers of rock overhead carry straight on for a hundred metres said the sphere speaking in karellens voice then turn to the left until i give you further instructions he strode forward eagerly though he realized that there was no need for hurry the sphere remained hanging in the corridor presumably covering his retreat a minute later he came across a second sphere waiting for him at a branch in the corridor youve half a kilometre to go it said keep to the left until we meet again six times he encountered the spheres on his way to the open at first he wondered if somehow the robot was managing to keep ahead of him then he guessed that there must be a chain of the machines maintaining a complete circuit down into the depths of the mine at the entrance a group of guards formed a piece of improbable statuary watched over by yet another of the ubiquitous spheres on the hillside a few metres away lay the little flying machine in which stormgren had made all his journeys tokarellen he stood for a moment blinking in the sunlight then he saw the ruined mining machinery around hint and beyond that a derelict railway stretching down the mountainside several kilometres away a dense forest lapped at the base of the mountain and very far off stormgren could see the gleam of water from a great lake he guessed that he was somewhere in south america though it was not easy to say exactly what gave him that impression as he climbed into the little flying machine stormgren had a last glimpse of the mine entrance and the men frozen around it then the door sealed behind him and with a sigh of relief he sank back upon the familiar couch for a while he waited until he had recovered his breath then he uttered a single heartfelt syllable well im sorry i couldnt rescue you before but you see how very important it was to wait until all the leaders bad gathered here do you mean to say spluttered stormgren that you knew where i was all the time if i thought dont be too hasty answered karellen at least let me nish expiining very well said stormgren darkly im listening he was beginning to suspect that he had been no more than bait in an elaborate trap ive had aperhaps tracer is the best word for iton you for some time began karellen though your late friends were correct in thinking that i couldnt follow you underground i was able to keep track until they brought you to the nine that transfer in the tunnel was ingenious but when the first car ceased to react it gave the plan away and i soon located you again then it was merely a matter of waiting i knew that once they were certain id lost you the leaders would come here and id be able top them all but youre letting them go until now said karellen i had no way of telling who of the two and a half billion men on this planet were the real heads of the organization now that theyre located i can trace their movements anywhere on earth and can watch their actions in detail if i want to thats far better than locking them up if they make any moves theyll betray their remaining comrades theyre effectively neutralized and they know it your rescue will be completely inexplicable to them for you must have vanished before their eyes that rich laugh echoed round the tiny room in some ways the whole affair was a comedy but it had a serious purpose im not merely concerned with the few score men in this organizationi have to think of the moral effect on other groups that exist elsewhere stormgren was silent for a while he was not altogether satisfied but he could see karellens point of view and some of his anger had evaporated its a pity to do it in my last few weeks of office he said finally but from now on im going to have a guard on my house pieter can be kidnapped next time how has he managed by the way ive watched him carefwly this last week and have deliberately avoided helping him on the whole hes done very well but hes not the man to take your place thats lucky for him said stormgren still somewhat aggrieved and by the way have you had any word yet from your superiorsabout showing yourself to us im sure now that its the strongest argument your enemies have again and again they told me well never trust the overlords until we can see them kardilen sighed no ive heard nothing but i know what the answer must be stormgren did not press the matter once he might have done so but now for the first time the faint shadow of a plan was beginning to take shape in his mind the words of his interrogator passed again through his memory yes perhaps instruments could be devised what he had refused to do under duress he might yet attempt of his own free will it would never have occurred to stormgren even a few days before that he could seriously have considered the action he was plnnning now this ridiculously melodramatic kidnapping which in retrospect seemed like a thirdrate tv drama probably had a great deal to do with his new outlook it was the first time in his life that stormgren had ever been exposed to violent physical action as opposed to the verbal battles of the conference room the virus must have entered his bloodstream or else he was merely approaching second childhood more quickly than he had supposed sheer curiosity was also a powerful motive and so was a determination to get his own back for the trick that had been played upon him it was perfectly obvious now that karellen had used him as a bait and even if this had been for the best of reasons stormgren did not feel inclined to forgive the supervisor at once pierre duval showed no surprise when stormgren walked unannounced into his office they were old friends and there was nothing unusual in the secretarygeneral paying a personal visit to the chief of the science bureau certainly karellen would not think it odd if by any chance heor one of his underlingsturned his instruments of surveillance upon this spot for a while the two men talked business and exchanged political gossip then rather hesitantly stormgren came to the point as his visitor talked the old frenchman leaned back in his chair and his eyebrows rose steadily millimetre by millimetre until they were almost entangled in his forelock once or twice he seemed about to speak but each time thought better of it when stormgren had finished the scientist looked nervously around the room do you think hes listening he said i dont believe he can hes got what he calls a tracer on me for my protection but it doesnt work underground which is one reason why i came down to this dungeon of yours its supposed to be shielded from all forms of radiation isnt it karellens no magician he knows where i am but thats all i hope youre right apart from that wont there be trouble when he discovers what youre trying to do because he will you know ill take that risk besides we understand each other rather well the physicist toyed with his pencil and stared into space for a while its a very pretty problem i like it he said simply then he dived into a drawer and produced an enormous writingpad quite the biggest that stormgren had ever seen right he began scribbling furiously in what seemed to be some private shorthand let me make sure i have all the facts tell me everything you can about the room in which you have your interviews dont omit any derail however trivial it seems there isnt much to describe its made of metal and is about eight metres square and four high the vision screen is about a metre on a side and theres a desk immediately beneath ithere it will be quicker if i draw it for you rapidly stormgren sketched the little room he knew so well and pushed the drawing over to duval as he did so he recalled with a slight shiver the last time he had done this sort of thing he wondered what had happened to the blind welshman and his confederates and how they had reacted to his abrupt departure the frenchman studied the drawing with a puckered brow and thats all you can tell me duval snorted in disgust what about lighting do you sit in total darkness and how about ventilation heating stormgren smiled at the characteristic outburst the whole ceiling is luminous and as far as i can tell the air comes through the speaker grille i dont know how it leaves perhaps the stream reverses at intervals but i havent noticed it theres no sign of any heater but the room is always at normal temperature meaning i suppose that the water vapour has frozen out but not the carbon dioxide stormgren did his best to smile at the wellworn joke i think ive told you everything he concluded as for the machine that takes me up to kardllens ship the room in which i travel is as featureless as an elevator cage apart from he couch and table it might very well be one there was silence for several minutes while the physicist embroidered his writingpad with meticulous and microscopic doodles as he watched stormgren wondered why it was that a man like duvalwhose mind was incomparably more brilliant than his ownhad never made a greater mark in the world of science he remembered an unkind and probably inaccurate comment of a friend in the us state department the french produce the best secondraters in the world duval was the sort of man who supported that statement the physicist nodded to himself in satisfaction leaned forward and pointed his pencil at stormgren what makes you think rikki he asked that karellens visionscreen as you call it really is what it pretends to be ive always taken it for granted it looks exactly like one what else would it be anyway when you say that it looks like a visionscreen you mean dont you that it looks like one of ours of course i find that suspicious in itself im sure the overlords own apparatus wont use anything so crude as an actual physical screentheyll probably materialize images directly in space but why should karellen bother to use a tv system anyway the simplest solution is always best doesnt it seem far more probable that your visionscreen is really wtluizg mon cornplicoed than a sheet of oneway glass stormgren was so annoyed with himself that for a moment h sat in silence retracing the past from the beginning he jid never challenged rardllens storyyet now he came to look back when had th supervisor ever told him that he was using a tv system he had simply taken it for granted the whole thing had been a piece of psychological trickery and he had been completely deceived always assuming of course that duvals theory was correct but he was jumping to conclusions again no one had proved anything yet if youre right he said all i have to do is to smash the glass duval sighed these unscientific laymen do you think itll be made of anything you could smash without explosives and if you succeeded do you imagine that karellen is likely to breathe the same air that we do wont it be nice for both of you if he flourishes in an atmosphere of chlorine storrogren felt a little foolish he should have thought of that well what do you suggest he asked with some exasperation i want to think it over first of all weve got to find if my theory is correct and if so learn something about the material of that screen ill put a couple of my men on the job by the way i suppose you carry a briefcase when you visit the supervisor is it the one youve got there yes it should be big enough we dont want to attract attention by changing it for another particularly if karellens grown used to it what do you want me to do asked stormgren carry a concealed xray set the physicist grinned i dont know yet but well think of something ill let you know what it is in a fortnights time he gave a little laugh do you know what all this reminds me of yes said stormgren promptly the time you were building illegal radio sets during the german occupation duval looked disappointed well i suppose i have mentioned that once or twice before but theres one other thiug whats that when you are caught i didnt know what you wanted the gear for what after all the fuss you once made about the scientists social responsibility for his inventions really pierre im ashamed of you stormgren laid down the thick folder of typescript with a sigh of relief thank heavens thats settled at last he said its strange to think that these few hundred pages hold the future of mankind the world state i never thought i would see it in my lifetime he dropped the file into his briefcase the back of which was no more than ten centimetres from the dark rectangle of the screen from time to nine his fingers played across the locks in a halfconscious nervous reaction but he had no intention of pressing the concealed switch until the meeting was over there was a chance that something might go wrong though duval had sworn that karellen would detect nothing one could never be sure now you said youd some news for me stormgren continued with scarcely concealed eagerness is it about yes said karellen i received a decision a few hours ago what did he mean by that wondered storingren surely it was not possible for the supervisor to have communicated with his distant home across the unknown numbers of light years that separated him from his base or perhapsthis was van rybergs theoryhe had merely been consulting some vast computing machine which could predict the outcome of any political action i dont think continued karellen that the freedom league and its associates will be very satisfied but it should help to reduce the tension we wont record this by the way youve often told me rikki that no matter how unlike you we are physically the human race would soon grow accustomed to us that shows a lack of imagination on your part it would probably be true in your case but you must remember that most of the world is still uneducated by any reasonable standards and is riddled with prejudices and superstitions that may take decades to eradicate you will grant that we know something of human psychology we know rather accurately what would happen if we revealed ourselves to the world in its present state of developmerit i cant go into details even with you so you must accept my analysis on trust we can however make this definite promise which should give you some satisfaction in fifty yearstwo generations from nowwe will come down from our ships and humanity will at last see us as we are stormgren was silent for a while absorbing the supervisors words he felt little of the satisfaction that karellens statement would once have given him indeed he was somewhat confused by his partial success and for a moment his resolution faltered the truth would come with the passage of time all his plotting was unnecessary and perhaps unwise if he still went ahead it would be only for the selfish reason that he would not be alive in fifty years karellen must have seen his irresolution for he continued im sorry if this disappoints you but at least the political problems of the near future wont be your responsibility perhaps you will think that our fears are unfounded but believe me weve had convincing proofs of the danger of any other course stormgren leaned forward breathing heavily so you have been seen by man i didnt say that karellen answered promptly your world isnt the only planet weve supervised stormgren was not to be shaken off so easily there have been many legends suggesting that elth has been visited in the past by other races i know ive read the iistorical research sections report it makes earth look like the crossroads of the universe there may have been visits about which you know nothing said stormgren still angling hopefully though since you must have been observing us for thousands of years i suppose thats rather unlikely i suppose it is replied karellen in his most unhelpful manner and at that moment stormgren made up his mind karellen he said abruptly ill draft out the statement and send it up to you for approval but i reserve the right to continue pestering you and if i see any opportunity ill do my best to learn your secret im perfectly well aware of that replied the supervisor with a slight chuckle and you dont mind not in the leastthough i draw the line at nuclear weapons poison gas or anything else that might strain our friendship stormgren wondered what if anything karellen had guessed behind the supervisors banter he had recognized the note of understanding perhapswho could telleven of encouragement im glad to know it stormgrcn replied in as level a voice as he could manage he rose to his feet bringing down the cover of his case as he did so his thumb slid along the catch ill draft that statement at once he repeated and send it up on the teletype later today while he was speaking he pressed the buttonand knew that all his fears had been groundless karellens senses were no subtler than mans the supervisor could have detected nothing for there was no change in his voice as he said goodbye and spoke the frnlilir codewords that opened the door of the chamber yet stormgren still felt like a shoplifter leaving a department store under the eyes of the housedetective and breathed a sigh of relief when the smooth wall had sealed itself behind i admit said van ryberg that some of my theories havent been very successful but tell me what you think of this one must i sighed stormgren pieter didnt seem to notice it isnt really my idea he said modestly i got it from a story of chestertons suppose the overlords are hiding the fact that theyve got nothing to hide that sounds just a little complicated to me said stormgren beginning to take slight interest what i mean is this van ryberg continued eagerly i think that physically theyre human beings like us they realize that well tolerate being ruled by creatures we imagine to be well alien and superintelligent but the human race being what it is it just wont be bossed around by creatures of the same species very ingenious like all your theories said stormgren i wish youd give them opus numbers so that i could keep up with them the objections to this one but at that moment alexander wainwright was ushered in storzngren wondered what he was thinking he wondered too if wainwright had made any contact with the men who had kidnapped him he doubted it for he believed wainwrights disapproval of violence to be perfectly genuine the extremists in his movement had discredited themselves thoroughly and it would be a long time before the world heard of them again the head of the freedom league listened carefully while the draft was read to him stormgren hoped he appreciated this gesture which had been karellens idea not for another twelve hours would the rest of the world know of the promise that had been made to its grandchildren fifty years said wainwright thoughtfully that is a long time to wait for mankind perhaps but not for karellen stormgren answered only now was he beginning to realize the nearness of the overlords solution it had given them the breathing space they believed they needed and it had cut the ground from beneath the freedom leagues feet he did not imagine that the league would capitulate but its position would be seriously weakened certainly wainwright realized this as well in fifty years he said bitterly the damage will be done those who remembered our independence will be dead humanity will have forgotten its heritage wordsempty words thought stormgren the words for which men had once fought and died and for which they would never die or fight again and the world would be better for it as he watched wainwright leave stormgren wondered how much trouble the freedom league would still causein the years that lay ahead yet that he thought with a lifting of his spirits was a problem for his successor there were some things that only time could cure evil men could be destroyed but nothing could be done with good men who were deluded heres your case said duval its as good as new thanks storrugren answered inspecting it carefully none the less now perhaps youll tell me what it was all about and what we are going to do next the physicist seemed more interested in his own thoughts what i cant understand he said is the ease with which weve got away with it now if id been kar but youre not get to the point man what did we discover ah me these excitable highlystrung nordic races sighed duval what we did was to make a type of lowpowered radar set besides radio waves of very high frequency it used far infraredall waves in fact which we were sure no creature could possibly see however weird an eye it had how could you be sure of that asked stormgren becoming intrigued by the technical problem in spite of himself wellwe couldnt be quite sure admitted duval reluctsntly but karellen views you under normal lighting doesnt he so his eyes must be approximately similar to ours in spectral range anyway it worked weve proved that there is a large room behind that screen of yours the screen is about three centimetres thick and the space behind it is at least ten metres across we couldnt detect any echo from the far wall but we hardly expected to with the low power which was all we dared use however we did get this he pushed across a piece of photographic paper on which was a single wavy line in one spot was a kink like the autograph of a mild earthquake see that little kink yes what is it only karellen good lord are you sure its a pretty safe guess hes sitting or standing or whatever it is he does about two metres on the other side of the screen if the resolution had been a bit better we might even have calculated his size stormgrens feelings were very mixed as he stared at that scarcely visible inflexion of the trace until now there had been no proof that karellen even had a material body the evidence was still indirect but he accepted it without question the other thing we had to do said duval was to calculate the transmission of the screen to ordinary light we think weve got a reasonable idea of thatanyway it doesnt matter if were out even by a factor often youll realize of course that theres no such thing as a truly oneway glass its simply a matter of arranging the lights karellen sits in a darkened room you are illuminatedthats all duval chuckled well were going to change that with the air of a conjurer producing a whole litter of white rabbits he reached into his desk and pulled out an overgrown nashlamp theend flared out into a wide nozzle so that the whole device looked rather like a blunderbuss duval grinned its not as dangerous as it looks all you have to do is to tam the nozzle against the screen and press the trigger it gives out a very powerful beam lasting ten seconds and in that dine youll be able to swing it round the room and get a good view all the light will go through the screen and it will floodlight your friend beautifully it wont hurt karellen not if you aim low and sweep upwards that will give his eyes time to adapti suppose he has reflexes like ours and we dont want to blind him stormgren looked at the weapon doubtfully and hefted it in his hand for the last few weeks his conscience had been pricking him karellen bad always treated him with unmistakable affection despite his occasional devastating frankness and now that their time together was drawing to its close he did not wish to do anything that might spoil that relationship but the supervisor had received due warning and stormgren had the conviction that if the choice had been his karellen would long ago have shown himself now the decision would be made for him when their last meeting came to its end stormgren would gaze upon karellens face it of course karellen bad a face the nervousness that stormgren had first felt had long since passed away karellen was doing almost all the talking weaving the intricate sentences which he was occasionally prone to use once this had seemed to stormgren the most wonderful and certainly the most unexpected of all karellens gifts now it no longer appeared quite so marvellous for he knew that like most of the supervisors abilities it was the result of sheer intellectual power and not of any special talent karellen had time for any amount of literary composition when he slowed his thoughts down to the pace of human speech there is no need for you or your successor to worry unduly about the freedom league even when it has recovered from its present despondency it has been very quiet for the past month and though it will revive again it will not be a danger for some years indeed since it is always valuable to know what your opponents are doing the league is a very useful institution should it ever get into financial difficulties i might even have to subsidize it stormgren had often found it difficult to tell when karellen was joking he kept his face impassive and continued to listen very soon the league will lose another of its arguments there has been a good deal of criticism all somewhat childish of the special position you have held for the past few years i found it very valuable in the early days of my administration but now that the world is moving along the lines that i planned it can cease in future all my dealings with earth will be indirect and the office of secretarygeneral can revert to something resembling its original form during the next fifty years there will be many crises but they will pass the pattern of the future is clear enough and one day all these difflqilties will be forgotteneven to a race with memories as long as yours the last words were spoken with such peculiar emphasis that stormgren immediately froze in his seat karellen he was sure never made accidental slips even his indiscretions were calculated to many decimal places but there was no time to ask questionswhich certainly would not be answeredbefore the supervisor had changed the subject again you have often asked me about our longterm plans he continued the foundation of the world state is of course only the first step you will live to see its completionbut the change will be so imperceptible that few will notice it when it comes after that there will be a period of slow consolidation while your race becomes prepared for us and thenwill comethe day which we have promised lain sorry you will not be there stormgrens eyes were open but his gaze was fixed far beyond the dark barrier of the screen he was looking into the future imagining the day that he would never see when the great ships of the overlords came down at last to earth and were thrown open to the waiting world on that day continued karellen the human race will experience what can only be called a psychological discontinuity but no permanent harm will be done the men of that age will be more stable than their grandfathers we will always have been part of their lives and when they meet us we will not seem sostrangeas we would do to you stormgren had never known karellen in so contemplative a mood but this gave him no surprise he did not believe that he had ever seen more than a few facets of the supervisors personality the real karellen was unknown and perhaps unknowable to human beings and once again stormgren had the feeling that the supervisors real interests were elsewhere and that he ruled earth with only a fraction of his mind as effortlessly as a master of threedimensional chess might play a game of draughts and after that asked stormgren softly then we can begin our real work i have often wondered what that might be tidying up our world and civilizing the human race is only a meansyou must have an end as well will we ever be able to come out into space and see your universeperhaps even help you in your tasks you can put it that way said karellenand now his voice held a clear yet inexplicable note of sadness that left stormgren strangely perturbed but suppose after all your experiment fails with man we have known such things in our own dealings with primitive human races surely you have your failures too yes said karellen so softly that stormgren could scarcely hear him we have had our failures and what do you do then we waitand try again there was a pause lasting perhaps five seconds when karellen spoke again his words were so unexpected that for a moment stormgren did not react goodbye rikki karellen had tricked himprobably it was already too late storrngrens paralysis lasted only a moment then with a single swift wellpractised movement he whipped out the flash gun and jammed it against the glass the pine trees came almost to the edge of the lake leaving along its border only a narrow strip of grass a few metres wide every evening when it was warm enough stormgren despite his ninety years would walk along this strip to the landing stage watch the sunlight die upon the water and then return to the house before the chill night wind came up from the forest the simple ritual gave him much contentment and he would continue it as long as he had the strength far away over the lake something was coming in from the west flying low and fast aircraft were uncommon in these parts unless one counted the transpolar liners which must be passing overhead every hour of the day and night but there was never any sign of their presence save an occasional vapour trail high against the blue of the stratosphere this machine was a small helicopter and it was coming towards him with obvious determination stormgren glanced along the beach and saw that there was no chance of escape then he shrugged his shoulders and sat down on the wooden bench at the head of the jetty the reporter was so deferential that stormgren found it surprising he had almost forgotten that he was not only an elder statesman but outside his own country almost a mythical figure mr stormgren the intruder began im very sorry to bother you but i wonder if youd care to comment on something weve just heard about the overlords stormgren frowned slightly after all these years he still shared karellens dislike for that word i do not think he said that i can add a great deal to what has been written elsewhere the reporter was watching him with a curious intentness i thought that you might a rather strange story has just come to our notice it seems that nearly thirty years ago one of the science bureaus technicians made some remarkable equipment for you we wondered if you could tell us anything about it for a moment stormgren was silent his mind going back into the past he was not surprised that the secret had been discovered indeed it was surprising that it had been kept so tong he rose to his feet and began to walk back along the jetty the reporter following a few paces behind the story he said contains a certain amount of truth on my last visit to karellens ship i took some apparatus with me in the hope that i might be able to see the supervisor it was rather a foolish thing to do butwell i was only sixty at the time he chuckled to himself and then continued its not much of a story to have brought you all this way you see it didnt work you saw nothing no nothing at all im afraid youll have to waitbut after all there are only twenty years to go twenty years to go yes karellen bad been right by then the world would be ready as it had not been when he had spoken that same lie to duval thirty years ago karellen had trusted him and stormgren had not betrayed his faith he was as sure as he could be of anything that the supervisor had known his plan from the beginning and had fbreseen every moment of its final act why else had that enormous chair been already empty when the circle of light blazed upon it in the same moment he had started to swing the beam fearing that he was too late the metal door twice as high as a man was closing swiftly when he first caught sight of itclosing swiftly yet not quite swiftly enough yes karellen had trusted him had not wished him to go down into the long evening of his life haunted by a mystery he could never solve karellen dared not defy the unknown powers above him but he had done all that he could if he had disobeyed them they could never prove it it was the final proof stormgren knew of karellens affection for him though it might be the affection of a man for a devoted and intelligent dog it was none the less sincere for that and stormgrens life had given him few greater satisfactions we have had our failures yes karellen that was true and were you the one who failed before the dawn of human history it must have been a failure indeed thought stormgren for its echoes to roll down all the ages to haunt the childhood of every race of man even in fifty years could you overcome the power of all the myths and legends of the world yet stormgren knew there would be no second failure when the two races met again the overlords would have won the trust and friendship of mankind and not even the shock of recognition could undo that work they would go together into the future and the unknown tragedy that must have darkened the past would be lost forever down the dim corridors of prehistoric time and stormgren hoped that when karellen was free to walk once more on earth he would one day come to these northern forests and stand beside the grave of the first man to be his friend n the golden age tins is the day whispered the radios in a hundred tongues this is the day said the headlines of a thousand newspapers this is the day thought the cameramen as they checked and rechecked the equipment gathered round the vast empty space upon which karellens ship would be descending there was only the single ship now hanging above new york indeed as the world had just discovered the ships above mans other cities had never existed the day before the great fleet of the overlords had dissolved into nothingness fading like mists beneath the morning dew the supply ships coming and going far out in space had been real enough but the silver clouds that had hung for a lifetime above almost all the capitals of earth had been an illusion how it had been done noone could tell but it seemed that every one of those ships had been nothing more than an image of karellens own vessel yet it had been far more than a matter of playing with light for radar had also been deceived and there were still men alive who swore that they had heard the shriek of torn air as the fleet came in through the skies of earth it was not important all that mattered was that karellen no longer felt the need for this displayof force he had thrown away his psychological weapons the ship is moving came the word flashed instantly to every corner of the planet it is heading westward at less than a thousand kilometres an hour falling slowly down from the empty heights of the stratosphere the ship moved out to the great plains and to its second rendezvous with history it settled down obediently before the waiting cameras and the packed thousands of spectators so few of whom coul see as much as the millions gathered round their tv sets the ground should have cracked and trembled beneath that tremendous weight but the vessel was still in the grip of whatever forces drove it among the stars it kissed the earth as gently as a falling snowflake the curving wall twenty metres above the ground seemed to flow and shimmer where there had been a smooth and shining surface a great opening had appeared nothing was visible within it even to the questing eyes of the camera it was as dark and shadowed as the entrance to a cave out of the orifice a wide glittering gangway extruded itself and drove purposefully towards the ground it seemed a solid sheet of metal with handrails along either side there were no steps it was steep and smooth as a toboggan slide and one would have thought equally impossible to ascend or descend in any ordinary manner the world was watching that dark portal within which nothing had yet stirred then the seldomheard yet unfor gettable voice of karellen floated softly down from some hidden source his message could scarcely have been more unexpected there are some children by the foot of the gangway i would like two of them to come up and meet me there was silence for a moment then a boy and a girl broke from the crowd and walked with complete lack of selfconsciousness towards the gangway and into history others followed but stopped when karellens chuckle came from the ship two will be enough eagerly anticipating the adventure the childrenthey could not have been more than six years oldjumped on to the metal slide then the first miracle happened waving cheerfiilly to the crowds beneath and to their anxious parentswho too late had probably remembered the legend of the pied piperthe children began swiftly ascending the steep slope yet their legs were motionless and soon it was clear also that their bodies were tilted at right angles to that peculiar gangway it possessed a private gravity of its own one which could ignore that of earth the children were still enjoying this novel experience and wondering what was drawing them upwards when they disappeared into the ship a vast silence lay over the whole world for the space of twenty secondsthough afterwards noone could believe that the time had been so short then the darkness of the great opening seemed to move forward and karellen came forth into the sunlight the boy was sitting on his left arm the girl on his right they were both too busy playing with karellens wings to take any notice of the watching multitude it was a tribute to the overlords psychology and to their careful years of preparation that only a few people fainted yet there could have been fewer still anywhere in the world who did not feel the ancient terror brush for one awful instant against their minds before reason banished it forever there was no mistake the leathery wings the little horns the barbed tailall were there the most terrible of all legends had come to life out of the unknown past yet now it stood smiling in ebon majesty with the sunlight gleaming upon its tremendous body and with a human child resting trustfully on either arm furry years is ample time in which to change a world and its people almost beyond recognition all that is required for the task are a sound knowledge of social engineering a clear sight of the intended goaland power these things the overlords possessed though their goal was hidden their knowledge was obviousand so was their power that power took many forms few of them realized by the peoples whose destinies the overlords now ruled the might enshrined in their great ships had been clear enough for every eye to see but behind that display of sleeping force were other and much subtler weapons all political problems karellen had once told stormgren can be solved by the correct application of power that sounds a rather cynical remark stormgren had replied doubtfully its a little too much like might is right in our own past the use of power has been notably unsuccessflu in solving anything the operative word is correct you have never possessed real power or the knowledge necessary to apply it as in all problems there are efficient and inefficient approaches suppose for example that one of your nations led by some fanatical ruler tried to revolt against me the highly inefficient answer to such a threat would be some billions of horsepower in the shape of atomic bombs if i used enough bombs the solution would be complete and finиi it would also as i remarked be inefficienteven if it possessed no other defects and the efficient solution that requires about as much power as a small radio transmitterand rather similar skills to operate for its the application of the power not its amount that matters how long do you think hitlers career as dictator of germany would have lasted if wherever he went a voice was talking quietly in his ear or if a steady musical note loud enough to drown all other sounds and to prevent sleep filled his brain night and day nothing brutal you appreciate yet in the final analysis just as irresistible as a tritium bomb i see said stormgren and there would be no place to hide no place where i could not send myahdevices if i felt sufficiently strongly about it and that is why i shall never have to use really drastic methods to maintain my position the great ships then had never been more than symbols and now the world knew that all save one had been phantoms yet by their mere presence they had changed the history of earth now their task was done and their achievementlingered behind them to go echoing down the centuries karellens calculations had been accurate the shock of revulsion had passed swiftly though there were many who prided themselves on their freedom from superstition yet would never be able to face one of the overlords there was something strange here something beyond all reason or logic in the middle ages people believed in the devil and feared him but this was the twentyfirst century could it be that after all there was such a thing as racial memory it was of course universally assumed that the overlords or beings of the same species had come into violent conflict with ancient man the meeting must have lain in the remote past for it had left no traces in recorded history here was another puzzle and karellen would give no help in its solution the overlords though they had now shown themselves to man seldom left their one remaining ship perhaps they found it physically uncomfortable on earth for their size and the existence of their wings indicated that they came from a world of much lower gravity they were never seen without a belt adorned with complex mechanisms which it was generally believed controlled their weight and enabled them to communicate with each other direct sunlight was painful to them and they never stayed in it for more than a few seconds when they had to go into the open for any length of time they wore dark glasses which gave them a somewhat incongruous appearance though they seemed able to breathe terrestrial air they sometimes carried small cylinders of gas from which they refreshed themselves occasionally perhaps these purely physical problems accounted fbr their aloofness only a small fraction of the human race had ever actually met an overlord in the flesh and noone could guess how many of them were aboard karellens ship no more than five had ever been seen together at one time but there might be hundreds even thousands of them aboard that tremendous vessel in many ways the appearance of the overlords had raised more problems than it had solved their origin was still noknown their biology a source of endless speculation on many matters they would give information freely but on others their behaviour could only be described as secretive on the whole however this did not annoy anyone except the scientists the average man though he might prefer not to meet the overlords was grateflil to them for what they had done to his world by the standards of all earlier ages it was utopia ignorance disease poverty and fear had virtually ceased to exist the memory of war was fading into the past as a nightmare vanishes with the dawn soon it would lie outside the experience of all living men with the energies of mankind directed into constructive channels the face of the world had been remade it was almost literally a new world the cities that had been good enough for earlier generations had been rebuiltor deserted and left as museum specimens when they had ceased t serve any useful purpose many cities had already been abandoned in this manner for the whole pattern of industry and commerce had changed completely production had become largely automatic the robot factories poured forth consumer goods in such unending streams that all the ordinary necessities of life were virtually free men worked for the sake of the luxuries they desired or they did not work at all it was one world the old names of the old countries were still used but they were no more than convenient postal divisions there was noone on earth who could not speak english who could not read who was not within range of a television set who could not visit the other side of the planet within twentyfour hours crime had practically vanished it had become both nonecessary and impossible when noone lacks anything there is no point in stealing moreover all potential criminals knew that there could be no escape from the surveillance of the overlords in the early days of their rule they had intervened so effectively on behalf of law and order that the lesson had never been forgotten crimes of passion though not quite extinct were almost unheard of now that so many of its psychological problems had been removed humanity was far saner and less irrational and what earlier ages would have called vice was now no more than eccentricityor at the worst bad manners one of the most noticeable changes had been a slowingdown of the mad tempo that had so characterized the twentieth century life was more leisurely than it had been for generations it therefore had less zest for the few but more tranquillity for the many western man had relearnedwhat the rest of the world had never forgottenthat there was nothing sinful in leisure as long as it did not degenerate into mere sloth whatever problems the future might bring time did not yet hang heavy on humanitys hands education was now much more thorough and much more protracted few people left college before twentyand that was merely the first stage since they normally returned again at twentyfive for at least three more years after travel and experience had broadened their minds even then they would probably take refresher urses at intervals for the remainder of their lives in the subjects that particularly interested them this extension of human apprenticeshi so far past the beginning of physical maturity had given rise to many social changes some of these had been necessary for generations but earlier periods had refused to face the challengeor had pretended that it did not exist in particular the pattern of sexual moresinsofar as there had ever been a single pattern ad altered radically it had been virtually shattered by two inventions which were ironically enough of purely human rn and owed nothing to the overlords the first was a completely reliable oral contraceptive the econd was an equally infallible methodas certain as fingerprinting and based on a very detailed analysis of the blood of identifying the father of any child the effect of these two inventions upon human society could only be described as devastating and they had swept away the last remnants of the puritan aberration another great change was the extreme mobility of the new society thanks to the perfection of airtransport everyone was free to go anywhere at a moments notice there was more room in the skies than there had ever been on the roads and the twentyfirst century had repeated on a larger scale the great american achievement of purnng a nation on wheels it had given wings to the world though not literally the ordinary private flyer or aircar had no wings at all or indeed any visible control surfaces even the clumsy rotor blades of the old helicopters had been banished yet man had not discovered antigravity only the overlords possessed that ultimate secret his aircars were propelled by forces which the wright brothers would have understood jet reaction used both directly and in the more subtle fbrm of boundary layer control drove his flyers forward and held them in the air as no laws or edicts of the overlords could have done the ubiquitous little aircars had washed away the last barriers between the different tribes of mankind profounder things had also passed it was a completely secular age of the faiths that had existed before the coming of the overlords only a forn of purified buddhismperhaps the most austere of all religionsstill survived the creeds that had been based upon miracles and revelations had collapsed utterly with the rise of education they had already been slowly dissolving but for a while the overlords had taken no sides in the matter though karellen was often asked to express his views on religion all that he would say was that a mans belieft were his own affair so long as they did not interfere with the liberty of others perhaps the old faiths would have lingered for generations yet had it not been for human curiosity it was known that the overlords had access to the past and more than once historians had appealed to karellen to settle some ancient contro versy it may have been that he had grown tired of such questions but it is more likely that he knew perfectly well what the outcome of his generosity would be the instrument he handed over on permanent loan to the world history foundation was nothing more than a television receiver with an elaborate set of controls for determining coordinates in time and space it must have been linked somehow to a far more complex machine operating on principles that noone could imagine aboard karellens ship one had merely to adjust the controls and a window into the past was opened up almost the whole of human history for the past five thousand years became accessible in an instant earlier than that the machine would not go and there were bafihing blanks all down the ages they might have had some natural cause or they might be due to deliberate censorship by the overlords though it had always been obvious to any rational mind that all the worlds religious writings could not be true the shock was nevertheless profound here was a revelation which noone could doubt or deny here seen by some unknown magic of overlord science were the true beginnings of all the worlds great faiths most of them were noble and inspiring but that was not enough within a few days all mankinds multitudinous messiahs had lost their divinity beneath the fierce and passionless light of truth faiths that had sustained millions for twice a thousand years vanished like morning dew all the good and all the evil they had wrought were swept suddenly into the past and could touch the minds of men no more humanity had lost its ancient gods now it was old enough to have no need for new ones though few realized it as yet the fall of religion bad been paralleled by a decline in science there were plenty of technologists but few original workers extending the frontiers of human knowledge curiosity remained and the leisure to mdulge in it but the heart had been taken out of fundamental scientific research it seemed futile to spend a lifetime searchtog fur secrets that the overlords had probably uncovered ages before this decline had been partly disguised by an enormous efflorescence of the descriptive sciences such as zoology botany and observational astronomy there had never been so many amateur scientists gathering facts for their own amusementbut there were few theoreticians correlating these facts the end of strife and conflicts of all kinds had also meant the virtual end of creative art there were myriads of performers amateur and professional yet there had been no really outstanding new works of literature music painting or sculpture for a generation the world was still living on the glories of a past that could never return noone worried except a few philosophers the race was too intent upon savouring its newfound freedom to look beyond the pleasures of the present utopia was here at last its novelty had not yet been assailed by the supreme enemy of all utopiasboredom perhaps the overlords had the answer to that as they had to all other problems noone knewany more than they knew a lifetime after their arrivalwhat their ultimate purpose might be mankind had grown to trust them and to accept without question the superhuman altruism that had kept karellen and his companions so long exiled from their homes if indeed it was altruism for there were still some who wondered if the policies of the overlords would always coincide with the true welfare of humanity when rupert boyce sent out the invitations for his party the total mileage involved was impressive to list only the first dozen guests there were the fosters from adelaide the shoenbergers from haiti the farrans from stalingrad the moravias from cincinnati the ivankos from paris and the sullivans from the general vicinity of easter island but approximately four kilometres down on the ocean bed it was a considerable compliment to rupert that although thirty guests had been invited over forty turned upwhich was about the percentage he had expected only the krauses let him down and that was simply because they forgot about the international date line and arrived twentyfour hours late by noon an imposing collection of flyers had accumulated in the park and the later arrivals would have quite a distance to walk once they had found somewhere to land at least it would seem quite a distance to them under this doudless sky and with the mercury at a hundred and ten the assembled vehicles ranged from oneman flitterbugs to family cadillacs which were more like airborne palaces than sensible flying machines in this age however nothing could be deduced concerning the social status of the guests from their modes of transport its a very zgy house said jean morrel as the meteor spiralled down it looks rather like a box that somebodys stepped on george greggson who had an oldfashioned dislike of automatic landings readjusted the rateofdescent control before answering its hardly fair to judge the place from this angle he replied sensibly enough from ground level it may look quite different oh dear whats the matter the fosters are here id recognize that colourscheme anywhere well theres no need to talk to them if you dont want to thats one advantage of ruperts partiesyou can always hide in the crowd george had selected a landing place and was now diving purposefully towards it they floated to rest between another meteor and something that neither of them could identify it looked very fast and jean thought very uncomfortable one of ruperts technical friends she decided had probably built it himself she had an idea that there was a law against that sort of thing the heat hit them like a blast from a blowtorch as they stepped out of the flyer it seemed to suck the moisture from their bodies and george almost imagined that he could feel his skin cracking it was partly their own fault of course they had left alaska three hours before and should have remembered to adjust the cabin temperature accordingly what a place to live gasped jean i thought this climate was supposed to be controlled so it is replied george this was all desert onceand look at it now come onitll be all right indoors ruperts voice slightly larger than life boomed cheerfully in their ears their host was standing beside the flyer a glass in each hand looking down at them with a roguish expression he looked down at them for the simple reason that he was about twelve feet tall he was also semitransparent one could see right through him without much difficulty this is a fine trick to play on your guests protcsted george he grabbed at the drinks which he could just reach his hand of course went right through them i hope youve got something more substantial for us when we reach the house dont worry laughed rupert just give your order now and itll be ready by the time you arrive two large beers cooled in liquid air said george promptly well be right there rupert nodded put down one of his glasses on an invisible table adjusted an equally invisible control and promptly vanished from sight well said jean thats the first time ive seen one of those gadgets in action how did rupert get hold of it i thought only the overlords had them have you ever known rupert not to get anything he wanted replied george thats just the toy for him he can sit comfortably in his studio and go wandering round half of africa no heat no bugs no exertionand the icebox always in reach i wonder what stanley and livingstone would have thought the sun put an end to further conversation until they had reached the house as they approached the front door it swung automatically open with a fanfare of trumpets jean guessed correctly that she would be heartily sick of that fanfare before the day was through the current mrs boyce greeted them in the delicious coolness of the hail she was if truth be known the main reason for the good turnout of guests perhaps half of them would have come in any case to see ruperts new house the waverers had been decided by the reports of ruperts new wife there was only one adjective that adequately described her she was distracting even in a world where beauty was almost commonplace men would turn their heads when she entered the room she was george guessed about one quarter negro her features were practically grecian and her hair was long and lustrous only the dark rich texture of her skinthe overworked word chocolate was the only one that described it revealed her mixed ancestry youre jean and george arent you she said holding out her hand im so pleased to meet you rupert is doing something complicated with the drinkscome along and meet everybody her voice was a rich contralto that sent little shivers running up and down georges back as if someone was playing on his spine like a flute he looked nervously at jean who had managed to force a somewhat artificial smile and finally recovered his voice itsits verynice to meet you he said lamely weve been looking forward to this party rupert always gives such nice parties put in jean by the way she accented the always one knew perfectly well she was thinking every time he gets married george flushed slightly and gave jean a glance of reproof but there was no sign that their hostess noticed the barb she was friendliness itself as she ushered them into the main lounge already half packed with a representative collection of ruperts numerous friends rupert himself was sitting at the console of what seemed to be a television engineers control unit it was george assumed the device that had projected his image out to meet them he was busily demonstrating it by surprising two more arrivals as they descended into the parking place but paused just long enough to greet jean and george and to apologize for having given their drinks to somebody else youll find plenty more over there he said waving one hand vaguely behind him while he adjusted controls with the other just make yourselves at home you know most of the people heremaia will introduce you to the rest good of you to come good of you to invite us said jean without much conviction george had already departed towards the bar and she made her way after him occasionally exchanging greetings with someone she recognized about threequarters of those present were perfect strangers which was the normal state of affairs at one of ruperts parties lets explore she said to george when they had refreshed themselves and waved to everyone they knew i want to look at the house george with a barely concealed backward look at maia boyce followed after her there was a faraway look in his eyes that jean didnt like in the least it was such a nuisance that men were fundamentally polygamous on the other hand if they werent yes perhaps it was better this way after george quickly came back to normal as they investigated the wonders of ruperts new abode the house seemed very large for two people but this was just as well in view of the frequent overloads it would have to handle there were two storeys the upper considerably larger so that it overhung and provided shade around the ground floor the degree of mechanization was considerable and the kitchen closely resembled the cockpit of an airliner poor ruby said jean she would have loved this place from what ive heard replied george who had no great sympathy for the last mrs boyce shes perfectly happy with her australian boyfriend this was such common knowledge that jean could hardly contradict it so she changed the subject shes awfully pretty isnt she george was sufficiently alert to avoid the trap oh i suppose so he replied indifferently that is of course if one likes brunettes which you dont i rake it said jean sweetly dont be jealous dear chuckled george stroking her platinum hair lets go and look at the library what floor do you think that will be on it must be up here theres no more room down below besides that fits in with the general design all the living eating sleeping and so ons relegated to the ground flopr this is the fun and games departmentthough i still think its a crazy idea having a swimmingpool upstairs i guess theres some reason for it said george opening a door experimentally rupert must have had skilled advice when he built this place im sure he couldnt have done it himself youre probably right if he had thered have been rooms without doors and stairways leading nowhere in fact id be afraid to step inside a house that rupert had designed all by himself here we are said george with the pride of a navigator l making landfall the fabulous boyce collection in its new home i wonder just how many of them rupert has really read the library ran the whole width of the house but was virtually divided into half a dozen small rooms by the great bookcases extending across it these held if george remembered correctly some fifteen thousand volumesalmost everything of importance that had ever been published on the nebulous subjects of magic psychic research divining telepathy and the whole range of elusive phenomena lumped in the category of paraphysics it was a very peculiar hobby for anyone to have in this age of reason presumably it was simply ruperts particular form of escapism george noticed the smell the moment he entered the room it was faint but penetrating not so much unpleasant as puzzling jean had observed it too her forehead was wrinkled in the effort of identification acetic acid thought george thats the nearest thing to it but its got something else as well the library terminated in a small open space just large enough for a table two chairs and some cushions this presumably was where rupert did most of his reading someone was reading there now in an unnaturally dim light jean gave a little gasp and clutched at georges hand her reaction was perhaps excusable it was one thing to watch a television picture quite another to meet the reality george who was seldom surprised by anything rose to the occasion at once i hope we havent disturbed you sir he said politely wed no idea that there was anyone here rupert never told us the overlord put down the book looked at them closely then commenced reading again there was nothing impolite about the action coming as it did from a being who could read talk and probably do several other things at the same time nevertheless to human observers the spectacle was disturbingly schizophrenic my name is rashaverak said the overlord amiably im afraid im not being very sociable but ruperts library is a difficult place from which to escape jean managed to suppress a nervous giggle their unexpected fellow guest was she noticed reading at the rate of a page every two seconds she did not doubt that he was assimilating every word and she wondered if he could manage to read a book with each eye and then of course she thought to herself he could go on to learn braille so he could use his fingers the resulting mental picture was too comic to be comfortable so she tried to suppress it by entering into the conversation after all it was not every day that one had a chance of talking to one of the masters of earth george let her chatter on after he had made the introductions hoping that she wouldnt say anything tactless like jean he bad never seen an overlord in the flesh though they mixed socially with government officials scientists and others who dealt with them in the course of business he had never heard of one being present at an ordinary private party one inference was that this party was not as private as it seemed ruperts possession of a piece of overlord equipment also hinted at this and george began to wonder in capital letters just what was going on he would have to tackle rupert about this when he could get him into a corner since the chairs were too small for him rashaverak was sitting on the floor apparently quite at ease since he had ignored the cushions only a metre away as a result his head was a mere two metres from the ground and george had a unique chance of studying extraterrestrial biology unfortunately as he knew little about terrestrial biology he was not able to learn much that he did not already know only the peculiar and by no means unpleasant acid odour was new to him he wondered how humans smelt to the overlords and hoped for the best there was nothing anthropomorphic about rashaverak george could understand the way in which if seen from a distance by ignorant terrified savages the overlords could be mistaken for winged men and so could have given rise to the conventional portrait of the devil from as close as this however some of the illusion vanished the little horns were as per specification but the body was neither like that of a man nor of any animal earth had ever known coming from a totally alien evolutionary tree the overlords were neither mmmnis insects nor reptiles it was not even certain that they were vertebrates their hard external armour might well be their only supporting framework rashaveraks wings were folded so that george could not see them dearly but his tail looking like a piece of armoured hosepipe lay neatly curled under him the famous barb was not so much an arrowhead as a large flat diamond its purpose it was now generally accepted was to give stability in flight like the tailfeathers of a bird from scanty facts and suppositions such as these scientists had concluded that the overlords came from a world of low gravity and very dense atmosphere ruperts voice suddenly bellowed from a concealed speaker jean george where the hell are you hiding come down and join the party people are beginning to talk perhaps id better go too said rashaverak putting his book back on the shelf he did that quite easily without moving from the floor and george noticed for the first time that he had two opposed thumbs with five fingers between them id hate to do arithmetic george thought to himself in a system based on fourteen rashaverak getting to his feet was an impressive sight and as the overlord bent to avoid the ceiling it became obvious that even if they were anxious to mix with human beings the practical difficulties would be considerable several more cargoes of guests had arrived in the last half hour and the room was now quite crowded rashaveraks arrival made matters a good deal worse because everyone in the adjacent rooms came running in to see him rupert was obviously very pleased with the sensation jean and george were much less gratified as noone took any notice of them indeed few people could see them because they were standing behind the overlord come over here rashy and meet some of the folks shouted rupert sit on the divanthen you can stop scraping the ceiling rashaverak his tail draped over his shoulder moved across the room like an icebreaker worrying its way through a pack as he sat down beside rupert the room seemed to become much larger again and george let out a sigh of relief it gave me claustrophobia when he was standing i wonder how rupert got hold of himthis looks like being an interesting party fancy rupert addressing him like that in public too but he didnt seem to mind its all very peculiar i bet you he did mind the trouble with rupert is that he likes to show oft and hes got no tact and that reminds me some of those questions you asked such as wellhow long have you been here how do you get on with supervisor karellen do you like it on earth really darling you just dont talk to overlords that way i dont see why not it is about time someone did before the discussion could get acrimonious they were accosted by the shoenbergers and fission rapidly occurred the girls went off in one direction to discuss mrs boyce the men went in another and did exactly the same thing though from a different viewpoint benny shoenberger who was one of georges oldest friends had a good deal of information on the subject for heavens sake dont tell anyone he said ruth doesnt know this but i introduced her to rupert i think george remarked enviously that shes much too good for rupert however it cant possibly last shell soon get fed up with him this thought seemed to cheer him considerably dont you believe it besides being a beauty shes a really nice person its high time someone took charge of rupert and shes just the girl to do it both rupert and maia were now sitting beside rashaverak receiving their guests in state ruperf s parties seldom had any focal point but usually consisted of half a dozen independent groups intent on their own affairs this time however the whole gathering was polarized towards a centre of attraction george felt rather sorry for maia this should have been her day but rashaverak had partially eclipsed her look said george nibbling at a sandwich how the devil has rupert got hold of an overlord ive never heard of such a thingbut he seems to take it for granted he never even mentioned it when he invited us benny thudded just another of his little surprises youd better ask him about it but this isnt the first time its happened after all karellens been to parties at the white house and buckingham palace and heck thats different ruperts a perfectly ordinary citizen i and maybe rashaveraks a very minor overlord but youd better ask them i will said george just as soon as i can get rupert by himself then youll have to wait a long time benny was right but as the party was now warming up it was easy to be patient the slight paralysis which the appearance of rashaverak had cast over the assembly had now vanished there was still a small group around the overlord but elsewhere the usual fragmentation had taken place and everyone was behaving quite naturally sullivan for example was describing his latest submarine research to an interested audience were not sure yet he said just how big they grow theres a canyon not far from our base where a real giant lives ive caught a glimpse of it once and id say that its tentaclespread is the best part of thirty metres im going in after it next week anyone like something really novel in the way of pets there was a squeal of horror from one of the women ugh it gives me the creeps just to think about it you must be terribly brave sullivan looked quite surprised id never thought about that he said of course i take suitable precautions but ive never been in any real danger the squids know that they cant eat me and as long as i dont go too close they never take the slightest notice most seacreatures leave you alone unless you interfere with them but surely someone asked sooner or later youre bound to run up against one that thinks youre edible oh replied sullivan airily that happens now and then i try not to hurt them because after all im anxious to make friends so i just turn the jets full on and it usually takes onl a minute or two to pull free if im too busy to stop and play may tidde them up with a couple of hundred volts that settles the matter and they never bother me again you certainly met some interesting people at ruperts parties thought george as he moved on to the next group ruperts literary tastes might be specialized but his friendships were wideranging without bothering to turn his head george could see a famous film producer a minor poet a mathematician two actors an atomic power engineer a game warden the editor of a weekly news magazine a statistician from the world bank a violin virtuoso a professor of arthology and an astrophysicist there were no other representatives of georges own profession television studio designwhich was a good thing as he wanted to get away from shop he loved his work indeed in this age for the first time in human history noone worked at tasks they did not like but george was content to mentally lock the studio doors behind him at the end of the day he finally trapped rupert in the kitchen experimenting wlthdrinks it seemed apitytobringhim backto earth when he had such a faraway look in his eye but george could be ruthless when necessary look here rupert he began perching himself on the nearest table i thipk you owe us all some explanation um said rupert thoughtfully rolling his tongue round his mouth just a teeny bit too much gin im afraid dont hedge and dont pretend youre not still sober because i know perfectly well you are where does your overlord friend come from and whats he doing here didnt i tell you said rupert i thought id explained it to everybody you couldnt have been aroundof course you were hiding up in the library he thudded in a manner which george found offensive its the library you know that brought rashy here how extraordinary why george paused realizing that this would require tact rupert was very proud of his peculiar collection erwell when you consider what the overlords know about science i should hardly think theyd be interested in psychic phenomena and all that sort of nonsense nonsense or not replied rupert theyre interested in human psychology and ive got some books that can teach them a lot just before i moved here some deputy underoverlord or overunderlord got in touch with me and asked if they could borrow about fifty of my rarest volumes one of the keepers of the british museum library had put him on to me it seemed of course you can guess what i said i cant imagine well i replied very politely that it had taken metwenty years to get my library together they were welcome to study my books but theyd darn well have to read them here so rasby came along and has been absorbing about twenty volumes a day id love to know what he makes of them george thought this over then shrugged his shoulders in disgust frankly he said my opinion of the overlords goes down i thought they had better things to do with their time youre an incorrigible materialist arent you i dont think jean will agree at all but even from your ohsopractical viewpoint itstill makes sense surely youd study the superstitions of any primitive race you were having dealings with i suppose so said george not quite convinced the tabletop was feeling hard so he rose to his feet rupert had now mixed the drinks to his satisfaction and was heading back to his guests querulous voices could already be heard demanding his presence hey protested george just before you disappear theres one other question how did you get hold of that twoway television gadget you tried to frighten us with just a bit of bargaining i pointed out how valuable it would be for a joblike mine and rashy passed the suggestion on to the right quarters forgive me for being so obtuse but what is your new job i suppose of course its something to do with animals thats right im a supervet my practice covers about ten thousand square kilometres of jungle and as my patients wont come to inc ive got to look for them rather a fulltime job oh of course it isnt practical to bother about the small fry just lions elephants rhinos and so on every morning i set the controls for a height of a hundred metres sit down in front of the screen and go cruising over the countryside when i find anyone in trouble i climb into my flyer and hope my bedside manner will work sometimes its a bit tricky lions and suchlike are easybut trying to puncture a rhino from the air with an ansthetic dart is the devil of a job rupert yelled someone from the next room now look what youve done youve made me forget my guests thereyou take that tray those are the ones with vermouthi dont want to get them mixed up it was just before sunset that george found his way up to the roof for a number of excellent reasons he had a slight headache and ftlt like escaping front the noise and confusion downstairs jean who was a much better dancer than he was still seemed to be enjoying herself hugely and refused to leave this annoyed george who was beginning to feel alcoholically amorous and he decided to have a quiet sulk beneath the stars one reached the roof by taking the escalator to the first floor and then climbing the spiral stairway round the intake of the airconditioning plant this led through a hatchway out on to the wide flat roof ruperts flyer was parked at one end the centre area was a gardenalready showing signs of running wildand the rest was simply an observation platform with a few deckchairs placed on it george flopped into one of these and regarded his surroundings with an imperial eye he felt very much monarch of all he surveyed it was to put it mildly quite a view ruperts house had been built on the edge of a great basin which sloped downwards towards the east into swamplands and lakes five kilometres away westwards the land was flat and the jungle came almost to ruperts backdoor but beyond the jungle at a distance that must have been at least fifty kilometres a line of mountains ran like a great wall out of sight to north and south their summits were streaked with snow and the clouds above them were turning to fire as the sun descended on the last few minutes of its daily journey as he looked at those remote ramparts george felt awed into a sudden sobriety the stars that sprang out in such indecent haste the moment the sun had set were completely strange to him he looked for the southern cross but without success though he knew very little of astronomy and could recognize only a few constellations the absence of familiar friends was disturbing so were the noises drifting in from the jungle uncomfortably close at band enough of this fresh air thought george ill go back to the party before a vampire bat or something equally pleasant comes flying up to investigate he was just starting to walk back when another guest emerged from the hatchway it was now so dark that george could not see who it was so he called out hello there have you had enough of it too his invisible companion laughed ruperts starting to show some of his movies ive seen them all before have a cigarette said george fhanks by the flame of the lightergeorge was fond of such antiqueshe could now recognize his fellowguest a strikingly handsome young negro whose name george had been told but had immediately forgotten like those of the twenty other complete strangers at the party however there seemed something familiar about him and suddenly george guessed the truth i dont think weve really met he said but arent you ruperts new brotherinlaw thats right im jan rodricks everyone says that mala and i look rather alike george wondered whether to commiserate with jan for his newly acquired relative he decided to let the poor fellow find out for himself after all it was just possible that rupert would settle down this time im george greggson this is the first time youve been to one of ruperts famous parties yes you certainly meet a lot of new people this way and not only humans added george this is the first chance ive had of meeting an overlord socially the other hesitated for a moment before replying and george wondered what sensitive spot he had struck but the answer revealed nothing ive never seen one before eitherexcept of course on tv there the conversation languished and after a moment george realized that jan wanted to be alone it was getting cold anyway so he took his leave and rejoined the party the jungle was quiet now as jan leaned against the curving wall of the air intake the only sound he could hear was the faint murmur of the house as it breathed through its mcdianical lungs he felt very much alone which was the way he wanted to be he also felt highly frustratedand that was something he had no desire to be at all no utopia can ever give satisfaction to everyone all the time as their material conditions improve men raise their sights and become discontented with powers and possessions that once would have seemed beyond their wildest dreams and even when the external world has granted all it can there still remain the searchings of the mind and the longings of the heart jan rodricks though he seldom appreciated his luck would have been even more discontented in an earlier age a century before his colour would have been a tremendous perhaps an overwhelming handicap today it meant nothing the inevitable reaction that had given early twentyfirstcentury negroes a slight sense of superiority had already passed away the convenient word nigger was no longer tabu in polite society but was used without embarrassment by everyone it had no more emotional content than such labels as republican or methodist conservative or liberal jans father had been a charming but somewhat feckless scot who had made a considerable name for himself as a professional magician his death at the early age of fortyfive had been aggravated by the excessive consumption of his countrys most famous product though jan had never seen his father drunk he was not sure that he had ever seen him sober mrs rodricks still very mtзh alive lectured in advanced probability theory at edinburgh university it was typical of the extreme mobility of twentyfirstcentury man that mrs rodricks who was coal black had been born in scotland whereas her expatriate and blond husband had spent almost all his life in haiti maia and jan had never had a single home but had oscillated between their parents families like two small shuttlecocks the treatment had been good fun but had not helped to correct the instability they had both inherited from their father at twentyseven jan still had several years of college life ahead of him before he needed to think seriously about his career he had taken his bachelors degrees without any difilculty following a syllabus that would have seemed very strange a century before ilis main subjects bad been mathematics and physics but as subsidiaries he had taken philosophy and musical appreciation even by the high standards of the time he was a firstrate amateur pianist in three years he would take his doctorate in engineering physics with astronomy as a second subject this would involve fairly hard work but jan rather welcomed that he was studying at what was perhaps the most beautifully situated place of higher education in the worldthe university of cape town nestling at the foot of table mountain he had no material worries yet he was discontented and saw no cure for his condition to make matters worse maias own happinessthotigh he did not grudge it in the leasthad underlined the chief cause of his own trouble for jan was still suffering from the romantic illusionthe cause of so much misery and so much poetrythat every man has only one real love in his life at an unusually late age be had lost his heart for the first time to a lady more renowned for beauty than constancy rosita tsien claimed with perfect truth to have the blood of manchu emperors flowing in her veins she still possessed many subjects including most of the faculty of science at cape jan had been taken prisoner by her delicate flowerlike beauty and the affair had proceeded far enough to make its termination all the more galling he could not imagine what had gone wrong he would get over it of course other men had survived similar catastrophes without irreparable damage had even reached the stage when they could say im sure i could never have been really serious about a woman like that but such detachment still lay far in the future and at the moment jan was very much at odds with life his other grievance was less easily remedied for it concerned the impact of the overlords upon his own ambitions jan was a romantic not only in heart but in mind like so many other young men since the conquest of the air had been assured he had let his dreams and his imagination roam the unexplored seas of space a century before man had set foot upon the ladder that could lead him to the stars at that very momentcould it have been coincidencethe door to the planets had been slammed in his face the overlords had imposed few positive bans on any form of human activity but research into space flight had virtually ceased the challenge presented by the science of the overlords was too great for the moment at least man had lost heart and had turned to other fields of activity there was no point in developing rockets when the overlords had infinitely superior means of propulsion based on principles of which they had never given any hint a few hundred men had visited the moon for the purpose of establishing a lunar observatory they had travelled as passengers in a small vessel loaned by the overlordsand driven by rockets it was obvious that little could be learned from a study of this primitive vehicle even if its owners handed it over without reservation to inquisitive terrestrial scientists man was therefore still a prisoner on his wn planet it was a much fairer but a much smaller planet than it had been a century before when the overlords had abolished war and hunger and disease they had also abolished adventure the rising moon was beginning to paint the eastern sky with a pale milky glow up there jan knew was the main base of the overlords lying within the ramparts of pluto though the supply ships must have been coming and going for more than seventy years it was only in jans lifetime that all concealment had been dropped and they had made their departure in clear sight of earth in the twohundredinch telescope the shadows of the great ships could be dearly seen when the morning or evening sun cast them for miles across the lunar plains since everything that the overlords did was of immense interest to mankind a careful watch was kept of their comings and goings and the pattern of their behaviour was beginning to emerge one of those great shadows had vanished a few hours ago that meant jan knew that somewhere off the moon an overlord ship was lying in space carrying out whatever routine was necessary before it began its journey to its distant unknown home he had never seen one of those returning ships launch itself towards the stars if conditions were good the sight was visible over half the world but jan had always been unlucky one could never tell exactly when the takeoff would beand the overlords did not advertise the fact he decided he would wait another ten minutes then rejoin the party what was that only a meteor sliding down through eridanus jan relaxed discovered his cigarette had gone out and lit another he was halfway through it when half a million kilometres away the stardrive went on up from the heart of the spreading moonglow a tiny spark began to climb towards the zenith at first its movement was so slow that it could hardly be perceived but second by second it was gaining speed as it climbed it increased in brilliance then suddenly faded from sight a moment later it had reappeared gaining speed and brightness waxing and waning with a peculiar rhythm it ascended ever more swiftly into the sky drawing a fluctuating line of light across the stars even if one did not know its real distance the impression of speed was breathtaking when one knew that the departing ship was somewhere beyond the moon the mind reeled at the speeds and energies involved it was an unimportant byproduct of those energies jan knew that he was seeing now the ship itself was invisible already far ahead of that ascending light as a highflying jet may leave a vapour trail behind it so the outwardbound vessel of the overlords left its own peculiar wake the generally accepted theoryand there seemed little doubt of its truth was that the immense accelerations of the stardrive caused a local distortion of space what jan was seeing he knew was nothing less than the light of distant stars collected and focused into his eye wherever conditions were favourable along the track of the ship it was a visible proof of relativitythe bending of light in the presence of a colossal gravitational field now the end of that vast pencilshaped lens seemed to be moving more slowly but that was only due to perspective in reality the ship was still gaining speed its path was merely being foreshortened as it hurled itself outwards to the stars there would be many telescopes following it jan knew as earths scientists tried to uncover the secrets of the drive dozens of papers had already been published on the subject no doubt the overlords had read them with the greatest interest the phantom light was beginning to wane now it was a fading streak pointing to the heart of the constellation carina as jan had known that it would the home of the overlords was somewhere out there but it might circle any one of a thousand stars in that sector of space there was no way of telling its distance from the solar system it was all over though the ship had scarcely begun its journey there was nothing more that human eyes could see but in jans mind the memory of that shining path still burned a beacon that would never fade as long as he possessed anibition and desire the parry was over almost all the guests had climbed back into the sky and were now scattering to the four corners of the globe there were however a few exceptions one was norman dodsworth the poet who had got unpleasantly drunk but had been sensible enough to pass out befbre any violent action proved necessary he had been deposited not very gently on the lawn where it was hoped that a hyena would give him a rude awakening for all practical purposes he could therefore be regarded as absent the other remaining guests were george and jean this was not georges idea at all he wanted to go home he disapproved of the friendship between rupert and jean though not for the usual reason george prided himself on being a practical levelheaded character and regarded the interest which drew jean and rupert together as being not only childish in this age of science but more than a little unhealthy that anyone should still place the slightest credence in the supernormal seemed extraordinary to him and finding rashaverak here had shaken his faith in the overlords it was now obvious that rupert had been plotting some surprise probably with jeans connivance george resigned himself gloomily to whatever nonsense was coming i tried all sorts of things before i settled on this said rupert proudly the big problem is to reduce friction so that you get complete freedom of movement the oldfashioned polished table and tumbler setup isnt bad but fts been used for centuries now and i was sure that modern science could do better and heres the result draw up your chairs are you quite sure you dont want to join rashy the overlord seemed to hesitate for a fraction of a second then he shook his head no thank you he replied i would prefer to observe some other time perhaps very welltheres plenty of time to change your mind later oh is there thought george looking gloomily at his watch rupert had shepherded his friends round a small but massive table perfectly circular in shape it had a flat plastic top which he lifted off to reveal a glittering sea of closely packed ballbearings they were prevented from escaping by the tables slightly raised rim and george found it quite impossible to imagine their purpose the hundreds of reflected points of light formed a fascinating and hypnotic pattern and he felt himself becoming slightly dizzy as they drew up their chairs rupert reached under the table and brought forth a disc some ten centimetres in diameter which he placed on the surface of the ballbearings there you are he said you put your fingers on this and it moves around with no resistance at all george eyed the device with profound distrust he noted that the letters of the alphabet were placed at regular intervals though in no particular orderround the circumference of the table in addition there were the numbers one to nine scattered at random among the letters and two cards bearing the words s and no these were on opposite sides of the table it looks like a lot of mumbojumbo to me he muttered im surprised that anyone takes it seriously in this age he felt a little better after delivering this mild protest which was aimed at jean quite as much as rupert rupert didnt pretend to have more than a detached scientific interest in these phenomena he was openminded but not credulous jean on the other handwell george was sometimes a little worried about her she really seemed to think that there was something in this business of telepathy and secondsight not until he had made his remark did george realize that it also implied a criticism of rashaverak he glanced nervously round but the overlord showed no reaction which of course proved absolutely nothing at all everyone had now taken up their positions going in a clockwise direction round the table were rupert maia jan jean george and benny shoenberger ruth shoenberger was sitting outside the cirde with a notebook she apparently had some objection to taking part in the proceedings which had caused benny to snake obscurely sarcastic remarks about people who still took the talmud seriously however she seemed perfectly willing to act as a recorder now listen began rupert for the benefit of sceptics like george lets get this straight whether or not theres anything supernormal about this it works personally i think theres a purely mechanical explanation when we put our hands on the disc even though we may try to avoid influencing its movements our subconscious starts playing tricks ive analysed lots of these seances and ive never got answers that someone in the group mightnt have known or guessed though sometimes they werent aware of the fact however id like to carry out the experiment in these ratherah peculiar circumstances the peculiar circumstance sat watching them silently but doubtless not with indifference george wondered just what rashaverak thought of these antics were his reactions those of an anthropologist watching some primitive religious rite the whole setup was really quite fantastic and george felt as big a fool as he had ever done in his life if the others felt equally foolish they concealed their emotions only jean looked flushed and excited though that night have been the drinks all set asked rupert very well he paused impressively then addressing noone in particular he called ut is there anybody there george could feel the plate beneath his fingers tremble lightly that was not surprising considering the pressure teing exerted upon it by the six people in the circle it ilithered around in a small figureeight then came to rest back at the centre is there anybody there repeated rupert in a more conversational tone of voice he added its often ten or fifteen minutes before we get started but sometimes hush breathed jean the plate was moving it began to swing in a wide arc between the cards labelled yes and no with some difficulty george suppressed a giggle just what would it prove he wondered if the answer was no he remembered the old joke theres nobody here but us chickens massa but the answer was yes the plate came swiftly back to the centre of the table somehow it now seemed alive waiting fir the next question despite himself george began to be impressed who are you asked rupert there was no hesitation now as the letters were spelled out the plate darted across the table like a sentient thing moving so swiftly that george sometimes found it hard to keep his fingers in contact he could swear that he was not contributing to its motion glancing quickly round the table he could see nothing suspicious in the faces of his friends they seemed as intent and as expectant as he himself iamall spelled the plate and returned to its point of equilibrium i am all repeated rupert thats a typical reply evasive yet stimulating it probably means that theres nothing here except our combined minds he paused for a moment obviously deciding upon his next question then he addressed the air once more have you a message for anyone here no replied the plate promptly rupert looked around the table its up to us sometimes it volunteers information but this time well have to ask definite questions anyone like to start will it rain tomorrow said george jestingly at once the plate began to swing back and forth in the yes no line thats a silly question reproved rupert its bound to be rining somewhere and to be dry somewhere else dont ask questions that have ambiguous answers george felt appropriately squashed he decided to let someone else have the next turn what is my favourite colour asked maia blue came the prompt reply thats quite correct but it doesnt prove anything at least three people here knew that george pointed out whats ruths favourite colour asked benny red is that right ruth the recorder looked up from her notebook yes it is but benny knows that and hes in the circle i didnt know retorted benny you darn well ought toive told you enough times subconscious memory murmured rupert that often happens but can we have some more intelligent questions please now that this has started so well i dont want it to peter out curiously enough the very triviality of the phenomenon was beginning to impress george he was sure that there was no supernormal explanation as rupert had said the plate was simply responding to their unconscious muscular movements but this fact in itself was surprising and impressive he would never have believed that such precise swift replies could have been obtained once he tried to see if he could influence the board by making it spell out his own name he got the g but that was all the rest was nonsense it was virtually unpossible he decided for one person to take control without the remainder of the circle knowing it after half an hour ruth had taken down more than a dozen messages some of them quite long ones there were occasional spelling mistakes and curiosities of grammar but they were few whatever the explanation george was now convinced that he was not contributing consciously to the results several times as a word was being spelt out he had anticipated the next letter and hence the meaning of the message and on each occasion the plate had gone in a quite unexpected direction and spelt something totally different sometimes indeed since there was no pause to indicate the end of one word and the beginning of the nextthe entire message was meaningless until it was complete and ruth had read it back the whole experience gave george an uncanny impression of being in contact with some purposeful independent mind and yet there was no conclusive proof one way or the other the replies were so trivial so ambiguous what for example could one make of believeinmannaturriswithyou yet sometimes there were suggestions of profound even disturbing truths rimembermanisnotalonenearmaniscountryofothers but of course everyone knew thatthough could one be sure that the message merely referred to the overlords george was growing very sleepy it was high time he thought drowsily that they headed for home this was all very intriguing but it wasnt getting them anywhere and you could have too much of a good thing he glanced around the table benny looked as if he might be feeling the same way maia and rupert both appeared slightly glazed and jeanwell she had been taking it too seriously all along her expression worried george it was almost as if she were afraid to stopyet afraid to go on that left only jan george wondered what he thought of his brotherinlaws eccentricities the young engineer had asked no questions shown no surprise at any of the answers he seemed to be studying the movement of the plate as if it was just another scientific phenomenon rupert roused himself from the lethargy into which he appeared to have fallen lets have one more question he said then well call it a day what about you jan youve not asked anything surprisingly jan never hesitated it was as if he had made his choice a long time ago and had been waiting for the opportunity he glanced once at the impassive bulk of rashaverak then called out in a clear steady voice which star is the overlords sun rupert checked a whistle of surprise maia and benny showed no reaction at all jean had closed her eyes and seemed to be asleep rashaverak had leaned forward so that he could look down into the circle over ruperts shoulder and the plate began to move when it came to rest again there was a brief pause then ruth asked in a puzzled voice what does ngs mean she got no reply for at the same moment george called out anxiously give me a hand with jean im afraid shes fainted this man boyce said karellen tell me all about him the supervisor did not use those actual words of course and the thoughts he really expressed were far more subtle a human listener would have heard a short burst of rapidly modulated sound not unlike a highspeed morse sender in action though many samples of overlord language had been recorded they all defied analysis because of their extreme coinplexity the speed of transmission made it certain that no interpreter even if he had mastered the elements of the language could ever keep up with the overlords in their normal conversation the supervisor for earth stood with his back to rashaverak staring out across the multicoloured gulf of the grand canyon ten kilometres away yet scarcely veiled by distance the terraced walls were catching the full force of the sun hundreds of metres down the shadowed slope at whose brim karellen stood a muletrain was slowly winding its way into the valleys depths it was strange karellen thought that so many human beings still seized every opportunity for primitive behaviour they could reach the bottom of the canyon in fraction of the time and in far greater comfort if they chose yet they preferred to be jolted along tracks which were probably as unsafe as they looked karellen made an imperceptible gesture with his hand the great panorama faded from view leaving only a shadowy blankness of indeterminable depth the realities of his office and of his position crowded in upon the supervisor once more rupert boyce is a somewhat curious character rashaverak answered professionally hes in charge of animal welfare over an important section of the main african reservalion hes quite efficient and interested in his work because he has to keep watch over several thousand square kilometres he has one of the fifteen panoramic viewers weve so far issued cm loanwith the usual safeguards of course it is incidentilly the only one with full projection facilities he was able to make a good case for these so we let him have them what was his argument he wanted to appear to various wild animals so that they could get used to seeing him and so wouldnt attack when he was physically present the theory has worked out quite well with nirnas that rely on sight rather than smellthough hell probably get killed eventually and of course there was anther reason why we let him have the apparatus it made him more cooperative precisely i originally contacted him because he has one rf the worlds finest libraries of books on parapsychology and illied subjects he politely but firmly refused to lend any of them so there was nothing to do but toit him ive now read ibout half his library it has been a considerable ordeal that i can well believe said kardllen dryly have you fiscovered anything among all the rubbish yeseleven dear cases of partial breakthrough and twentyseven probables the material is so selective however that one cannot use it for sampling purposes and the evidence is hopelessly confused with mysticismperhaps the prime aberration of the human mind and what is boyces attitude to all this he pretends to be openminded and sceptical but its clear that he would never have spent so much time and effort in this field unless he had some subconscious faith i challenged him on this and he admitted that i was probably right he would like to find some convincing proof that is why he is always carrying out these experiments even though he pretends that they are only gaines you are sure he doesnt suspect that your interest is more than academic quite sure in many ways boyce is remarkably obtuse and simpleminded that makes his attempts to do research in this of all fields rather pathetic there is no need to take any special acon regarding him i see and what about the girl who fainted this is the most exciting feature of the entire affair jean morrel was almost certainly the channel through which the information came but she is twentysixfar too old to be a prime contact herself judging by all our previous experience it must therefore be someone closely linked to her the conclusion is obvious we cannot have many more years to wait we must transfer her to category purple she may be the most important human being alive i will do that and what of the young man who asked the question was it random curiosity or did he have some other motive it was chance that brought him therehis sister has just married rupert boyce he had never met any of the other guests before i am sure the question was unpremeditated being inspired by the unusual conditionsand probably by my presence given these factors it is hardly surprising that he acted in the way he did his great interest is astronautics he is secretary of the spacetravel group at cape town university and obviously intends to make this field his life study flis career should be interesting meanwhile what action do you think he will take and what shall we do about him lie will undoubtedly make some checks as soon as he can but there is no way in which he can prove the accuracy of his information and because of its peculiar origin he is hardly likely to publish it even if he does will it affect matters in the slightest i will have both situations evaluated karellen replied though it is part of our directive not to reveal our base there is no way in which the information could be used against us i agree rodricks will have some information which is of doubtful truth and of no practical value so it would seem said karellen but let us not be too certain human beings are remarkably ingenious and often very persistent it is never safe to underrate them and it will be interesting to follow mr rodricks career i must think about this further rupert boyce never really got to the bottom of it when his guests had departed rather less boisterously than usual he bad thoughtfully rolled the table back into its corner the mild alcoholic fog prevented any profound analysis of what had happened and even the actual facts were already slightly blurred he had a vague idea that something of great but elusive importance had happened and wondered if he should iscuss it with rashaverak on second thought he decided it aught be tactless after all his brotherinlaw had caused the trouble and rupert felt vaguely annoyed with young jan but was it jans fault was it anybodys fault rather guiltily rupert remembered that it had been his experiment he lecided fairly successfully to forget the whole business perhaps he might have done something if the last page of ruths notebook could have been found but it had vanished in the confusion jan always feigned innocenceand well one ould hardly accuse rashaverak and noone could ever emember exactly what had been spelled out except that it lidnt seem to make any sense the person most immediately affected had been george creggson he could never forget his feeling of terror as jean iitched into his arms her sudden helplessness transformed icr in that moment from an amusing companion to an object of tenderness and affection women had faintednot always without forethoughtsince time immemorial and men had invariably responded in the desired way jeans collapse was completely spontaneous but it could not have been better planned in that instant as he realized later george came to one of the most important decisions of his life jean was definitely the girl who mattered despite berqueer ideas and queerer friends he had no intention of totally abandoning naomi or joy or elsa orwhat was her namedenise but the tune bad come for something more permanent he had no doubt that jean would agree with him for her feelings had been quite obvious from the start behind his decision there was another factor of which he was unaware tonights experience had weakened his contempt and scepticism for jeans peculiar interests he would never recognize the fact but it was soand it had removed the last barrier between them he looked at jean as she lay pale but composed in the reclining chair of the flyer there was darkness below stars above george had no idea to within a thousand kilometres where they might benor did he care that was the business of the robot that was guiding them homewards and would land them in so the control board announced fiftyseven minutes from now jean smiled back at him and gently dislodged her hand from his just let me restore the circulation she pleaded rubbing her fingers i wish youd believe me when i tell you im perfectly all right now then what do you think happened surely you remember sometfthg noits just a complete blank i heard jan ask his quesdonand then you were all making a fuss over me im sure it was some kind of trance after all she paused then decided not to tell george that this sort of thing had happened before she knew how he felt about these matters and had no desire to upset him furtherand perhaps scare him away completely after allwhat asked george oh nothing i wonder what that overlord thought about the whole business we probably gave him more material than he bargained for jean shivered slightly and her eyes clouded im afraid of the overlords george oh i dont xne theyre evil or anything foolish like that im sure they mean well and are doing what they think is best for us i wonder just what their plans really are george shifted uncomfortably men have been wondering that ever since they came to earth he said theyll tell us when were ready for itand frankly im not inquisitive besides ive got more importt things to bother about he turned towards jean and grasped her hands what about going to archives tomorrow and signing a contract forlets sayfive years jean looked at him steadfastly and decided that the whole she liked what she saw make it ten she said jan bided his time there was no hurry and he wanterj to think it was almost as if he feared to make any checks lest the fantastic hope that had come into his mind be too swiftly destroyed while he was still uncertain he could at least dream moreover to take any further action he would have to see the observatory librarian she knew hint and his interests too well and would certainly be intrigued by his request probably it would make no difference but jan was determined to leave nothing to chance there would be a better opportujty in a week he was being supercautious he knew but that added a schoolboy zest to the enterprise jan also feared ridicule quite as much as anything that the overlords might conceivably do to thwart him if he was embarking on a wildgoose chase noone else would ever know he had a perfectly good reason for going to london the arrangements had been made weeks ago though he wa too young and too unqualified to be a delegate he was one of the three students who had nlnllged to attach themselves to the official party going to the meeting of the international astr nomical union the vacancies had been there and it scened a pity to waste the opportunity as he had not visited london since his childhood he knew that very few of the dozens of papers to be delivered to the iau would be of the iigt interest to turn even if he could understand them like a delegate to any scientific congress he would attend the lectures that looked promising and spend the rest of the time talking with fellow enthusiasts or simply sightseeing london had changed enormously in the last fifty years it now contained scarcely two million people and a hundred times as many machines it was no longer a great port for with every country producing almost all its needs the entire pattern of world trade had been altered there were some goods that certain countries still made best but they went directly by air to their destinations the trade routes that had once converged on the great harbours and later on the great airports had finally dispersed into an intricate webwork covering the whole world with no major nodal points yet some things had not altered the city was still a centre of administration of art of learning in these matters none of the continental capitals could rival itnot even paris despite many claims to the contrary a londoner from a century before could still have found his way around at least at the citys centre with no difficulty there were new bridges over the thames but in the old places the great grimy railway stations had gonebanished to the suburbs but the houses of parliament were unchanged nelsons solitary eye still stared down whitehall the dome of st pauls still stood above ludgate hill though now there were taller buildings to challenge its preeminence and the guard still marched in front of buckingham palace all these things thought jan could wait it was vacation time and he was lodged with his two fellow students in one of the university hostels blooinsbury also had not changed its character in the last century it was still an island of hotels and boardinghouses though they no longer jostled each other so closely or formed such endless identical rows of sootcoated brick it was not until the second day of the congress that jan got his opportunity the main papers were being read in the great assembly chamber of the science centre not far from the concert hall that had done so much to make london the musical metropolis of the world jan wanted to hear the first of the days lectures which it was rumoured would completely demolish the current theory of the formation of the planets perhaps it did but jan was little the wiser when he left after the interval he hurried down to the directory and looked up the rooms he wanted some humorous civil servant had put the royal astrociomical society on the top floor of the great building a gesture which the council members fully appreciated as it gave them a magnificent view across the lhames and over the entire northrn part of the city there seemed to be nobody around but anduching his membership card like a passport in case he was challengedhad no difficulty in locating the library it took him almost an hour to find what he wanted and to learn how to handle the great star catalogues with their millions of entries he was trembling slightly as he neared the end of his quest and felt glad that there was noone around to see his nervousness he put the catalogue back among its fellows and for a long time sat quite still staring sightlessly at the wall of volumes before him then he slowly walked out into the still corridors past the secretarys office and down the stairs he avoided the elevator for he wanted to be free and unconfined there was another lecture he had intended to hear but that was no longer important now his thoughts were still in turmoil as he crossed to the embankment wall and let his eye follow the thames on its unhurried way to the sea it was hard for anyone with his training in orthodox science to accept the evidence that had now come into his hands he would never be certain of its truth yet the probability was overwhelming as he paced slowly beside the river wall he marshalled the facts one by one fact one noone at ruperts party could possibly have known that he was going to ask that question he had not known it himself it had been a spontaneous reaction to the circumstances therefore noone could have prepared any answer or had it already lying in their minds fact two ngs probably meant nothing to anyone except an astronomer though the great national geographic survey had been completed half a century before its existence was known only to a few thousand specialists and taking any number from it at random noone could have said where that particular star lay in the heavens butand this was fact three which he had only this moment discoveredthe small and insignificant star known as ngs was in precisely the right place it lay in the heart of the constellation carina at the end of that shining trail jan himself had seen so few nights ago leading from the solar system out across the depths of space it was an impossible coincidence ngs must be the home of the overlords yet to accept the fact violated all jans cherished ideas of scientific method very welllet them be violated he must accept the fact that somehow ruperts fantastic experiment had tapped a hitherto unknown source of knowledge rashaverak that seemed the most probable explanation the overlord had not been in the circle but that was a minor point however jan was not concerned with the mechanism of paraphysics he was only interested in using the results very little was know about ngs there had been nothing to distinguish it from a million other stars but the catalogue gave its magnitude its coordinates and its spectral type jan would have to do a little research and make a few simple calculations then he would know at least approximately how far the world of the overlords was from earth a slow smile spread over jans face as he turned away from the thames back towards the gleaming white faзade of the science centre knowledge was powerand he was the only man on earth who knew the origin of the overlords how he would use that knowledge he could not guess it would lie safely in his mind awaiting the moment of destiny tw human race continued to bask in the long cloudless summei afternoon of peace and prosperity would there ever be a winter again it was unthinkable the age of reason prematurely welcomed by the leaders of the french revolution two and a half centuries before had now really arrived this time there was no mistake there were drawbacks of course though they were willingly accepted one had to be very old indeed to realize that the papers which the telecaster printed in every home were really rather dull gone were the crises that had once produced banner headlines there were no mysterious murders to baffle the police and to arouse in a million breasts the moral indignation that was often suppressed envy such murders as did occur were never mysterious it was only necessary to turn a dialand the crime could be seen reenacted that instruments capable of such feats existed had at first caused considerable panic among quite lawabiding people this was something that the overlords who had mastered most but not all the quirks of human psychology had not anticipated it had to be made perfectly clear that no peeping tom would be able to spy on his fellows and that the very few instruments in human hands would be under strict control rupert boyces projector for instance could not operate beyond the borders of the reservation so he and main were the only persons inside its range even the few serious crimes that did occur received no par ricular attention in the news for wellbred people do not after all care to read about the social gaffes of others the average working week was now about twenty hours but those twenty hours were no sinecure there was little work left of a routine mechanical nature mens minds were too valuable to waste on tasks that a few thousand transistors some photoelectric cells and a cubic metre of printed circuits could perform there were factories that ran for weeks without being visited by a single human being men were needed for troubleshooting for making decisions for planning new enterprises the robots did the rest the existence of so much leisure would have created tremendous problems a century before education had overcome most of these for a wellstocked mind is safe from boredom the general standard of culture was at a level which would once have seemed fantastic there was no evidence that the intelligence of the human race had improved but for the first time everyone was given the fullest opportunity of using what brains they had most people had two homes in widely separated parts of the world now that the polar regions had been opened up a considerable fraction of the human race oscillated from arctic to antarctic at six monthly intervals seeking the long nightiess polar summer others bad gone into the deserts up the mountains or even into the sea there was nowhere on the planet where science and technology could not provide one with a comfortable home if one wanted it badly enough some of the more eccentric dwellingplaces provided the few items of excitement in the news in the most perfectly orderedsociety there will always be accidents perhaps it was a good sign that people felt it worthwhile to risk and occasionally break their necks for the sake of a cosy villa tucked under the summit of everest or looking out through the spray of victoria falls as a result someone was always being rescued from somewhere it had become a kind of gamealmost a planetary sport people could indulge in such whims because they had both the time and the money the abolition of armed forces had at once almost doubled the worlds effective wealth and increased production had done the rest as a result it was difficult to compare the standard of living of twentyfirstcentury man with that of any of his predecessors everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free provided as a public service by the community as roads water street lighting and drainage had once been a man could travel anywhere he pleased eat whatever food he fanciedwithout handing over any money he had earned the right to do this by being a productive member of the community there were of course some drones but the number of people sufficiently strongwilled to indulge in a life of complete idleness is much smaller than is generally supposed supporting such parasites was considerably less of a burden than providing the armies of ticketcollectors shop assistants bank clerks stockbrokers and so forth whose main function when one took the global point of view was to transfer items from one ledger to another nearly a quarter of the human races total activity it had been calculated was now expended on sports of various kinds ranging from such sedentary occupations as chess to lethal pursuits like skigliding across mountain valleys one unexpected result of this was the extinction of the professional sportsmen there were too many brilliant amateurs and the changed economic conditions had made the old system obsolete next to sport entertainment in all its branches was the greatest single industry for more than a hundred years there had been people who had believed that hollywood was the centre of the world they could now make a better case for this claim than ever before but it was safe to say that most of s productions would have seemed incomprehensibly highbrow to there had been some progress the boxoffice was no longer lord of all it surveyed among all the distractions and diversions of a planet which now seemed well on the way to becoming one vast playground there were some who still found time to repeat an ancient and neveranswered question where do we go from here ii jail leaned against the elephant and rested his hands on the skin rough as the bark of a tree he looked at the great tusks and the curving trunk caught by the skill of the taxidermist in the moment of challenge or salutation what still weirder creatures he wondered from what unknown worlds would one day be looking at this exile from earth how many animals have you sent the overlords he asked rupert at least fifty though of course this is the biggest one hes magnificent isnt he most of the others have been quite smallbutterflies snakes monkeys and so on though i did get a hippo last year jan gave a wry smile its a morbid thought but i suppose theyve got a fine stuffed group of homo sapiens in their collection by this time i wonder who was honoured youre probably right said rupert rather indifferently it would be easy to arrange through the hospitals what would happen continued jan thoughtfully if someone volunteered to go as a live specimen assuming that an eventual return was guaranteed of course rupert laughed though not unsympathetically is that an offer shall i put it to rashaverak for a moment jan considered the idea more than half seriously then he shook his head erno i was only thinking out loud theyd certainly turn me down by the way do you ever see rashaverak these days he called me up about six weeks ago hed just founa book id been hunting rather nice of him jan walked slowly round the stuffed monster admiring the skill that had frozen it forever at this instant of greatest vigour did you ever discover what he was looking for he asked i mean it seems so hard to reconcile the overlords science with an interest in the occult rupert looked at jan a little suspiciously wondering if his brotherinlaw was poking fun at his hobby his explanation seemed adequate as an anthropologist he was interested in every aspect of our culture remember they have plenty of time they can go into more detail than a human research worker ever could reading my entire library probably put only a slight strain on rashys resources that might be the answer but jan was not convinced sometimes he had thought of confiding his secret to rupert but his natural caution had held him back when he met his overlord friend again rupert would probably give something awaythe temptation would be far too great incidentally said rupert changing the subject abruptly if you think this is a big job you should see the commission sullivans got hes promised to deliver the two biggest creatures of alla sperm whale and a giant squid theyll be shown locked in mortal combat what a tableau that will make for a moment jan did not answer the idea that had exploded in his mind was too outrageous too fantastic to be taken seriously yet because of its very daring it might succeed whats the matter said rupert anxiously the heat getting you down jan shook himself back to present reality im all tight he said i was just wondering how the overlords would collect a little packet like that oh said rupert one of those cargo ships of theirs will come down open a hatch and hoist it in that said jan is exactly what i thought it might have been the cabin of a spaceship but it was not the walls were covered with meters and instruments there were no windowsmerely a large screen in front of the pilot the vessel could carry six passengers but at the moment jan was the only one he was watching the screen intently absorbing each glimpse of this strange and unknown region as it passed before his eyes unknownyes as unknown as anything he might meet beyond the stars ifhis mad plan succeeded he was going into a realm of nightmare creatures preying upon each other in a darkness undisturbed since the world began it was a realm above which men had sailed for thousands of years it lay no more than a kilometre below the keels of their shipsyet until the last hundred years they had known less about it than the visible face of the moon the pilot was dropping down from the ocean heights towards the still unexplored vastness of the south pacific basin he was following jan knew the invisible grid of sound waves created by beacons along the ocean floor they were still sailing as far above that floor as clouds above the surface of the earth there was very little to see the submarines scanners were searching the waters in vain the disturbance created by their jets had probably scared away the smaller fish if any creature came to investigate it would be something so large that it did not know the meaning of fear the tiny cabin vibrated with powerthe power which could hold at bay the immense weight of the waters above their heads and could create this little bubble of light and air within which men could live if that power failed thought jan they would become prisoners in a metal tomb buried deep in the silt of the ocean bed time to get a fix said the pilot he threw a set of switches and the submarine came to rest in a gentle surge of deceleraion as the jets ceased their thrust the vessel wasinotioniess oating in equilibrium as a balloon floats in the atmosphere it took only a moment to check their position on the sonar rid when he had finished with his instrument readings the pilot remarked before we start the motors again lets see if we can hear anything the loudspeaker flooded the quiet little room with a low ontinuous murmur of sound there was no outstanding ioise that jan could distinguish from the rest it was a steady dackground into which all individual sounds had been diended he was listening jan knew to the myriad creatures f the sea talking together it was as if he stood in the centre f a forest that teemed with lifeexcept that there he would have recognized some of the individual voices here not one thread in the tapestry of sound could be disentangled and identified it was so alien so remote from anything he had ever known that it set jans scalp crawling and yet this was part of his own world the shriek cut across the vibrating background like a flash of lightning against a dark stormdoud it faded swiftly away into a banshee wail an ululation that dwindled and died yet was repeated a moment later from a more distant source then a chorus of screams broke out a pandemonium that caused the pilot to reach swiftly for the volume control what in the name of god was that gasped jan weird isnt it its a school of whales about ten kilometres away i knew they were in the neighbourhood and thought youd like to hear them jan shuddered and i always thought the sea was silent why do they make such a din talking to one another i suppose sullivan could tell you they say he can even identifs some individual whales though i find that hard to believe hello weve got company a fish with incredibly exaggerated jaws was visible in the viewing screen it appeared to be quite large but as jan did now know the scale of the picture it was bard to judge hanging from a point just below its gills was a long tendril ending in an unidentifiable bellshaped organ were seeing it on infrared said the pilot lets look at the normal picture the fish vanished completely only the pendant remained slowing with its own phosphorescence then just for an mstant the shape of the creature ifickered into visibility as a line of lights flashed out along its body its an angler thats the bait it uses to lure other fish fantastic isnt it what i dont understand iswhy doesnt his bait attract fish big enough to eat him but we cant wait here all day watch him run when i switch on the jets the cabin vibrated once again as the vessel eased itself forward the great luminous fish suddenly flashed on all its lights in a frantic signal of alarm and departed like a meteor into the darkness of the abyss it was after another twenty minutes of slow descent that the invisible fingers of the scanner beams caught the first glimpse of the ocean bed far beneath a range of low hills was passing their outlines curiously soft and rounded what ever irregularities they might once have possessed had long ago been obliterated by the ceaseless rain from the watery heights above even here in midpacific far from the great estuaries that slowly swept the continents out to sea that rain never ceased it came from the stormscarred flanks of the andes j from the bodies of a billion living creatures from the dust ofi meteors that had wandered through space for ages and had come at last to rest here in the eternal night it was laying the foundations of the lands to be the hills drifted behind they were the frontier posts as jan could see from the charts of a wide plain which lay at too great a depth for the scanners to reach the submarine continued on its gentle downward glide now another picture was beginning to form on the screen because of the angle of view it was some tune before jan could interpret what he saw then he realized that they were approaching a submerged mountain jutting up from the hidden plain the picture was dearer now at this short range the definition of the scanners improved and the view was almost as distinct as if the image was being formed by lightwaves jan could see fine detail could watch the strange fish that pursued each other among the rocks once a venomouslooking creature with gaping jaws swam slowly across a halfconcealed cleft so swiftly that the eye could not follow the movement a long tentacle flashed out and dragged the struggling fish down to its doom nearly there said the pilot youll be able to see the lab in a minute they were travelling slowly above a spur of rock jutting out from the base of the mountain the plain beneath was now coming into view jan guessed that they were not more than a few hundred metres above the seabed then he saw a kilometre or so ahead a cluster of spheres standing on tripod legs and joined together by connecting tubes it looked exactly like the tanks of some chemical plant and indeed was designed on the same basic principles the only difference was that here the pressures which had to be resisted were outside not within whats that gasped jan suddenly he pointed a shaky finger towards the nearest sphere the curious pattern of lines on its surftce had resolved itself into a network of giant tentacles as the submarine came closer he could see that they ended in a great pulpy bag from which peered a pair of enormous eyes that said the pilot indifferently is probably lucifer someones been feeding him again he threw a switch and leaned over the control desk s calling lab im connecting up will you shoo away your pet the reply came promptly lab to s okgo ahead and make contact lucey will get out of the way the curving metal walls began to fill the screen jan caught a last glimpse of a giant suckerstudded arm whipping away at their approach then there was a dull clang and a series of scratching noises as the clamps sought for their locking points on the submarines smooth oval hull in a few minutes the vessel was pressed tightly against the wall of the base the two entrance ports had locked together and were moving forward through the hull of the submarine at the end of a giant hollow screw then came the pressure equalized signal the batches unsealed and the way into deep sea lab one was open jan found professor sullivan in a small untidy room that seemed to combine the attributes of office workshop and laboratory he was peeping through a microscope into what looked like a small bomb presumably it was a pressurecapsule containing some specimen of deepsea life still swimming happily around under its normal tonstothesquarecentimetre conditions well said sullivan dragging himself away from the eyepiece hows rupert and what can we do for you ruperts fine replied jan he sends his best wishes and says hed love to visit you if it werent for his claustrophobia then hed certainly feel a little unhappy down here with five kilometres of water on top of him doesnt it worry you by the way jan shrugged his shoulders no more than being in a stratoliner if anything went wrong the result would be the same in either case thats the sensible approach but its surprising how few people see it that way sullivan toyed with the controls of his microscope then shot jan an inquisitive glance ill be very glad to show you around he said but i must confess i was a little surprised when rupert passed on your request i couldnt understand why one of you spacehounds should be interested in our work arent you going in the wrong direction he gave a chuckle of amusement personally ive never seen why you were in such a hurry to get out there it will be centuries before weve got everything ln the oceans nicely charted and pigeonholed jan took a deep breath he was glad that sullivan had broached the subject himself fbr it made his task that much easier despite the ichthyologists jest they had a great deal in common it should not be too hard to build a bridge to enlist sullivans sympathy and aid he was a man of imagination or he would never have invaded this underwater world but jan would have to be cautious for the request he was going to make was to say the least of it somewhat unconventional there was one fact that gave him confidence even if sullivan refused to cooperate he would certainly keep jans secret and here in this quiet little office on thc bed of the pacific there seemed no danger that the overlordswhatever strange powers they possessedwould be able to listen to their conversation professor sullivan he began if you were interested in the ocean but the overlords refused to let you go near it how would you feel exceedingly annoyed no doubt im sure you would and suppose one day you had a chance of achieving your goal without them knowing what would you do would you take the opportunity sullivan never hesitated of course and argue later right into my hsnds thought jan he cant retreat now unless hes afraid of the overlords and i doubt if sullivan is afraid of anything he leaned forward across the cluttered table and prepared to present his case professor sullivan was no fool before jan could speak his lips twisted into a sardonic smile so thats the game is it he said slowly very very interesting now you go right ahead and tell me why i should help you earlier age would have regarded professor suffivan as an expensive luxury his operations cost as much as a small war indeed he could be likened to a general conducting a perpetual campaign against an enemy who never relaxed professor sullivans enemy was the sea and it fought him with weapons of cold and darknessand above all pressure in his turn he countered his adversary with intelligence and engineering skill he bad won many victories but the sea was patient it could wait one day sullivan knew he would make a mistake at least he had the consolation of knowing that he could never drown it would be far too quick for that he had refused to commit himself one way or the other when jan made his request but he knew what his answer was going to be here was the opportunity for a most interesting experiment it was a pity that he would never know the result still that happened often enough in scientific research and he had initiatedother programmes thatwould take decades to complete professor sullivan was a brave and an intelligent man but looking back on his career he was conscious of the fact that it had not brought him the sort of fame that sends a scientists name safely down all the centuries here was a chance totally unexpected and all the more attractive for that of really establishing himself in the history books it was not an ambition he would ever have admitted to anybodyand to do him justice he would still have helped jan even if his part in the plot remained forever secret as for jan he was now having second thoughts the momentum of his original discovery had carried him thus far almost without effort he had made his investigations but had taken no active steps to turn his dream into reality in few days however he must make his choice if professor sullivan agreed to cooperate there was no way in which he could retreat he must face the future he had chosen with all its implications what finally decided him was the thought that if he neglected this incredible opportunity he would never forgive himself all the rest of his life would be spent in vain regrets and nothing could be worse than that sullivans answer reached him a few hours later and he knew that the die was cast slowly because there was still plenty of time he began to put his affairs in order dear maia this is going to beto put it mildlyrather a surprise for you when you get this letter i shall no longer be on earth by that i dont mean that i shall have gone to themoon as many others have done no i shall be on my way to the home of the overlords i shall be the rst man ever to leave the solar system i am giving this letter to the friend who is helping me he will hold it until he knows that my plan has succeededin its first phase at leastand that it is too late for the overlords to interfere i shall be so far away and travelling at such a speed that i doubt if any recall message can overtake me even if it could it seems most unlikely that the ship would be able to put back to earth and i very much doubt if im all that important anyway first let me explain what led to this you know that ive always been interested in spaceflight and have always felt frustrated because weve never been allowed to go to the other planets or to learn anything about the civilization of the overlords if they had never intervened we might have reached mars and venus by now i admit that it is equally probable that we would have destroyed ourselves with colialt bombs and the other global weapons the twentieth century was developing yet sometimes i wish we could have had a chance of standing on our own feet probably the overlords have their reasons for keeping us in the nursery and probably they are excellent reasons but even if knew what they were i doubt if it would make much difference to my own feelingsor my actions everything really began at that party of ruperts you remember that silly sйance he arranged and how it ended when that girli forget her namefainted id asked what star the overlords came from and tne reply was ngs id not expected any answer and had treated the whole business as a joke until then but when i realized that this was a number in a star catalogue i decided to look into it i found that the star was in the constellation carina and one of the few facts that we do know about the overlords is that they come from that dire ion now i dont pretend to understand how that information reached us or where it originated did someone read rashaveraks mind even if they had its hardly likely that he would have known the reference number of his sun in one of our catalogues its a complete mystery and i leave it to people like rupert to solveif they can im just content to take the information and to act on it we know a lot now through our observation of their departure about the speed of the overlord ships they leave the solar system under such tremendous accelerations that they approach the velocity of light in less than an hour that means that the overlords must possess some kind of propulsive system that acts equally on every atom of their ships so that anything aboard wont be crushed instantly i wonder why they employ such colossal accelerations when theyve got all space to play with and could take their time picking up speed my theory is that they can somehow tap the energy fields round the stars and so have to do their starting and stopping while theyre fairly close to a sun but thats all by the way the important fact was that i knew how far they had to travel and therefore how long the journey took ngs is forty lightyears from earth the overlords ships reach more than ninetynine per cent of the speed of light so the trip must last forty years of our dine our time thats the crux of the matter now as you may have beard strange things happen as one approaches the speed of light time itself begins to flow at a different rateto pass more slowly so that what would be months on earth would be no more than days on the ships of the overlords the effect is quite fundamental it was discovered by the great einstein more than a hundred years ago i have made calculations based on what we know about the stardrive and using the firmlyestablished results of relativity theory from the viewpoint of the passengers on one of the overlord ships the journey to ngs will last not more than two monthseven thouh by earths reckoning forty years will have passed i know this seems a paradox and if its any consolation its puzzled the worlds best brains ever since einstein announced it perhaps this example will show you the sort of thing that can happen and will give you a clearer picture of the situation if the overlords send me straight back to earth i shall arrive home having aged only four months but on earth itself eighty years will have passed so you understand maia that whatever happens this is goodbye i have few ties binding me here as you know well enough so i can leave with a clear conscience ive not told mother yet she would get hysterical and i couldnt face that its better this way though ive tried to make allowances ever since father diedoh theres no point now in going into all that again ive terminated my studies and told the authorities that for family reasons im moving to europe everything has been settled and there should be nothing for you to worry about by this time you may imagine that im crazy since it seems impossible for anyone to get into one of the overlord ships but ive found a way it doesnt happen very often and after this it may never happen again for im sure karellen never makes the same mistake twice do you know the legend of the wooden horse that got the greek soldiers into troy but theres a story from the old testament thats an even closer parallel youll certainly be much more comfortable than jonah said sullivan there is no evidence that he was provided with electric light or sanitation but youll need a lot of provisions and i see youre taking oxygen can you take enough for a two month voyage in such a small space he stubbed his finger on the careful sketches which jan had laid on the table the microscope acted as a paper weight at one end the skull of some improbable fish held down the other i hope the oxygen isnt necessary said jan we know that they can breathe our atmosphere but they dont seem to like it very much and i might not be able to manage theirs at all as for the supply situation using narcosamine solves that its perfectly safe when were under way ill take a shot that will knock me out for six weeks plus or minus a few days p be nearly there by then actually it wasnt the food and xygen that was worrying me so much as the boredom professor sullivan nodded thoughtfully yes narcosamine is safe enough and can be calibrated fairly accurately but mind youve got plenty of food handy youll be ravening when you wake up and as weak as a kitten suppose you starved to death because you hadnt the strength to use a canopener id thought of that said jan a little hurt ill work up through sugar and chocolate in the usual way good im glad to see that youve been into the problem thoroughly and arent treating it like some stunt you can back out of if you dont like the way its going its your life youre playing with but id hate to feel i was helping you to commit suicide he picked up the skull and lifted it absentmindedly in his bands jan grabbed the plan to prevent it rolling up luckily continued professor sullivan the equipment you need is all fairly standard and our shop can put it together in a few weeks and if you decide to change your mind i wont said jan ive considered all the risks im taking and there seems tobenoflawintheplan attheend ofsixweeks ill emerge like any other stowaway and give myself up by then in my time rememberthe journey will be nearly over we will be about to land on the world of the overlords of course what happens then is up to them probably ill be sent home on the next shipbut at least i can expect to see something ive got a four millimetre camera and thousands of metres of film it wont be my fault if i cant use it even at the worst ill have proved that man cant be kept in quarantine forever ill have created a precedent that will compel karellen to take some action that my dear maia is all i have to say i know you wont miss mc greatly lets be honest and admit that we never had very strong ties and now that youve married rupert youll be quite happy in your own private universe at least i hope so goodbye then and good luck i shall look forward to meeting iour grandchildrenmake sure that they know about me won t you your affectionate brother witaii jan first saw it he found it hard to realize that he was not watching the fuselage of a small airliner being assembled the metal skeleton was twenty metres long perfectly streamlined and surrounded by light scafibiding over which the workmen were clathbering with their power tools yes said sullivan in reply to jans question we use standard aeronautical techniques and most of these men are from the aircraft industry its hard to believe that a thing this size could be alive isnt it or could throw itself clear out of the water as ive seen them do it was all very fascinating but jan had other things on his mind his eyes were searching the giant skeleton to find a suitable hidingplace for his little cellthe airconditioned coflin as sullivan had christened it on one point he was immediately reassured as far as space was concerned there would be room for a dozen stowaways the framework looks nearly complete said jan when will you be putting on the skin i suppose youve already caught your whale or you wouldnt know how large to make the skeleton sullivan seemed highly amused by this remark we havent the slightest intention of catching a whale anyway they dont have skins in the usual sense of the word it would hardly be practicable to fold a blanket of blubber twenty centimetres thick around that framework no the whole thing will be faked up with plastics and then accurately painted by the time weve finished noone will be able to tell the difference in that case thought jan the sensible thing for the overlords to have done would be to take photographs and make the fullsized model themselves back on their home planet but perhaps their supply ships returned empty and a little thing like a twentymetre sperm whale would hardly be noticed when one possessed such power and such resources one could not be bothered with minor economics professor sullivan stood by one of the great statues that had been such a challenge to archcology since easter island was discovered king god or whatever it might be its eyeless gaze seemed to be following his as he looked upon his handiwork he was proud of what he had done it seemed a pity that it would soon be banished forever from human sight the tableau might have been the work of some mad artist in a drugged delirium yet it was a painstaking copy from life nature herself was the artist here the scene was one that until the perfection of underwater television few men had ever glimpsedand even then only for seconds on those rare occasions when the giant antagonists thrashed their way to the surface these battles were fought in the endless night of the ocean depths where the sperm whales hunted for their food it was food that objected strongly to being eaten alive the long sawtoothed lower jaw of the whale was gaping wide preparing to fasten upon its prey the creatures head was almost concealed beneath the writhing network of white pulpy arms with which the giant squid was fighting desperately for life livid suckermarks twenty centimetres or more in diameter had mottled the whales skin where those arms had fastened one tentacle was already a truncated stump and there could be no doubt as to the ultimate outcome of the battle when the two greatest beasts on earth engaged in combat the whale was always the winner for all the vast strength of its forest of tentacles the squids only hope lay in escaping before that patiently grinding jaw bad sawn it to pieces its great expressionless eyes half a metre across stared at its destroyerthough in all probability neither creature could see the other in the darkness of the abyss the entire exhibit was more than thirty metres long and had now been surrounded by a cage of aluminium girders to which the lifting tackle had been connected everything was ready awaiting the overlords pleasure sullivan hoped that they would act quickly the suspense was beginning to be uncomfortable someone had come out of the office into the bright sunlight obviously looking for him sullivan recognized his chief clerk and walked over to meet him hello billwhats the fuss the other was holding a message form and looked rather pleased some good news professor weve been honoured the supervisor himself wants to come and look at our tableau before its shipped off just think of the publicity well geti it will help a lot when we apply for our new grant id been hoping for something like this professor sullivan swallowed hard he never objected to publicity but this time he was afraid he might get altogether too much karellen stood by the head of the whale and looked up at the great blunt snout and the ivorystudded jaw sullivan concealing his unease wondered what the supervisor was thinking his behaviour had not hinted at any suspicion and the visit could be easily explained as a normal one but sullivan would be very glad when it was over weve no creatures as large as this on our planet said karellen that is one reason why we asked you to make this group myercompatriots will find it fascinating with your low gravity answered sullivan i should have thought you would have had some very large nimas alter all look how much bigger you are than us yesbut we have no oceans and where size is concerned the land can never compete with the sea that was perfectly true thought sullivan and as far as he knew this was a hitherto unrevealed fact about the world of the overlords jan confound him would be very interested at the moment that young man was sitting in a hut a kilometre away anxiously watching the inspection through field glasses he kept telling himself that there was nothing to fear no inspection of the whale however close could reveal its secret but there was always the chance that karellen suspected somethingand was playing with them it was a suspicion that was growing in sullivans mind as the supervisor peered into the cavernous throat in your bible said karellen there is a remarkable story of a hebrew prophet one jonah who was swallowed by a whale and thus carried safely to land after he had been cast from a ship do you think there could be any basis of fact in such a legend i believe sullivan replied cautiously that there is one fairly wellauthenticated case of a whaleman being swallowed and then regurgitated with no illeffects of course if he had been inside the whale for more than a few seconds he would have suffocated and he must have been very lucky to miss the teeth its an almost incredible story but not quit impossible very interesting said karellen he stood for another moment staring at the great jaw then moved on to examine the squid sullivan hoped he did not hear his sigh of relief if id known what i was going to go through said professor sullivan id have thrown you out of the office as soon as you tried to infect me with your insanity im sorry about that jan replied but weve got away with it i hope so good luck anyway if you want to change your mind youve still got at least six hours i wont need them only karellen can stop me now thanks for all that youve done if i ever get back and write a book about the overlords ill dedicate it to you much good that will do me said sullivan gruffly ill have been dead for years to his surprise and mild consternation for he was not a sentimental man he discovered that this farewell was beginning to affect him he had grown to like jan during the weeks they had plotted together moreover he had begun to fear he might be an accessory to a complicated suicide he steadied the ladder as jan climbed into the great jaw carefully avoiding the lines of teeth by the light of the electric torch he saw jan turn and wave then he was lost in the cavernous hollow there was the sound of the airlock hatch being opened and closed and thereafter silence in the moonlight that had transformed the frozen battle into a scene from a nightmare professor sullivan walked slowly back to his office he wondered what he had done and where it would lead but this of course he would never know jan might walk this spot again having given no more than a few months of his life in travelling to the home of the overlords and returning to earth yet if he did so it would be on the other side of times impassable barrier for it would be eighty years in the future the lights went on in the tiny metal cylinder as soon as jan bad closed the inner door of the lock he allowed himself no time for second thoughts but began immediately upon the routine check he had already worked out all the stores and provisions bad been loaded days ago but a final recheck would put him in the right frame of mind by assuring him that nothing had been left undone an hour later he was satisfied he lay back on the spongerubber couch and recapitulated his plans the only sound was the faint whirr of the electric calendar dock which would warn him when the voyage was coming to its end he knew that he could expect to feel nothing here in his cell for whatever tremendous forces drove the ships of the overlords must be perfectly compensated sullivan had checked that pointing out that his tableau would collapse if subjected to more than a few gravities hisclientshad assured him that there was no danger on this score there would however be a considerable change of atmospheric pressure this was unimportant since the hollow models could breathe through several orifices before he left his cell jan would have to equalize pressure and he had assumed that the atmosphere inside the overlord ship was unbreathable a simple facemask and oxygen set would take care of that there was no need for anything elaborate if he could breathe without mechanical aid so much the better there was no point in waiting any longer it would only be a strain on the nerves he took out the little syringe already loaded with the carefully prepared solution narcosamine had been discovered during research into animal hibernation it was not true to sayas was popularly believedthat it produced suspended animation all it caused was a great slowingdown of the vital processes though metabolism still continued at a reduced level it was as if one had banked up the fires of life so that they smouldered underground but when after weeks or months the effcct of the drug wore off they would burst out again and the sleeper would revive narcosamine was perfectly safe nature had used it for a million years to protect many of her children from the foodless winter so jan slept he never felt the tug of the hoisting cables as the huge metal framework was lifted into the hold of the overlord freighter he never hcaid the hatches dose not to open again for three hundred million million kilometres he never heard faroff and faint through the mighty walls the protesting scream of earths atmosphere as the ship climbed swiftly back to its natural element and he never felt the stardrive go on tiu conference room was always crowded for these weekly meetings but today it was so closely packed that the reporters had difficulty in writing for the hundredth time they gruinbled to each other at karellens conservatism and lack of consideration anywhere else in the world they could have brought tv cameras tape recorders and all the other tools of their highly mechanized trade but here they had to rely on such archaic devices as paper and penciland even incredible to relate shorthand there had of course been several attempts to smuggle in recorders they had been successfully smuggled out again but a single glance at their smoking interiors had shown the futility of the experiment everyone understood then why they had always been warned in their own interest to leave watches and other metallic objects outside the conference room to make things more unfair karellen himself recorded the whole proceedings reporters guilty of carelessness or downright misrepresentationthough this was very rarehad been summoned to short and unpleasant sessions with karellens underlings and required to listen attentively to playbacks of what the supervisor had really said the lesson was not one that ever had to be repeated it was strange how these rumours got around no prior announcement was made yet there was always a full house whenever karellen had an important statement to make which happened on the average two or three times a year silence descended on the murmuring crowd as the great doorway split open and karellen caine forward on to the dais the light here was dimapproximating no doubt to that of the overlords far distant sunso that the supervisor for earth had discarded the dark glasses he normally wore when in the open he replied to the ragged chorus of greetings with a formal good morning everybody then turned to the tall distinguished figure at the front of the crowd mr golde doyen of the press club might have been the original inspirer of the butlers announcement three reporters mlud and a gentleman from the times he dressed and behaved like a diplomat of the old school noone would ever hesitate to confide in him and noone had ever regretted it subsequently quite a crowd today mr golde there must be a shortage of news the gentleman from the times smiled and cleared his throat i hope you can rectify that mr supervisor he watched intently as karellen considered his reply it seemed so unfair that the overlords faces rigid as masks betrayed no trace of emotion the great wide eyes their pupils sharply contracted even in this indifferent light stared fathonilessly back into the frankly curious human ones the twin breathing orifices on either cheekif those fluted basalt curves could be called cheeksemitted the faintest of whistles as karellens hypothetical lungs laboured in the thin air of earth golde could just see the curtain of tiny white hairs fluttering to and fro keeping accurately out of phase as they responded to karellens rapid doubleaction breathing cycle dust filters they were generally believed to be and elaborate theories concerning the atmosphere of the overlords home bad been constructed on this slender foundation yes i have some news for you as you are doubtless aware one of my supply ships recently left earth to return to its base we have just discovered that there was a stowaway on board a hundred pencils braked to a halt a hundred pairs of eyes fixed themselves upon karellen a stowaway did you say mr supervisor asked golde may we ask who he wasand how he got aboard his name is jan rodricks he is an engineering student from the university of cape town further details you can no doubt discover for yourselves through your own very efficient channels karellen smiled the supervisors smile was a curious affair most of the effect really resided in the eyes the inflexible lipless mouth scarcely moved at all was this golde wondered another of the many human customs that karellen bad copied with such skill for the total effect was undoubtedly that of a smile and the mind readily accepted it as such as for how he left continued the supervisor that is of secondary importance i can assure you or any other potential astronauts that there is no possibility of repeating the exploit what will happen to this young man persisted golde will he be sent back to earth that is outside my jurisdiction but i expect he will come back ofl the next ship he would find conditions tooalien fur comfort where he has gone and this leads me to the main purpose of our meeting today jarellen paused and the silence grew even deeper there has been some complaint among the younger and more romantic elements of your population because outer space has been closed to you we had a purpose in doing this we do not impose bans for the pleasure of it but have you ever stopped to considerif you will excuse a slightly attering analogywhat a man from your stone age would have felt if he suddenly found himself in a modern city surely protested the herald tribune there is a fundamental difference we are accustomed to science on your world there are doubtless many things which we might not understandbut they wouldnt seem magic to us are you quite sure of that said karellen so softly that it was hard to hear his words only a hundred years lies beween the age of electricity and the age of steam but what would a victorian engineer have made of a television set or an electronic computer and how long would he have lived if he started to investigate their workings the gulf between two bnologies can easily become so great that it islethal hello whispered reuters to the bbc were in luck hes going to make a major policy statement i know the symptoifls and there are other reasons why we have restricted the human race to earth watch the lights dimmed and vanished as they faded a milky opalescence formed in the centre of the room it congealed into a whirlpool of starsa spiral nebula seen from a point far beyond its outermost sun no human eyes have ever seen this sight before said karellens voice from the darkness you arc looking at your own universe the island galaxy of which your sun is a member from a distance of half a million lightyears there was a long silence then karellen continued and now his voice held something that was not quite pity and not ecisely scorn your race has shown a notable incapacity for dealing with the problems of its own rather small planet when we arrived you were on the point of destroying yourselves with the powers that science had rashly given you without our intervention the earth today would be a radioactive wilderness now you have a world at peace and a united race soon you will be sufliciently civilized to run your planet without our assistance perhaps you could eventually handle the problems of an entire solar systemsay fifty moons and planets but do you really imagine that you could ever cope with this the nebula expanded now the individual stars were rushing past appearing and vanishing as swiftly as sparks from a forge and each of those transient sparks was a sun with who knew how many circling worlds in this single galaxy of ours murmured karellen there are eightyseven thousand million suns even that figure gives only a faint idea of the immensity of space in challenging it you would be like ants attempting to label and classify all the grains of sand in all the deserts of the world your race in its present stage of evolution cannot face that stupendous challenge one of my duties has been to protect you from the powers and forces that lie among the stars fbroes beyond anything that you can ever imagine the image of the galaxys swirling firemists faded light returned to the sudden silence of the great chamber karellen turned to go the audience was over at the door he paused and looked back upon the hushed crowd it is a bitter thought but you must face it the planets you may one day possess but the stars are not for man the stars are not for man yes it would annoy them to have the celestial portals slammed in their faces but they must learn to face the truthor as much of the truth as could mercifully be given to them from the lonely heights of the stratosphere karellen looked lown upon the world and the people that had been given into is reluctant keeping he thought of all that lay ahead and what this world would be only a dozen years from now they would never know how lucky they had been for a lifetime mankind had achieved as much happiness as any race can ever know it had been the golden age but gold was also the colour of sunset of autumn and only karellens ears could catch the first wailings of the winter storms andonly karellen knew with what inexorable swiftness the golden age was rushing to its close m the last generation look at this exploded george greggson hurling the paper across at jean it came to rest despite her efforts to intercept it spread listlessly across the breakfast table jean patiently scraped away the jam and read the offending passage doing her best to register disapproval she was not very good at this because all too often she agreed with the critics usually she kept these heretical opinions to herself and not merely for the sake of peace and quiet george was perfectly prepared to accept praise from her but if she ventured any criticism of his work she would receive a crushing lecture on her artistic ignorance she read the review twice then gave up it appeared quite favourable and she said so he seemed to like the performance what are you grumbling about this snarled george stubbing his finger at the middle of the column just read it again particularly restful on the eyes were the delicate pastel greens of the background to the ballet sequence well they werent greens i spent a lot of time getting that exact shade of blue and what happens either some blasted engineer in the control room upsets the colour balance or that idiot of a reviewers got a cockeyed set hey what colour did it look on our receiver eri cant remember confessed jean the poppet started squealing about then and i had to go and find what was wrong with her oh said george relapsing into a gently simmering quiescence jean knew that another eruption could be expected at any moment when it came however it was fairly mild ive invented a new definition for tv he muttered gloomily ive decided its a device for hindering communication between artist and audience what do you want to do about it retorted jean go back to the live theatre and why not asked george thats exactly what i hat been thinking about you know that letter i received from the new athens people theyve written to me again this time im going to answer indeed said jean faintly alarmed i think theyre a lot of cranks well theres only one way to find out i intend to go and see them in the next fortnight i must say that the literature they put out looks perfectly sane and theyve got some very good men there if you expect me to start cooking over a wood fire or learning to dress in skins youll have oh dont be silly those stories are just nonsense the colonys got everything thats really needed for civilized life they dont believe in unnecessary frills thats all anyway its a couple of years since i visited the pacific it will make a trip for us both i agree with you there said jean but i dont intend junior and the poppet to grow up into a couple of polynesian savages they wont said george i can promise you that he was right though not in the way he had intended as you noticed when you flew in said the little man on the other side of the veranda the colony consists of two islands linked by a causeway this is athens the other weve christened sparta its rather wild and rocky and is a wonderful place for sport or exercise his eye flickered momentarily over his visitors waistline and george squirmed slightly in the cane chair sparta is an extinct volcano by the way at least the geologists say its extinct haha but back to athens the idea of the colony as youve gathered is to build up an independent stable cultural group with its own artistic traditions i should point out that a vast amount of research took place before we started this enterprise its really a piece of applied social engineering based on some exceedingly complex mathematics which i wouldnt pretend to understand all i know is that the mathematical sociologists have computed how large the colony should be how many types of people it should containand above all what constitution it should have fur longterm stability were ruled by a council of eight directors representing production power social engineering art economics science sport and philosophy theres no permanent chairman or president the chairs held by each of the directors in rotation for a year at a time our present population is just over fifty thousand which is a little short of the desired optimum thats why we keep our eyes open for recruits and of course there is a certain wastage were not yet quite selfsupporting in some of the more specialized talents here on this island were trying to save something of humanitys independence its artistic traditions weve no hostility towards the overlords we simply want to be left alone to go our own way when they destroyed the old nations and the way of life man had known since the beginning of history they swept away many good things with the bad the worlds now placid featureless and culturally dead nothing really new has been created since the overlords came the reasons obvious theres nothing left to struggle for and there are too many distractions and entertainments do you realize that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and tv pour out over the various channels if you went without sleep and did nothing else you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment thats available at the turn of a switch no wonder that people are becoming passive spongesabsorbing but never creating did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day soon people wont be living their own lives any more it will be a fulltime job keeping up with the various family serials on tv here in athens entertainment takes its proper place moreover its live not canned in a community this size it is possible to have almost complete audience participation with all that that means to the performers and artists incidentally weve got a very fine symphony orchestraprobably among the worlds halfdozen best but i dont want you to take my word for a this what usually happens is that prospective citizens stay here a few days getting the feel of the place if they decide theyd like to join us then we let them take the battery of psychological tests whicharereallyourmainlineofdefence about athirdof the applicants are rejected usually fur reasons which dont reflect on them and which wouldnt matter outside those who pass go home long enough to settle their affairs and then rejoin us sometimes they change their minds at this stage but thats very unusual and almost invariably through personal reasons outside their control our tests are practically a hundredpercent reliable now the people they pass are the people who really want to come suppose anyone changed their mind later asked jean anxiously then they could leave thered be no difficulty its happened once or twice there was a long silence jean looked at george who was rubbing thoughtfully at the sidewhiskers currently popular in artistic circles as long as they werent burning their boats behind them she was not unduly worried the colony looked an interesting place and certainly wasnt as cranky as shed feared and the children would love it that in the final analysis was all that mattered they moved in six weeks later the singlestoried house was small but quite adequate for a family which had no intention of being greater than four all the basic laboursaving devices were in evidence at least jean admitted there was no danger of reverting to the dark ages of domestic drudgery it was slightly disturbing however to discover that there was a kitchen in a community of this size one would normally expect to dial food central wait five minutes and then get whatever meal they had selected individuality was all very well but this jean feared might be taking things a little too far she wondered darkly if she would be expected to make the familys clothes as well as to prepare its meals but there was no spinningwheel between the automatic dishwasher and the radar range soit wasnt quite as bad as that of course the rest of the house still looked very bare and raw they were its first occupants and it would be some time before all this aseptic newness had been converted into a warm human home the children doubtless would catalyze the process rather effectively there was already an unfortunate victim of jeffreys expiring in the bath as a result of that young mans ignorance of the fundamental difference between fresh and salt water jean moved to the still uncurtained window and looked across the colony it was a beautiful place there was no doubt of that the house stood on the western slopes of the low bill that dominated because of the absence of any other competition the island of athens two kilometres to the north she could see the causewaya thin knifeedge dividing the water that led to sparta that rocky island with its brooding volcanic cone was such a contrast to this peaceful spot that it sometimes frightened her she wondered how the scientists could be so certain that it would never reawaken and overwhelm them all a wavering figure coming up the slope keeping carefully to the palmtrees shade in defiance of the rule of the road attracted her eye george was returning from his first conference it was time to stop daydreaming and get busy about the house a metallic crash announced the arrival of georges bicycle jean wondered how long it was going to take them both to learn to ride this was yet another unexpected aspect of life on the island private cars were not permitted and indeed were unnecessary since the greatest distance one could travel in a straight line was less than fifteen kilometres there were various communityowned service vehiclestrucks ambulances and fireengines all restricted except in cases of real emergency to fifty kilometres an hour as a result the inhabitants of athens had plenty of exercise uncongested streets and no traffic accidents george gave his wife a perfunctory peck and collapsed with a sigh of relief into the nearest chair phew i he said mopping his brow everyone raced past me on the way up the hill so i suppose people do get used wit i think ive lost ten kilograms already what sort of a day did you have asked jean dutifully she hoped george would not be too exhausted to help with the unpacking very stimulating of course cant remember half the people i met but they all seemed very pleasant and the theatre is just as good as id hoped were starting work next week on shaws back to methuselah ill be in complete charge of sets and stage design itll make a change not having a dozen people to tell me what i cant do yes i think were going to like it here despite the bicycles george summoned up enough energy to grin yes he said in a couple of weeks i wont even notice this little hill of ours he didnt really believe itbut it was perfectly true it was another month however before jean ceased to pine for the car and discovered all the things one could do with ones own kitchen new athens was not a natural and spontaneous growth like the city whose name it bore everything about the colony was deliberately planned as the result of many years of study by a group of very remarkable men it had begun as an open conspiracy against the overlords an implicit challenge to their policy if not to their power at first the colonys sponsors had been more than half certain that karellen would neatly frustrate them but the supervisor had done nothingabsolutely nothing this was not quite as reassuring as might have been expected karellen had plenty of time he might be preparing a delayed counterstroke or he might be so certain of the projects failure that he felt no need to take any action against it that the colony would fail had been the prediction of most people yet even in the past long before any real knowledge of social dynamics had existed there had been many communities devoted to special religious or philosophical ends it was true that their mortality rate had been high but some had survived and the foundations of new athens were as secure as modern science could make them there were many reasons for choosing an island site not the least important were psychological in an age of universal air transport the ocean meant nothing as a physical barrier but it still gave a sense of isolation moreover a limited land area made it impossible for too many people to live in the colony the maximum population was fixed at a hundred thousand more than that and the advantages inherent in a small compact community would be lost one of the aims of the founders was that any member of new athens should know all the other citizens who shared his interestsand as many as one or two per cent of the remainder as well the man who had been the driving force behind new athens was a jew and like moses he had never lived to enter his promised land for the colony had been founded three years after his death he had been born in israel the last independent nation ever to come into existenceand therefore the shortest lived the end of national sovereignty had been felt here perhaps more bitterly than anywhere else for it is hard to lose a dream which one has just achieved after centuries of striving ben salomon was no fanatic but the memories of his childhood must have determined to no small extent the philosophy he was to put into practice he could just remember what the world had been before the advent of the overlords and had no wish to return to it like not a few other intelligent and wellmeaning men he could appreciate all that karellen had done for the human race while still being unhappy about the supervisors ultimate plans was it possible he sometimes said to himself that despite all their enormous intelligence the overlords did not really understand mankind and were making a terrible mistake from the best of motives suppose in their altruistic passion for justice and order they had determined to reform the world but had not realized that they were destroying the soul of man the decline had barely started yet the ftrst symptoms of decay were not hard to discover salomon was no artist but he had an acute appreciation of art and knew that his age could riot match the achievements of previous centuries in any single field perhaps matters would right themselves in due course when the shock of encountering the overlord civilization had worn off but it might not and a prudent man would consider taking out an insurance policy new athens was that policy its establishment had taken twenty years and some billions of pounds decimala relatively trivial factor therefore of the worlds total wealth nothing had happened for the first fifteen years everything had happened in the last five salomons task would have been impossible had he not been able to convince a handful of the worlds most famous artists that his plan was sound they had sympathized because it appealed to their egos not because it was important for the race but once convinced the world had listened to them and given both moral and material support behind this spectacular faзade of temperamental talent the real architects of the colony had laid their plans a society consists of human beings whose behaviour as individuals is unpredictable but if one takes enough of the basic units then certain laws begin to appearas was discovered long ago by lifeinsurance companies noone can tell what individuals will die in a given timeyet the total number of deaths can be predicted with considerable accuracy there are other subtler laws first glimpsed in the early twentieth century by mathematicians such as weiner and rashavesky they had argued that such events as economic depressions the results of armament races the stability of social groups political elections and so on could be analysed by the correct mathematical techniques the great difficulty was the enormous number of variables many of them hard to define in numerical terms one could not draw a set of curves and state definitely when this line is reached it will mean war and one could never wholly allow for such utterly unpredictable events as the assassination of a key figure or the effects of some new scientific discoverystill less such natural catastrophes as earthquakes or floods which might haves profound effect on large numbers of people and the social groups in which they lived yet one could do much tianks to the knowledge patiently accumulated during the past hundred years the task would have been impossible without the aid of the giant computing machines that could perform the work of a thousand human calculators in a matter of seconds such aids had been used to the utmost when the colony was planned even so the founders of new athens could only provide the soil and the climate in which the plant they wished to cherish mightor might notcome to flower as salomon himself had remarked we can be sure of talent we can only pray for genius but it was a reasonable hope that in such a concentrated solution some intresting reactions would take place few artists thrive in solitude and nothing is more stimulating than the conflict of minds with similar interests so far the conflict had produced worthwhile results in sculpture music literary criticism and filmmaking it was still too early to see if the group working on historical research would fulfil the hopes of its instigators who were frankly aiming at restoring mankinds pride in its own achievements painting still languished which supported the view of those who considered that static twodimensional forms of art had no further possibilities it was noticeablethough a satisfactory explanation fbr this had not yet been producedthat time played an essential part in thecolonys most successful artistic achievements even its sculpture was seldom immobile andrew carsons intriguing volumes and curves changed slowly as one watched according to complex ptterns that the mind could appreciate even if it could not fully comprehend them indeed carson claimed with some truth to have taken the mobiles of a century before to their ultimate conclusion and thus to have wedded sculpture and ballet much of the colonys musical experimenting was quite consciously concerned with what might be called time span what was the briefest note that the mind could graspor the longest that it could tolerate without boredom could the result be varied by conditioning or by the use of appropriate orchestration such problems were discussed endlessly and the arguments were not purely academic they had resulted in some extremely interesting compositions but it was in the art of the cartoon film with its limitless possibilities that new athens had made its most successful experiments the hundred years since the time of disney had still left much undone in this most flexible of all mediums on the purely realistic side results could be produced indistinguishable from actual photographymuch to the contempt of those who were developing the cartoon along abstract lines the group of artists and scientists that had so far done least was the one that had attracted the greatest interestand the greatest alarm this was the team working on total identification the history of the cinema gave the clue to their actions first sound then colour then stereoscopy then cinerama had made the old moving pictures more and more like reaiity itself where was the end of the story surely the final stage would be reached when the audience forgot it was an audience and became part of the action to achieve this would involve stimulation f all the senses and perhaps h nosis as wcll but many beheved it to be practical when goal was attained there would be an enormous enrichment of human experience a man could becomefor a while at leastany other person and could take part in any conceivable adventure real or imaginary he could even be plant or animal if it proved possible to capture and record the sense impressions of other living creatures and when the programme was over he would have acquired a memory as vivid as any experience in his actual lifeindeed indistinguishable from reality itself the prospect was dazzling many also found it terrifying and hoped that the enterprise would fail but they knew in their hearts that once science had declared a thing possible there was no escape from its eventual realization this then was new athens and some of its dreams it hoped to become what the old athens might have been had it possessed machines instead of slaves science instead of superstition but it was much too early yet to tell if the experiment would succeed jmiluy gigson was one islander who as yet had no interest in esthetics or science the two main preoccupations of his elders but he heartily approved of the colony for purely personal reasons the sea never more than a few kilometres away in any direction fascinated hini most of his short life bad been spent far inland and he was not yet accustomed to the novelty of being surrounded by water he was a good swimmer and would often cycle off with other young friends carrying his fins and mask to go exploring the shallower water of the lagoon at first jean was not very happy about this but after she had made a few dives herself she lost her fear of the sea and its strange creatures and let jeffrey enjoy himself as he pleasedon condition that he never swam alone the other member of the greggson household who approved of the change was fey the beautiful golden retriever who nominally belonged to george but could seldom be detached from jeffrey the two were inseparable both by day andif jean had not put her foot downby night only when jeffrey went off on his bicycle did fey remain at home lying listlessly in front of the door and staring down the road with moist mournful eyes her muzzle resting on her paws this was rather mortifying to george who had paid a stiff price for fey and her pedigree it looked as if he would have to wait for the next generationdue in three monthsbefore he could have a dog of his own jean had other views on the subject she liked fey but felt that one hound per house was quite sufficient only jennifer anne had not yet decided whether she liked the colony that however was hardly surprising for she had so far seen nothing of the world beyond the plastic panels of her cot and had as yet very little suspicion that such a place existed george greggson did not often think about the past he was too busy with plans for the future too much occupied by his work and his children it was rare indeed that his mind went back across the years to that evening in africa and he never talked about it with jean by mutual consent the subject was avoided and since that day they had never visited the boyces again despite repeated invitations they called rupert with fresh excuses several times a year and lately he bad ceased to bother them his marriage to maia rather to everyones surprise still seemed to be flourishing one result of that evening was that jean had lost all desire to dabble with mysteries at the borders of known science the naive and uncritical wonder that had drawn her to rupert and his experiments bad completely vanished perhaps she had been convinced and wanted no more proof george preferred not to ask her it was just as likely that the cares of maternity had banished such interests from her mind there was no point george knew in worrying about a mystery that could never be solved yet sometimes in the stillness of the night he would wake and wonder he remembered his meeting with jan rodericks on the roof of ruperts house and the few words that were all he had spoken with the only human being successfully to defy the overlords ban nothing in the realm of the supernatural thought george could be more eerie than the plain scientific fact that though almost ten years had passed since he had spoken to jan that nowfardistant voyager would have aged by only a few days the universe was vast but that fact terrified him less than its mystery george was not a person who thought deeply on such matters yet sometimes it seemed to him that men were like children amusing themselves in some secluded playground protected from the fierce realities of the outer world jan rodricks had resented that protection and had escaped from it into noone knew what but in this matter george found himself on the side of the overlords he bad no wish to face whatever urked in the unknown darkness just beyond the little circle of light cast by the lamp of science how is it said george plaintively that jeffs always off somewhere when i happen to be home wheres he gone today jean looked up from her knittingan archaic occupation which had recently been revived with much success such fashions came and went on the island with some rapidity the main result of this particular craze was that the men had now all been presented with multicoloured sweaters far too hot to wear in the daytime but quite useful after sundown hes gone off to sparta with some friends jean replied he promised to be back for dinner i really came home to do some work said george thoughtfully but its a nice day and i think ill go out there and have a swim myself what kind of fish would you like me to bring back george had never caught anything and the fish in the lagoon were much too wily to be trapped jean was just going to point this out when the stillness of the afternoon was shattered by a sound that still had power even in this peaceful age to chill the blood and set the scalp crawling with apprehension it was the wail of a siren rising and filling spreading its message of danger in concentric circles out to sea for almost a hundred years the stresses had been slowly increasing here in the burning darkness deep beneath the oceans floor though the submarine canyon had been formed geological ages ago the tortured rocks had never reconciled themselves to their new positions countless times the strata bad creaked and shifted as the unimaginable weight of water disturbed their precarious equilibrium they were ready to move again jeff was exploring the rock pools along the narrow spartan beachan occupation he found endlessly absorbing one never knew what exotic creatures one might find sheltered here from the waves that marched forever across the pacific to spend themselves against the reef it was a fairyland for any child and at the moment he possessed it all himself for his friends had gone up into the hills the day was quiet and peaceful there was not a breath of wind and even the perpetual muttering beyond the reef had sunk to a sullen undertone a blazing sun hung halfway down the sky but jeffs mahoganybrown body was now quite immune to its onslaughts the beach here was a narrow belt of sand sloping steeply towards the lagoon looking down into the glassclear water jeff could see the submerged rocks which were as familiar to him as any formations on the land about ten metres down the weedcovered ribs of an ancient schooner curved up towards the world it had left almost two centuries ago jeff and his friends had often explored the wreck but their hopes of hidden treasure had been disappointed all that they had ever retrieved was a barnacleencrusted compass very firmly something took hold of the beach and gave it a single sudden jerk the tremor passed so swiftly that jeff wondered if he had imagined it perhaps it was a momentary giddiness for all around him remained utterly unchanged the waters of the lagoon were unruffled the sky empty of cloud or menace and then a very strange thing began to happen swifter than any tide could ebb the water was receding from the shore jeff watched deeply puzzled and not in the least afraid as the wet sands were uncovered and lay sparkling in the sun he followed the retreating ocean determined to make the most of whatever miracle had opened up the underwater world for his inspection now the level had sunk so far that the broken mast of the old wreck was climbing into the air its weeds hanging limply from it as they lost their liquid support jeff hastened forward eager to see what wonders would be uncovered next it was then that he noticed the sound from the reef he had never heard anything like it before anli he stopped to think the matter over his bare feet slowly sinking into the moist sand a great fish was thrashing in its death agonies a few metres away but jeff scarcely noticed it he stood alert and listening while the noise from the reef grew steadily around him it was a sucking gurgling sound as of a river racing through a narrow channel it was the voice of the reluctantly retreating sea angry at losing even for a moment the lands it rightfully possessed through the graceful branches of the coral through the hidden submarine caves millions of tons of water were draining out of the lagoon into the vastness of the pacific very soon and very swiftly they would return one of the salvage parties hours later found jeff on a great block of coral that had been hurled twenty metres above the normal water level he did not seem particularly frightened though he was upset over the loss of his bicycle he was also very hungry as the partial destruction of the causeway had cut him off from home when rescued he was contemplating swimming back to athens and unless the currents had changed drastically would doubtless have managed the crossbig without much trouble jean and george had witnessed the whole sequence of events when the tsunami hit the island though the damage to the lowlying areas of athens had been severe there had been no loss of life the seismographs had been able to give only fifteen minutes warning but that had been long enough to get everyone above the danger line now the colony was licking its wounds and collecting together a mass of legends that would grow steadily more hairraising through the years to come jean burst into tears when her son was restored to her for she had quite convinced herself that he had been swept out to sea she had watched with horrified eyes as the black and foamcapped wall of water had moved roaring in from the horizon to smother the base of sparta in spume and spray it seemed incredible that jeff could have reached safety in time it was scarcely surprising that he could not give a very rational account of what had happened when he had eaten and was safely in bed jean and george gathered by his side go to sleep darling and forget all about it said jean youre all right now but it was fun mummy protested jeff i wasnt reay frightened thats fine said george youre a brave lad and its a good thing you were sensible and ran in time ive heard about these tidal waves before a lot of people get drowned because they go out on the uncovered beach to see whats happened thats what i did confessed jeff i wonder who it was helped me what do you mean there wasnt anyone with you the other boys were up the bill jeff looked puzzled but someone told me to run jean and george glanced at each other in mild alarm you meanyou imagined you heard something oh dont bother him now said jean anxiously and with a little too much haste but george was stubborn i want to get to the bottom of this tell me just vhat happened jeff well i was right down the beach by that old wreck when the voice spoke what did it say i cant quite remember but it was something like jeffrey get up the hill as quickly as you can youll be drowned if you stay here im sure it called me jeffrey not jeff so it couldnt have been anyone i knew was it a mans voice and where did it come from it was ever so close beside me and it sounded like a man jeff hesitated for a moment and george prompted him go onjust imagine that youre back on the beach and tell us exactly what happened well it wasnt quite like anyone ive ever heard talking before i think he was a very big man is that all the voice said yesuntil i started to climb the hill then another funny thing happened you know the path up the cliff yes i was running up that because it was the quickest way i knew what was happening now for id seen the big wave coming in it was making an awful noise too and then i found there was a great big rock m the way it wasnt there before and i couldnt get past it the quake must have brought it down said george shush go on jeff i didnt know what to do and i could hear the wave coming closer then the voice said close your eyes jeffrey and put your hand in front of your face it seemed a funny thing to do but i tried it and then there was a great flashi could feel it all overand when i opened my eyes the rock was gone gone thats rightit just wasnt there so i started running again and thats when i nearly burnt my feet because the path was awful hot the water hissed when it went over it but it couldnt catch me theni was too far up the cliff and thats all i came down again when there werent any more waves then i found that my bike had gone and the road home had been knocked down dont worry about the bicycle dear said jean squeezing her son thankfully well get you another one the only thing that matters is that youre safe we wont worry about how it happened that wasnt true of course for the conference began immediately they had left the nursery it decided nothing but it bad two sequels the next day without telling george jean took her small son to the colonys child psychologist he listened carefully while jeff repeated his story not in the least overawed by his novel surroundings then while his unsuspecting patient rejected seriatim the toys in the next room the doctor reassured jean theres nothing on his card to suggest any mental abnormality you must remember that hes been through a terrifying experience and hes come out of it remarkably well hes a highly imaginative child and probably believes his own story so just accept it and dont worry unless there are any later symptoms then let me know at once that evening jean passed the verdict on to her husband he did not seem as relieved as she had hoped and she put it down to worry over the damage to his beloved theatre he just grunted thats fine and settled down with the current issue of stage and studio it looked as if he had lost interest in the whole affair and jean felt vaguely annoyed with him but three weeks later on the first day that the causeway was reopened george and his bicycle set off briskly towards sparta the beach was still littered with masses of shattered coral and in one place the reef itself seemed to have been breached george wondered how long it would take the myriads of patient polyps to repair the damage there was only one path up the face of the dliff and when he had recovered his breath george began the climb a few dried fragments of weed trapped among the rocks marked the limit of the ascending waters for a long time george greggson stood on that lonely track staring at the patch of fused rock beneath his feet he tried to tell himself that it was some freak of the longdead volcano but soon abandoned this attempt at selfdeception his mind went back to that night years ago when he and jean had joined that silly experiment of rupert boyces noone had ever really understood what had happened then and george knew that in some unfathomable way these two strange events were linked together first it had been jean now her son he did not know whether to be glad or fearful and in his heart he uttered a silent prayer thank you karellen for whatever your people did for jeff but i wish i knew why they did it he went slowly down to the beach and the great white gulls wheeled around him annoyed because he had brought no food to throw them as they cirded in the sky kiuus request though it might have been expected at any time since the foundation of the colony was something of a bombshell it represented as everyone was fully aware a crisis in the affairs of athens and nobody could decide whether good or bad would come of it until now the colony had gone its way without any form of interference from the overlords they had left it completely alone as indeed they ignored most human activities that were not subversive or did not offend their codes of behaviour whether the colonys aims could be called subversive was uncertain they were nonpolitical but they represented a bid for intellectual and artistic independence and from that who knew what might come the overlords might well be able to foresee the future of athens more clearly than its foundersand they might not like it of course if karellen wished to send an observer inspector or whatever one cared to call him there was nothing that could be done about it twenty years ago the overlords had announced that they had discontinued all use of their surveillance devices so that humanity need no longer consider itself spied upon however the fact that such devices still existed meant that nothing could be hidden from the overlords if they really wanted to see it there were some on the island who welcomed this visit as a chance of settling one of the minor problems of overlord psychologytheir attitude towards art did they regard it as a childish aberration of the human race did they have any forms of art themselves in that case was the purpose of this visit purely asthetic or did karellen have less innocent motives all these matters were debated endlessly while the preparations were under way nothing was known of the visiting overlord but it was assumed that he could absorb culture in unlimited amounts the experiment would at least be attempted and the reactions of the victim observed with interest by a battery of very shrewd minds the current chairman of the council was the philosopher charles yan sen an ironic but fundamentally cheerful man who was not yet in his sixties and was therefore still in the prime of life plato would have approved of him as an example of the philosopherstatesman though sen did not altogether approve of plato whom he suspected of grossly misrepresenting socrates he was one of the islanders who was determined to make the most of this visit if only to show the overlords that men still had plenty of initiative and were not yet as he put it fully domesticated nothing in athens was done without a committee that ultimate hallmark of the democratic method indeed someone had once defined the colony as a system of interlocking committees but the system worked thanks to the patient studies of the social psychologists who had been the real founders of athens because the community was not too large everyone in it could take some part in its running and could be a citizen in the truest sense of the word it was almost inevitable that george as a leading member of the artistic hierarchy should be one of the reception committee but he made doubly sure by pulling a few strings if the overlords wanted to study the colony george wanted equally to study them jean was not very happy about this ever since that evening at the boyces she had felt a vague hostility towards the overlords though she could never give any reason for it she just wished to have as little to do with them as possible and to her one of the islands main attractions had been its hopedfor independence now she feared that this independence might be threatened the overlord arrived without ceremony in an ordinary manmade flyer to the disappointment of those who had hoped for something more spectacular he might have been karellen himself for noone had ever been able to distinguish one overlord from another with any degree of confidence they all seemed duplicates from a single mastermould perhaps by some unknown biological process they were after the first day the islanders ceased to pay much attention when the official car murmured past on its sightseeing tours the visitors correct name thanthalteresco proved too intractable for general use and he was soon christened the inspector it was an accurate enough name for his curiosity and appetite for statistics were insatiable charles yan sen was quite exhausted when long after midnight he had seen the inspector back to the flyer which was serving as his base there no doubt he would continue to work throughout the night while his human hosts indulged in the frailty of sleep mrs sen greeted her husband anxiously on his return they were a devoted couple despite his playful habit of calling her xantippe when they were entertaining guests she had long ago threatened to make the appropriate retort by brewing him a cup of hemlock but fbrtunately this herbal beverage was less common to new athens than the old was it a success she asked as her husband settled down to a belated meal i think sobut you can never tell what goes on inside those remarkable minds he was certainly interested even cornplimentary i apologized by the way for not inviting him here he said he quite understood and had no wish to bang his head on our ceiling what did you show him today the breadandbutter side of the colony which he didnt seem to find as boring as i always do he asked every question you could imagine about production how we balanced our budget our mineral resources the birth rate how we got our food and so on luckily i had secretary harrison with me and hed come prepared with every annual report since the colony began you should have heard them swapping statistics the inspectors borrowed the lot and im prepared to bet that when we see him tomorrow hell be able to quote any figure back at us i find that kind of mental performance frightfully depressing he yawned and began to peck haifheartedly at his food tomorrow should be more interesting were going to do the schools and the academy thats when im going to ask some questions for a change id like to know how the overlords bring up their kidsassuming of course that they have any that was not a question that charles sen was ever to have answered but on other points the inspector was remarkably talkative he would evade awkward queries in a manner that was a pleasure to behold and then quite unexpectedly would become positively confiding their first real intimacy occurred while they were driving away from the school that was one of the colonys chief prides its a great responsibility dr sen had remarked training these young minds ftr the future fortunately human beings are extraordinarily resilient it takes a pretty bad upbringing to do permanent damage even if our aims are mistaken our little victims will probably get over it and as yotive seen they appear to be perfectly happy he paused for a moment then glanced mischievously up at the towering figure of his passenger the inspector was completely clothed in some reflecting silvery cloth so that not an inch of his body was exposed to the fierce sunlight behind the dark glasses dr sen was aware of the great eyes watching him emotionlesslyor with emotions which he could never understand our problem in bringing up these children must i imagine be very similar to yours when confronted with the human race wouldnt you agree in some ways admitted the overlord gravely in others perhaps a better analogy can be found in the history of your colonial powers the roman and british empires for that reason have always been of considerable interest to us the case of india is particularly instructive the main difference between us and the british in india was that they had no real motives for going thereno conscious objectives that is except such trivial and temporary ones as trade or hostilty to other european powers they found themselves possessors of an empire before they knew what to do with it and were never really happy until they had got rid of it again and will you asked dr sen quite unable to resist the opportunity get rid of your empire when the time arises without the slightest hesitation replied the inspector dr sen did not press the point the forthrightness of the reply was not altogether flattering moreover they had now arrived at the academy where the assembled pedagogues were waiting to sharpen their wits on a real live overlord as our distinguished colleague will have told you said professor chance dean of the university of new athens our main purpose is to keep the minds of our people alert and to enable them to realize all their potentialities beyond this islandhis gesture indicated and rejected the rest of the globei fear that the human race has lost its initiative it has peace it has plentybut it has no horizons yet here of course interjected the overlord blandly professor chance who lacked a sense of humour and was vaguely aware of the fact glanced suspiciously at his visitor here he continued we do not suffer from the ancient obsession that leisure is wicked but we do not consider that it is enough to be passive receptors of entertainment everybody on this island has one ambition which may be summed up very simply it is todo something however small it may be better than anyone else of course its an ideal we dont all achieve but in this modern world the great thing isto have an ideal achieving it is considerably less important the inspector did not seem inclined to comment he had discarded his protective clothing but still wore dark glasses even in the subdued light of the common room the dean wondered if they were physiologically necessary or whether they were merely camouflage certainly they made quite impossible the already difficult task of reading the overlords thoughts he did not however seem to object to the some what challenging statements that had been thrown at him or the criticisms of his races policy with regard to earth which they implied the dean was about to press the attack when professor sperling head of the science department decided to make it a threecornered fight as you doubtless know sir one of the great problems of our culture has been the dichotomy between art and science id very much like to know your views on the matter do you subscribe to the view that all artists are abnormal that their workor at any rate the impulse behind itis the result of some deepseated psychological dissatisfaction professor chance cleared his throat purposefully but the inspector forestalled him ive been told that all men are artists to a certain extent so that everyone is capable of creating something if only on a rudimentary level at your schools yesterday for example i noticed the emphasis placed on selfexpression in drawing painting and modellingthe impulse seemed quite universal even among those clearly destined to be specialists in science so if all artists are abnormal and all men are artists we have an interesting syllogism everyone waited for him to complete it but when it suited their purpose the overlords could be impeccably tactful the inspector came through the symphony concert with flying colours which was a good deal more than could be said for many human members of the audience the only concession to popular taste bad been stravinskys symphony of psalms the rest of the programme was aggressively modernistic whatever ones views on its merits the performance was superb for the colonys boast that it possessed some of the finest musicians in the world was no idle one there had been much wrangling among the various rival composers for the honour of being included in the programme though a few cynics wondered if it would be an honour at all for all that anyone knew to the contrary the overlords might be tone deaf it was observed however that after the concert thanthalteresco sought out the three composers who had been present and complimented them all on what he called their great ingenuity this caused them to retire with pleased but vaguely baffled expressions it was not until the third day that george greggson had a chance of meeting the inspector the theatre had arranged a kind of mixed grill rather than a single dishtwo oneact plays a sketch by a worldfamous impersonator and a ballet sequence once again all these items were superbly executed and one critics predicnonnow at least well discover if the overlords can yawnwas falsified indeed the inspector laughed several times and in the correct places and yetnoone could be sure he might himself be putting on a superb act following the performance by logic alone and with his own strange emotions completely untouched as an anthropologist might take part in some primitive rite the fact that he uttered the appropriate sounds and made the expected responses really proved nothing at all though george had been determined to have a talk with the inspector he failed utterly after the performance they exchanged a few words of introduction then the visitor was swept away it was completely impossible to isolate him from his entourage and george went home in a state of extreme frustration he was by no means certain what he wished to say even if he had had the chance but somehow he felt sure he could have turned the conversation round to jeff and now the opportunity had gone his bad temper lasted two days the inspectors flyer had departed amid many protestations of mutual regard before the sequel emerged noone had thought of questioning jeff and the boy must have been thinking it over for a long time before he approached george daddy he said just prior to bedtime you know the overlord who came to see us yes replied george grimly well he came to our school and i heard him talk to some of the teachers i didnt really understand what he saidbut i think i recognized his voice thats who told me to run when the big wave came you are quite sure jeff hesitated for a moment not quitebut if it wasnt him it was another overlord i wondered if i ought to thank him but hes gone now hasnt he yes said george im afraid he has still perhaps well have another chance now go to bed like a good boy and dont worry about it any more when jeff was safely out of the way and jenny had been attended to jean came back and sat on the rug beside georges chair leaning against his legs it was a habit that struck him as annoyingly sentimental but not worth creating a fuss about he merely made his knees as nobbly as possible what do you think about it now asked jean in a tired flat voice do you believe it really happened it happened george replied but perhaps were foolish to worry after all most parents would be gratefuland of course i am grateful the explanation may be perfectly simple we know that the overlords have got interested in the colony so theyve undoubtedly been observing it with their instrumentsdespite that promise they made suppose one was just prowling round with that viewing gadget of theirs and saw the wave coming it would be natural enough to warn anyone who was in danger but he knew jeffs name dont forget that no were being watched theres something peculiar about us something that attracts their attention ive felt it ever since ruperts party its funny how that changed both our lives george looked down at her with sympathy but nothing more it was strange how much one could alter in so short a time he was fond of her she had borne his children and was part of his life but of the love which a notclearlyremembered person named george greggson had once known towards a fading dream called jean morrel how much remained his love was divided now between jeff and jennifer on the one handand carolle on the other he did not believe that jean knew about carolle and he intended to tell her before anyone else did but somehow he had never got round to it very welljeff is being watchedprotected in fact dont you think that should make us proud perhaps the overlords have planned a great future for him i wonder what it can be he was talking to reassure jean he knew he was not greatly disturbed himself only intrigued and baffled and quite suddenly another thought struck him something that should have occurred to him before his eyes turned autonatically towards the nursery i wonder if its only jeff theyre after he said in due course the inspector presented his report the islanders would have given much to see it all the statistics md records went into the insatiable memories of the great omputers which were some but not all of the unseen powers hehind karellen even before these impersonal electric minds had arrived at their conclusions however the inspector had given his own recommendations expressed in the thoughts and language of the human race they would have run as follows we need take no action regarding the colony it is an interesting experiment but cannot in any way affect the future its artistic endeavours are no concern of ours and there is no evidence that any scientific research is progressing along dangerous channels as planned i was able to see the school records of subject zero without arousing curiosity the relevant statistics are attached and it will be seen that there are still no signs of any unusual development yet as we know breakthrough seldom gives much prior warning i also met the subjects father and gathered the impression that he wished to speak to me fortunately i was able to avoid this there is no doubt that he suspects something though of course he can never guess the truth nor affect the outcome in any way i grow more and more sorry for these people george greggson would have agreed with the inspectors verdict that there was nothing unusual about jeff there was just that one baffling incident as startling as a single clap of thunder on a long calm day and after thatnothing jeff bad all the energy and inquisitiveness of any other sevenyearold he was intelligentwhen he bothered to be but was in no danger of becoming a genius sometimes jean thought a little wearily he filled to perfection the classic recipe for a small boy a noise surrounded by dirt not that it was very easy to be certain about the dirt which had to accumulate for a considerable time before it showed against jeffs normal sunburn by turns he could be affectionate or morose reserved or ebullient he showed no preference for one parent rather than the other and the arrival of his little sister had not produced any signs of jealousy his medical card was spotless he had never had a days illness in his life but in these times and in such a climate there was nothing unusual about this unlike some boys jeff did not grow quickly bored by his fathers company and desert him whenever possible for assodates of his own age it was obvious that he shared georges artistic talents and almost as soon as he was able to walk had become a regular backstage visitor to the colonys theatre indeed the theatre had adopted him as an unofficial mascot and he was now highly skilled at presenting bouquets to visiting celebrities of stage and screen yes jeff was a perfectly ordinary boy so george reassured himself as they went for walks or rides together over the islands rather restricted terrain they would talk as sons and fathers had done since the beginning of timeexcept that in this age there was so much more to talk about though jeff never left the island he could see all that he wished of the surrounding world through the ubiquitous eye of the television screen he felt like all the colonists a slight disdain for the rest of mankind they were the elite the vanguard of progress they would take mankind to the heights that the overlords had reachedand perhaps beyond not tomorrow certainly but otie day they never guessed that that day would be all too soon t dreams began six weeks later in the darkness of the subtropical night george greggson swam slowly upwards towards consciousness he did not know what had awakened him and for a moment he lay in a puzzled stupor then he realized that he was alone jean had got up and gone silently into the nursery she was talking quietly to jeff too quietly for him to hear what she was saying george heaved himself out of bed and went to join her the poppet had made such nocturnal excursions common enough but then there had been no question of his remaining asleep through the uproar this was something quite different and he wondered what had disturbed jean the only light in the nursery came from the fluoropaint patterns on the walls by their dim glow george could see jean sitting beside jeffs bed she turned as he came in and whispered dont disturb the poppet whats the matter i knew that jeff wanted me and that woke me up the very matteroffact simplicity of that statement gave george a feeling of sick apprehension i knew that jeff wanted me how did you know he wondered but all he asked was has he been having nightmares im not sure said jean he seems all right now but he was frightened when i came in i wasnt frightened mummy came a small indignant voice but it was such a strange place what was asked george tell me all about it there were mountains said jeff dreamily they were ever so high and there was no snow on them like on all the mountains ive ever seen some of them were burning you meanvolcanoes not really they were burning all over with funny blue flames and while i was watching the sun came up go onwhy have you stopped jeff turned puzzled eyes towards his father thats the other thing i dont understand daddy it came up so quickly and it was much too big andit wasnt the right colour it was such a pretty blue there was a long heartfreezing silence then george said quietly is that all yes i began to feel kind of lonely and thats when mummy came and woke me up george tousled his sons untidy hair with one hand while tightening his dressinggown around him with the other he felt suddenly very cold and very small but there was no hint of this in his voice when he spoke to jeff its just a silly dream youve eaten too much for supper forget all about it and go back to sleep theres a good boy i will daddy jeff replied he paused for a moment then added thoughtfully i think ill try and go there again a blue sun said karellen not many hours later that must have made identification fairly easy yes rashaverak answered it is undoubtedly aiphanidon the sulphur mountains confirm the fact and its interesting to notice the distortion of the time scale the planet rotates fairly slowly so he must have observed many hours in a few minutes thats all you can discover yes without questioning the child directly we dare not do that events must take their natural course without our interference when his parents approach us then perhaps we can question him they may never come to us and when they do it may be too late that i am afraid cannot be helped we should never forget this factthat in these matters our curiosity is of no importance it is no more important even than the happiness of mankind his hand reached out to break the connection continue the surveillance of course and report all results to me but do not interfere in any way yet when he was awake jeff still seemed just the same that at least thought george was something for which they could be thankful but the dread was growing in his heart to jeff it was only a game it had not yet begun to frighten him a dream was merely a dream no matter how strange it might be he was no longer lonely in the worlds that sleep opened up to him only on that first night had his mind called out to jean across whatever unknown gulfs had sundered them now he went alone and fearless into the universe that was opening up before him in the mornings they would question him and he would tell what he could remember sometimes his words stumbled and failed as he tried to describe scenes which were clearly not only beyond all his experience but beyond the imagination of man they would prompt him with new words show him pictures and colours to refresh his memory then build up what pattern they could from his replies often they could make nothing of the result though it seemed that in jefts own mind his dream worlds were perfectly plain and sharp he was simply unable to communicate them to his parents yet some were clear enough spaceno planet no surrounding landscape no world underfoot only the stars in the velvet night and hanging against them a great red sun that was beating like a heart huge and tenuous at one moment it would slowly shrink brightening at the same time as if new fuel was being fed to its internal fires it would climb the spectrum and hover at the edge of yellow and the cycle would reverse itself the star would expand and cool becoming once more a ragged flamered cloud typical pulsating variable said rashaverak eagerly seen too under tremendous timeacceleration i cant identify it precisely but the nearest star that fits the description is rhamsandron or it may be pharanidon whichever it is replied karellen hes getting further away from home much further said rashaverak it might have been earth a white sun hung in a blue sky flecked with clouds which were racing before a storm a bill sloped gently down to an ocean torn into spray by the ravening wind yet nothing moved the scene was frozen as if glimpsed in a flash of lightning and far far away on the horizon was something that was not of eartha line of misty columns tapering slightly as they soared out of the sea and lost themselves among the clouds they were spaced with perfect precision along the rim of the planettoo huge to be artificial yet too regular to be natural sideneus and the pillars of the dawn said rashaverak and there was awe in his voice he has reached the centre of the universe and he has barely begun his journey answered karellen the planet was absolutely flat its enormous gravity had long ago crushed into one uniform level the mountains of its fiery youthmountains whose mightiest peaks had never exceeded a few metres in height yet there was life here for the surface was covered with a myriad geometrical patterns that crawled and moved and changed their colour it was a world of two dimensions inhabited by beings who could be no more than a fraction of a centimetre in thickness and in its sky was such a sun as no opium eater could have imagined in his wildest dreams too hot to be white it was a searing ghost at the frontiers of the ultraviolet burning its planets with radiations which would be instantly lethal to all earthly forms of life for millions of kilometres around extended great veils of gas and dust fluorescing in countless colours as the blasts of ultraviolet tore through them it was a star against which earths pale sun would have been as feeble as a glowworm at noon hexanerax and nowhere else in the known universe said rashaverak only a handful of our ships have ever reached itand they have never risked any landings for who would have thought that life could exist on such planets it seems said karellen that you scientists have not been as thorough as you had believed if thosepatternsare intelligent the problem of communication will be interesting i wonder if they have any knowledge of the third dimension it was a world that could never know the meaning of night and day of years or seasons six coloured suns shared its sky so that there came only a change of light never darkness through the clash and tug of conflicting gravitational flelds the planet travelled along the loops and curves of its inconceivably complex orbit never retracing the same path ever moment was unique the configuration which the six suns now held in the heavens would not repeat itself this side of eternity and even here there was life though the planet might be scorched by the central fires in one age and frozen in the outer reaches in another it was yet the home of intelligence the great manyfaceted crystals stood grouped in intricate geometrical patterns motionless in the eras of cold growing slowly along the veins of mineral when the world was warm again no matter if it took a thousand years fbr them to complete a thought the universe was still young and time stretched endlessly before them i have searched all our records said rashaverak we have no knowledge of such a world or such a combination of suns if it existed inside our universe the astronomers would have detected it even if it lay behind the range of our ships then he has left the galaxy yes surely it cannot be much longer now who knows he is only dreaming when he awakes he is still the same it is merely the first phase we will know soon enough when the change begins we have met before mr greggson said the overlord gravely my name is rashaverak no doubt you remember yes said george that party of rupert boyces i am not likely to forget and i thought we should meet again tell mewhy have you asked fbr this interview i think you already know pernaps but it will help us both if you tell me in your own words it may surprise you a good deal but i also am trying to understand add in some ways my ignorance is as great as yours george stared at the overlord in astonishment lhis was a thought that had never occurred to him he had subconsciously assumed that the overlords possessed all knowledge and all powerthat they understood and were probably responsible fbr the things that had been happening to jeff i gather george continued that you have seen the reports i gave to the island psychologist so you know about the dreams yes we know about them i never believed that they were simply the imaginings of a child they were so incredible thati know this sounds ridiculousthey had to be based on some reality he looked anxiously at rashaverak not knowing whether to hope for confirmation or denial the overlord said nothing but merely regarded him with his great calm eyes they were sitting almost face to face for the roomwhich had obviously been designed for such interviewswas on two levels the overlords massive chair being a good metre lower than georges it was a friendly gesture reassuring to the men who asked for these meetings and who were seldom in an easy frame of mind we were worried but not really alarmed at first jeff seemed perfectly normal when he woke up and his dreams didnt appear to bother him and then one nighthe hesitated and glanced defensively at the overlord ive never believed in the supernatural im no scientist but i think theres a rational explanation for everything there is said rashaverak i know what you saw i was watching i always suspected it but karellen had promised that youd never spy on us with your instruments why have you broken that promise i have not broken it the supervisor said that the human race would no longer be under surveillance that is a promise we have kept i was watching your children not you it was several seconds before george understood the implications of rashaveraks words then the colour drained slowly from his face you mean he gasped his voice trailed away and he had to begin again then what in gods name are my children that said rashaverak solemnly is what we are trying to discover jennifer anne greggson lately known as the poppet lay on her back with her eyes tightly closed she had not opened them for a long time she would never open them again for sight was now as superfluous to her as to the manysensed creatures of the lightless ocean deeps she was aware of the world that surrounded her indeed she was aware of much more than that one reflex remained from her brief babyhood by some unaccountable trick of development the rattle which had once delighted her sounded incessantly now beating a complex everchanging rhythm in her cot it was that strange syncopadon which had amused jean from her sleep and sent her flying into the nursery but it was not the sound alone that had started her screaming for george it was the sight of that commonplace brightly coloured rattle beating steadily in airy isolation half a metre away from any support while jennifer anne her chubby fingers clasped tightly together lay with a smile of calm contentment on her face she had started later but she was progressing swiftly soon she would pass her brother for she had so much less to unlearn you were wise said rashaverak not to touch her toy i do not believe you could have moved it but if you had succeeded she might have been annoyed and then i do not know what would have happened do you mean said george dully that you can do nothing i will not deceive you we can study and observe as we are doing already but we cannot interfere because we cannot understand then what are we to do and why has this thing happened to us it had to happen to someone there is nothing exceptional about you any more than there is about the first neutron that starts the chain reaction in an atomic bomb it simply happens to be the first any other neutron would have servedjust as jeffrey might have been anybody in the world we call it total breakthrough there is no need for any secrecy now and i am very glad we have been waiting for this to happen ever since we caine to earth there was no way of telling when and where it would startuntil by pure chance we met at rupert boyces party theli i knew that almost certainly your wifes children would be the first butwe werent married then we hadnt even yes i know but miss morrels mind was the channel that if only for a moment let through knowledge which noone alive at that time could possess it could only come from another mind intimately linked to hers the fact that it was a mind not yet born was of no consequence for time is very much stranger than you think i begin to understand jeff knows these thingshe can see other workis and can tell where you come from and somehow jean caught his thoughts even before he was born there is far more to it than thatbut i do not nigine you will ever get much closer to the truth all through history there have been people with inexplicable powers which seemed to transcend space and time they never understood them almost without exception their attempted explanations were rubbish i should knowi have read enough of them but there is one analogy which iswell suggestive and helpful it occurs over and over again in your literature imagine that every mans mind is an island surrounded by ocean each seems isolated yet in reality all are linked by the bedrock from which they spring if the oceans were to vanish that would be the end of the islands they would all be part of one continent but their individuality would have gone telepathy as you have called it is something like this in suitable circumstances minds can merge and share each others contents and carry back memories of the experience when they are isolated once more in its highest form this power is not subject to the usual limitations of time and space that is why jean could tap the knowledge of her unborn son there was a long silence while george wrestled with these astounding thoughts the pattern was beginning to take shape it was an unbelievable pattern but it had its own inherent logic and it explainedif the word could be used fur anything so incomprehensibleall that had happened since that evening at rupert boyces home it also accounted he realized now for jeans own curiosity about the supernormal what has started this thing asked george and where is it going to lead that is something we cannot answer but there are many races in the universe and some of them discovered these powers long before your speciesor mineappeared on the scene they have been waiting for you to join them and now the time has come then where do you come into the picture probably like most men you have always regarded us as your masters that is not true we have never been more than guardians doing a duty imposed upon us fromabove that duty is hard to define perhaps you can best think of us as midwives attending a difficult birth we are helping to bring something new and wonderful into the world rashaverak hesitated for a moment it almost seemed as if he was at a loss for words yes wc are the midwives but we ourselves are barren in that instant george knew he was in the presence of a tragedy transcending his own it was incredibleand yet somehow just despite all their powers and their brilliance the overlords were trapped in some evolutionary culdesac here was a great and noble race in almost every way superior to mankind yet it had no future and it was aware of it in the face of this georges own problems seemed suddenly trivial now i know he said why you have been watching jeffrey he was the guinea pig in this experiment exactlythough the experiment was beyond our control we did not start itwe were merely trying to observe we did not interfere except when we had to yes thought georgethe tidal wave it would never do to let a valuable specimen be destroyed then he felt ashamed of himself such bitterness was unworthy ive only one more question he said what shall we do about our children enjoy them while you may answered rashaverak gently they will not be yours for long it was advice that might have been given to any parent in any age but now it contained a threat and a terror it had never held before tiiarj came the time when the world of jeffreys dreams was no longer sharply divided from his everyday existence he no longer went to school and for jean and george also the routine of life was completely broken as it was soon to break down throughout the world they avoided all their friends as if already conscious that soon noone would have sympathy to spare for them sometimes in the quietness of the night when there were few people about they would go for long walks together they were closer now than they had been since the first days of their marriage united again in the face of the still unknown tragedy that soon would overwhelm them at first it had given them a feeling of guilt to leave the sleeping children alone in the house but now they realized that jeff and jenny could look after themselves in ways beyond the knowledge of their parents and of course the overlords would be watching too that thought was reassuring they felt that they were not alone with their problem but that wise and sympathetic eyes shared their vigil jennifer slept there was no other word to describe the state she had entered to all outward appearances she was still a baby but round her now was a sense of latent power so terrifying that jean could no longer bear to enter the nursery there was no need to do so the entity that had been jennifer anne greggson was not yet fully developed but even in its sleeping chrysalis state it already had enough control of its environment to take care of all its needs jean had only once attempted to feed it without success it chose to take nourishment in its own time and in its own manner for food vanished from the freezer in a slow steady stream yet jennifer anne never moved from her cot the rattling had ceased and the discarded toy lay on the nursery floor where noone dared to touch it lest jennifer anne might need it again sometimes she caused the furniture to stir itself into peculiar patterns and it seemed to george that the fluoropaint on the wall was glowing more brilliantly than it had ever done before she gave no trouble she was beyond their assistance and beyond their love it could not last much longer and in the time that was left they clung desperately to jeff he was changing too but he still knew them the boy whose growth they had watched from the formless mists of babyhood was losing his personality dissolving hour by hour before their very eyes yet sometimes he still spoke to them as he had always done and talked of his toys and friends as if unconscious of what lay ahead but much of the time he did not see them or show any awareness of their presence he no longer slept as they were forced to do despite their overwhelming need to waste as few as possible of these last remaining hours unlike jenny he seemed to possess no abnormal powers over physical objectsperhaps because being already partly grown he had less need for them his strangeness was entirely in his mental life of which the dreams were now only a small part he would stay quite still for hours on end his eyes tightly closed as if listening to sounds which noone else could hear into his mind was flooding knowledgefrom somewhere or somewhenwhich soon would overwhelm and destroy the halfformed creature who had been jeffrey angus greggson and fey would sit watching looking up at him with tragic puzzled eyes wondering where her master had gone and when he would return to her jeff and jenny had been the first in all the world but soon they were no longer alone like an epidemic spreading swiftly from land to land the metamorphosis infected the entire human race it touched practically noone above the age of ten and practically noone below that age escaped it was the end of civilization the end of all that men had striven for since the beginning of time in the space of a few days humanity had lost its future for the heart of any race is destroyed and its will to survive is utterly broken when its children are taken from it there was no panic as there would have been a century before the world was numbed the great cities stilled and silent only the vital industries continued to function it was as though the planet was in mourning lamenting all that now could never be and then as he had done once before in a nowforgotten age karellen spoke for the last time to mankind my work here is nearly ended said karellens voice from a million radios at last after a hundred years i can tell you what it was there are many things we have had to hide from you as we hid ourselves for half our stay on earth some of you i know thought that concealment unnecessary you are accustomed to our presence you can no longer imagine how your ancestors would have reacted to us but at least you can understand the purpose of our concealment and know that we had a reason for what we did the supreme secret we kept from you was our purpose in coming to earththat purpose about which you have speculated so endlessly we could not tell you until now for the secret was not ours to reveal a century ago we came to your world and saved you from selfdestruction i do not believe that anyone would deny that factbut what that selfdestruction was you never guessed because we banned nuclear weapons and all the other deadly toys you were accumulating in your armouries the danger of physical annihilation was removed you thought that was the only danger we wanted you to believe that but it was never true the greatest danger that confronted you was of a different character altogetherand it did not concern your race alone many worlds have come to the crossroads of nuclear power have avoided disaster have gone on to build peaceful and happy civilizationsand have then been utterly destroyed by forces of which they knew nothing in the twentieth century you first began to tamper seriously with those forces that was why it became necessary to act all through that century the human race was drawing slowly nearer to the abyssnever even suspecting its existence across that abyss there is only one bridge few races unaided have ever found it some have turned back while there was still time avoiding both the danger and the achievement their worlds have become elysian islands of effortless content playing no further part in the story of the universe that would never have been your fateor your fortune your race was too vital for that it would have plunged into ruin and taken others with it for you would never have found the bridge i am afraid that almost all i have to say now must be by means of such analogies you have no words no conceptions for many of the things i wish to tell youand our own knowledge of them is also sadly imperfect to understand you must go back into the past and recover much that your ancestors would have found familiar but which you have forgottenwhich in fact we deliberately helped you to forget for all our sojourn here has been based on a vast deception a concealment of truth which you were not ready to face in the centuries before our coming your scientists uncovered the secrets of the physical world and led you from the energy of steam to the energy of the atom you had put superstition behind you science was the only real religion of mankind it was the gift of the western minority to the remainder of mankind and it had destroyed all other faiths those that still existed when we came were already dying science it was felt could explain everything there were no forces which did not come within its scope no events for which it could not ultimately account the origin of the universe might be forever unknown but all that had happened after obeyed the laws of physics yet your mystics though they were lost in their own delusions had seen part of the truth there are powers of the mind and powers beyond the mind which your science could never have brought within its framework without shattering it entirely all down the ages there have been countless reports of strange phenomenapoltergeists telepathy precognitionwhich you had named but never explained at first science ignored them even denied their existence despite the testimony of five thousand years but they exist and if it isto be complete any theory of the universe must account for them during the first half of the twentieth century a few of your scientists began to investigate these matters they did not know itbut they were tampering with the lock of pandoras box the forces they might have unleashed transcended any perils that the atom could have brought for the physicists could only have ruined the earth the paraphysicists could have spread havoc to the stars that could not be allowed i cannot explain the full nature of the threat you represented it would not have been a threat to us and therefore we do not comprehend it let us say that you might have become a telepathic cancer a malignant mentality which in its inevitable dissolution would have poisoned other and greater minds and so we camewe were sentto earth we interrupted your development on every cultural level but in particular we checked all serious work on paranormal phenomena i am well aware of the fact that we have also inhibited by the contrast between our civilizations all other forms of creative achievement as well but that was a secondary effect and it is of no importance now i must tell you something which you may find very surprising perhaps almost incredible all these potentialities all these latent powerswe do not possess them nor do we understand them our intellects are far more powerful than yours but there is something in your minds that has always eluded us ever since we came to earth we have been studying you we have learned a great deal and will learn more yet i doubt if we shall discover all the truth our races have much in commonthat is why we were chosen for this task but in other respects we represent the ends of two different evolutions our minds have reached the end of their development so in their present form have yours yet you can make the jump to the next stage and therein lies the difference between us our potentialities are exhausted but yours are still untapped they are linked in ways we do not understand with the powers i have mentioned the powers that are now awakening on your world we held the clock back we made you mark time while those powers developed until they could come flooding out into the channels that were being prepared for them what we did to improve your planet to raise your standards of living to bring justice and peacethose things we should have done in any event once we were forced to intervene in your affairs but all that vast transformation diverted you from the truth and therefore helped to serve our purpose we are your guardiansno more often you must have wondered what position my race held in the hierarchy of the universe as we are above you so there is something above us using us for its own purposes we have never discovered what it is though we have been its tool for ages and dare not disobey it again and again we have received our orders have gone to some world in the early flower of its civilization and have guided it along the road that we can never followthe road that you are travelling now again and again we have studied the process we have been sent to foster hoping that we might learn to escape from our own limitations but we have glimpsed only the vague outlines of the truth you called us the overlords not knowing the irony of that title let us say that above us is the overmind using us as the potter uses his wheel and your race is the clay that is being shaped on that wheel we believeit is only a theorythat the overmind is trying to grow to extend its powers and its awareness of the universe by now it must be the sum of many races and long ago it left the tyranny of matter behind it is conscious of intelligence everywhere when it knew that you were almost ready it sent us here to do its bidding to prepare you for the transformation that is now at hand all the earlier changes your race has known took countless ages but this is a transformation of the mind not of the body by the standards of evolution it will be cataclysmicinstantaneous it has already begun you must face this thct yours is the last generation of homo sapiens as to the nature of that change we can tell you very little we do not know how it is producedwhat trigger impulse the overmind employs when it judges that the time is ripe all we have discovered is that it starts with a single individual always a childand then spreads explosively like the formation of crystals round the first nucleus in a saturated solution adults will not be affected for their minds are already set in an unalterable mould in a few years it will all be over and the human race will have divided in twain there is no way back and no future for the world you know all the hopes and dreams of your race are ended now you have given birth to your successors and it is your tragedy that you will never understand themwill never even be able to communicate with their minds indeed they will not possess minds as you know them they will be a single entity as you yourselves are the sums of your myriad cells you will not think them human and you will be right i have told you these things so that you will know what faces you in a few hours the crisis will be upon us my task and my duty is to protect those i have been sent here to guard despite their wakening powers they could be destroyed by the multitudes around themyes even by their parents when they realize the truth i must take them away and isolate them for their protection and for yours tomorrow my ships will begin the evacuation i shall not blame you if you try to interfere but it will be useless greater powers than mine are wakening now i am only one of their instruments and thenwhat am i to do with you the survivors when your purpose has been fufilled it would be simplest perhaps and most merciful to destroy youas you yourselves would destroy a mortally wounded pet you loved but this i cannot do your future will be your own to choose in the years that are left to you it is my hope that humanity will go to its rest in peace knowing that it has not lived in vain for what you have brought into the world may be utterly alien it may share none of your desires or hopes it may look upon your greatest achievements as childish toysyet it is something wonderful and you will have created it when our race is forgotten part of yours will still exist do not therefore condemn us for what we were compelled to do and remember thiswe shall always envy you jean had wept before but she was not weeping now the island lay golden in the heartless unfeeling sunlight as the ship came slowly into sight above the twin peaks of sparta on that rocky island not long ago her son had escaped death by a miracle she now understood all too well sometimes she wondered if it might not have been better had the overlords stood aside and left him to his fate death was something she could face as she had faced it before it was in the natural order of things but this was stranger than deathand more final until this day men had died yet the race had continued there was no sound or movement from the children they stood in scattered groups along the sand showing no more interest in one another than in the homes they were leaving forever many carried babies who were too small to walkor who did not wish to assert the powers that made walking unnecessary for surely thought george if they could move inanimate matter they could move their own bodies why indeed were the overlord ships collecting them at all it was of no importance they were leaving and this was the way they chose to go then george realized what it was that had been teasing his memory somewhere long ago he had seen a centuryold newsreel of such an exodus it must have been at the beginning of the first world waror the second there had been long lines of trains crowded with clildren pulling slowly out of the threatened cities leaving behind the parents that so many of them would never see again few were crying some were puzzled clutching nervously at their small belongings but most seemed to be looking forward with eagerness to some great adventure and yetthe analogy was false history never repeated itself these who were leaving now were no longer children whatever they might be and this time there would be no reunion the ship had grounded along the waters edge sinking deeply into the soft sand in perfect unison the line of great curving panels slid upwards and the gangways extended themselves towards the beach like metal tongues the scattered unutterably lonely figures began to converge to gather into a crowd that moved precisely as a human crowd might do lonely why had he thought that wondered george for that was the one thing they could never be again only individuals can be lonelyonly human beings when the barriers were down at last loneliness would vanish as personality faded the countless raindrops would have merged into the ocean he felt jeans hand increase its pressure on his in a sudden spasm of emotion look she whispered i can see jeff by that second door it was a long way away and very hard to be certain there was a mist before his eyes which made it hard to see but it was jeffhe was sure of that george could recognize his son now as he stood with one foot already on the metal gangway and jeff turned and looked back his face was only a white blur at this distance there was no way of telling if it bore any hint of recognition any remembrance for all that he was leaving behind nor would george ever know if jeff had turned towards them by pure chanceor if he knew in those last moments while he was still their son that they stood watching him as he passed into the land that they could never enter the great doors began to close and in that moment fey lifted up her muzzle and gave a low desolate moan she turned her beautiful limpid eyes towards george and he knew that she had lost her master he had no rival now for those who were left there were many roads but only one destination there were some who said the world is still beautiful one day we must leave it but why should we hasten our departure but others who had set more store by the future than the past and had lost all that made life worth living did not wish to stay they took their leave alone or with their friends according to their nature it was thus with athens the island had been born in fire in fire it chose to die those who wished to leave did so but most remained to meet the end amid the broken fragments of their dreams noone was supposed to know when the time would be yet jean awoke in the stillness of the night and lay for a moment staring at the ghostly glimmer from the ceiling then she reached out to grasp georges hand he was a sound sleeper but this time he woke at once they did not speak fur the words that were wanted did not exist jean was no longer frightened or even sad she had come through to the calm waters and was beyond emotion now but there was one thing still to be done and she knew that there was barely time to do it still without a word george followed her through the silent house they went across the patch of moonlight that had entered through the studio roof moving as quietly as the shadows it cast until they came to the deserted nursery nothing had been changed the fluoropatterns that george had painted so carefully still glowed on the walls and the rattle that had once belonged to jennifer anne still lay where she had dropped it when her mind turned into the unknowable remoteness it inhabited now she bad left her toys behind thought george but ours go hence with us he thought of the royal children of the pharaohs whose dolls and beads had been buried with them five thousand years ago so it would be again noone else he told himsel will ever love our treasures we will take them with us and will not part with them slowly jean turned towards him and rested her head upon his shoulder he clasped his arms about her waist and the love he had once known came back to him faint yet clear like an echo from a distant range of hills it was too late now to say all that was due to her and the regrets he felt were less for his deceits than for his past indifference then jean said quietly goodbye my darling and tightened her arms about him there was no time for george i to answer but even at that final moment he felt a brief astonishment as he wondered how she knew that the moment had arrived far down in the rock the segments of uranium began to rush together seeking the union they could never achieve and the island rose to meet the dawn tiis ship of the overlords came sliding in along its glowing meteortrail through the heart of carina it had begun its mad deceleration among the outer planets but even while passing mars it had still possessed an appreciable fraction of the velocity of light slowly the immense fields surrounding the sun were absorbing its momentum while for a million kilometres behind the stray energies of the stardrive were painting the heavens with fire jan rodricks was coming home six months older to the world he had left eighty years before this time he was no longer a stowaway hidden in a secret chamber he stood behind the three pilots watching the patterns come and go on the great screen that dominated the control room the colours and shapes it showed were meaningless to himhe assumed that they were conveying information which in a vessel designed by men would have been displayed on banks of meters but sometimes the screen showed the surrounding starfields and soon he hoped it would be showing earth he was glad to be home despite the effort he had devoted to escaping from it in these few months he had grown up he had seen so much travelled so far and now was weary for his own familiar world he understood now why the overlords had sealed earth from the stars humnriity still had very far to go before it could play any part in the civilization he had glimpsed it might bethough this he refused to acceptthat mankind could never be more than an inferior species preserved in an outoftheway zoo with the overlords as keepers perhaps that was what vindarten bad meant when he gave jan that ambiguous warning just before his departure much may have happened the overlord had said in the time that has passed on your planet you may not know your world when you see it again perhaps not thought jan eighty years was a long time and though he was young and adaptable he might find it hard to understand all the changes that had come to pass but of one thing he was certainmen would want to hear his story and to know what he had glimpsed of the civilization of the overlords they had treated him well as he had assumed they would of the outward journey he had known nothing when the injection had worn off and he had emerged the ship was already entering the overlord system he had climbed out of his fantastic hidingplace and found to his relief that the oxygen set was not needed the air was thick and heavy but he could breathe without difficulty he had found himself in the ships enormous redlit hold among countless other packingcases and all the impedimenta one would expect on a liner of space or of sea it had taken him almost an hour to find his way to the control room and to introduce himself to the crew their lack of surprise had puzzled him he knew that the overlords showed few emotions but he had expected some reaction instead they simply continued with their work watching the great screen and playing with the countless keys on their control panels it was then that he knew that they were landing for from time to time the image of a planet larger at each appearancewould flash upon the screen yet there was never the slightest sense of motion or accelerationonly a perfectly constant gravity which he judged to be about a fifth of earths the immense forces that drove the ship must have been compensated with exquisite precision and then in unison the three overlords had risen from their seats and he knew that the voyage was over they did not speak to their passenger or to each other and when one of them beckoned to him to follow jan realized something that he should have thought of before there might well be noone here at this end of karellens enormously long supply line who understood a word of english they watched him gravely as the great doors opened before his eager eyes this was the supreme moment of his life now he was to be the first human being ever to look upon a world lit by another sun the only light of ngs came flooding into the ship and there before him lay the planet of the overlords what had he expected he was not sure vast buildings cities whose towers were lost among the clouds machines beyond imaginationthese would not have surprised him yet what he saw was an almost featureless plain reaching out to an unnaturally close horizon and broken only by three more of the overlords ships a few kilometres away for a moment jan felt a surge of disappointment then he shrugged his shoulders realizing that after all one would expect to find a spaceport in some such remote and uninhabited region as this it was cold though not uncomfortably so the light from the great red sun low down on the horizon was quite ample for human eyes but jan wondered how long it would be before he yearned for greens and blues then he saw that enormous waferthin crescent reaching up the sky like a great bow placed beside the sun he stared at it for a long time before he realized that his journey was not yet altogether ended that was the world of the overlords this must be its satellite merely the base from which their vessels operated they had taken him across in a ship no larger than a terrestrial airliner feeling a pygmy he had climbed up into one of the great seats to try and see something of the approaching planet through the observation windows the journey was so swift that he had time to make out few details on the expanding globe beneath even so near to home it seemed the overlords used some version of the stardrive for in a matter of minutes they were falling down through a deep cloudflecked atmosphere when the doors opened they stepped out into a vaulted chamber with a roof that must have swung swiftly shut behind them for there was no sign of any entrance overhead it was two days before jan left this building he was an unexpected consignment and they had nowhere to put him to make matters worse not one of the overlords could understand english communication was practically impossible j and jan realized bitterly that getting in touch with an alien race was not so easy as it was so often depicted in fiction sign language proved singularly unsuccessful for it depended too much on a body of gestures expressions and attitudes which the overlords and mankind did not possess in common l it would be more than frustrating thought jan if the only overlords who spoke his language were all back on earth he could only wait and hope for the best surely some scientst some expert on alien races would come and take charge of him or was he so unimportant that noone could be bothered there was no way he could get out of the building because the great doors had no visible controls when an overlord walked up to them they simply opened jan had tried the same trick had waved objects high in the air to interrupt any controlling lightbeam had tried everything he could imagine with no result at all he realized that a man from the stone age lost in a modern city building might be equally helpless once he had tried to walk out when one of the overlords left but had been gently shooed back as he was very anxious not to annoy his hosts he did not persist vindarten arrived before jan had begun to get desperate the overlord spoke very bad english much too rapidly but improved with amazing speed in a few days they were able to talk together with little trouble on any subject that did not demand a specialized vocabulary once vindarten had taken charge of him jan had no more worries he also had no opportunity of doing the things he wished for almost all his time was spent meeting overlord scientists anxious to carry out obscure tests with complicated instruments jan was very waxy of these machines and after one session with some kind of hypnotic device had a splitting headache for several hours he was perfectly willing to cooperate but was not sure if his investigators realized his limitations both mental and physical it was certainly a long time before he could convince them that he had to sleep at regular intervals between these investigations he caught momentary glimpses of the city and realized how difficultand dangerousit would be for him to travel around in it streets were practically nonexistent and there seemed to be no surface transport this was the home of creatures who could fly and who had no fear of gravity it was nothing to come without warning upon a vertiginous drop of several hundred metres or to find that the only entrance into a room was an opening high up in the wall in a hundred ways jan began to realize that the psychology of a race with wings must be fundamentally different from that of earthbound creatures it was strange to see the overlords flying like great birds among the towers of their city their pinions moving with slow powerful beats and there was a scientific problem here this was a large planetlarger than earth yet its gravity was low and jan wondered why it had so dense an atmosphere he questioned vindarten on this and discovered as he had half expected that this was not the original planet of the overlords they had evolved on a much smaller world and then conquered this one changing not only its atmosphere but even its gravity the architecture of the overlords was bleakly functional jan saw no ornaments nothing that did not serve a purpose even though that purpose was often beyond his understanding if a man from mediaval times could have seen this redlit city and the beings moving through it he would certainly have believed himself in hell even jan for all his curiosity and scientific detachment sometimes found himself on the verge of unreasoning terror the absence of a single familiar reference point can be utterly unnerving even to the coolest and clearest minds and there was much he did not understand and which vindarten could or would not attempt to explain what were those flashing lights and changing shapes the things that flickered through the air so swiftly that he could never be certain of their existence they could have been something tremendous and aweinspiringor as spectacular yet trivial as the neon signs of oldtime broadway jan also sensed that the world of the overlords was full of sounds that he could not hear occasionally he caught complex rhythmical patterns racing up and down through the audible spectrum to vanish at the upper or lower edge of hearing vindarten did not seem to understand what jan meant by music so he was never able to solve this problem to his satisfaction the city was not very large it was certainly far smaller then london or new york had been at their heyday according to vindarten there were several thousand such cities scattered over the planet each one designed for some specific purpose on earth the closest parallel to this place would have been a university townexcept that the degree of specialization had gone much further this entire city was devoted jan soon discovered to the study of alien cultures in one of their first trips outside the bare cell in which jan lived vindarten had taken him to the museum it had given jan a much needed psychological boost to find himself in a place whose purpose he could fully understand apart from the scale upon which it was built this museum might well have been on earth they had taken a long time to reach it falling steadily on a great platform that moved like a piston in a vertical cylinder of unknown length there were no visible controls and the sense of acceleration at the beginning and ending of the descent was quite noticeable presumably the overlords did not waste their compensating field devices for domestic uses jan wondered if the whole interior of this world was riddled with excavations and why had they limited the size of the city going underground instead of outwards that was just another of the enigmas he never solved one could have spent a lifetime exploring these colossal chambers here was the loot of planets the achievements of more civilizations than jan could guess but there was no time to see much vindarten placed him carefully on a strip of flooring that at first sight seemed an ornamental pattern then jan remembered that there were no ornaments here and at the same time something invisible grasped him gently and hurried him forward he was moving past the great display cases past vistas of unimaginable worlds at a speed of twenty or thirty kiometres an hour the overlords had solved the problem of museum fatigue there was no need for anyone to walk they must have travelled several kilometres before jans guide grasped him again and with a surge of his great wings lifted him away from whatever force was propelling them before them stretched a huge halfempty hail flooded with a familiar light that jan had not seen since leavng earth it was flint so that it would not pain the sensitive eyes of the overlords but it was unmistakably sunlight jan would never have believed that anything so simple or so commonplace could have evoked such yearning in his heart so this was the exhibit for earth they walked for a few metres past a beautiful model of paris past arttreasures from a dozen centuries grouped incongruously together past modem calculating machines and paleolithic axes past television receivers and hero of alexandras steamturbine a great doorway opened ahead of them and they were in the office of the curator for earth was he seeing a human being for the first time jan wondered had he ever been to earth or was it just another of the many planets in his charge of whose exact location he was not precisely sure certainly he neither spoke nor understood english and vindarten had to act as interpreter jan had spent several hours here talking into a recording device while the overlords presented various terrestrial objects to him many of these he discovered to his shame he could not identify his ignorance of his own race and its achievements was enormous he wondered if the overlords for all their superb mental gifts could really grasp the complete pattern of human culture vindarten took him out of the museum by a different route once again they floated effortlessly through great vaulted corridors but this time they were moving past the creations of nature not of conscious mind sullivan thought jan would have given his life to be here to see what wonders evolution had wrought on a hundred worlds but sullivan he remembered was probably already dead then without any warning they were on a galleiy high above a large circular chamber perhaps a hundred metres across as usual there was no protective parapet and for a moment jan hesitated to go near the edge but vindarten was standing on the very brink looking calmly downwards so jan moved cautiously forward to join him the floor was only twenty metres belowfar far too dose afterwards jan was sure that his guide had not intended to surprise him and was completely taken aback by his reaction for he had given one tremendous yell and jumped backwards frзm the gallerys edge in an involuntary effort to hide what lay below it was not until the muffled echoes of his shout had died away in the thick atmosphere that he steeled himself to go forward again it was lifeless of coursenot as he had thought in that first moment of panic consciously staring up at him it filled almost all that great circular space and the ruby light gleamed and shifted in its crystal depths it was a single giant eye why did you make that noise asked vindarten i was frightened jan confessed sheepishly but why surely you did not imagine that there could be any danger here jan wondered if he could explain what a reflex action was but decided not to attempt it anything completely unexpected is frightening until a novel situation is analysed it is safest to assume the worst his heart was still pounding violently as he stared down once more at that monstrous eye of course it might have been a model enormously enlarged as were microbes and insects in terrestrial museums yet even as he asked the question jan knew with a sickening certainty that it was no larger than life vindarten could tell him little this was not his field of knowledge and he was not particularly curious from the overlords description jan built up a picture of a cyclopean beast living among the asteroidal rubble of some distant sun its growth uninhibited by gravity depending for food and life upon the range and resolving power of its single eye there seemed no limit to what nature could do if she was pressed and jan felt an irrational pleasure at discovering something which the overlords would not attempt they had brought a fullsized whale from earthbut they had drawn the line at this and there was the time when he had gone up endlessly up until the walls of the elevator had faded through opalescence into a crystal transparency he was standing it seemed unsupported among the uppermost peaks of the city with nothing to protect him from the abyss but he felt no more vertigo than one does in an aeroplane for there was no sense of contact with the distant ground he was above the clouds sharing the sky with a few pinnacles of metal or stone a rosered sea the cloudlayer rolled sluggishly beneath him there were two pale and tiny moons in the sky not far from the sombre sun near the centre of that bloated red disc was a small dark shadow perfectly circular it might have been a sunspot or another moon in transit jan slowly moved his gaze along the horizon the cloudcover extended clear to the edge of this enormous world but in one direction at an unguessable distance there was a mottled patch that might have marked the towers of another city he stared at it for a long while then continued his careful survey when he had turned halfcircle he saw the mountain it was not on the horizon but beyond ita single serrated peak climbing up over the edge of the world its lower slopes hidden as the bulk of an iceberg is concealed below the waterline he tried to guess its size and failed completely even on a world with gravity as low as this it seemed hard to believe that such mountains could exist did the overlords he wondered sport themselves upon its slopes and sweep like eagles around those immense buttresses and then slowly the mountain began to change when he saw it first it was a dull and almost sinister red with a few faint markings near its crown that he could not dearly distinguish he was trying to focus on them when he realized that they were moving at first he could not believe his eyes then he forced himself to remember that all his preconceived ideas were worthless here he must not let his mind reject any message his senses brought into the hidden chamber of the brain he must not try to understandonly to observe understanding would come later or not at all the mountainhe still thought of it as such for there was no other word that could serveseemed to be alive he remembered that monstrous eye in its buried vaultbut no that was inconceivable it was not organic life that he was watching it was not even be suspected matter as he knew it the sombre red was brightening to an angrier hue streaks of vivid yellow appeared so that for a moment jan felt he was looking at a volcano pouring streams of lava down on to the land beneath but these streams as he could tell by occasional flecks and mottlings were moving upwards now something else was rising out of the ruby clouds around the mountains base it was a huge ring perfectly horizontal and perfectly circularand it was the colour of all that jan had left so far behind for the skies of earth had held no lovelier blue nowhere else on the world of the overlords had he seen such hues and his throat contracted with the longing and the loneliness they evoked the ring was expanding as it climbed it was higher than the mountain now and its nearer arc was sweeping swiftly towards him surely thought jan it must be a vortex of some kinda smokering already many kilometres across but it showed none of the rotation he expected and it seemed to grow no less solid as its size increased its shadow rushed past long before the ring itself had swept majestically overhead still rising into space he watched until it had dwindled to a thin thread of blue hard for the eye to focus upon in the surrounding redness of the sky when it vanished at last it must already have been many thousands of kilometres across and it was still growing he looked back at the mountain it was golden now and devoid of all markings perhaps it was imaginationhe could believe anything by this timebut it seemed taller and narrower and appeared to be spinning like the funnel of a cyclone not until then still numbed and with his powers of reason almost in abeyance did he remember his camera he raised it to eyelevel and sighted towards that impossible mindshaking enigma vindarten moved swiftly into his line of vision with implacable firmness the great hands covered the lens turret and forced him to lower the camera jan did not attempt to resist it would have been useless of course but he felt a sudden deathly fear of that thing out there at the edge of the world and wanted no further part of it there was nothing else in all his travels that they would not let him photograph and vindarten gave no explanations instead he spent much time getting jan to describe in minute detail what he had witnessed it was then that jan realized that vindartens eyes had seen something totally different and it was then that he guessed fur the first time that the overlords had masters too now he was coming home and all the wonder the fear and the mystery were far behind it was the same ship he believed though surely not the same crew however long their lives it was hard to believe that the overlords would willingly cut themselves off from their home for all the decades consumed on an interstellar voyage the relativity timedilation effect worked both ways of course the overlords would age only four months on the round trip but when they returned their friends would be eighty years older had he wished jan could doubtless have stayed here for the remainder of his life but vindarten had warned him that there would be no other ship going to earth for several years and had advised him to take this opportunity perhaps the overlords realized that even in this relatively short time his mind had nearly reached the end of its resources or he might merely have become a nuisance and they could spare no more time for him it was of no importanct now for earth was there ahead he had seen it thus a hundred times before but always through the remote mechanical eye of the television camera now at last he himself was out here in space as the final act of his dream unfolded itself and earth spun beneath on its eternal orbit the great bluegreen crescent was in its first quarter more than half the visible disc was still in darkness there was little clouda few bands scattered along the line of the trade winds the arctic cap glittered brilliantly but was far outshone by the dazzling reflection of the sun in the north pacific one might have thought it was a world of water this hemisphere was almost devoid of land the only continent visible was australia a darker mist in the atmospehric haze along the limb of the planet the ship was driving into earths great cone of shadow the gleaming crescent dwindled shrank to a burning bow of fire and winked out of existence below was darkness and night the world was sleeping it was thea that jan realized what was wrong there was land down therebut where were the gleaming necklaces of light where were the glittering coruscations that had been the cities of man in all that shadowy hemisphere there was no single spark to drive back the night gone without a trace were the millions of kilowatts that once had been splashed carelessly towards the stars he might have been looking down on earth as it had been before the coming of man this was not the homecoming he had expected there was nothing he could do but watch while the fear of the unknown grew within him something had happenedsomething tinimsginabie and yet the ship was descending purposefully in a long curve that was taking it again over the sunlit hemisphere he saw nothing of the actual landing for the picture of earth suddenly winked out and was replaced by that meaning less pattern of lines and lights when vision was restored they were on the ground there were great buildings in the distance machines moving about and a group of overlords watching them somewhere there was the muffled roar of air as the ship equalized pressure then the sound of great doors opening he did not wait the silent giants watched him with tolerance or indifference as he ran from the control room he was home seeing once more by the sparkling light of his own familiar sun breathing the air that had first washed through his lungs the gangway was already down but he had to wait for a moment until the glare outside no longer blinded him karellen was standing a little apart from his companions beside a great transport vehicle loaded with crates jan did not stop to wonder how he recognized the supervisor nor was he surprised to see him completely unchanged that was almost the only thing that had turned out as he had expected i have been waiting for you said karellen w the early days said karellen it was safe for us to go among them but they no longer needed us our work was done when we had gathered them together and given them a continent of their own watch the wall in front of jan disappeared instead he was looking down from a height of a few hundred metres on to a pleasantly wooded country the illusion was so perfect that he fought a momentary giddiness this is five years later when the second phase had begun there were figures moving below and the camera swooped down upon them like a bird of prey this will distress you said karellen but remember that your standards no longer apply you are not watching human children yet that was the immediate impression that came to jans mind and no amount of logic could dispel it they might have been savages engaged in some complex ritual dance they were naked and filthy with matted hair obscuring their eyes as faras jan could tell they were of all ages from five to fifteen yet they all moved with the same speed precision and complete indifference to their surroundings then jan saw their faces he swallowed hard and forced himself not to turn away they were emptier than the faces of the dead for even a corpse has some record carved by times chisel upon its features to speak when the lips themselves are dumb there was no more emotion or feeling here than in the face of a snake or an insect the overlords themselves were more human than this you are searching for something that is no longer there said karellen rememberthey have no more identity than the cells in your own body but linked together they are something much greater than you why do they keep moving like this we called it the long dance replied karellen they never sleep you know and this lasted almost a year three hundred million of them moving in a controlled pattern over a whole continent weve analysed that pattern endlessly but it means nothing perhaps because we can see only the physical part of itthe small portion thats here on earth possibly what we have called the overmind is still training them moulding them into one unit before it can wholly absorb them into its being but how did they manage about food and what happened if they hit obstructions like trees or cliffs or water water made no difference they could not drown when they encountered obstacles they sometimes damaged themselves but they never noticed it as for foodwell there was all the fruit and game they required but now they have left that need behind like so many others for food is largely a source of energy and they have learned to tap greater sources the scene flickered as if a heat haze had passed over it when it cleared the movement below had ceased watch again said karellen it is three years later the little figures so helpless and pathetic if one did no know the truth stood motionless in forest and glade and plaint the camera roamed restlessly from one to the other already thought jan their faces were merging into a common mould he had once seen some photographs made by the superposition of dozens of prints to give one average face the result had been as empty as void of character as this they seemed to be sleeping or entranced then eyes were tightly closed and they showed no more awareness of their surroundings than did the trees under which they stood what thoughts jan wolidered were echoing through the intricate network in which their minds were now no moreand yet no lessthan the separate threads of some great tapestry and a tapestry he now realized that covered many worlds and many racesand was growing still it happened with a swiftness that dazzled the eye and stunned the brain at one moment jan was looking down upon a beautiful fertile country with nothing strange about it save the countless small statues scatteredyet not randomly over its length and breadth and then in an instant all the trees and grass all the living creatures that had inhabited this land flickered out of existence and were gone there were left only the still lakes the winding rivers the rolling brown hills now stripped of their green carpetand the silent indifferent figures who had wrought all this destruction why did they do it gasped jan perhaps the presence of other minds disturbed them even the rudimentary minds of plants and animals one day we believe they may find the material world equally distracting and then who knows what will happen now you understand why we withdrew when we had done our duty we are still trying to study them but we never enter their land or even send our instruments there all we dare do is to observe from space that was many years ago said jan what has happened since very little they have never moved in all that time and take no notice of day or night summer or winter they are still testing their powers some rivers have changed their courses and there is one that flows uphill but they have done nothing that seems to have any purpose and they have ignored you completely yes though that is not surprising theentityof which they are part knows all about us it does not seem to care if we attempt to study it when it wishes us to leave or has a new task fbr us elsewhere it will make its desires very obvious until then we will remain here so that our scientists can gather what knowledge they may so this thought jan with a resignation that lay beyond all sadness was the end of man it was an end that no prophet had ever foreseenan end that repudiated optimism and pessimism alike yet it was fitting it had the sublime inevitability of a great work of art jan had glimpsed the universe in all its awful immensity and knew now that it was no place for man he realized at last how vain in the ultimate analysis had been the dream that had lured him to the stars for the road to the stars was a road that forked in two directions and neither led to a goal that took any account of human hopes or fears at the end of one path were the overlords they had preserved their individually their independent egos they possessed selfawareness and the pronoun i had a meaning in their language they had emotions some at least of which were shared by humanity but they were trapped jan realized now in a culdesac from which they could never escape their minds were tenperhaps a hundredtimes as powerful as mens it made no difference in the final reckoning they were equally helpless equally overwhelmed by the unimaginable complexity of a galaxy of a hundred thousand million suns and a cosmos of a hundred thousand million galaxies and at the end of the other path there lay the overmind whatever it might be bearing the same relation to man as man bore to amcrba potentially infinite beyond mortality how long had it been absorbing race after race as it spread across the stars did it too have desires did it have goals it sensed dimly yet might never attain now it had drawn into its being all that the human race had ever achieved this was not tragedy but fulfilment the billions of transient sparks of consciousness that had made up humanity would flicker no more like flreffies against the night but they had not lived utterly in vain the last act jan knew had still to come it might occur tomorrow or it might be centuries hence even the overlords could not be certain he understood their purpose now what they had done with man and why they still lingered upon earth towards them he felt a grcat humility as well as admiration for the inflexible patience that had kept them waiting here so long he never learned the full story of the strange symbiosis between the overmind and its servants according to rasha verak there had never been a time in lus rac s history when the overmind was not there though it had made no use of them until they had achieved a scientific civilization and could range through space to do its bidding but why does it need you queried jan with all its tremendous powers surely it could do anything it pleased no said rashaverak it has limits in the past we know it has attempted to act directly upon the minds of other races and to influence their cultural development its always failed perhaps because the pull is too great we are the interpretersthe guardians or to use one of your own metaphors we till the field until the crop is ripe the overmind collects the harvestand we move on to another task this is the fifth race whose apotheosis we have watched each time we learn a little more and do you not resent being used as a tool by the overmind the arrangement has some advantages besides noone of intelligence resents the inevitable that proposition jan reflected wryly had never been fully accepted by mankind there were things beyond logic that the overlords had never understood it seems strange said jan that the overmind chose you to do its work if you have no trace of the paraphysical powers latent in mankind how does it communicate with you and make its wishes known that is one question i cannot answerand i cannot tell you the reason why i must keep the facts from you one day perhaps you will know some of the truth jan puzzled over this for a moment but knew it was useless to follow this line of inquiry he would have to change the subject and hope to pick up clues later tell me this then he said this is something else youve never explained when your race first came to earth back in the distant past what went wrong why had you become the symbol of fear and evil to us rashaverak smiled he did not do this as well as karellen could but it was a fair imitation noone ever guessed and you see now why we could never ell you there was only one event that could have made such an impact upon humanity and that event was not at the dawn of history but at its very end what do you mean asked jan when our ships entered your skies a centmy and a half ago that was the first meeting of our two races though of course we had studied you from a distance and yet you feared and recognized us as we knew that you would it was not precisely a memory you have already had proof that time is more complex than your science ever imagined for that memory was not of the past but of thefutureof those dosing years when your race knew that everything was finished we did what we could but it was not an easy end and because we were there we became identified with your races death yes even while it was still ten thousand years in the future it was as if a distorted echo had reverberated round the closed cirde of time from the future to the past call it not a memory but a premonition the idea was hard to grasp and for a moment jan wrestled with it in silence yt he should have been prepared he had already received proof enough that cause and event could reverse their normal sequence there must be such a thing as racial memory and that memmy was somehow independent of time to it the future and the past were one lhat was why thousands of years ago men hadalreadyglimpsedadistortedimageoftheoverlordsthrough a mist of fear and terror now i understand said the last man the last man jan found it very hard to think of himself as that when he had gone into space he had accepted the possibility of eternal exile from the human race and loneliness had not yet come upon him as the years passed the longing to see another human being might rise and overwhelm him but for the present the company of the overlords prevented him from feeling utterly alone there had been men on earth as little as ten years ago but they had been degenerate survivors and jan had lost nothing by missing them for reasons which the overlords could not explain but which jan suspected were largely psychological there had been no children to replace those who had gone homo sapiens was extinct perhaps lost in one of the stillintact cities was the manuscript of some laterday gibbon recording the last days of the human race if so jan was not sure that he would care to read it rashaverak had told him all that he wished to know those who had not destroyed themselves had sought oblivion in ever more feverish activities in fierce and suicidal sports that were often indistinguishable from minor wars as the population had swiftly fallen the ageing survivors had clustered together a defeated army closing its ranks as it made its last retreat that final act before the curtain came down for ever must have been lit by flashes of heroism and devotion darkened by savagery and selfishness whether it had ended in despair or resignation jan would never know there was plenty to occupy his mind the overlords base was about a kilometre from a deserted villa and jan spent months fitting this out with equipment he had taken from the nearest town some thirty kilometres distant he had flown there with rashaverak whose friendship he suspected was not completely altruistic the overlord psychologist was still studying the last specimen of homo sapiens the town must have been evacuated before the end for the houses and even many of the public services were still in good order it would have taken little work to restart the generators so that the wide streets glowed once more with the illusion of life jan toyed with the idea then abandoned it as too morbid the one thing he did not wish to do was to brood upon the past there was everything here that he needed to maintain himself for the rest of his life but what he wanted most was an electronic piano and certain bach transcriptions he had never had as much time for music as he would have liked and now he would make up for it when he was not performing himself he played tapes of the great symphonies and concertos so that the villa was never silent music had become his talisman against the loneliness which one day must surely overwhelm him often he would go for long walks on the hills thinking of all that had happened in the few months since he had last seen earth he had never thought when he said goodbye to suffivan eighty terrestrial years ago that the last generation of mankind was already in the womb what a young fool he had been yet he was not sure that he regretted his action had he stayed on earth he would have witnessed those dosing years over which time had now drawn a veil instead he had leapfrogged past them into the future and had learned the answers to questions that no other man would ever know his curiosity was almost satisfied but sometimes he wondered why the overlords were waiting and what would happen when their patience was at last rewarded but most of the time with a contented resignation that comes normally to a man only at the end of a long and busy life he sat before the keyboard and filled the air with his beloved bach perhaps he was deceiving himself perhaps this was some merciful trick of the mind but now it seemed to jan that this was what he had always wished to do his secret ambition had at last dared to emerge into the full light of consciousness jan had always been a good pianistand now he was the finest in the world it was rashaverak who brought him the news but he had already guessed it in the small hours of the morning a nightmare had awakened him and he had not been able to regain sleep he could not remember the dream which was very strange for he believed that all dreams could be recalled if one tried hard enough immediately after waking all he could remember of this was that he had been a small boy again on a vast and empty piain listening to a great voice calling in an unknown language the dream had disturbed him he wondered if it was the first onslaught of loneliness upon his mind restlessly he walked out of the villa on to the neglected lawn a full moon bathed the scene with a golden light so brilliant that he could see perfectly the immense gleaming cylinder of karellens ship lay beyond the buildings of the overlord base towering above them and reducing them to manmade proportions jan looked at the ship trying to recall the emotions it had once roused in him there was a time when it had been an unattainable goal a symbol of all that he had never really expected to achieve and now it meant nothing how quiet and still it wail the overlords of course would be as active as ever but for the moment there was no sign of them he might have been alone on earthas indeed in a very real sense he was he glanced up at the moon seeking some familiar sight on which his thoughts could rest there were the ancient wellremembered seas he had been forty lightyears into space yet he had never walked on those silent dusty plains less than two lightseconds away for a moment he amused himself trying to locate the crater tycho when he did discover it he was puzzled to find that gleaming speck further from the centre line of the disc than he had thought and it was then that he realized that the dark oval of the mare crisium was missing altogether the face that her satellite now turned towards the earth was not the one that had looked down on the world since the dawn of life the moon had begun to turn upon its axis that could mean only one thing on the other side of the earth in the land that they had stripped so suddenly of life they were emerging from their long trance as a waking child may stretch its arms to greet the day they too were flexing their muscles and playing with their newfound powers you have guessed correctly said rashaverak it is no longer safe for us to stay they may ignore us still but we cannot take the risk we leave as soon as our equipment can be loadedprobably in two or three hours he looked up at the sky as if afraid that some new miracle was about to blaze forth but all was peaceful the moon had set and only a few clouds rode high upon the west wind it does not matter greatly if they tamper with the moon rashaverak added but suppose they begin to interfere with the sun we shall leave instruments behind of course so that we can learn what happens i shall stay said jan abruptly i have seen enough of the universe theres only one thing im curious about now and that is the fate of my own planet very gently the ground trembled underfoot i was expecting that jan continued if they alter the moolis spin the angular momentum must go somewhere so the earth is slowing down i dont know which puzzles me morehow they are doing it or why they are still playing said rashaverak what logic is there in the actions of a child and in many ways the entity thatyourracehasbecomeisstillachild itisnotyetreadyto unite with the overmind but very soon it will be and then you will have the earth to your own he did not complete the sentence and jan finished it for him if of course the earth still exists you realize that dangerand yet you will stay yes i have been home fiveor is it sixyears now whatever happens ill have no complaints we were hoping began rashaverak slowly that you would wish to stay there is something that you can do for us the glareof the stardrive dwindled and died somewhere out there beyond the orbit of mars along that road thought jan he alone had travelled out of all the billions of human beings who had lived and died on earth and noone would ever travel it again the world was his everything he neededall the material possessions anyone could ever desirewere his for the taking but he was no longer interested he feared neither the loneliness of the deserted planet nor the presence that still rested here in the last moments before it went to seek its unknown heritage in the inconceivable backwash of that departure jan did not expect that he and his problems would long survive that was well he had done all that hehad wished to do and to drag out a pointless life on this empty world would hive been unbearable anticlimax he could have left with the overlords but for what purpose for he knew as noone else had ever known that karellen spoke the truth when he had said the stars are not for man he turned his back upon the night and walked through the vast entrance of the overlord base its size affected him not in the least sheer immensity no longer had any power over his mind the lights were burning redly driven by energies that could feed them for ages yet on either side lay machines whose secrets he would never know abandoned by the overlords in their retreat he went past them and clambered awkwardly up the great steps until he had reached the control room the spirit of the overlords still lingered here their machines were still alive doing the bidding of their now firdistant masters what could he add wondered jan to the information they were already hurling into space he climbed into the great chair and made himself as comfortable as he could the microphone already alive was waiting for him something that was the equivalent of a tv camera must be watching but he could not locate it beyond the desk and its meaningless instrument panels the wide windows looked out into the starry night across a valley sleeping beneath a gibbous moon and to the distant range of mountains a river wound along the valley glittering here and there as the moonlight struck upon some patch of troubled water it was all so peaceful it might have been thus at mans birth as it was now at his ending out there across unknown millions of kilometres of space karellen would be waiting it was strange to think that the ship of the overlords was racing away from earth almost as swiftly as his signal could speed after it almostbut not quite it would be a long chase but his words would catch the supervisor and he would have repaid the debt he owed how much of this jan wondered had karellen planned and how much was masterful improvisation had the supervisor deliberately let him escape into space almost a century ago so that he could return to play the role he was flulfihling now no that seemed too fantastic but jan was certain now that karellen was involved in some vast and complicated plot even while he served it he was studying the overmind with all the instruments at his command jan suspected that it was not only scientific curiosity that inspired the supervisor perhaps the overlords had dreams of one day escaping from their peculiar bondage when they had learned enough about the powers they served that jan could add to that knowledge by what he was now doing seemed hard to believe tell us what you see rashaverak had said the picture that reaches your eyes will be duplicated by our cameras but the message that enters your brain may be very different and it could tell us a great deal well he would do his best still nothing to report he began a few minute ago i saw the trail of your ship disappear in the sky ihe moon is just past full and almost half its familiar side has now turned away from earthbut i suppose you already know that jan paused feeling slightly foolish there was something incongruous even faintly absurd about what he was doing here was the climax of all history yet he might have been a radiocommentator at a racetrack or a boxingring then he shrugged his shoulders and put the thought aside at all moments of greatness he suspected bathos had never been very far awayand certain he alone could sense its presence here there have been three slight quakes in the last hour he continued their control of earths spin must be marvellous but not quite perfect you know karellen im going to find it very hard to say anything your instruments havent already told you it might have helped if youd given me some idea of what to expect and warned me how long i may have to wait if nothing happens ill report again in six hours as we arranged hello they must have been waiting for you to leave somethings starting to happen the stars are becoming dimmer its as if a great doud is coming up very swiftly over all the sky but it isnt really a doud it seems to have some sort of structurei can glimpse a hazy network of lines and bands that keep changing their positions its almost as if the stars are tangled in a ghostly spiders web the whole network is beginning to glowto pulse with light exactly as if it were alive and i suppose it is or is it something as much beyond life as that is above the inorganic world the glow seems to be shifting to one part of the skywait a minute while i move round to the other window yesi might have guessed theres a great burning column like a tree of fire reaching above the western horizon its a long way off right round the world i know where it springs from theyre on their way at last to become part of the overmind their probation is ended theyre leaving the last remnants of matter behind as that fire spreads upwards from the earth i can see the network becoming firmer and less misty in places it seems almost solidyet the stars are still shining faintly through it ive just realized its not exactly the same but the thing i saw shooting up above your world karellen was very much like this was that part of the overmind i suppose you hid the truth from me so that i would have no preconceived ideas so that id be an unbiased observer i wish i knew what your cameras were showing you now to compare it with what my mind imagines im seeing is this how it talks to you karellen in colours and shapes like these ive remembered the control screens on your ship and the patterns that went across them speaking to you in some visual language which your eyes could read now it looks exactly like the curtains of the aurora dancing and flickering across the stars why thats what it really is im surea great auroral storm the whole landscape is lit upits brighter than dayreds and golds and greens are chasing each other across the skyoh its beyond words it doesnt seem fair that im the only one to see iti never thought such colours the storms dying down but the great misty network is still there i think that aurora was only a byproduct of whatever energies are being released up there on the frontier of space just a minute ive noticed something else my weight decreasing what does that mean ive dropped a pencilits falling slowly somethings happened to gravitytheres a great wind coming upi can see the trees tossing their branches down there in the valley of coursethe atmospheres escaping sticks and stones are rising into the sky almost as if the earth itself is trying to follow them out into space theres a great cloud of dust whipped up by the gale its becoming hard to see perhaps it will dear in a moment yesthats better everything movable has been stripped awaythe dust clouds have vanished i wonder how long this building will stand and its getting hard to breathei must try and talk more slowly i can see clearly again that great burning column is still there but its constricting narrowingit looks like the funnel of a tornado about to retract into the clouds andoh this is hard to describe but just then i felt a great wave of emotion sweep over me it wasnt joy or sorrow it was a sense of fulfilment achievement did i imagine it or did it come from outside i dont know and nowthis cant be all imaginationthe world feels empty utterly empty its like listening to a radio set thats suddenly gone dead and the sky is dear againthe misty web has gone what world will it go to next karellen and will you be there to serve it still strange everything around me is unaltered i dont know why but somehow id thought that jan stopped for a moment he struggled for words then closed his eyes in an effort to regain control there was no room for fear or panic now he had a duty to performa duty to man and a duty to karellen slowly at first like a man awaking from a dream he began to speak the buildings round methe groundthe mountainseverythings like glassi can see through it earths dissolving my weight has almost gone you were righttheyve finished playing with their toys its only a few seconds away there go the mountains like wisps of smoke goodbye karellen rashaveraki am sorry f you though i cannot understand it ive seen what my race became everything we ever achieved has gone up there into the stars perhaps thats what the old religions were trying to say but they got it all wrong they thought mankind was so important yet were only one race indoyou know how many yet now weve become something that you could never be there goes the river no change in the sky though i can hardly breathe strange to see the moon still shining up there im glad they left it but it will be lonely now the light from beneath meinside the earthshining upward through the rocks the ground everythinggrowing brighter brighter blinding in a soundless concussion of light earths core gave up its hoarded energies for a little while the gravitational waves crossed and recrossed the solar system distubing ever so slightly the orbits of the planets then the suits remaining children pursued their ancient paths once more as corks floattngon a placid lake ride out the tiny ripples set in motion by a falling stone there was nothing left of earth they had teethed away the last atoms of its substance it had nourished them through the fierce moments of their inconceivable meta norphosis as the food stored in a grain of wheat feeds the nfant plant while it climbs towards the sun six thousand million kilometres beyond the orbit of pluto karellen sat before a suddenly darkened screen the record was complete the mission ended he was homeward bound br the world he had left so long ago the weight of centuries was upon him and a sadness that no logic could dispel he lid not mourn for man his sorrow was for his own race forever barred from greatness by forces it could not overcome for all their achievements thought karellen for all their mastery of the physical universe his people were no better than a tribe that had passed its whole existence upon some flat and dusty plain far off were the mountains where power and beauty dwelt where the thunder sported above the glaciers and the air was clear and keen there the sun still walked transfiguring the peaks with glory when all the land below was wrapped in darkness and they could only watch and wonder they could never scale those heights yet karellen knew they would hold fast until the end they would await without despair whatever destiny was theirs they would serve the overmind because they had no choice but even in that service they would not lose their souls the great control screen flared for a moment with sombre ruby light without conscious effort karellen read the message of its changing patterns the ship was leaving the frontiers of the solar system the energies that powered the stardrive were ebbing fast but they had done their work karellen raised his hand and the picture changed once more a single brilliant star glowed in the centre of the screen noone could have told from this distance that the sun had ever possessed planets or that one of them had now been lost for a long time karellen stared back across that swiftly widening gulf while many memories raced through his vast and labyrinthiric mind in silent farewell he saluted the men he had known whether they had hindered or helped him ta his purpose noone dared disturb him or interrupt his thoughts and presently he turned his back upon the dwindling sun
