chapter one an escape and a murder jenny logan was enjoying an afternoon of warm scottish sunshine on the beach at portobello five kilometres from the centre of edinburgh when her phone rang logan grant here madam its my day off grant said logan i know im sorry said grant but ronnie campbell the murderer has escaped from prison ok said logan ill meet you in my office in about fifteen minutes she put on jeans and a tshirt over her swimsuit and walked quickly to her car jenny logan was an inspector in the edinburgh police during the tenminute drive from portobello to the london road police station she thought about ronnie campbell she knew that he had gone to prison for murdering a man called craig sinclair that was about seven years ago just after she had joined the police but she couldnt remember anything else sergeant grant was waiting for logan in her office he was fiftynine but looked younger his hair was thick and black and he had a large black moustache he was holding some papers with police record ronnie campbell written on the front tell me whats happening said logan putting her beach bag in a cupboard under the window campbell escaped from a prison van near dundee some time this morning said grant they were moving him down to saughton saughton was a prison in the western part of edinburgh campbell escaped at a petrol station and got away we found out later hed stolen a car a dark blue audi what have you done so far asked logan weve told the newspapers the radio and the tv stations weve given them the car number and described what campbell was wearing logan said nothing and thought for a moment is he dangerous do you think she asked grant possibly said grant putting campbells police record on logans desk and pointing to it he opened his mouth to say something else but just then the phone rang grant answered it he listened said ok twice and then put the phone down he looked at logan someones found a young womans body in holyrood park were wanted over there immediately today was my day off said logan not any longer said grant a few minutes later logan with grant beside her in the car entered holyrood park holyrood park is one of the most beautiful places in edinburgh inside the park is arthurs seat the tall hill that stands over all of edinburgh there are also lakes and fields what other capital city in the world has such a large area of wild green and open land so close to its centre edinburgh people know it well and love it tourists do not often go there as she drove past the palace of holyroodhouse the queens palace in scotland logan remembered that in the middle of the sixteenth century there had been a very bloody murder inside the palace itself she asked herself what they would find as she reached the group of police cars logan parked her car on the grass at the side of the road behind the last police car she got out and looked up at arthurs seat the sky was blue and it was still warm but logan began to feel cold at the unfairness of a young womans early death there was a group of people almost all men standing about a hundred metres away on the hillside logan and grant walked up the hill towards the group when they arrived people moved back to let them through logan stepped forward and looked down at the body of a young woman in her late twenties there was a wide cut across the womans throat and blood everywhere a darkhaired woman in blue trousers and a white shirt was studying the body carefully this woman was helen robertson the police doctor logan had met her a few times helen said logan softly robertson looked up jenny she said hi a bad business im afraid she turned back to the body but went on talking as you can see someone cut her throat with a knife its almost cut her head away from her body and theres a lot of blood she pointed at the ground near the body time of deathprobably between two and three this afternoon robertson continued to move round the body she touched it as little as possible only when she needed to see something better i cant be sure until ive carefully she stopped as she looked more closely at something yes said logan well look at how the cut starts at the bottom of the neck here on the right and finishes close to her left ear i would say the killer stood behind her and held her head back with his right arm then he cut her throat holding the knife in his left hand i see said logan how sure are you sure enough said robertson looking up with a serious smile on her face and id also say he or she is quite a bit taller than this woman she nodded her head at the body on the ground in front of her and this womans actually quite tall herself id say about centimetres thanks helen said logan if theres anything else ill let you know finished robertson there is one other thing the killer will probably have blood all over his clothes ok thats useful logan turned to grant we need to find the knife if possible she said get some people to search the park right madam said grant logan looked at her watch it was only five oclock it would be light for a long time yet the parks a big place but they can look till it gets dark she said theyve probably got another four or five hours at least grant moved away and started giving orders to some of the police officers standing around logan walked some metres away from the body and allowed the sunshine and fresh air to take away some of the coldness of death a few minutes later grant came back towards logan with helen robertson i found this in her pocket said robertson passing logan a clear plastic police bag with a rather dirty envelope inside it logan took the bag and held it carefully so that she could look inside the envelope it was empty on the back of the envelope there were a few words eggs bread milk matches someones shopping list on the front was the name morag mackenzie but no address you havent had time to read ronnie campbells police record said grant but the name morag mackenzie is in it shes not one of his favourite people logan gave the bag and the envelope back to helen helen could you give this to the scientists she said i want to know if there are any fingerprints on it and i want to know if they can tell me anything about the handwriting logan turned to grant well she said it looks as if ronnie campbell may be dangerous youd better tell me what you know about him chapter two a visit to jimmy brown we were lucky to catch campbell for craig sinclairs murder said grant as he and logan walked down the hill towards her car did you work on the murder asked logan yes but before you ask i didnt speak to morag mackenzie then and i dont know if thats her up there said grant pointing back up the hillside with his thumb at first we didnt have any idea at all whod killed sinclair then someone rang the london road police station didnt leave a name but said we should search campbells flat and what was there asked logan there was a gun in a metal box in his kitchen it was the gun which had killed sinclair campbells fingerprints were all over the box what about the gun none no fingerprints on the gun said grant hed probably cleaned it anyway they were still questioning him when morag mackenzie came into the police station i wasnt there at the time she said shed seen campbell and sinclair drinking together and shouting at each other on the night that sinclair died the two of them had been in that pub at the end of rose street the abbotsford arms what did campbell have to say asked logan well he said the box was his but hed never seen the gun he also said hed never been in the abbotsford arms in his life he said he didnt know sinclair very well at all so why would he kill him but you were sure you had the right person said logan oh yes said grant campbell had been in trouble quite a few times hed been to prison twice once for stealing cars and once for fighting in a pub he broke someones arm that doesnt make him a murderer said logan true said grant but you wouldnt be surprised if he was what about sinclair asked logan a smalltime criminal too hed never been to prison but that was just good luck he got into fights he sold stolen cds things like that nice people said logan at six oclock back at the london road police station logan sent grant to find out the latest news about ronnie campbell and the dark blue audi at last she had time to change out of her beach clothes into a dark blue trouser suit that she always kept in her office she felt more comfortable at work if she wore smart clothes she studied her face in the mirror she had short brown hair and dark brown eyes but she always thought her nose was rather too long a journalist friend of hers tam macdonald said she was too pretty to be a police officer she had been angry with him when he said this she was intelligent and good at her job and it was an important job however it was sometimes difficult being a woman police officer because she was goodlooking people did not always take her seriously she worked hard to show those people they were wrong logan got herself a cup of coffee then she opened ronnie campbells record and looked at his photo there was nothing interesting or unusual about him he was thirtyfive years old cm tall with brown hair and brown eyes the hair was short and straight the eyes small and close together he was described as slim and quite strong as logan looked at the photo she began to ask herself questions why had campbell escaped was that morag mackenzies body in holyrood park had morag seen campbell in the abbotsford arms seven years ago had campbell killed her in fact had he really killed craig sinclair and where was he now he wouldnt need new clothes because prisoners in scotland wore their own clothes but he would need money where would he get it at that moment grant returned no news on campbell or the audi im afraid he said but im sure that was morag mackenzies body on the hillside why asked logan some of the officers downstairs knew her and described her to me she lived with a man called jimmy brown and hes no good at all hes part of all sorts of criminal activities robbery stealing cars everything well need him to look at the body so that were sure its her said logan and even though it seems ronnie campbell killed her well also need to ask mr brown some questions we need to know where he was this afternoon as we know women are most often murdered by their husband or boyfriend have you got an address for him yes replied grant springwell place off dairy rd ok said logan lets go the flat which jimmy brown shared with morag mackenzie was on the second floor of an old building near dairy road grant parked the car in the street outside and followed logan up the stairs their knock was answered by a young fairhaired man who badly needed a bath and a change of clothes he was wearing a dirty red tshirt jeans which a long time ago had been white and no shoes or socks he was tall and looked down at logan with an ugly smile on his face he turned and looked at grant and then back to logan well he said its the pigs chapter three the main man people call the police a lot of different names bobbies coppers the cops and other worse things the one thing all police officers really hate being called is pigs as soon as she heard the word logan felt grant move beside her she reached out her hand and put it on his arm no she said softly she looked at the man in front of her jimmy brown she asked maybe he said who wants to know jimmy im inspector logan of the edinburgh police and this is sergeant grant she showed him her id card then put it away in her bag so said jimmy continuing to look down his nose at her so wed like to come in explained grant putting his face very close to the other mans face brown took a couple of steps back grant and logan stepped quickly into the flat and grant shut the door brown looked surprised problem asked grant his voice did not sound friendly he did not look friendly brown gave a weak smile and moved back against the wall logan took a few more steps into the flat and looked around she had been in some terrible flats in the past but she had never seen anywhere quite like this the furniture was old and had cigarette burns all over it the walls were a dark colour probably once a kind of brown but it was difficult to tell coffee cups and cigarette packets lay everywhere empty pizza boxes lay on the table that days evening paper was open on a chair a halfeaten piece of pizza lay on the floor by an empty beer can on its side there was a smell of unwashed clothes and unwashed people she turned to jimmy brown do you know where morag is jimmy brown moved away from grant and walked round the room picking up empty cigarette packets and shaking them no he said what were you doing this afternoon nothing come on jimmy lets have some answers said logan impatiently grant looked round the room there was a door to his left he reached out to open it dont go in there said brown moving towards grant grant looked once at brown and opened the door well well well said grant sounding very pleased with himself as he looked through the door he had just opened what have we got here logan took a step forward to see what grant had found there was a bed in one corner of the room but all along the opposite wall were boxes of videos televisions and cd players all on top of each other grant walked into the room and opened some of the boxes checking what was inside brown sat down on the floor in the living room looking unhappily at the wall on the other side of the room am i right in thinking that these are all stolen asked logan brown nodded but did not speak its not your lucky day is it continued logan youre in big trouble now jimmy and itll be much worse if we dont get some answers so wheres morag i really dont know said brown she went out about midday where was she working no she doesnt work much said brown not a real job anyway not a nine to five kind of job where does she get money asked logan as grant came back into the living room i really dont know said brown very quickly some man she calls him her main man she gets money from him sometimes youre joking said grant you expect us to believe that some man just gives morag money why what does she do its true really its true i dont know what she does for him you dont know who this main man is then asked logan no said brown no idea asked grant looking hard at brown i think hes someone important said brown quickly but shes never told me she always says there are some things its better not to know so you dont know what she did for him no said brown was she going to see him today asked logan probably said brown she made a phone call just before she went out it sounded as if she was talking to him in fact it sounded as if she wanted to see him why are you asking all these questions about morag anyway whats she done logan stopped speaking she looked out of the window and thought about the main man how important was he grant continued the questioning what about you jimmy he asked where have you been all day here said brown ive been here i havent been out all day is there anyone whos seen you or been with you grant asked no said brown no visitors no brown got up off the floor and started looking a little braver than before now come on you two ive answered your questions he said whats all this about whats morag been doing logan looked at grant grant sat down on the arm of the cleanest chair jimmy he said youd better sit down im afraid ive got some bad news for you they drove from jimmy browns flat to the london road police station grant and logan sat in the front of the car brown in the back he had cried when grant told him about morag when he had stopped crying they told him he would have to come to the police station he would have to look at the body so that they could be sure it was morag he would also have to talk to officers from the robbery unit about what was in his bedroom logan didnt tell him that she would have some more questions for him later as grant drove logan thought about the people who had come into her life today ronnie campbell murderer jimmy brown robber morag mackenzie dead at the age of how old was she twentysix twentyseven certainly not much older when they arrived at the police station it was seven thirty logan asked a young sergeant to take brown to look at the body as soon as they had left she turned to grant he wasnt telling the truth about this afternoon she said wasnt he asked grant no replied logan he had this evenings paper in the flat the evening paper comes out at about two oclock so either he went out to buy it or a visitor brought it in you didnt question him about it said grant no i thought id leave it till later said logan he might talk more easily here grant smiled and then said hes lefthanded yes i saw said logan and tall and hes not a very nice person no said logan but that doesnt make him a murderer true said grant but you wouldnt be surprised if he was finished logan smiling and what about the main man she asked its an interesting choice of words isnt it said grant yes said logan it is unusual but ive heard it before someone who thinks theyre important said grant more to himself than to logan right said logan putting a hand on grants shoulder when jimmys had a look at the body lock him up and get someone from the robbery unit to go and talk to him about all those stolen things theyll also need to go round to his flat and pick everything up then come and find me in my office right said grant logan was reading through ronnie campbells police record and making notes in a small black notebook when grant returned as he came through the door she looked at her watch it was eight fifteen but it was still very light outside the body is morag mackenzies grant told logan yes someone rang to tell me she replied any news on the envelope or the knife the scientists will call us as soon as possible about the envelope the search has finished and they havent found a knife what about st margarets loch maybe the killer threw the knife in the water said logan st margarets loch was a small manmade lake in holyrood park get some divers to check that in the morning right madam said grant do we have any idea where campbell might go she asked not really said grant i spoke to the prison he had one visitor in the last twelve months his lawyer of course at this time of year its warm enough to sleep outside logan said she went on ive also been thinking about how hell get money hell probably steal it said grant logan said nothing for a few moments then she spoke campbell was sent to prison for fifteen years thats right said grant hes still got quite a long time left said logan yes agreed grant and because hes in trouble again now he wont get out early hell be in there for eight more years theres something strange about this murder said logan i think if we want to find out who murdered morag mackenzie well need to look into craig sinclairs murder again grant looked at her but said nothing he had only worked with inspector logan for three years but he knew that she was often right logan looked through a few pages of her notebook craig sinclair had a sister she said jean drummond married theres an address for her in the new town st stephen street lets see if she still lives there go and organise the divers for tomorrow and ill meet you in the car park in ten minutes what about jimmy brown asked grant let the robbery unit talk to him tonight said logan well talk to him tomorrow im more interested in finding out about sinclairs murder at the moment the old town of edinburgh is a fairly small area around the castle and the palace of holyroodhouse st stephen street is in the new town not far from princes street and although this part of the city is already more than two hundred years old it is still called the new town as they drove through the streets of edinburgh at eight thirty on this warm june evening logan looked at the busy streets and the stone houses she thought to herself as she often did that edinburgh must be one of the most beautiful cities in the world she had been to london once but she hadnt liked it london was too big too noisy too dirty edinburgh was just right as they turned into st stephen street and parked the car phone rang grant picked it up he listened for a minute then said goodbye and put the phone down theyve found the audi he said in a car park near the haymarket station thats near dairy road said logan where morag mackenzie was living yes theyre searching the area but campbell could be anywhere by now he wont go back to the car that would be completely stupid true said logan ok lets go and see what sinclairs sister has to say chapter four bags of money st stephen street is a narrow street with tall buildings on each side almost all the buildings are now flats a couple are pubs and there are a few shops grant and logan walked up the steps to the front door of one of the buildings and studied the names on the wall next to the door drummond first floor grant pointed to the name logan and grant walked up the stairs grant knocked at a door and it was opened by a woman in her early thirties yes said the woman mrs jean drummond asked logan yes im inspector logan edinburgh police said logan im sorry its so late could i have a few words with you please of course said jean drummond come in jean drummond had shoulderlength blonde hair blue eyes and a warm smile she was wearing jeans and a shirt that was too big and almost came down to her knees sorry about all this she said pointing to tables and chairs on top of each other and several boxes of books on the floor im painting the living room i was going to do it when we came here eight years ago and ive finally started come into the kitchen and sit down would you like a cup of tea thank you said logan that would be nice grant and logan sat down on wooden chairs by the kitchen table while jean drummond made some tea the kitchen was clean and welcoming yellow walls yellow curtains it was light and airy it felt comfortable to sit in logan couldnt think of anywhere more different from jimmy browns flat im afraid weve come to ask you some questions about your brother craig and his death said logan im sorry to come round and ask about the past but it might be important jean drummond put some cups and a teapot on the table and looked at logan she was no longer smiling but her eyes still seemed soft and warm inspector dont worry about the past i dont i was very sad when craig was killed but it was no great surprise he was often in trouble even when he was a boy he was in trouble at school by the time he was fourteen the police were always coming round to our house to speak to him i was sad when he died very sad i mean he was my brother and i loved him but she stopped speaking and passed tea to logan and then to grant mrs drummond said logan i dont know if youve heard the news today but ronnie campbell the man who was in prison for the murder of your brother has escaped jean drummond put down her cup logan and grant could almost see the different thoughts going through her head and the girl who said she saw campbell with your brother on the night he died was murdered today jean drummonds hand flew up to her mouth and she made a strange low sound logan reached out and put her hand softly on the womans arm dont worry logan said campbell wont be interested in you jean drummonds eyes were wide open she looked very afraid but he might be she said her voice sounded very worried campbell always said that he didnt really know craig at all but i always thought they were friends i saw them together five or six times at least i thought they were probably working together stealing and so on thats what i told the police and im sure campbell wont have forgotten that logan and grant looked at each other then logan turned to jean drummond i really dont think youre in any danger she said but of course we cant take any chances we could ask for a policewoman to stay with you until we find campbell jean drummond sat quietly for a moment thinking yes i think i would like that she said finally my husband is away on business at the moment and i dont want to be in the flat alone logan nodded at grant who went out of the room to phone for a policewoman logan spoke to jean drummond again you said your brother was often in trouble with the police yes i always knew craig was a criminal she said i mean he always had money and he never had a job for a long time i thought he was just a small criminal you know buying and selling things that were stolen perhaps stealing things himself sometimes as well i used to think that he wasnt a serious criminal and that one day hed grow up and get a job grant came quietly back into the room and sat down logan said nothing waiting to see if jean drummond wanted to say more i havent thought about craig for a long time said jean standing up and looking out of the window down to the street below i always thought he would leave his life of crime but one evening he came round to see me hed had too much to drink and he was full of talk about money i saw then that he had decided how he would live his life i saw then that he would always be a criminal again logan said nothing sometimes it was better to let people follow their thoughts jean drummond turned back from the window with a little smile on her face id almost forgotten about that evening i remember craig said something strange he said something like im going to get bags of money i thought he meant he was going to get lots of money i thought he was telling me that he was going to become very rich so i said something like thatll be nice to have bags of money but he said no no im going to get bags of money he thinks hes mr big around here i asked him who he was talking about but he just repeated bags of money i dont know what he meant anyway hed had far too much to drink so it probably didnt mean anything jean drummond did not see grant look across at logan but logan did grant had got something it was something that the woman had said logan couldnt think what it was and she would have to wait to find out jean drummond was smiling to herself remembering her brother i havent thought about that for ages she said as she sat down on one of the kitchen chairs im sorry you must think i cant stop talking its just that i havent talked about craig for ages no you dont have to be sorry said logan thank you for seeing us youve been very helpful after telling jean drummond that a policewoman would arrive in about half an hour logan and grant said goodbye and left the flat as they walked down the stairs logan looked at grant ok she said what did jean drummond say that was so interesting well said grant craig sinclair had drunk far too much what if he didnt say he was going to get bags of money what if he actually said he was going to get bagss money and who asked logan is bags grant gave her a big smile chapter five questions for robert baxter bags said grant as he opened the car door and got in is robert baxter you mean the robert baxter who owns the big sports centre out on the corstorphine road asked logan thats him and of course the robert baxter that the serious crimes unit have been trying to catch for such a long time how is it that you know hes called bags and i dont said logan smiling when she and grant had started working together three years ago logan had quickly realised that grant was a very good policeman he had ways of getting information that other people couldnt find out and he forgot very little id be surprised if you did know hes called bags said grant only people who grew up in edinburgh would know logan was from penicuik a town about fifteen kilometres south of edinburgh baxter grew up in a poor part of town continued grant he was a wild kid but he only got caught by the police once what for asked logan as she knew grant wanted her to for stealing an old ladys handbag he ran past her in the street and took it unluckily for him he ran straight into the arms of a policeman after that his friends called him bags baxter for a while but not now asked logan no hes too rich and important now said grant and of course people are afraid of him yes said logan they certainly are for the rest of the journey back to the london road police station neither grant nor logan spoke logan was deep in thought about robert baxter the serious crimes unit had wanted to catch baxter for a long time but hed been too clever baxter was the man behind a lot of the crime in edinburgh he planned it organised it and made a lot of money from it he also owned businesses that were not criminal and made a lot of money from those too baxter was a hard man he expected the people who worked for him to do what they were told without question people who did not follow his orders found out how hard he was it was said that he had killed more than one person however the police had never found anything and it was difficult for them to get information about baxter because people were too afraid to talk when logan and grant arrived back at the london road police station it was nearly ten oclock logan spoke well need to talk to mr baxter tomorrow grant find out where hes going to be at nine thirty in the morning and let me know before you go home right madam said grant logan went up to her office on her desk were two notes from the scientists the first note said that there were three fingerprints on the envelope two of them were morag mackenziess one was not that fingerprint might be useful if they could find out whose it was there was no information about the handwriting on the front of the envelope the writing on the back was morags the second note said that the scientists were looking at the blue audi and they would let logan know what they found out the next day logan turned her chair away from her desk and sat looking out of the window she thought about the two people who were dead craig sinclair killed seven years ago and morag mackenzie killed not much more than seven hours ago were they killed by different people or was it perhaps the same person why had ronnie campbell escaped had he killed morag because she had helped to put him in prison would he kill again or was there another reason for his escape what about jimmy brown was he just a robber or was he a murderer too and now there was robert baxter what was his part in this story was he lefthanded or righthanded she would find out in the morning at nine thirty the next morning logan and grant were standing beside an indoor tennis court at the robert baxter sports centre watching two men play tennis the taller of the two fairhaired and in his late thirties threw a ball in the air and hit it hard with the racket in his right hand logan knew from pictures she had seen in the papers that this was robert baxter the other man missed the ball completely game set and match said baxter six love six two the men shook hands thanks for the game said baxter as baxter came off the court logan and grant walked up to him mr baxter im inspector logan of the edinburgh police and this is sergeant grant logan showed him her id card i was hoping we could talk to you for a few minutes of course inspector said baxter im always happy to help the police his voice was friendly but logan looked into his eyes they were grey and hard if its all right with you inspector said baxter id like to have a quick shower first and then we could talk in my office ok agreed logan there are some seats by the front entrance said baxter if you wait there ill be very quick ten minutes later baxter led logan and grant through the sports centre towards his office logan watched baxter walking easily in front of her his suit looked italian and logan thought it must have cost at least pounds baxter was also wearing a dark blue shirt with a light blue tie there was a large gold ring on the little finger of his left hand and his shoes which looked italian too probably cost as much as the suit here was a man who liked spending his money on clothes they arrived at baxters office and he held the door open for logan and grant to walk in it was a large airy room with expensivelooking furniture coffee asked baxter nodding at the coffee machine on a small table at the side of the room no thank you said logan well try to take as little of your time as possible we know youre a busy man baxter got a cup of coffee for himself and sat down opposite logan and grant what can i do for you inspector he asked he took a cigarette from a wooden box on his desk and lit it with a gold lighter just a couple of things really said logan a young woman was murdered yesterday in holyrood park yes i read about it in the paper this morning said baxter a terrible business her name was morag mackenzie have you ever met her or spoken to her baxter thought for a moment or two morag mackenzie he said slowly no i dont think i know that name of course she might have used the sports centre here i could get someone to find out if you like i mean i know some of the people who come here but not all of them there are far too many thats all right said logan i dont think she was a very sporty type of person she gave a little smile and then continued the other question is about the past did you ever know a man called craig sinclair did he work for you or were you friends with him baxter looked as if he was thinking hard his hand came up to his chin craig sinclair no i dont think so i dont think i know that name at all again i could get someone to find out if he was working here but baxter did not finish the sentence well thats it said logan standing up im sorry i couldnt be more help inspector said baxter also standing up i hope you find the person youre looking for i hope so too said logan she looked round at baxters office youve done very well for yourself mr baxter i understand you come from one of the poorer parts of edinburgh and yet now youre an important businessman with a number of fine companies ive worked hard said baxter smiling a little if i do something i like to do it well now if youll excuse me he continued picking up the phone i have an important call to make as logan and grant left the room they could hear baxter speaking what do you mean hes not there he said find out where he is tell him the main man wants to speak to him outside the sports centre logan and grant sat in the car across the car park logan could see a dark green mercedes the car number was rb so said logan do you think baxter is morag mackenzies main man thats just the question i was asking myself said grant but even if he is that doesnt mean he killed her anyway hes righthanded logan put on her seat belt and started the car what did you think of him she asked i think his clothes probably cost as much money as i earn in a month said grant i didnt know you were so interested in fashion said logan and they both laughed grant always wore a blue jacket and grey trousers somehow even when he wore a new jacket or new trousers they always looked old there was something else strange though she said what was that asked grant he didnt seem at all surprised by the questions how do you mean asked grant well he didnt want to know why we were asking him about these two people replied logan i mean if someone started asking you questions about two people youd never heard of wouldnt you want to know why i see what you mean said grant yes that is interesting i hadnt thought of that as logan turned the car out of the sports centre on to corstorphine road the car phone rang grant answered it he listened for a moment then said hold on please he turned to logan i think you might want to take this call its your journalist friend tam macdonald he says he knows where ronnie campbell is chapter six catching ronnie campbell logan stopped the car at the side of the road she and grant quickly got out and changed places so that he could drive as she got back into the car she picked up the phone tam she said are you doing my job for me again there was a laugh at the other end of the phone jenny my dear tams voice came down the phone i could never do it as well as you do logan laughed too seriously said tam i heard that you were leading the search for ronnie campbell well im looking at him right now where are you asked logan well hes sitting on the ground outside jenners department store in princes street holding out his hat for people to put money in said tam and im on the other side of the road looking like a tourist logan looked at grant jenners princes street quick she said grant turned on the blue light put it out on the roof of the car and pulled into the traffic you could never look like a tourist tam said logan into the phone tam laughed like quite a few scots he had red hair logan spoke into the phone again are you sure its campbell i am now said tam at first i thought he was just another beggar who lives on the street and asks people for money how clever of him said logan what do you mean asked tam well his photo is in the papers and on the television and everyones looking for him said logan so said tam so nobody looks at street people she explained its the best place to hide hes right in front of us but in a place wed never think to look it explains how hes getting money too very clever agreed tam youre sure its him arent you logan asked suddenly oh yes said tam i wrote one or two pieces about the sinclair murder so i know what campbell looks like keep your eye on him sure said tam but listen i followed him to jenners from holyrood park holyrood park repeated logan what was he doing there ive no idea i went out there to have a look at where morag mackenzie was murdered as i was leaving i saw campbell so i left my car in the park and followed him on foot up here i waited until he stopped somewhere before i rang you well be there in a few minutes said logan so wait for us dont worry said tam ill be waiting around for my dinner invitation after giving you information like this logan laughed ill see you in a few minutes she said and turned her phone off it was unusual for a police officer and a journalist to be close friends but she and tam were the road was fairly clear as they reached the haymarket and two minutes later they were at the west end of princes street grant turned off the light and brought it inside the car again they drove slowly along the street with the rest of the traffic jenners was at the far end of princes street on their left as logan looked along the street in front of her she could see a man sitting in front of the department store there was a hat on the ground next to him ill get out here she said getting out quickly and shutting the door as grant stopped the car grant drove on again and stopped just past the front door of the store he got out and walked back quickly logan and grant walked towards ronnie campbell at the same time as they got near he looked up and suddenly realised they were police officers he moved faster than seemed possible in seconds he was on his feet and running across the road cars had to stop suddenly and there was a loud noise of screaming metal and breaking glass as other cars hit those that had stopped police stop shouted grant running across the road after campbell logan followed pulling her phone out of her pocket to call for help as campbell reached the other side of the road he turned right running fast along the side of the road looking for a way into the princes street gardens suddenly a short redhaired person jumped out of the crowd and threw his arms round campbells legs it was tam macdonald macdonald and campbell fell to the ground with campbell fighting to get away seconds later grant arrived he pulled one of campbells arms round behind his back and pushed it up between his shoulders campbell stopped fighting and lay there on the ground then logan arrived pulled her police id card out of her pocket and showed it to campbell ronnie campbell she said youre wanted for escaping from a prison van near dundee yesterday morning for stealing a car and weve got a lot of other questions we want to ask you too so get on your feet and were all going down to the london road police station she turned to tam macdonald who was getting to his feet and brushing down his clothes with his hands he was wearing jeans a dark green tshirt and a brown jacket hi jenny he said to logan well done tam she said i didnt know you were good at rugby actually i played for the first team at school said tam with a big smile chapter seven a very good reason to kill back at the london road police station logan and grant sat opposite campbell in a windowless room the clock on the wall showed eleven thirty a cassette recorder on the table recorded their conversation ronnie sat forward in his chair his arms on the table his head in his hands he was wearing a white tshirt jeans and trainers a blue jacket was on the back of his chair a paper cup of water was on the table in front of him since they had brought him into the room he had said nothing logan waited until campbell looked up at her why did you escape ronnie she asked campbell looked her straight in the eye because i wanted to get out he replied dont play games with us said grant crossly you know what the inspector means campbell looked at grant and said nothing logan spoke again ronnie you know that first almost noone escapes second if you do escape you are almost certainly caught third the only way to stay free is to have friends outside to give you money and get you out of the country and you dont have any friends outside do you campbell said nothing logan and grant said nothing the room stayed quiet after a few minutes logan said do you remember the girl who said she saw you and sinclair in the abbotsford arms campbell looked up again this time his eyes looked hard he still said nothing do you remember her name asked logan campbell said nothing logan looked at grant come on ronnie said grant ive told you stop the games you remember morag mackenzie you wont forget her name quickly will you well she was killed yesterday soon after you escaped in fact probably about the time you got to edinburgh someone cut her throat there was a strange look on ronnies face he looked surprised and afraid grant continued the inspector asked why you escaped my answer is that youve spent seven years in prison because of morag mackenzie and youve still got time left to spend there morag mackenzie gave the police important information that meant you were caught and sent to prison i think you escaped so you could find morag and murder her campbell jumped up out of his chair stop it he shouted i didnt kill morag mackenzie and i didnt kill craig sinclair i didnt even know morag mackenzie was dead but you did know where she lived didnt you said logan she wasnt at all sure that he did know but it seemed possible since the blue audi was found near her flat yes i did campbell said i know someone who knows her so what happened when you went to see her said logan again she didnt know that he had been to see morag but it seemed possible probable even i didnt see her said campbell you were seen said grant following logans thoughts and letting campbell think they knew more than they actually did we found the car near her flat and you were seen going there i went there said campbell but she wasnt in there was noone there so where was jimmy brown logan thought to herself then she remembered the evening paper in morags flat and realised that brown must have gone out at some point so what did you do then she asked well i just walked the streets for a time werent you worried that someone might realise who you were from your picture in the papers or on the television asked logan campbell looked at logan nobody looks at people who live on the street he said logan nodded slowly and then looked at grant where did you spend the night grant asked campbell holyrood park had you been there before asked grant what do you mean before said campbell before yesterday evening explained grant no said campbell i got there about ten or eleven in the evening it was already dark i slept up on the hillside about halfway up arthurs seat it seemed to logan that campbell was beginning to talk more freely perhaps he might give her the information she had wanted earlier so why did you want to see morag mackenzie she asked campbell was quiet for a few moments putting his thoughts together and deciding if he should answer at all you wouldnt understand he said at last try me said logan i was beginning to go mad in prison its a terrible place more terrible than you can possibly know seven years is a long time i didnt know how long i could last and i was in there for something i didnt do campbell stopped and looked at logan and grant waiting for them to say they did not believe him they stayed quiet knowing that if they spoke campbell would say nothing more for a time i thought there would be some new information about sinclairs murder continued campbell i hoped the police would find out who really did it but my lawyer came to see me some time ago and said that there was no chance of that happening he stopped for a moment and drank some water i had no hope no hope of getting out no hope of people believing that i didnt kill sinclair no hope and then there was a chance to escape so i took it i didnt think about it i just took the chance when it came and morag asked logan quietly she hadnt told the truth said campbell and i wanted to know why i wanted to find out why she had said shed seen us together the night sinclair was murdered i didnt even know her perhaps someone had paid her to say it but if so who and why i wanted to find out so what were your plans for today asked logan i was hoping to get some more money outside jenners this morning and then go and see if morag was back at her place this afternoon logan and grant left a police officer with campbell and went up to logans office for some coffee so what do you think asked logan well he didnt have a knife or blood all over his clothes said grant but he does have a very good reason for wanting to kill her logan said seven years in prison said grant logan picked up a message from her desk and read it the search of morag and jimmys flat she said the scientists have taken away some knives for a closer look but no clothes with blood on them she picked up another note from her desk campbells fingerprints are on the inside of the blue audi but theres nothing else of interest there theyre also checking the fingerprints on the envelope with our records so far they arent campbells or jimmy browns she looked at her watch i think we should go and talk to jimmy brown now she said i want to know how that newspaper got into his flat and if he really knew who morags main man was chapter eight the mystery car sorry youve had to wait so long said logan sweetly as she and grant came into the room where jimmy brown was sitting it was just after one oclock weve been rather busy she added brown just looked at her angrily been having an interesting conversation with the robbery unit asked grant sitting down on one of the chairs opposite brown ive been up half the night answering questions said brown why dont you go away and leave me alone i know im in trouble for the stolen things in the flat but i had nothing to do with morags murder just go away and leave me alone logan sat on the other chair opposite brown and looked at him jimmy i just want to find the person who killed morag said logan now where were you yesterday at home said brown i told you i know thats what you told us said logan but that wasnt the truth was it as she said this she looked brown straight in the eye jimmy looked back for a few seconds but then looked away and started to bite his lip i followed morag he said softly noone spoke i didnt kill her brown spoke again really i didnt why didnt you tell us this before asked logan i know what the police are like just because ive been in trouble before you think you can get me for anything now it doesnt matter what i tell you youre all the same so why should i tell you anything and now because i didnt tell you the truth youre going to think that i killed morag brown was beginning to get angry again jimmy said logan patiently youre a criminal and i dont like you but you dont have to be afraid of me if you didnt murder morag jimmy gave logan a strange look police officers didnt often say things like that not to people like him anyway so why did you decide to follow morag asked logan brown looked down at the table as if deciding if he should tell the truth or not finally he looked at grant and then at logan i wanted to find out who the main man was why asked logan why now why not before well morag and id only known each other six months we only got the flat together a couple of months ago i didnt want to put my nose into her business too early so i waited until now i thought it was time to find out who the main man was and did you find out asked grant no said brown lets go back to before morag went out said logan when we spoke to you at the flat you said that morag made a phone call thats right said brown you thought she wanted to meet her main man yes said brown did she usually ring him or did he ring her asked logan brown gave logan another strange look yes yesterday was unusual he usually rang her in fact i dont think i can ever remember her calling him except for yesterday so why do you think she called him yesterday asked logan i dont know said brown thinking hard what were you doing before she called him asked logan watching tv then suddenly she jumped up and made the phone call i just thought shed forgotten something what time did this happen asked logan i dont know midday maybe yes it must have been around that time because we were watching the midday news ok said logan now what time did you say morag went out soon after that replied brown logan looked at grant and he started to ask the questions where did she go he said she walked down dairy road towards the haymarket said brown and then this car stopped beside her she got in the car and that was it the car drove away logan sat back in her chair thinking campbells escape would have been on the midday news morag must have seen that and phoned her main man she started listening to grant and brown again what kind of car asked grant dont know said brown big small asked grant big said brown and a dark colour blue or green or something grant and logan looked at each other which asked logan blue or green i dont remember did you see the car number logan asked oh come on inspector said brown it was just a car what was the person in the car like continued grant i dont know this all happened about fifty metres away i couldnt see very much think back said logan remember what happened did you see anything else no nothing which way did they drive away asked grant they drove up towards the haymarket said brown and what did you do asked grant i went back home said brown but first you bought a newspaper said logan how do you know that asked brown im a detective said logan and smiled come on jimmy grant said what do you think morag did for the main man you must have an idea she went to parties and looked after some of the people he did business with if you know what i mean talked to people and made them feel welcome and she slept with them asked grant yes and that said brown quietly thats another reason we didnt talk about it too much did morag ever talk about someone called robert baxter asked logan browns eyes suddenly opened wide in surprise robert baxter is he the main man he asked you know him asked logan everyone knows robert baxter said brown i mean i dont know him really and i dont want to know him but i know who he is is it possible that he was the main man asked logan browns shoulders went up and then down its possible he said but morag never talked about him did she talk much about the past logan asked not really brown said did she ever talk about craig sinclair craig sinclair that little rat no she didnt talk about him brown was angry again his eyes had lit up but i remember him he once sold me a couple of boxes full of cds and then the next day the police came round to my place and found them he promised me he hadnt told the police where to find them i didnt know if i believed him or not i got into big trouble for that the little rat of course he was murdered as well said logan quietly logan watched browns face as he suddenly realised talking about craig sinclair like that might be a mistake hey come on he said i know he was murdered i didnt like him but that doesnt mean i killed him later logan and grant were sitting in logans office drinking coffee they had taken brown through his story again but he hadnt added anything or changed any of it should we believe jimmy brown asked grant i dont know said logan shaking her head its strange that he knew sinclair as well well need to check what brown was doing when sinclair was murdered yes said grant and the information about the car was interesting the audi that campbell stole was dark blue said grant and baxters cars dark green said logan she turned her chair and looked out of the window into the park across the road some young children were playing while their mothers lay on the grass in the warm sunshine logan remembered that this time the day before she had been on the beach a lot had happened since then she turned and looked at her watch it was already three thirty in the afternoon yes i think we should talk to baxter again first she said phone him and invite him along here say id like to speak to him tonight would be best if not tomorrow morning there was a box full of papers about craig sinclairs murder on her desk she pulled it towards her i want another look at this information about craig sinclairs murder before i talk to baxter as grant left she picked up the first page and started to read chapter nine back to the first murder craig sinclairs body had been discovered in the early hours of the morning at the back of a factory in beaverhall road in the broughton area of edinburgh one of the factory workers found it when he went outside to have a cigarette someone had shot sinclair and then taken his body to the factory and left it there logan thought it might be useful to see where this had happened she tried to remember if she had ever been to beaverhall road but thought she probably hadnt fifteen minutes later she was there beaverhall road was a small street off broughton road there were some old flats and a car park on the right hand side of the street on the left were some big buildings factories and offices at the end of the road was a large empty area where the powderhall stadium had once been logan left her car outside the last block of flats on the right hand side and walked up the street it was empty the fish and chip shop on the corner was closed there was nobody around she walked back up the street to her car opening the car door she took out the police record and looked at the photographs of sinclairs body she looked round the street and worked out where his body had been found had the murderer known that the factories worked day and night maybe he or she had thought that noone would find the body until the next morning just then she heard a noise behind her an old man was walking across the empty area behind her he was wearing an old jacket and grey trousers which looked as if he had slept in them as he came towards her there was a strong smell of whisky all right then he asked some scots people call women hen if they dont know their name logan didnt like it much but it was better than love just all right she replied moving slowly from side to side the old man stood in front of her suddenly he looked hard at her and then he stood up straight youll be the police then he said thats right said logan and you are angus macleod at your service madam said the old man touching the right side of his head with his first finger and then pointing it at logan you can call me gus logan smiled the old man had clearly drunk too much but he wasnt dangerous where do you live gus asked logan in a friendly way here and there under the stars im a free man in a free world said gus throwing his arms wide open logan laughed a little do you come round here often she asked oh yes said gus slowly and carefully ive been coming round here for a long time since before they knocked the stadium down and he looked back at where the stadium had been and then turned back to logan since before you joined the police i should think too he said looking her up and down and since before they found the body over there he said and pointed between the two factories but i didnt come back for some time after that that was a bad business a bad business you were here then asked logan oh yes said macleod but i didnt come back for a long time it was a bad business macleod looked unhappy at remembering the murder and as he spoke he took a half bottle of whisky out of his pocket took off the top and had a drink i mean were you actually here on the night of the murder gus asked logan oh yes said macleod so did the police talk to you asked logan no no i went away it was a bad business nothing to do with me but did you see anything that night asked logan oh yes said macleod his voice was clearer now i saw him you saw the body said logan she couldnt believe her luck in finding this old man i saw the body said macleod and i saw him too who too asked logan trying to understand what the old man was talking about i saw the body said macleod slowly as if talking to a child and i saw him too the man who brought the body logan could feel her breathing getting quicker you mean you saw the man who left the body over there macleod looked at her as if she was stupid logan knew she had a problem she should take macleod straight to london road for questioning she should also be really angry with him for not giving information to the police but people like gus people who lived on the street and drank too much could be difficult he might tell her something but he might not she could not make him talk and if he did talk it would not be easy to know if he was telling the truth or even if he knew what the truth was if he gave her information that actually was important she would have to be careful how she used it a good lawyer could make someone like gus seem completely mad she decided to talk to gus now somehow she felt he would not like the london road police station tell me about him said logan well said macleod helping himself to another small drink id be very happy to tell you and he said nothing more but just looked at logan with a smile on his face logan found a tenpound note in her pocket and gave it to the old man now thats very kind of you he said well it was the middle of the night and this car stopped just about here and he pointed to a place near where they were standing a big man got out opened the back door of the car on the other side took something out and carried it over there what was the man like asked logan big said macleod tall what was he wearing asked logan a suit said macleod perhaps it was dark the street lights were on but it was still quite dark what sort of car was it asked logan big said macleod four wheels and four doors and he started laughing however when he saw the look on logans face he stopped colour asked logan i dont know hen it was the middle of the night it looked as if it was a dark colour anything else asked logan think carefully did you see the car number macleod started laughing again at the thought that he might have remembered the car number but then he stopped laughing and looked at logan he took another drink from his bottle he seemed to be thinking hard actually he spoke clearly and looked her straight in the eye i dont remember the car number but i seem to have an idea in my head it was an unusual one you know like jb or gus or something like that are you sure about that asked logan absolutely said macleod his voice becoming a little unclear again then he looked at her as if deciding he had spent enough time with the police for now and now he continued if you will excuse me it has been nice talking to you but i have important things to do he turned and singing quietly to himself started walking up the street in a more or less straight line logan stood by her car and watched macleod he seemed to drink too much and he probably believed what he had told her but should she believe him noone else would but actually she thought she did it was interesting information and she needed time to think about it chapter ten catching a murderer logan got back to the london road police station at five oclock and found a message on her desk the fingerprint on the envelope in morags pocket was not the same as any of the fingerprints in the police records logan thought about this it was not what she had expected not what she had expected at all at that moment sergeant grant put his head round the door good news he said the divers found a knife in st margarets loch it was on the bottom of the loch inside a plastic bag full of stones the scientists have got it now thats great said logan but well have to wait and see if its the knife that killed morag mackenzie theyll let us know as soon as possible he told logan and baxters in glasgow at the moment hell be back in edinburgh first thing in the morning and hell be here at nine thirty thanks grant said logan listen she went on a couple of things first id like to see robert baxters criminal record he hasnt got one madam said grant but you told me about the time he was caught with the handbag said logan surprised yes but he was only fifteen or sixteen at the time he didnt get a criminal record the officer who caught baxter just told him that if he did it again hed be in a lot of trouble he thought that would be enough well that explains why we dont have his fingerprints said logan now theres just one other thing id like you to do before you go home and she explained what she wanted then when grant had gone she picked up her bag and went home logans flat was in leith an area in the north of edinburgh by the sea leith had once been a busy place with a lot of ships going in and out every day now however it was a quieter place and many of the old buildings were flats for the young single people of edinburgh logan lay on the sofa in her living room listening to capercaillie her favourite scottish band on the cd player as she lay there she thought about all the facts that she had discovered they were like the different pieces of a jigsaw puzzle the game where you make a picture out of all the little pieces you can only put the pieces together one way to make a picture if you put them together the wrong way you find that you cant use some of the pieces she lay there for hours trying to find the right way to make a complete picture by midnight she had finally put an almost complete picture together there were still a couple of pieces that she couldnt quite put in however she hoped her conversation with robert baxter the next morning would take care of those problems the next morning logan sat at her desk with a cup of hot black coffee reading the message that grant had left after his visit to browns flat there was a knock at her door and sergeant grant came in morning grant thanks for this she said waving the piece of paper at him and then putting it in her pocket ive got news from the scientists about the knife he said sounding pleased were in luck go on said logan its the knife which killed morag her blood is on it ok thats a good start said logan and the knife was probably in a plastic bag with stones because the handle is wooden the murderer must have been worried that it wouldnt stay at the bottom of the loch grant said logan said nothing realising that there was more information to come because the knife was in a plastic bag very little water got in and the scientists have been able to find some fingerprints on it great said logan and one of the fingerprints is the same as the fingerprint on the envelope logan banged the top of her desk with her hand excellent she said now is baxter here yet yes said grant ive put him in the room you asked for and given him a cup of coffee but i still dont understand were sure the murderer knew morag and we know the murderer was lefthanded campbell and brown both knew her and theyre both lefthanded baxter may be the main man but were not sure he says he never knew her and hes righthanded weve seen him playing tennis logan just smiled at him you havent got a packet of cigarettes have you she asked grant gave her a surprised look logan didnt smoke sure he said and gave her a packet of cigarettes and a box of matches which he took from his pocket thanks ill let you have them back later she said still smiling ok lets go and talk to baxter logan opened the door and walked into the room where robert baxter was sitting the usual rooms where the police talked to people were small with only a little furniture three or four hard chairs and a table but nothing else logan had chosen a different more comfortable room it was bigger too and it would be easier for baxter to move logan wanted him to be able to move she wanted him to be able to move his arms there were comfortable chairs and a low table with magazines there was a coffee machine in the corner and pictures on the wall baxter was sitting in a chair reading a magazine he put it down as logan and grant came in good morning mr baxter said logan thank you very much for coming here this morning there are just a couple of things id like to get clear thats all right inspector said baxter watching logan carefully but i did answer all your questions last time ill do my best to help you today but after that i would be happier if you left me alone fine said logan cigarette as she spoke she took grants packet of cigarettes out of her pocket and threw it lazily towards baxter the packet turned over in the air and fell towards the left arm of baxters chair baxters left hand shot out to catch it he took a cigarette out of the packet put it in his mouth and threw the packet back with his left hand thanks he said logan threw him the matches again they fell towards the left arm of the chair again baxter caught with his left hand he lit his cigarette and threw the matches back easily with his left hand logan looked at grant grant smiled baxter saw the smile whats going on he asked looking from logan to grant and back youre not bad at sport are you said logan so what asked baxter he was beginning to realise something was wrong what sports do you play as well as tennis asked logan football squash ive also played rugby and cricket whats all this about and like many good sportspeople continued logan youre good with both hands arent you youre not completely righthanded youre very good with your left hand too so asked baxter angrily so said logan the person who murdered morag mackenzie was lefthanded youre mad said baxter youre completely mad ive told you ive never heard of her logan pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket and looked at it have you got a mobile phone she asked baxter of course he replied and is this the number logan read a number from the piece of paper yes said baxter looking at it but you could easily get that information he was beginning to look more worried yes said logan it was easy to get last night sergeant grant got the phone records for morag mackenzies flat she called your number at about midday on the day she was murdered she could have got my number from anyone he said looking round the room as if he wanted to find a way out logan continued weve got an envelope which we found in morags pocket its got her name on and it will be interesting to compare the handwriting on the envelope with your handwriting and theres a fingerprint on it too baxters face started to go red so perhaps i did know her but that doesnt mean i killed her you dont know that but we will know very soon mr baxter said logan seriously you see weve also found the knife that killed morag mackenzie and there are fingerprints on that too you dont know theyre my fingerprints said baxter no we dont said logan but i think well find they are and you havent told us the truth about you and morag mackenzie you certainly knew her and you spoke to her just before she was murdered we know enough now to take your fingerprints we can then compare them with those that we have found on the envelope and the knife baxters head fell forward into his hands logan turned to grant take mr baxters fingerprints and organise a search of the sports centre on corstorphine road and mr baxters home were looking for clothes with a lot of blood on them i dont think well find them but you never know we may get lucky chapter eleven the last pieces of the puzzle grant brought in some fingerprint ink and paper and took baxters fingerprints he left the room for a short time to take them to the scientists when he returned logan started talking to baxter again ok she said lets go right back to the start to the murder of craig sinclair baxters eyes looked empty he shook his head slowly from side to side as if he could not believe what was happening yes logan went on ive been looking at that murder too and actually ive had some good luck i found a man who saw you leaving sinclairs body in beaverhall road he described you and your car and he even told me your car number you shouldnt have such an easy number to remember she didnt tell baxter that gus macleod couldnt actually remember the number and that anyway nobody would ever believe him it was enough that baxter believed that she had found him logan was now quiet if baxter believed that she knew everything he might tell her the things she didnt know grant and logan watched him thinking baxter opened his mouth and started to speak a couple of times but then stopped it was as if he could not quite decide what to say would he still say he knew nothing although the police already knew so much or would he tell the truth finally he spoke sinclair tried to steal some money from me actually he did steal it and then he started telling everyone about it ive got bagss money bags is no good any more im the boss now so i had to do something i got my money back and i made sure noone else would try to steal from me and everyone knew i was still the main man and you made us think that campbell killed sinclair said grant why not baxters shoulders went up and down i knew campbell a little and i didnt like him much he and sinclair worked together sometimes i thought they might have worked together getting my money i thought it was a clever idea to make both of them disappear at the same time and i knew that if campbell went to prison for sinclairs murder i wouldnt so you put the gun in his flat said logan yes i found a box under the sink in the kitchen i just put the gun in the box it was his box it had his fingerprints on it how did you get into his flat asked logan it was easy said baxter ive had a lot of practice getting into houses without breaking any glass logan thought for a moment and then continued and what about morag she did things for me from time to time she was happy to tell the police that shed seen campbell with sinclair that night i paid her well for it i continued to give her bits of work so i could make sure she stayed quiet and everything was fine until campbell escaped said logan morag rang and told me about it shed seen it on the news she was worried that campbell would come and see her she said she wanted to meet me to talk about it logan said nothing baxter had stopped talking and was looking at the top of the table finally he looked up the stupid woman wanted more money campbell escaped and the stupid stupid woman thought it was a great chance to ask for some more money to keep her quiet well she was right shes quiet now baxter sat back in his chair his hands on his knees his face was now white his eyes wide as he realised his world had just crashed in the most terrible way he looked at logan and said no more at five oclock logan was standing in her office looking out of the window and deciding that it was time to go home there was a light knock and the door opened tam macdonald came in shutting the door behind him i hear its all over he said walking across the room to stand beside her yes she said robert baxter killed morag mackenzie and seven years ago he killed craig sinclair i know i met sergeant grant as i came in tam said he turned to look at her the usual excellent work by jenny logan he smiled but he could see that she was still serious thanks she said but im sure that ronnie campbell wishes the edinburgh police had done some excellent work seven years ago what will happen to him asked tam well first we have to look at the sinclair murder again that will be easy because baxter has told us everything then campbell will go free i dont think were going to worry too much about his escape from prison or his stealing a car hes had seven years in prison for something he didnt do will he get some money for the time he was in prison asked tam quite a lot i should think said logan id rather be free for seven years than have a lot of money tam said i think ronnie campbell would agree with you said logan she turned and looked into his eyes anyway thanks for your help they were good friends so she moved forward and kissed him softly on the lips his arms came up round her body and he held her to him after a minute she moved back a little what about that dinner invitation he said smiling i hadnt forgotten she said her hands still on his arms im tired lets go back to my place first and decide where to eat later the end
