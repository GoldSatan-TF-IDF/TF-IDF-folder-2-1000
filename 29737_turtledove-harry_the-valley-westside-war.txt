the valleywestside war harry turtledove one as dan neared the top of the sepulveda pass he saw the barricade the westside had built across the his deerskin boots scuffed on the old cracked sunfaded asphalt weeds even bushes sprouted from the cracks but the freeway was still the best route south from the valley or it had been till the westsiders blocked it they saw the valley war party coming horns blared an alert men ran back and forth behind the barrier some of them would have crossbows or longbows at seventeen dan himself was only an archer others would carry modern smoothbore muskets and a few would use old time rifles those were far better than anything people could make nowadays years after the fire came down but the ammunition was two lifetimes old too sometimes it worked the way it was supposed to sometimes it didnt do anything and sometimes it blew up you needed to be several different kinds of brave to carry an old time gun captain kevin raised the truce flag he hadnt brought along enough men to rush the barricade he couldnt have come without a good escort though not unless he wanted to lose face the game had rules big louie strode out in front of the flag he had an even bigger voice parley he bellowed we want to talk he stepped back looking proud of himself a westside herald shouted back come ahead with no more than ten his voice sounded thin after big louies the valley man looked prouder than ever captain kevin chose two riflemen four musketeers and four archers you had to have some of each that was what democracy was all about he pointed to dan as the last archer having a youngster among the veterans helped show he wasnt scared the barricade looked stronger than first reports suggested the westsiders must have worked hard to make it taller and thicker dust kicked up from dan s boots it was summer and hot and dry sweat ran down under his broadbrimmed hat turkey vultures circled overhead once upon a time men had flown too they could still get gliders into the air but it wasnt the same theyd really flown in the old timeflown at peace flown to war the songs and the old books all said so and everybody knew the fire came down from the sky close enough a westside officer yelled that you morris captain kevin called colonel morris if you please like most of his kind the westsider sounded snooty dan thought of things that way anyhow westsiders said valley people were a bunch of hicks to dan that only proved how dumb westsiders were well colonel morris your wonderfulness you can tear down this wall captain kevin said king zev and the council say thats how its got to be we have a treaty to keep the pass open and you people are breaking it we wont put up with that we know our rights we do better believe it dan thought the barricade would cut the valley off from trade and from scrounging farther south if you didnt scrounge how were you supposed to keep going so much the old time made was better than its modern equivalents everything from coins to mirrors to guns people had scrounged a jot and time had ruined a lot but not everything there werent that many people any more and thered been even fewer right after the fire came down times they are achanging colonel morris said weve got some things of our own going on if you want to come south youll have to pay to pass thats simple we wont do it and if you think youre coming north youre crazy captain kevin declared who wants to come north the westsider said scornfully good luck with your oranges good luck with your greens good luck with your grain captain kevin told him you need us worse than we need you colonel morris replied westsiders always said that maybe it was even true back before the fire fell not many valley people thought it was any more the way things were going it looked as if both sides would find out what was really what before too long theyd find out the hard way too captain kevin scowled you wont get away with this i can tell you that right now we know what our rights are if we have to well go to war to make sure the pass stays open and if we go to war well win it thats telling him dan muttered the musketeer next to him nodded you can try colonel morris didnt sound worried did that mean he really wasnt or did it just mean he was a good liar most westsiders werevalley people thought so anyhow thats your last word captain kevin by contrast sounded sad and mad at the same time thats my first last and only word the westside commander said well im sorry for you but youll be sorrier captain kevin nodded to his soldiers come on boys if theyre going to be dumb well teach em a lesson the soldiers turned around and marched back toward the rest of the valley company behind them the westsiders jeered and swore dan got an itchy spot right in the middle of his back if they started shooting his leather jerkin wouldnt keep out an arrow much less a bullet but they didnt he breathed a sigh of relief when he got out of arrow and musket range oh a rifleman could still hit him but riflemen would go after important targets first a kid with a bow was no big deal whats the word sir a waiting valley sergeant asked war captain kevin answered liz mendoza hated this los angeles being here working here was like being best friends with one identical twin and then suddenly having to visit the other one in the intensivecare unit in the home timeline where she lived los angeles was one of the great cities of the world even a hundred years ago back in the twentieth century people said the future happened here first and they were right this los angeles had been much like that one up till then in this alternate somebody got stupid people in what was left of the usa said the russians fired the first missile people in what was left of the ussr said the americans started the war it hardly mattered any more both sides had fired way too many quite a few alternates went through nuclear wars in the second half of the twentieth century or the first half of the twentyfirst crosstime traffic stayed away from most of them the company that controlled trade between the home timeline and the worlds that happened when history changed didnt see much profit in dealing with them why would you want to do business with somebody whod set his own house and car on fire and then jumped into the flames here though ucla was paying the freight indirectly the government was the university had got a grant to try to find out just what went wrong in this alternate liz s father was one of the historians whod come here to do research her mother was a doctor who specialized in genetic diseases and the effects of radiation and liz was protective coloration she thought her parents seemed more normal if they had a kid along and so here she was she had studied a lot more about the s than she would have otherwise it was in the ancient slang of the day a mindblowing experience except that slang wasnt ancient here people still used it they used whatever they could from the days before the war because they mostly couldnt match that stuff whether material goods or language any more sad but that was how things were in this alternate shed start ucla herself a year later than she would have otherwise but shed start with a year of crosstime experience under her belt that was good or it would have been good if shed gone to an alternate more different than this one was the house where she and her folks stayed was in westwood village a couple of blocks south of the ucla campus it was made from the rubble of the stores and apartments that had stood there when the bombs fell the house was built around a central courtyard the style came from rome through spain to the new world it gave both light and shade and worked well in the california climate the windows that looked out on the world were small and barred liz could see the ucla campus through the northfacing ones she could yes but she didnt look that way very often it hurt too much most of the big hospital buildings at the south end of campus never got built in this alternate the war took care of that as it took care of so many other things the buildings that did survive were in sad disrepair some of the earlier ones built before there were any earthquake codes had crumbled in one shaker or another somebody banged on the big brass knocker bolted to the front door you want to get that liz her father called well no not really was the first thing that crossed her mind but that was the wrong answer and she knew it okay she said out loud and went to the door before she opened it she looked through the little window set above the knocker the westsiders patrolled westwood village pretty well but robber bands still skulked in other ruins and came out to raid every now and then there were freelance thieves too she relaxed when she recognized the man standing in the street unbarring the door she said come in colonel morris thank you missy the westsider said in the home timeline that would have made liz want to spit in his eye here he was just being polite his english sounded oldfashioned to her the language here hadnt changed as much since as it had in the home timeline dad she yelled its colonel morris be right there her father said hello jeff how are you doing colonel morris said when liz s father came to the door not too bad yourself jeff mendoza held out his hand to the important westsider when colonel morris took it his clasp also locked thumbs with liz s father handshakes like that were an ancient joke in the home timeline they hung on here both men wore baggy wool trousers tucked into boots and equally baggy linen shirts colonel morris used a wide leather belt with a fat fancy brass buckle he wore an old time windup wristwatch on a broad leather band westsiders couldnt make anything that fine but they could keep some that were already made running dads belt looked like the colonels some styles here still reflected the ones in fashion when the fire fell so did some of the language some things had changed though liz s wool skirt reached to the ground minis were scandalous her shirt was like the mens it even buttoned the same way which drove her crazy liz why dont you get us some improved water her father said okay she said once more men ordered women around here a lot more than they did in the home timeline women mostly put up with it the ones who didnt got thumped and nobody said a thing except that they had it coming the people who went on and on about how enlightened the westside was were all men liz poured water from a big earthenware jug into two earthenware mugs with the aqueducts gone water was always the biggest worry in this los angeles she added one part strong brandy to about five of water the brandy was what improved it not because the booze got you drunkbrandy did that much faster by itselfbut because it killed enough germs to keep you from getting the runs she politely served the guest first here you are colonel groovy sweetheart he said and she didnt crack a smile if somebody in had heard someone else say bully by jingo it would have sounded just as oldfashioned in his ears thank you her father said when she gave him his water you didnt have to talk like a hippie here you didnt have to nobut you could dad turned back to colonel morris what can i do for you sir youll have heard its probably war with the valley ive heard it i hoped it wasnt true dad answered well it is colonel morris said were going to collect a toll at the top of the pass and they dont like it i hope well be able to buy some more of those fine muskets and revolvers you sell theyre the next best thing to old time guns ill see what i can do liz s father said as far as anyone here knew the guns he sold came up from a cousins shop in sandago they really came from the home timeline people there used them as trade goods in several lowtech alternates dad went on do you really need the toll enough to fight to keep it the city council says we do the city council was the band of nine nobles who ran things in the westside the title made it sound as if they were elected but they werent a lot of names from the days before the war hung on even if they pointed to different things now colonel morris added im loyal to the council and obey its orders of course of course dad didnt even sound sarcastic the westside officer had to say stuff like that the city councils spies were everywhere colonel morris couldnt know dad wasnt one of them do you really have to follow orders even when theyre dumb liz asked colonel morris blinked dad sent her a look that said shed got out of line a mere girl wasnt supposed to challenge authority for that matter nobody in the westside was supposed to thats a heavy question sweetie colonel morris said by which he meant it was important when he said sweetie he meant liz wasnt she was only a girl somebody he could patronize she wanted to pick up a chair and clout him over the head with it maybe that would knock sense into him or maybe not instead she smiledsweetlyand said well have you got an answer for it dad coughed she wasnt supposed to push like this she didnt much care not when the westsider insulted her without even knowing he was doing it i have the only answer i need colonel morris said whatever the city council tells me to do i do it im just following orders how many people in how many alternates said the same thing how much grief did they cause when they did too much liz knew that how long will we have to wait for the guns the colonel asked liz s father he tried to ignore her now was that better than patronizing her was it worse was it as bad in a different way itll be a while sir jeff mendoza answered long way down to sandago it wasnt even two hundred kilometers if traffic on the wasnt bad you could get to san diego in a couple of hours you could in the home timeline anyhow if you were traveling in a horsedrawn wagon in this alternate the town with the rubbeddown name was more like a week away well do what you can colonel morris said we need those guns especially the sixshooters see you later he sketched a salute to dad nodded to liz and left after the door was barred behind the local dad turned to liz and said you cant poke him with a pin whenever you feel like it you know i guess not she said but he ticked me off he didnt even realize he was doing it thats the point liz said i sure knew what am i going to do with you her father sounded half annoyed half amused send me home i dont like it here very much liz answered or if you cant do that let me go up to the campus you know we wont send you home you know you dont really want to go home too now dad donned patience like a suit of armor the most annoying thing was he was right she wanted the year of crosstime service on her college applications even if she didnt like coming here to get it dad went on sending you up to ucla wasnt so simple either what we had to pay to get you a stack pass liz sighed what is simple her father gave her a hug welcome to the world sweetheart groovy she said as sardonically as she could he only laughed along with the rest of captain kevin s men dan marched back to the barracks in the sepulveda basin piles and piles of sandbags were stacked close to the halls most of the time the sepulveda basin was as dry as the rest of the valley but it could flood in a hurry when the rains came down the sandbags had saved the barracks more than once over the years no rain now not in the summertime the valley was full of cisterns to hold the rain that had fallen the winter before watermasters doled it out to farms and families in years with dry winters everyone worried about whether thered be enough for cropsand for people back in the old time irrigation had brought water from hundreds of miles away everybody in los angeles had had plenty all the houses and apartments and factories and shops showed as much there were far more of them than the people who lived here now could ever hope to fill all over la in all the little countries that had sprung up since the day the fire fell scavengers scrounged through the swarms of abandoned buildings for whatever they could find something occurred to dan hey sergeant he said if sergeant chuck didnt know everything he didnt know he didnt know it what is it kid the three stripes on his sleevegenuine old time stripes machineembroideredgave him the right to treat everybody below him the way dan s father treated him before he got drafted is it true what they say about swimming pools you mean did the old time people really fill those cement holes in the ground with water and swim in them they didnt just use em for cisterns or put dirt back in em yes sergeant thats what i mean dan nodded oh its true all right sergeant chuck nodded too solemnly ive seen pictures in old time magazines that proved it all right unless were they fortrue magazines well i sure think so the sergeant answered they had other things that sure are realcars and things you know oh yeah dan nodded you couldnt not know about cars their rusting corpses filled the streets to this day they were the main source of iron for blacksmiths their wheelswith tires of wood not the rubber that had rotted awaystill turned on carts and wagons glass from their windows gave homes light to this day i wonder how they moved so fast all by themselves though well who doesnt chuck said mustve been something like a steam engine i expect big puffing steam engines pumped water a few of them moved engines along railroads but so many rail lines were broken and so many bandits prowled the routes that railroads often seemed more trouble than they were worth how did old time people keep railroads from getting raided dan asked i dont think they did the sergeant told him you know the story of jesse james and annie oakley dont you little orphan annie i hope i do dan said well they were train robbers right they were dan admitted but they got caught and paid the price jesse did anyway annie married judge warbucks and got off too many robbers these days never even get caught too many places for bad guys to slip through the cracks sergeant chuck said what youve got to remember is back in old time days this was all one countrythe valley and the westside and burbank and speedro all the way from sandago to frisco even vegas all one country bad guys couldnt just skip over a border and disappear like uhhuh dan had learned that in school and there were big stretches of land now that didnt belong to anybody except bandits and brigands anyhow if people other places would just admit zev was their rightful king chuck laughed dont hold your breath the westside wants the city council to run everything burbank s got a director and a producer all the other countries think they ought to be top dog too but they dont know what theyre talking about were the only really civilized one dan had learned that in school too well sure chuck had probably also learned it in school most people in the valley had four years of education quite a few had six or even eight dan did he could read and write and add and subtract and even multiply and do long division adding and subtracting always came in handy he didnt know if hed ever use the fancier stuff but he had it if he needed it and reading nothing killed time better than reading back in the old time theyd had tv and the movies and radio and records to make time go by a few records still played on windup phonographs the other things werent even memories anymore because nobody still alive recalled using them but old people remembered their grandparents talking about them and old time books and magazines mentioned them all the time they had to be fortrue sergeant chuck broke into his thoughts if i were you dan id start practicing hard a good archers worth about as much as a musketeer do you think therell be a war honest dan asked sure do the sergeant answered king zev wont let the westside close the pass thats too big a slap in the face to put up with if those snooty soandsos get away with it next thing you know burbank ll start pushing us around too its a good thing they put these barracks on victory boulevard dan said yeah thats heavy all right chuck agreed talk about your good omens cant hardly get a better one dan said some old time books seemed to laugh at the idea that anyone could foretell the future but the bible didnt whether you were christian or jewish you had to believe in prophets and plenty of decks of tarot cards floated around some printed before the fire came down and others cruder afterwards dan snapped his fingers talking about omenscan i ask you one more thing go ahead sergeant chuck was in a good moodmaybe he looked forward to a war with the westside does king zev really have a magic eight ball to help tell him what to do he doesnt have just onehes got two chuck declared my cousins a preachers assistant and he knows stuff like that two wow oh wow dan hadnt dreamt the valley was so rich you better believe it chuck said and what he does is he asks both of them the same question and then he sees how each one answers if thats not scientific i dont know what is scientific dan s voice went all dreamythere was a word to conjure with and plenty of wizards and fortunetellers did just that well if we dont have the vitamins to beat the westside with two magic eight balls i dont know what else wed need soldiers sergeant chuck told him whatever else youve got you always need soldiers walking up hilgard to the ucla campus made liz want to cry it was like walking past the skeleton of a good friend you knew who it was if you tried you could picture what the personor the placehad looked like alive but all you saw was death the asphalt was so old it was nearer white than black here and there it had washed out altogether cobblestones replaced a few stretches others were just dirt cracks seamed even intact asphalt like the wrinkles on a greatgrandmothers face cracks also marred the concrete of the sidewalk back in the home timeline liz would have gone past the botanical gardens and some nicely watered lawns across the street here most of the imported plants in the gardens were dead killed off by las summer droughts no one here had a lawn that was green in the summertime there was no water to spare for such luxury from november to marchin a wet year to may things were green any other time brown sorority houses and rich peoples homes stood across the street from the campus in the home timeline some of the buildings still stood here a couple of the old sororities even had their greek letters on the front wall nobody in this alternate seemed to know what they meant any more they werent sorority houses and rich peoples homes any more not here guards stood outside one of themit was the westside jail smoke poured from another oneit was a smithy and armory and made a lot of the weapons the local army used several homes were armored with ironsome old sheet metal some taken from dead automobiles members of the city council lived in those as far as liz was concerned they took a mans home is his castle too far the rulers of the westside didnt seem to take chances about how well loved they were turning left onto the actual campus was both a relief and a bigger wound parts of the north end seemed hauntingly familiar everyone in the home timeline called bunche hall the waffle because of the square windows in the south wall that stuck out from the brown stone surface the building remained intact here too only a few of the windows did though there was also another differencea subtler one between the two versions of the same building down at the bottom of bunche hall in the home timeline there was a bust of the diplomat and his name and the dates of his birth and death everything here was the same except the date of ralph bunche s death was missing he was still alive when the war started and after that nobody cared the that remained seemed asymmetrical the artisan who put it up had figured it would look fine once bunche died in the home timeline he was right liz wondered whether ralph bunche ever saw the building named for him if he did what did he think of the way that nameless artisan had laid things out wouldnt it have seemed as if the man was just waiting for him to keel over it felt that way to liz anyhow her goal lay beyond bunche hall and to the left as she came up from the south in the home timeline it was the young research librarythe yrlnamed after a twentiethcentury administrator here it was the university research library or url they hadnt got around to naming it for the otherwise forgotten young before the missiles started flying five stories worth of books and periodicals what better place to try to figure out why things went wrong in this alternate the westsiders had an almost superstitious respect for what they called old time knowledge they took care of what the url held as best they could most of it was still intact a guard outside the door nodded to liz shed been here before he had an old time on his hipthat was how important the westsiders thought the lrl was liz had sometimes wondered if computer urls got their name from the university research library that turned out not to be true only an interesting coincidence once upon a time the plateglass door by the guard station had been automatic no more no infrared beam to cut no electricity to power the door even if there were a beam nothing but muscle power and fading memories liz pulled the door open and went in her eyes needed a few seconds to get used to the gloom in the foyer some ol the lamp fixtures in the ceding still had fluorescent tubes in them maybe some of the tubes still worked but no electricity had flowed through them since the fire fell the light inside the entrance hall came from the doorway and from the flickering oil lamps and candles soot caked thick on the walls above them said theyd burned there for a long long time in the home timeline studentsand other people who needed to find things they couldnt track on the netwould have bustled through the library and gathered in front of the elevators only a couple of people here wandered across the foyer the elevators of course were as dead as the door and the fluorescent tubes if you wanted to go upstairs here you literally had to go up the stairs a stair dragon waited at the bottom he called himself a librarian but he was really a stair dragon you had to placate him before you could go up and hed search you when you came down again to make sure you werent stealing books stack pass he growled as liz came up he breathed smoke toohe was puffing on a fat cigar liz thought he smelled gross tobacco was a popular crop and trade good here and why not in this alternate other things were likely to kill you before cancer or heart disease could to make sure he didnt start breathing fire liz showed him the family stack pass it had cost her father a pretty penny in bribes but good whiskey and windup alarm clocks and other goodies from the home timeline made getting what you wanted here pretty easy thank you go ahead the stair dragon actually smiled the stink of his smoldering cheroot chased liz up the stairs she coughed a couple of times wishing she needed to go all the way up to the fifth floor so she could escape it but the magazines she wanted lived on the second floor and the nasty smell was bound to keep coming up after her study desks and chairs and tables all stood near the southfacing windows sunlight was the best light by which to work here and the library shut down after dark the desks and the tables dated back to the old time a few of the chairsthe plastic ones with metal legsdid too most of those had cracked or worn out since though that didnt bother liz the wooden ones the westsiders had made since were more comfortable anyhow when liz did go back into the stacks the musty smell of old paper filled her nostrils it was stronger here than it would have been in the home timeline no climate control here so the paper aged faster a lot of books on the top floor were damaged beyond repair because the roof leaked down here that wasnt a worry anyhow she pulled out a bound volume of newsweek magazines that ran from january to march of the war had startedand endedin the summer nobody at the url had bound the issues for april to june or if somebody had the volume had disappeared before crosstime traffic discovered this blighted alternate liz wanted those or the equivalent from time or life or look or us news amp world report she was stuck with what she had though she carried the bound volume back to a table she was the only one there so she could open the volumecarefullyand start scanning pages with a handheld scanner that sucked up data the way a vacuum cleaner sucked up dust if a local did see her doing that he wouldnt understand it neither this alternate nor the home timeline had known how to make handheld scanners in transistor radios were still pretty new she saw an ad for one it was bigger than an ipod and couldnt do one percent as much it didnt even have an fm band only am and the ad said it was a technological breakthrough the scary thing was maybe the ad was right the vietnam war dominated the news it would have done the same thing in the home timeline liz didnt know exactly how what had happened here differed from what happened in the home timeline that was why she was sucking up data computers could compare the text here to what the same issues said in the home timeline once they figured out how things had changed they would have a better chance of nailing down where the breakpoint layin the meantime in the meantime liz was unskilled labor all she had to do was slide the scanner over one column after another it did the real work if she wanted to stare at the strange clothes and hairdos and the funky lines of the cars she could if she wanted to pause and read something interestinglooking she could do that and as long as the mellow sunshine poured in through the windows if she wanted to pretend she was at the other ucla the right ucla well she could almost do that too king zev wasnt much to look at dan had been much younger than he was now when he first realized as much zev was short and round not tall and heroic the way kings in stories usually were zev was going bald his beard was scraggly and streaked with gray he had a big nose but when he dressed up in an old time business suit and necktie when he put a top hat on his head he looked dignified even if not quite handsome and he owned a big booming voice the kind of voice a lot of tall heroic kings would have envied he hardly needed the gilded megaphone of state to get what he wanted to say out to the people and the army of the valley along with the other soldiers whod gone down to the westsides barricade across the dan sat close to the podium from which king zev spoke their tobaccobrown uniforms were a good match for the dirt and the sunblasted shrubs and bushes all around most ordinary people wore homespun which also went well with the open space some richer men though had on old time shirts of nylon and trousers of polyester the old time fabrics could wear out and fray but bugs and mildew didnt bother them and the colors and patterns on some of them drove modern weavers and dyers mad with jealousy the westside wont get away with it king zev roared through the megaphone we wont let the westside get away with it will we no dan yelled along with the other soldiers the ordinary citizens shouted too but not so loud down in the westside they think they can break treaties whenever they want to the king said they think they can make us pay for whats always been a freeway they think were too spineless to care are they right no dan yelled again louder than ever i cant hear you king zev cupped a hand behind one ear no this time dan yelled so loud it hurt all around him other young men in uniform were shouting themselves hoarse too king zev smiled all right good he said far freaking out weve told them we wont stand for it but they dont want to listen so what are we like going to do about it fight em dan bellowed the other soldiers were shouting things like kill them and nuke em and smash em to bits zevs smile got wider thats just what well do ive given ambassador mort his walking papers he can go down there and tell the westside city council our soldiers will take care of their miserable stupid wall everybody cheered no one liked the ambassador much even for a westsider he was pompous he seemed to think getting sent to the valley was a punishment not a diplomatic appointment he walked around as if everything up here smelled bad send him back where he belongs dan yelled the soldiers sitting near him laughed and clapped im going to send him back zev said picking up on dan s shout that made dan feel pretty special all the people in the valley were special just because they were lucky enough to live here hed learned that in school too but he felt especially special right now king zev went on and im going to tell him to tell the city council they can look for our soldiers right behind him right on dan thrust his fist in the air in a gesture that came from the old time right on your majesty heavy thats soooo heavy sergeant chuck agreed soldiers and civilians cheered and pounded on things and made as much noise as they could king zev raised his hands the hot valley sun gleamed off the golden megaphone i thank you my people for rolling with me on this one now hed said the closing words it was official it was democratic it was war two what the westside called a city council meeting wasnt like the ones in the home timeline liz didnt think so anyway the council decided whatever it decided and then told the people what that was that was what the meeting was about when liz complained to her dad he smiled a sour smile its not as different as you think hon he said theyre smoother about hiding what theyre really up to in the home timelinei will say that for them the nine members of the city council knew what they wanted to get across what had been the ucla sculpture garden was now the westside assembly area some of the sculptures still stood othersmostly the abstract oneshad disappeared probably melted down for the metal in them ambassador mort was tall and skinny he wore a doublebreasted old time sport jacket over baggy modern pants the valley humiliated me he shouted to the people whod come to the meeting humiliated me i tell you they put me on a donkey with my face turned towards its tail and rode me to the border that way its a shame and a disgrace thats what it is it was also the standard way to send an ambassador home when you declared war on his country mort didnt say anything about that how many of the men and women listening to him knew what the custom was not many liz was sure of that the council wanted to get people all worked up and knew how to get what it wanted a big man named cal was the chairman of the city council he wore an old time jacket tooan ugly plaid one he also wore a big white stetson for no reason liz could see are we going to let the valley get away with treating our ambassador that way he shouted his voice high and quick and glib liz wouldnt have wanted to buy a used car from him i dont think so no way no way no way people chanted they were a claque a group set up in advance to make the kind of noise their patrons wanted when their patrons wanted it they were too loud and too smooth to be anything else when others joined in the chant they sounded differentless rehearsed maybe im gonna sic my dog on the valley cal shouted that was no idle threat cal s dog was famedand fearedall over the westside there werent nearly so many mutations alter the atomic war as people had feared but there were some and that dog was descended from them it was a german shepherd about three quarters as big as a horse with teeth a tyrannosaurus might have envied it was mostly a nice dog but if it got mad feed king zev to it yelled somebody from the claque in a moment that whole group was shouting the phrase again people who didnt belong joined more slowly but they did join the stage managing would have been too open too blatant to work in the home timeline liz hoped so anyhow but it did just fine here so shall we show the valley that they cant tell us what to do cal asked yes thats right bet your bippy people shouted back liz didnt know what a bippy was she wondered if the men who used the word knew what it meant back in it had probably had a meaning now it was just a noise here people said it without thinking about it there were words like that in the home timeline too is it war then cal wanted to make it official war the word came back as a roar that seemed official enough to liz it seemed official enough to the head of the westside city council too thanks folks he said well lick em you wait and see when they got a good look at my dog pots theyll be so scared theyll run away before the fighting really gets going everybody cheered as the meeting was breaking up liz asked her father why does he call that monster of a dog pots because nobody here seems to remember who the fenris wolf was dad said which both was and wasnt an answer he added besides whatever you call a critter like that the dog is bigger than the name there were old childrens books in the home timeline about a dog like that although he wasnt mean what was his name clarence that was close but it wasnt right clifford liz exclaimed where did you come up with that dad said my grandmother had some of those books she read them to me when i was little her mother used to read them to her she said oh wow liz saidin the home timeline a phrase even more oldfashioned than clifford books people still used it here and it did come in handy now and then she went on will the westside win they sure think so her father replied but the valley thinks itll win too or it wouldnt have started the war in the first place i havent been up there i dont know what all theyve got i dont know how serious they are about the fighting either thats one of the reasons people fight warsto find out how serious both sides are if the westside werent serious it wouldnt have built that wall across the liz said or maybe it just didnt think the valley would think the wall was worth fighting about dad shrugged if it didnt it was wrong and it looks like a lot of people will get hurt because of that if the fighting came all the way down into westwood the mendozas could escape back to the home timeline a transposition chamber would whisk them away in nothing flat the locals werent so lucky they were stuck here they had to hope the struggle stayed far away liz hoped for the same thing she didnt want anything bad to happen to the locals and she really didnt want anything bad to happen to ucla dan watched a couple of officers load an impressivelooking piece of ordnance onto a horses back wow he said whats that the cartridges gleamed in the sunshine each one looked as big as his thumb the weapon had to come from the old time nobody nowadays could make anything like that machine guncaliber one of them answered proudly we testfired it and it shoots great that is so cool dan said i didnt know anything like that was left in the armory it didnt come from the armory the captain said scrounger found it in a house no kidding dan said and the officer nodded dan went on ordinary people could have a piece like that in their houses wow old time mustve been something else that gun might beat the westside all by itself now old time was something else the other officer said oh yes sir dan knew better than to show he disagreed with any officer even when he did but he didnt disagree with this one ordinary people had guns like this the way folks have belt knives now makes you wonder what all the kings no they called them presidentshad though they had the fire the first captain said grimly they had it and they used it and thats how come we dont have so much anymore he was right about that the russians threw the fire at america and then the americans threw it back that was what the schoolbooks said and why would they lie dan didnt know exactly where russia was somewhere far awayhe was sure of that anyhow farther than tj farther than vegas farther than frisco you went a whole lot farther than that you probably fell off the edge of the world schoolbooks also insisted the world was round again why would they lie but dan had his doubts the world sure looked flat to him well bumpy in spots but basically flat the officers with the machine gun looked at him then at each other the second one spoke up i bet youve got something you need to do dont you soldier if you have time to rubberneck well find you something to do oh no sir ive got plenty it was just seeing the fancy gun that made me stop thats all dan saluted and beat a hasty retreat you didnt always have to be busy in the army but you always had to look busy if you didnt look busy somebody would make sure you were he hustled over to the barracks he had a whetstone in his kit he started using it to sharpen the points on his arrows hed sharpened them just the other day they couldnt very well have got dull between then and now anybody who saw him though would think he had plenty of work and didnt need anything more that was the point all right had officers and sergeants been so silly back in the old time dan didnt want to believe it theyd known so much theyd been able to do so many things they wouldnt have wanted soldiers to waste time for the sake of wasting time would they of course in the end the old time folks the americans and the russians had blown themselves up theyd thrown away all their marvels thrown them into the fire in school the books and the teachers said theyd been about to fly to the moon before they went to war instead the moon there were still pictures of airplanes and nobody doubted that the fire hew before it fell but the moon could people really have gone there if they could have if the people of old time could have gone to the moon but chose to blow themselves up instead if they chose to do that were they as smart as everybody always said they were or were they amazingly unbelievably dumb dan stopped sharpening he just stood there file in one hand arrow in the other it wasnt against the law to think the people of old time were dumbnot quite it wasnt against any religion to think they were dumb eithernot quite but if you had a thought like that you probably didnt want to admit it to anybody either people would call you a weirdo or a fruitcake or even a nonconformist you didnt want to get hung with a label like that it could stick to you for the rest of your life whats happening dan sergeant chuck appeared behind him at just the wrong moment sergeants had a knack for doing that nothing sergeant dan started scraping the point against the file again i just saw our machine gun its too much that should be safe and it was wait till the westsiders see it wait till they meet it up close and personal theyll freak out manyou better believe it chuck smiled as if he could hardly wait that was part of what made him a sergeant dan was ready to go to war but he wasnt in any big hurry about it king zev and his officers were the next morning right at sunup dan set his helmet on his head he was just an archernot a fancy kind of soldier at all and yet he still wore a genuine us army steel helmet from the old time if that didnt prove what a rich and powerful kingdom the valley was he didnt know what would the metal facing on his shield came from an old time car door you could see where once upon a time it had said falcon falcons were swift fierce birds so he thought that was a good omen his shirt and trousers and boots were modern but he thought his belt buckle came from the days before the fire fell too captain kevin made a little speech before his company set out when we march today were going to start marching up victory boulevard he said and every step we take till this war is done were going to stay on the road to victory the westsiders cant stop us because were right and theyre wrong were tougher than they are too if they dont know that yet theyll find out up victory boulevard they went along with the rest of king zev s soldiers there had to be two or three thousand men in that army maybe even more they sang as they marched alternating old songs like satisfaction and hound dog with new ones like a mighty fortress is our king dan couldnt carry a tune in a bucket but he enjoyed making noise some of the companies marched south on the when they got to the old freeway they were going to attack the wall dan s unitand he was excited to see the machine gun as wellwent south along sepulveda boulevard instead they could support the troops on the because the road and the freeway ran close together still other valley soldiers kept heading east from what dan heard they would go south by way of laurel canyon the thinking was that the westsiders wouldnt be looking for a threepronged attack the city council down there didnt know how strong and how determined the valley was captain kevin had said it besttheyd find out it was a hot day like almost any summer day in the valley wearing a steel hat sure didnt make it any cooler sweat ran down dan s face drink plenty of water captain kevin called to his men eat some salt too but remember to drink nobody keels over before we go into action right yes sir dan shouted along with the rest of the men he swigged from his canteen and crunched sea salt between his teeth sweat was wet and salty it only stood to reason that salt and water put back what you sweated away for a while stores and apartment buildings lined sepulveda boulevard after the men passed the though those petered out there were some houses on either side of the road their windows empty now of glass looked on the marching men like the eye sockets of so many skulls dan wished that hadnt crossed his mind it gave him the creeps his free hand twisted in a sign to hold evil away his shield and the helmet and his quiver and the long knife he wore on his belt and the pack with his rations in it all started to feel heavy as lead do i really need all this stuff he wondered can ithrow some of it away he tried to imagine what sergeant chuck would say if he did then he tried to imagine what the sergeant would do to him if he did whatever it was it wouldnt be pretty he hung on to his stuff soldiers lined up to fill their canteens at a cistern without those the valley would have been in trouble so would the westside and all the other little countries that made up greater la you had to save all the winter water you could or else youd run low in the summertime a medic poured brandy into each canteennot too much it kept down the runs anybody who improved the water too much caught it from his sergeant after the men drank they pressed on along with her father and mother liz watched the westsides soldiers march toward battle they tramped west along sunset toward the and sepulveda here as in the home timelines southern california the very richest of the rich lived north of sunset there were differences though in the home timeline hardly any of those superrich people had children who joined the army lots of young officers came from that group here they were willing to put their lives on the line for what they believed in in other words they were willing to put their lives on the line for the sake of a wall across the top of sepulveda pass the more liz thought about it the crazier it seemed she wondered what would happen if she said so to one of the soldiers in the muddy green nottoouniform uniforms no actually she didnt wonder she had a pretty good idea shed get arrested for being unpatriotic and things would go downhill from there so leeling like a hypocrite she cheered and clapped her hands one of the standardbearers grinned at her why not she was a pretty girl not far from his age the westside flag had a bear on it part of the bear seemed to come from the one on the old california state flag part from the ucla bruin that left it looking fierce and friendly at the same time but the westsiders didnt care how big is this army liz asked her father i dont know he shrugged a couple of thousand men something like that are they enough her father shrugged again well find out he said which wasnt what she wanted to hear the cheering got louder here came cal and his dog pots the beast looked as if it could eat half the valleys army all by itself behind cal came a horse that carried armor for pots the chunks of iron looked like the ones that had protected horses back in the days when knights were bold and life was nasty brutish and short hobbes liz thought remembering ap euro cal waved his big white stetson well get em he shouted to the people they wont come past us ilsne passeront pas dad murmured that goes back a couple of hundred years i wonder if he knows ask not what the westside can do for you cal added ask what you can do for the westside liz s father stirred again that one rang a bell with her too she remembered grainy blackandwhite video from the middle of the twentieth century even across almost a century and a half of changing hair and clothes styles she remembered thinking how handsome john kennedy was maybe he hadnt been the greatest president nobodyd cared much then or later an aura of glamour surrounded him to this day it did here too kennedy halfdollars werent just coins in this alternate they were amulets only rich men had them and mostly wore them on chains around their necks the coins were credited with everything from magically stopping bulletsmore irony when you thought about itto curing smallpox smallpox liz rubbed at her left arm in the home timeline the disease was extinct but shed had to get vaccinated before she came to this alternate people here vaccinated toothey remembered that much not everybody got vaccinated though and the disease still broke out every now and then the pocked faces of survivors were appalling and people from the home timeline did a brisk business selling perfect copies of kennedy halves yes it was taking advantage of superstition but the superstition would have been there whether they took advantage of it or not in other alternates crosstime traffic sold religious relics of several different kinds what was the difference really liz had trouble seeing any for that matter what was the difference between superstition and religion generally lots of people had spilled lots of ink and killed lots of trees and pushed around lots of electrons trying to define the answer so far most of what they said boiled down to what i believe is religion and what those foolish people over there believe is superstition there was no evidence that knocking on wood made the world less likely to go wrong there was no evidence that praying in a church or synagogue or mosque made the world less likely to go wrong either that didnt stop people from doing both kinds of things when it first became plain that science explained how things happenednot necessarily why but howbetter than religion did lots of experts from karl marx on down predicted that religion would wither up and die it hadnt happened in the home timeline it also hadnt happened in any hightech alternate crosstime traffic had found most people werent rational enough or werent rational often enough to be satisfied believing this was all there was by now the experts doubted they ever would that might prove as wrong as the earlier experts certainty that religion would fail in lowtech alternates religion was the only game in town more and more that was how things worked in this one liz had a hard time blaming the locals for feeling that way what had science done for them here dropped them in the frying pan and turned up the heat and that was about it oh the westsiders still called themselves scientific but they still called themselves democratic too that was another joke except it wasnt funny a priest and a rabbi and a minister marched with the westside army no doubt a priest and a rabbi and a minister marched with the valleys army too and no doubt both sides were sure god meant them to win some things didnt change no matter what alternate you were inand no matter how much you wished they would supply wagons made a dull close to a military parade but no army was much good without them mules and horses twitched their ears as they trudged along it wasnt their war but people made the work anyway they didnt like it not that the teamsters cared the draft animals got even less vote than the people had at the city council meeting after the soldiers and the wagons passed the westsiders started drifting back toward their homes shows over liz s mother said now we hope we dont seen the soldiers for a while cause if we do somethings gone wrong somewhere dad finished for her well yes mom sent dad a dirty look liz didnt blame her she didnt like getting her lines stepped on either the dirty look sailed over dads head the way a badly aimed arrow would have he said lets get back to the house getting back to the house of course meant walking back to the house that was a couple of miles liz more readily thought of it as three kilometersand took more than half an hour going from one place to another here was like traveling in the home timeline in one way ten minutes of travel was a short trip half an hour was kind of medium an hour was long and two hours was a pain in the neck reserved for something that had better be special but how far you went in your time shrank drastically here you traveled on foot or maybe on horseback if you were very rich you might have a carriage some bicycles survived but their rubber tires didnt with wooden tires riding them was a good way to shake your kidneys loose and so you mostly didnt go more than four or five miles six or eight kilometersfrom where you lived as they had in the days before trains and cars and planes people lived their whole lives within twenty or thirty miles of where they were born if this alternate didnt regain its technology lots of little very different peoples would sprout from the ruined tree trunk of the usa that was already starting to happen the westside and the valley werent just independent countries people in both of them spoke english but it wasnt quite the same english people from the valley had a nasal accent that made it pretty easy to pick them out from westsiders by ear in another few hundred years the two dialects might turn into separate languages even if they didnt it was pretty clear that people from southern california would have trouble understanding people from the upper midwest and both those groups would have trouble with the language they spoke in the deep south liz looked around to make sure no locals could overhear when she saw they couldnt she asked is what im getting out of the library helping you figure out just where this alternate split off from the home timeline it will help its bound to her mother answered it may take a while though her father added i envy ancient historians theres only so much for them to know its not like that when you get up into the twentieth century youre drowning in data it does seem plain that the breakpoint has to do with the vietnam war though we already knew that liz said or we were pretty sure anyhow her father nodded it was always a good bet since the big war started while the vietnam war was going strong but it still isnt obvious whether the us escalation here scared the russians enough to make them start throwing rockets or whether the united states threw them first when we didnt like what russia and china were doing whoever shot first an awful lot of people on both sides ended up dead liz eyed this sorry version of the ucla campus and theres been nothing but trouble ever since nobodys going to tell you youre wrong hon her father said at that they got off lucky here they got bombed back to the middle ages but they didnt get bombed back to the stone age they didnt all get killed either mom said that happened in some alternates liz nodded people really could be stupid just in case the home timeline didnt have enough examples of that the alternates offered even more people in the home timeline hadnt been stupid some ways they hadnt tried blowing one another off the map with hbombs for instance they were proud of that and relieved about it too seeing what other people people much too much like them had done in different alternates should have made them prouder of escapingand also more relieved to some degree it did but only to some degree too many people in the home timeline still had axes to grind big wars seemed unlikely these days terrorist strikes on the other hand ive got a question liz said what her mother and father asked together what happens if something now makes the home timeline split into two alternates liz said theyd both have crosstime traffic in them which one would be the real home timeline mom and dad looked at each other they walked on for several steps without answering at last her father said if there are no other questions class is dismissed dad liz said reproachfully were just historians we cant deal with questions like that her mother said you need to talk to the chronophysicists if anybody can tell you theyre the ones talk to them at a convention after theyve got a few drinks under their belts dad added if you get em when theyre in the lab theyll look wise and tell you things like that cant happen i hope theyre right everybody does how will we find out liz asked the same way people usually do i bet her father answered the hard way come on come on get moving sergeant chuck booted dan in the seat of the pants he didnt kick him hard enough to hurt but it was plenty hard enough to wake him chuck went on shouting and booting other soldiers awake dan yawned and stretched and looked around the sun hadnt risen yet but it would soon it was already bright enough to see colors only a handful of the brightest stars still shone and they faded out as he watched he pulled a square of hardtack and some smoked sausage from his pack some soldiers crumbled up their hardtack and fried it in bacon grease he just crunched on his you needed good teeth to do that he had good teeth and knew how lucky he was to have them wounded soldiers got ether before surgeons went to work on them ordinary people with toothaches you needed to be rich to get knocked out before a dentist pulled a tooth that was driving you nuts everybody ready captain kevin called you better be ready cause were moving out dan stuffed a last chunk of sausage into his mouth as he chewed on it he probably looked like a hamster with its cheek pouches full he didnt care he kind of liked hamsters they were a lot cuter than rats and mice they didnt have pointy noses and they didnt have long naked tails either old men and women said their grandparents said there hadnt been any wild hamsters before the fire fell there also hadnt been any wild iguanas or parrots and lakes and ponds hadnt had any piranhas in them dan wasnt sure he believed that wasnt it like saying thered been a time without possums and starlings and cabbage butterflies if there had been a time like that nobody remembered it now form up the captain shouted chances are well be in action later on today the soldiers who were about dan s age hurried into place they were as eager as he was older men men whod gone to war before didnt move so fast dan thought that was because they were old that it might be because theyd already seen battle and didnt much care for it never crossed his mind as carefully as if handling gold and precious jewels the machinegun crew loaded their lovely weapon onto the pack horses back extra ammunition went onto another horse when the men waved to kevin he got the company moving be alertthe enemy may have pushed scouts forward he warned that made dan try to look every which way at once old sepulveda gave scouts plenty of places to hide one could lurk in any of those dead houses watching the valley soldiers with field glasses but if one was how would he get word back to his commanders this wasnt the old time he wouldnt have a television or a radio or a telephone handy here and there people did still use telegraphs could a scout have strung wire out behind him so he could click away and pass on information like that dan supposed it wouldnt be impossible but he didnt think it would be easy and how much did it matter as they started to march they moved uphill toward the top of the pass the westsiders were already looking down into the valley if they didnt know king zev s army was moving toward them they were even dumber than dan thought could you be that dumb and live he doubted it that set him looking toward the top of the pass he already knew there was a wall across the was there one across sepulveda too squint as he would he couldnt tell sepulveda was lower than the freeway and didnt show up so well against the sky something howled up ahead in the distance the noise seemed to echo from the brushcovered walls of the pass the hair at the back of his neck stood up is that a coyote he asked trying not to sound scared if it is its a coyote the size of the coliseum sergeant chuck answered the saying reached back to old times the coliseum didnt exist anymore one of the bombs that got la and ended the good days came down not far from it does cal really have a dog the size of a house yes dan was nervous idont know well see what comes out of the tunnel thats all chuck said old sepulveda went through a cliff near the highest part of the pass the westside held both ends of the tunnel dan would have liked it better if the border went through the middle then either side could have blocked the other from using that way through as things were the westside had the edge weve got to beat them thats all he thought then well hold both ends of the tunnel and lets see how they like that a cannon boomed he thought the sound came from near the barricade the westsiders had built it was a blackpowder boom not the sharper crack of old time explosives if you were on the wrong end of a cannonball though you wouldnt care one way or the other come on step it up captain kevin shouted our friends our neighbors are in action well help them out hurrah for king zev hurrah for king zev dan yelled along with the rest of kevin s company he trotted forward another boom this one from near the mouth of the tunnel dan could see this cannonball flying through the air he ducked he couldnt help himself he felt ashamed till he realized the other valley soldiers were ducking too the cannonball hissed over his head and smashed into an empty house with a noise like a thunderclap startled crows flew up screeching spread out kevin and chuck yelled the same thing at the same time that way they wont be able to get so many of you with one round chuck added oh boy dan thought it didnt mean they wouldnt be able to get him it just meant theyd have to work a little harder or hed have to be a little less lucky he wished he hadnt thought of that there wasnt a whole lot of room to spread out in either the cracked asphalt of old sepulveda and the wider expanse of the were the only good routes through the pass wreckage and undergrowth clogged the rest that horrible howl came again holy moley somebody shouted pointing south there he is the dog had to be enormous to be noticed from that far away was it really as big as a house dan wasnt sure it was plenty big enoughhe was sure of that some westside soldiers ran forward with it to guide it toward the valley men then as it saw them or smelled them or did whatever it did to know they were there it ran on by itself they just wore uniforms while it had on armor like a cavalry chargers it easily outdistanced them even so dan reached back over his shoulder for an arrow a heartbeat later he started to laugh at himself as if an arrow would do anything to a creature like that even if by some accident it hit he wanted to run the fearsome westside dog could bite him in half with one chomp a couple of valley soldiers did run their sergeants swore at them which didnt make them stop theyd get in trouble later on they had to think that was better than getting eaten right now then dan heard a sharp repeated hammering noise bang bang bang bang bang the reports were bigger and louder than any hed ever heard from an old time rifle he looked around the machinegun crew had got their weapon down from the pack horse they were banging away at the westside monster dog as if their lives depended on itand they did the dogmonsters growls changed to yelps of agony the beasts armor would have turned arrows maybe even musket balls dan didnt know about ordinary old time rifle bullets he did know the armor had zero chance against the enormous slugs thecaliber machine gun spat in spite of its wounds the dog was brave it kept coming up sepulveda till it couldnt move any more it didnt finally go down till it got within a couple of hundred yards of the valley soldiers by then dan could clearly see the holes the bullets had chewed in its armor and the blood that poured from the holes in the animals hide his stomach wanted to turn overit wasnt pretty that cannon up near the mouth of the tunnel boomed once more the big iron ball it fired clanged off a boulder not far from the machine gun and crazily ricocheted away one ol the men in the gun crew had some old time field glasses he peered through them then pointed the machine gun started banging again dan had no field glasses some of the machinegun rounds were tracers though he could see where they went the red flashes of fire led his eye straight to the cannon the old time machine gun had at least as much range as the modern artillery piece one after another the men serving the cannon fell when the machine gun slopped shooting some of the westside artillerymen stood up replacements ran forward to help them fire the gun the valley machine gunner with the binoculars was waiting for that as soon as the enemy gun crew was complete again the machine gun roared back to life more westsiders went down dan didnt think they would rise till judgment day lets go captain kevin yelled they wont give us any trouble now cheering the valley men ran forward dan charged past the enormous dogs corpse blood puddled underneath it flies buzzed up in annoyance as the soldiers went past theyd already started feeding on the body a few shots rang out from the westsiders they must have counted on the dog and the cannon to hold back the valley troops now that that wasnt working they didnt seem to have another plan the pitiless machine gun picked off their men at a range from which they couldnt answer some of the valley soldiers started climbing up to the dan was one of them what he saw when he got up there made him whoop and stomp his feet the valley men had outflanked the wall which didnt stretch all the way across the pass and the westsiders were running as fast as they could three sound really carried here that was one of the first things liz had noticed about this alternate it had much less background noise than the home timeline did no streets and freeways full of cars here no tvs no radios only a handful of windup record players no factories not really and so when the fighting in the sepulveda pass got going liz and her family could try to figure out what was going on from what they heard so could everybody else in westwood one particular set of bangs made her father frown somebodys got a heavy machine gun he said for a place like this thats a very nasty weapon its a very nasty weapon anywhere her mother said well yeah dad nodded but weve got even worse ones in the home timeline here its liable to be king of the hill king of the pass i mean do you think it belongs to the westside or the valley liz asked yes dad said deadpan thanks a lot she gave him a dirty look which one please well i didnt see it in cal s parade her father answered if he had one he would have been proud to show it off i think if the valley has it liz s voice trailed away if the valley has it the people here were really dumb to go to war dad said unless their hat has a rabbit in it too do you think it does she asked adding i dont want anything to happen to ucla after some thought dad shrugged hon i just dont know if theyve got more stuff than they were showing i havent heard about it but i dont know if i would im just a tradesman after all if the big bosses have any brains theyll keep secrets from people like me if the big bosses had any brains they wouldve known the valleys got a heavy machine gun right liz said her father spread his hands cant argue with you i wish i could ive never thought king zev was real smart but its amazing how brilliant you look when you can shoot your enemies and they cant shoot you back right liz said when she went out into what had been west wood village to shop for produce everything seemed normal enough people werent paying much attention to the bangs and booms coming out of the northor if they were they werent letting on apricots peaches oranges lemons avocados eggs chickens live baby pigs fishsome smoked some salted some youd buy if it smelled okay the sellersmostly womensat under awnings or old time beach umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun seeing what amounted to a farmers market just south of the ucla campus made liz sad in westwood village had probably been the coolest part of la the way melrose was a generation later in the home timeline it got commercial then it got grimy then it got redeveloped and turned cool again even if not quite so cool as the first time around then the cycle started over in this alternate time might as well have stopped when the bombs came down and after it stopped it might have started running backwards without running water to fight them fires flattened a lot of the shops and restaurants and apartment buildings that had stood in the village the buildings here nowthe house where she was staying includedwere built from rubble and wreckage the market had sprung up in one of the fireborn open spaces how much for those avocados liz asked an old lady in a broadbrimmed straw hatnot quite a sombrero but close dime apiece she answered three for a quarter liz had all she could do not to giggle old time money still circulated here so did newer coins on the same standard prices were ridiculously cheap at least by the home timelines standards liz had had to learn about pennies and nickels and dimes and quarters before she came here in the home timeline a dollarthe smallest coin aroundwouldnt come close to buying what a penny bought here and a benjamin a hundred dollarswas worth somewhere between a dime and a quarter no matter how cheap things seemed you couldnt take the first offer that was an insult ill give you a quarter for five liz said they arent very big shed had to practice sounding that snotty the old lady let out a squawk she told liz what a snippy rude thing she was all this was as formal as a dance they settled on four avocados for twentyfive cents the way theyd both known they would but social rules had to be followed even when they made no sensemaybe especially when they made no sense more bangs and booms came from the north are those getting closer liz asked that wasnt in the rules about haggling but it was liable to be more important after cocking her head to one side to listen the avocado seller said i sure hope not that would be a stone bummer yeah wouldnt it liz said she wasnt sure but she did think the noises from the north were louder than they had been maybe that was just her jumpy imagination talking she could hope it was anyhow carrying the avocados in a cloth sack she wandered through the market looking for a chicken to buy meat here didnt come neatly packaged in a refrigerated case at the store if you wanted chicken stew you bought a live chicken and whacked off its head with a hatchet then after it stopped spewing blood and thrashingwhich could take much longer than liz would have imagined before she watched the first timeyou had to pluck it and clean it cleaning it was a polite way to say cutting it open and taking out the guts and the lungs and whatever else you didnt want to eat the first time liz helped do that she got sick she could handle it now but it didnt thrill hernot even close so she dawdled instead of buying a bird right away carrying one back to the house by its feet while it clucked and squawked wasnt much fun either hoofbeats drummed up the road from the west that was more interesting than looking at one more beadyeyed chicken so liz turned to see what was going on a mounted soldier galloped his horse toward the market liz had seen the look on his face before back in the home timeline people whod just been in a traffic accident had that same air of stunned disbelief whats happening man somebody called they beat us the soldiers voice was eerily calm the way those of accident survivors often were they beat us he repeated as if hed forgotten hed said the same thing a moment earlier they rolled us up that stinking machine gun of theirs he shuddered theyre coming well try to stop them but theyre coming before anyone could ask him more questions he rode on he left chaos in his wake men groaned women screamed and wailed some of the buyers and sellers decided they didnt want to hang around anymore several of them looked to the north as if they expected a million valley soldiers to follow hard on the horsemans heels that didnt happen of course little by little the ones who stayed realized it wouldnt but by the time liz bought a meanlooking chicken so she wouldnt mind so much when the bird got it in the neck several more westside soldiers made it back from the fighting in the pass some rode horses others were on bicycles with the wooden tires they used here instead of rubber they all told the same story near enough they would have easily beaten the men from the valley if not for that machine gun with it king zev s soldiers could do no wrong they could kill us from ranges where we couldnt even touch them said a man on a bike how are you supposed to fight a war like that why didnt cal know they had it somebody asked beats me the soldier answered he didnt thoughnever in a million years he paused then added one more telling detail pots is dead that gun chewed up his armor like it wasnt there chewed him up too people moaned and wept when they heard that the monster mutant dog had been a symbol of westside strength for years what did he symbolize now the collapse of westside strength it sure looked that way to liz sack of avocados in one hand chicken legs in the other her head full of news she headed back toward the house she was glad to give her mother the chicken she wasnt so glad to pass the news along moms mouth tightened i was afraid of that remember how your father said a heavy machine gun would be big trouble well he was right liz didnt say that every day she got on well with her father but she didnt always agree with him not even close she paused gulped and asked what do we do if if the valley soldiers come here try to stay out of their way her mother answered trynot to make them notice us try not to get in trouble try to protect ucla if we can how do we do that if were doing all those other things too liz asked this time mom didnt answer liz wondered why she thought it was a mighty good question dan was over the top of sepulveda pass the wall the westsiders had run upthe wall that had started the warlay behind him prisoners the valley troops had taken were already starting to knock it down all downhill from here captain kevin shouted the men in his company cheered the captain meant it both literally and figuratively dan figured the fight would get easier from here on out too and it was downhill from here all the way into westwood and brentwood the westsiders most important northern centers not all the enemy soldiers had given up and run away somebody fired a musket from behind a boulder a cloud of blackpowder smoke told where he hid the bullet hit the asphalt maybe twenty feet from dan and ricocheted away shall we hunt him down sir sergeant chuck asked captain kevin shook his head no it would only waste our time and thats what he wants spread the men out so theyre harder to hit thats all once we finish taking the westside apart this guy will have to surrender too yes sir the sergeant said dan didnt think he liked the order but he obeyed it before long the musketeer fired again he missed again too a musket would shoot farther than a bow but it was less accurate if hed had an old time rifle now but he didnt and dan was glad he didnt before long the valley men came to another barricade across the this one was made of rubble and plainly brand new some westside soldiers crouched behind it aiming to stop the troops from the valleyor more likely to delay them anyhow a couple of the westsiders did have old time weapons they opened up too soon though and warned the valley men dan and his comrades scrambled off the freeway into the brush to either side if they had to work their way past the men with the dangerous weapons then they did that was all and then the machine gun started hammering at the westsiders again with that gun reaching for you you had to be crazy or at least crazybrave to expose yourself to the death it spat some of them were they held their ground and tried to shoot back but the machine gun was too much for most of them to face some of its bullets even punched through the junk theyd piled up to protect themselves so was it any wonder that a lot of them ran away to fight somewhere else another timeor maybe just to save their own lives wonder or not one of the westsiders dashed past dan without knowing or caring that he was close by the enemy soldier couldnt have been more than a year or two older than he was himself dan set an arrow on his bowstring drew and let fly all in one smooth motion the string scraped across his leather wristguard the arrow caught the westsider in his right calf he went down with a wail dan had aimed at his chest still a hit was a hit drawing his shortsword dan ran forward surrender he yelled youre my prisoner it hurts the westsider said it hurts he hardly even knew dan was there pain twisted his face blood ran from the wound dan could smell it as well as seeing it all at once gulping he was less proud of what hed done you give up dan said roughly and then you better give up you reach for that musket its the last dumb thing youll ever do it hurts the westsider wailed again after that he blinked and seemed to realize he had company he looked from dan to the musket hed dropped stupid thing isnt loaded anyway he could say that which didnt make it true do you surrender dan demanded this is your last chance that sounded tough but what would he do if the westsider said no kill him in cold blood he wasnt sure he could he didnt have to find out because the westsider answered yeah i surrender what else can i do will you put a bandage on my leg sure dan said want me to push the arrow through first otherwise the surgeon will have to cut for it and i dont think weve got ether for prisoners oh wow the captured enemy sounded bleak dan would have too were it his leg only luck that it wasnt luck and a heavy machine gun if one of those slugs had hit this guy he wouldnt be freaking out about a nice clean wound hed likely be dead dan had gone past some westsiders whod stoppedcaliber rounds even if the bullet didnt hit a vital spot the shock of getting smacked by something moving that fast could kill well do you dan asked when the westsider didnt give him a straight answer yeah go ahead the other youngster set himself but before dan could sergeant chuck said come on kidget moving throw his musket some place where he cant grab it and get yourself in gear he wont be your personal slave even if you did shoot him youre here to fight weve got other people to clean up the mess afterwards okay sarge dan wasnt sorry to have an excuse to get to his feet he knew what you were supposed to do about an arrow wound but hed never tried it before he didnt much want to either hurting somebody on purpose even if you were helping at the same time seemed harder than shooting at the same person had been that was crazy but it was true he nodded to the westsider uh good luck thanks a bunch the wounded soldier said dan grabbed the musket and flung it into the brush the westsider wasnt likely to go after it lets move chuck gave dan a shove dan got moving the sergeant asked first one you shot first one i know i did anyway dan answered yeah sometimes you cant tell chuck agreed how do you feel about it dan wanted to brag about how heroic he was he found that the words wouldnt come out of his mouth what did come out was i almost barfed he waited for the tough sergeant to laugh at him but chuck only nodded well thats honest he said i felt the same way the first time i did it people who arent soldiers think wars a game the ones who have to fight know better some soldiers brag about what they do dan said most of the ones who brag havent really done it chuck replied some of the others his mouth tightened well some people get off on hurting others theyre good killers they usually arent good soldiers theres a difference i guess dan hadnt really thought about that before a few hundred yards ahead some westsiders were making another stand they couldnt hope to stop the valley army nowor they were flipping out if they thought they could but they could slow down the advance through the pass that would let more of their own men get away come on come on captain kevin shouted we have to outflank them theyll be sorry they tried to mess with us then they he broke off with a howl of pain clutching at his right upper arm the captains hit chuck shouted he and dan werent especially near the wounded valley officer one of kevin s lieutenants spoke up we have to go on our medics will see to the captain that deep voice had to belong to hank he made a pretty good number two man dan had never thought of him as a commander but now he had the chance to show what he could do for the moment he did what captain kevin had been on the point of doing he led the valley men around the makeshift scrape of earth and rubble the enemy had thrown up he didnt wait for the heavy machine gun to make the westsiders keep their heads down instead he used riflemen and musketeers for the same job they did what needed doing too there werent that many defenders which helped when the westside soldiers saw the valley men were starting to slip around behind them they fled dan shot at one of them he wasnt too disappointed when his arrow missed he did think he aimed honestlyhe didnt want to let his kingdom down or anything but he still wasnt sorry not to be responsible for hurting somebody else some of the other valley men were hurting the westsiders dan watched a man go down clutching at his side a valley soldier ran over to him picked up a loose chunk of asphalt and bashed in his head for the captain the valley man yelled he kicked the westsiderwho had to be dead after thatand ran on if theyd won they would have done the same thing to us dan thought he knew that was true the westsiders wouldnt have turned cal s huge horrible dog loose on anybody they loved even so seeing what war was all about and what it did to people didnt make him happy then a bullet cracked past his head it came so close that he felt or thought he felt the wind of its passage while he was being sorry war was so savage somebody on the other side was doing his level best to kill him and the enemy soldiers level best was almost good enough if the westsiders were going to fight how could he do anything else he saw no way they were probably asking themselves the same question about king zev s troops but dan couldnt do anything about that hed been fighting and scrambling forward all day long even so he realized he wasnt nearly so hot and sweaty as he would have been back home people said the weather on the westside was cooler than it was in the valley they talked about the sea breeze dan had never seen the sea he knew it was there but hed never gone down topanga to see it that was an allday journey a lot of the time what people said was a bunch of bull here though it looked as if those people whoever they wereknew what they were talking about it really was cooler once you started coming down the south side of sepulveda pass jeep jeep jeep a scrub jay yelled at him from a bush he almost jumped out of his skin scrub jays lived in the valley toohe saw them all the time but he hadnt noticed this one till it started screeching the way ice ran through him told him how jumpy he was firing picked up again the pass widened out as it got lower there wouldnt be many more places for the westsiders to make a stand before the valley men came to brentwood a cannon boomed the smoke that poured from the muzzle looked like thick fog dan saw fog every so often in the valley there was supposed to be more of it down below the pass the cannonball slammed down onto the scattering chips of asphalt that probably bit like bullets it bounced up the freeway not much bigger than a softball a valley soldier stuck out a foot to try to stop it dont do that sergeant chuck screamed the startled man jerked back his foot just in time the cannonball bounced on why shouldnt he stop it sarge dan asked because he wouldnt thats why chuck answered its still going fast and its solid iron if it hit him in the foot theyd likely have to amputate cause itd smash him to the devil and back again really dan had trouble believing it had he stood where the other soldier was chances were he would have done the same thing he eyed chuck was the sergeant pulling his leg but chuck solemnly raised his right hand by king zev s name i swear its true he said i havent seen it but i know somebody who did he wouldnt lie eitherhes not that kind okay sarge dan believed that chuck believed it whether it was true who would want to find out by trying it the westside cannon roared again a horse shrieked and toppled spouting blood the man on the horse yelled too when its weight came down on his leg dan had been amazed to find out how much blood a mans body held a horses held much more and it was just as red just as scary from behind the advancing valley soldiers the heavy machine gun started up again those big nasty slugs probed for the cannon crew the machine gun had at least as much range as the miserable modern gun the muzzleloading cannon fired one ball at a time after that the crew had to go through a fancy dance to reload it it got off maybe a round a minute maybe the machine gun on the other hand one after another westside artillerymen went down the cannon stopped shooting the westsiders brought up horses to haul it away so it could fight somewhere else later on the machine gunners waited till the westsiders hitched the horses to the gun carriage then cruelly efficient they shot them down you hate to do that chuck said the poor horses dont know whats going on this isnt their fault but if they can help the bad guys hurt you down there in the westsiders shattered lines were they calling the machine gunners the bad guys they probably were the gun had done more to smash their hopes than the rest of the valley army put together bang bang bang that wasnt a machine gun but it was an old time rifle fired from the westside position dan needed a few heartbeats to figure out what was going on then he did the westsider was trying to pick off the machine gunners the way the valley men had nailed the artillery crew he tried yeah but he didnt have much luck the machine gun was just at or just past the extreme range of his piece his bullets could reach about that far but not with any accuracy and he could also fire only one round at a time though he managed several shots a minute when the machine gun answered it put out a lot of lead if one bullet didnt get the rifleman the next would or the one after that a westsider threw up his hands and then flopped down limply over the rough barricade behind which he was shooting was that the troublesome fellow with the rifle the machine gunners must have thought so they kept shooting to make sure hed been killed dan watched the body jerk several times by the time the valley machinegun crew turned the weapon in a new direction the westsider had to be dead another westside soldier scrambled over the barrier to rescue the valuable old time rifle the machine gunners shot him before he could get his hands on it serves him right sergeant chuck said theres a time to show how brave you are and theres a time to use your brains you dont go sticking your head in the cougars mouth not more than once you dont dan nodded the machine gun was much more deadly than any cougar ever born cougars would have climbed trees to get away from the westsiders mutant dog the gun had killed it easy as you please oh wow somebody pointed ahead look at all the houses and stuff some of those buildings were too big and fancy to be houses ucla was down there somewhere its bear had gone into the westside flag dan knew that much it was supposed to be a store of wisdom too how much good had its wisdom done the westside though if the people who lived there were wise would they have picked a fight with the valley dan didnt think so the westsiders were probably sorry now being sorry was easy but it usually came too late to do any good the other soldier pointed again this time to the southwest oh wow he repeated is that the ocean can it be dan s eyes followed the mans outstretched index finger off in the distance where things got blue and hazy the land did seem to end something even bluer lay beyond it the pacific the sea dan murmured awe prickling through him the sea in a moment all the valley soldiers were chanting it the sea the sea how many of them had ever seen it before maybe a few of the officers had and some who came from widely traveled merchant families but for most of the valley men the sea was only a vast mysteryor it had been till now one reason they could see it was that a bomb had flattened santa monica whatever tall buildings had stood there were nothing but melted stumps now dan wondered why no bomb had come down on the rest of the westside that would have taken care of those people once and for all did the westsiders feel the same way about the valley wondering whether they did never occurred to dan more and more panicky westside soldiers ran through westwood village all of them went from north to south none seemed interesting in fortifying the area against an attack from the valley was that good news or bad liz wasnt sure i think were going to get occupied her father said liz thought so too what will the valley soldiers do she asked nervously well they wont shoot up the village and smash things with cannonballs her mother answered if the westsiders tried to make a stand here they would as the sun set somebody knocked on the mendozas door dad opened it there stood cal in his trademark white stetson and plaid jacket a couple of bodyguards with rifles followed him you boys can wait outside he told them as he stepped over the threshold but one of the guards began its okay cal said flatly if i have to worry about these people no place is safe for me as liz s father closed the door cal muttered and maybe no place is the way things are going what can we do for you sir dad asked i hear you have a way to keep things safe for people cal said is that so a stout safe one that looked as if it came from the old time was hidden in a storeroom in fact it came from the home timeline the locals wouldnt be able to break into it though they might torture the combination out of someone dad could also take stuff back to the home timeline if he had to or wanted to he picked his words with care theres safe and then theres safe if someone puts a gun to my head i wont get killed to hang on to something for somebody else no no i understand that cal said but within reason you can right and you can make things hard to find right sometimes if things work out the way they should dad was playing it as cagey as he could liz didnt blame him a bit cal didnt seem to be fussy here he thrust a large leather pouch at liz s father hang on to this till i can come back and get it i hope that wont be long i hope i can rally our forces and lead us to the victory we deserve i aim to try he suddenly ran out of bluster but you never can tell hang on to it like i said if i dont come back for it ill see if i can find some kind of way for you to get it back to me is that a deal thats a deal dad said it wasnt one that committed him to much good cal stuck out his hand dad shook it cal made as if to tip his hat then went out the door and hurried away he and his bodyguards trotted around a corner after that liz couldnt see them anymore what did he give you she asked her father dad hefted the pouch a lot of whats in here has to be gold nothing else that takes up so little room is so heavy he grinned wryly oh it could be lead but i dont think so why dont you look liz said he didnt tell say you couldnt or anything he didnt even ask you not to she watched dad fight temptation and lose the expressions chasing one another across his face were pretty funny youre right he said after maybe ten seconds lets go in the kitchen where we can spread stuff out mom was chopping up tomatoes when liz and dad came in everything here got done by hand liz had found out about chickens the hard way but there were no food processors here no fancy bread machines either making food was work a lot oi work keeping it fresh was even more workno refrigeration either if you didnt want to eat it the day you made it or the day after that you had to salt it or smoke it or dry it what have you got there mom asked she seemed glad of any excuse to knock off for a while cal gave it to dad liz answered hes heading into ah political exile dad added he hopes hell be back but hes not making like douglas macarthur hed better not not with that hat and that coat mom said so what did he leave behind were going to find out dad opened the pouch and spilled its contents onto a table with a formica top and iron legs with peeling chrome trim an old time relic some of the gold that spilled out was old coins some was rings and bracelets and necklaces some was just lumps where a goldsmith had melted stuff down so youre deeper into the banking business mom said to dad looks that way he agreed anything else in the pouch hope maybe liz had been studying greek mythology and it rubbed off ill find out her father reached inside he pulled out a folded sheet of paper it was modern not from the old time ironically that meant it would last better it wasnt cheap wood pulp that started turning brown the day it got made instead it came from old rags the way paper had when it was just invented as dad turned it over liz saw a wax seal and some upsidedown writing on the other side what does it say she asked open only if you know im dead dad answered are you going to pay attention to that mom asked he thought about it then nodded he didnt look very happy though i guess i am he said cal might come back and get his stuff yeah and then you wake up mom wasnt sarcastic very often but she could be dangerous when she let fly as if to underscore what she said bursts of gunfire came from the northfrom not nearly far enough away screams said somebodyd been wounded running feet and galloping hooves added to the racket outside as far as liz could tell they were all going from north to south if those werent more westsiders getting out while the getting was good liz would have been amazed see mom said dad spread his hands palms up this is now who knows what things will look like next year or even next week maybe the valleys machine gun will break down maybe itll run out of ammo or maybe the westsiders will scrounge one of their own cal wont be happy if he comes back and finds out weve been snooping youre no fun liz s mother said besides cant we match the seal and put it back so he never finds out we peeked its not as simple as you make it sound dad answered liz happened to know he was right sealing wax was lowtech which didnt make it a bad security device oh you could beat it if you took a mold of the existing seal before you broke it you could replace it with one that looked the same if you didnt put the replacement in just the same spot though somebody with sharp eyes or a suspicious nature could tell what youd been up to hold it somebody out there yelled was that the nasal whine of a valley accent the man went on dont you move or youll be sorry somebody must have moved because a musket boomed a second later and an anguished cry from right in front of the house said whoever had moved was sorry now search that man ordered the fellow whod warned against moving for sure sergeant that had to be a valley soldier talking they were here in westwood village then cal had got out just in time a moment later the soldier said hes got silver well save me my share the sergeant said i wouldnt hold out on youhonest the soldier sounded offended okay dan keep your shirt on the sergeant by contrast seemed to be doing his best not to laugh he went on that guy need a doctor nope dan answered you got him in the neck and hes dead nice shot thanks they both seemed casual about death how much of it had they seen before how much had they dealt out liz s stomach did a slow lurch as she thought about that and then her heart leaped into her mouth because the soldier dan was banging on the front door and yelling open up open up in the name of king zev four open up dan shouted open up in the name of king zev he didnt know what he would do if the people inside didnt he couldnt shoot through the door not with a bow and arrows the windows were narrow shuttered slits like most modern houses this one rejected the street it would have a courtyard inside from which to draw light and air he might start a fire if the people inside proved stubborn that would fix them trouble was it might fix them too well them and all their neighbors and maybe the valley soldiers too starting fires was easy putting them out once they got going that was a different story back in the old time thered been underground pipes full of water the pipes were still there the water wasnt you couldnt fight fires with buckets and cisterns not if you expected to win everybody dreaded them and so dan dropped any thought of arson even if he was in the enemys country he banged on the door again louder this time open up sergeant chuck had a gun he could fire through the door if he felt like it would he dan doubted it why should this house be more important than any of the others around here then to dan s surprise the door opened a middleaged man with glassesnot common these days but not unknown looked out at him yes the fellow said in a mild voice what do you want uh dan felt foolish which was putting it mildly hed been making noise and acting toughthat was all chuck knew what was what he pointed his musket at the local and growled who are you what have you got in there my name is mendoza the man with the glasses answered im a trader im a peaceable man i dont want any trouble all kinds of things are here if you want them take them things are justthings they arent worth getting killed over i wont try to fight you like you could dan said scornfully but sergeant chuck was thoughtful he might cause trouble if he felt like it dan he said then he spoke straight to the trader youve seen the elephant once or twice i expect could be mendoza said ive fought bandits not a lot of traders who havent but only a fool or a desperate man takes on soldiers especially after theyve won chuck said yes especially then the trader agreed so come inyou would anyhow he stepped aside take what you wantyoud do that anyhow too his voice still easy and calm the sergeant went on suppose we dont just feel like plundering suppose we still feel like killing dan didnt and looked at chuck in surprise hed had his fill of killing for a long time maybe forever but if the sergeant hadnt i hope you wont not in cold blood mendoza replied a certain bleak calm in his voice but if you do well if that wouldnt make me a desperate man i dont know what would how dangerous would he be in a fight maybe more dangerous than he seemed at first glance he was worried plainly he might well be afraid but he wasnt panickedthat seemed obvious and anybody who could keep his head in a tight spot could cause a lot of trouble was sergeant chuck making the same calculation if he brought up his musket now what would mendoza do what could the trader do two or three more soldiers from the valley pushed up behind dan and chuck that made everybody relax the trader might have had some chance against two men against so many more not a prayer and he had to know it he did with a sigh he said well come on heres what ive got i hope youll leave me something when youre through you stay here jerry chuck told one of the new arrivals guard the door dont let anybody else in jerry didnt look happy chuck slapped him on the back dont get all bent out of shape man well share with you and you wont get any less than these guys he didnt say anything about what he would get himself he was a sergeant so he was entitled to more if you didnt believe it you just had to ask him but his promise did make jerry happyor happier anyhow okay sarge i guess thats fair he said the trader led the valley soldiers from the entry hall out into the courtyard standing there were a woman about mendoza s age and another one who couldnt have been any older than dan my wife and my daughter liz mendoza said carefully even more carefully he added they arent loot thats part of the deal what could he do about it if sergeant chuck decided they were loot he could get himself killed that was what but how much of a ruckus could he and the womenthey looked uncommonly alert stir up beforehand maybe chuck decided he didnt want to find out because he nodded and said sure plunders one thing but thatd be something else dan nodded too toward liz hi he said she might not be gorgeous but she was a long way from ugly hello she said soberly youre not like real friendly he said she shrugged i bet id like you better if you werent robbing my house she sounded polite and matteroffact so he couldnt even get mad at her she was telling the truth too one of the other soldiers had gone into a storeroom he came out with a big grin on his face a box in his hand and a cigar in his mouth theyve got smokes sarge he exclaimed far out chuck said tobacco was an expensive luxury the valley didnt grow much because it needed land and water for crops that didnt just go up in smoke but it traded for cigars and pipe tobacco when it could old people said the stuff wasnt good for you but that didnt keep a lot of them from smoking dan figured other things were more likely to do him in than a cigar every once in a while when the other soldier gave him a handful of them he stuck one in his mouth and the rest in a front pocket chuck had a flintandsteel lighter dan leaned close to get his cigar started it was a good one the flavor fine and mild he blew out a happy cloud of smoke then he offered liz one of the other cigars no thank you she said her voice still polite but now with an edge in it for one thing i dont smoke for another thing dont you feel funny about trying to give me something thats really mine to begin with his ears got hot i didnt think of it that way i guess not she answered three words and she made him feel about three inches tall not even his mother could do that when the soldiers found bourbon and brandy chuck limited the plunder there to one bottle apiece we are not going to get too drunk to do our jobs he growled we are notyou hear me yes sergeant dan chorused along with the rest of the men like most people he drank beer or wine instead of water when he could get them he would mix wine with water if he didnt have enough wine to drink by itself drinking water without something in it was asking for the runs but brandy and whiskey were a lot stronger than beer and wine you had to make a pig of yourself to get drunk from beer or wine not with the distilled liquors no wonder chuck warned his men to go easy what other goodies have you got the sergeant asked mendoza with a sigh the trader said ill show you my cash box youd find it anyway chuck shared out the money he took more than he gave any of the soldiers he led but not a lot more he eyed mendoza this is all the bread youve got right of course it is the trader answered deadpan he was lying even dan could see it but chuck only laughed he slapped mendoza on the back youve played pretty fair with us im not going to try and squeeze you for whatever youre holding out gee thanks mendoza somehow managed to sound sincere and sarcastic at the same time ill even post a guard outside to keep you from getting it twice the sergeant went on dan you take that slot anybody else tries to do a number here send em to me all right sergeant dan said but what if its an officer send officers to lieutenant hank chuck said ill let him know where its at with this place okay dan nodded he had his orders he would follow them and maybewho could say liz would come out while he was standing watch that could be interesting too the shooting was over theyd got robbed by some of the politest thieves liz had ever not enjoyed meeting the valley soldiers didnt even try to pretend they werent looting they took what they wanted and acted as if the mendozas ought to be grateful they didnt do worse the devil of it was liz knew how many different ways they could have done worse if theyd wanted to they didnt hurt us dad said for about the dozenth time thing are just things were all right thats the only thing that matters would he have said that if he truly depended on making his living from what the valley soldiers stole liz wouldnt have bet a dollar on it let alone a benjamin playing the role of merchant lent him a certain detachment a real trader wouldnt have had mom winked at liz i think the kid outside on guard duty likes you oh boy thats all i need liz said they trained you not to get involved with people from the alternates where you worked being people themselves men and women from crosstime traffic sometimes ignored their training from everything liz had heard those affairs almost always ended badly she wouldnt have wanted anything to do with even a westsider the best of them were dirty and ignorant racist and sexist and homophobicby hometimeline standards anyhow those were the standards she had and she stuck to them and the invaders were bound to be worse the westsiders saw them as country cousins people who werent very bright besides they were invaders wouldnt a proper westsider feel like a traitor for having anything to do with them liz got her answer to that the first time she went to the market she saw several westside girls walking and talking with the occupiers they hadnt wasted any time figuring out which side their bread was buttered on older westside women sniffed at them but not too loud liz was reminded of old blackandwhite pictures of german soldiers with parisian girls during world war ii she wondered what would happen if cal and the westsiders farther south drove the valley men out of westwood village again how much trouble would these girls be in plenty unless she missed her guess sergeant chuck had been rightthat cash box wasnt the only money the mendozas had the valley soldiers hadnt found the safe for instance even if they had cleaned things out dad could get more with the transposition chamber under the house no wonder he hadnt worried too much about getting robbed but if somebody took your life it was gone forever with some old coins and some new ones liz bought coffee imported up from mexicoand some green onions the onions were local she carried the purchases back to her house the soldier named dan was doing sentry duty outside he nodded as she came up hello he said hello she answered when somebody with a bow and arrows talked to you you couldnt very well pretend he wasnt there how are you dan asked im all right liz wanted to push past him and go on in but didnt have the nerve bad things could happen if he decided she was rude so she asked how are you too the kid soldiers face lit up im fine he said is it always cool like this here a lot of the time liz said westwood could be ten degrees celsius cooler than the valley in the summertime nobody in america used celsius in this alternate though some thermometers from old time survived but they were all in fahrenheit degrees liz thought they were dumb why degrees between boiling and freezing why was freezing thirtytwo degrees and not zero because fahrenheit was a weird manthat was the only answer that occurred to her is it colder in the winter too dan asked i dont think so it doesnt snow or anything liz said i saw it snow once dan said i was just a little kid it was like the snowflakes were dancing in the air it was so pretty but boy it was cold liz couldnt remember the last time it had got cold enough to snow on the westside she wondered if her parents could that wasnt obvious either if you lived up in the valley you faced weather extremes both ways nodding as politely as she could liz went into the house she felt dan s eyes on her as she closed the door how much of a nuisance would he be or on the other hand how hot and bothered about nothing was she getting if you shot every guy who looked at a girl and tried to talk to her the world would get empty mighty fast she understood that but dan wasnt just a guy back at high school he was a soldier in a conquering army if he got angry at her he could do things a guy at high school never dreamt of after a moment liz shook her head highschool guys probably did dream of things like that but they could only dream dan didnt have to he had king zev s army behind him after all king zev liz didnt know whether to laugh or cry he ruled a kingdom that wouldnt even be a county supervisors district back in the home timeline not that the westside was or had been any bigger he was the most petty of petty tyrants except maybe for whatever was left of the westside city council but his men were here which was what counted now she brought the coffee and the onions into the kitchen thanks her mother said when she set them down any trouble trouble no not really liz answered mom shot her a sharp look something though whats up liz is that dan outside the door again uhhuh hes not really trouble not trouble trouble anyhow i sure hope not mom said do you want to stay inside the rest of the time were here if bad things happen while youre away from the house your father and i cant do much about them till its too late liz shook her head i dont want to do that im here to learn how to take care of myself in the alternates right hiding like a turtle in its shell is no way to go we try not to get stuck in the middle of wars it doesnt always work but we do try her mother said if the choice is between staying in and getting raped or murdered you stay in dan s not like thator i dont think so anyway liz said hes just interested you know what i mean and im so not interested in him hes a local and hes not even a cute local she made a face cute isnt always the only thing that matters her mother pointed out is he smart is he nice hes nice enough i guess liz said smart i dont know we havent talked about anything much more complicated than the weather that was literally true she glanced over at mom do you think i ought to act friendlier to him protective coloration like some of the girls in the market square not il you really cant stand him and i didnt mean throw yourself at him or anything there are lots and lots of good reasons why crosstime traffic doesnt want us to get involved with the locals i know i was thinking about that a few minutes ago these people couldnt do anything with the crosstime secret even if we handed it to them on a silver tray though sure but thats not the only reason why the rules are there they keep people from getting hurt too mom said no matter how you slice it were way different from people in the alternates especially in lowtech ones like this but if you can be friendly without her mother paused looking for the right words without acting like a floozy liz suggested acid in her voice her mother made a face much like the one shed pulled a moment before but then nodded thats close enough if you can it might make things easier all the way around as long as youre not asking me to be easy liz said no no no no even mom made pushingaway motions i want you to be able to live with yourself and to live in a world with dan in it both at the same time if you can thatd be good liz said her mother fed some of the roasted coffee beans into an oldfashionedand very oldcoffee grinder all brass and wood and glass in the home timeline it would have been a fancy antique on a shelf it still worked for a living here mom turned the crank freshly ground coffee started to fill the hopper a wonderful aroma wafted through the air liz couldnt help smiling as she sniffed what a shame coffee smelled so much better than it tasted she thought so anyhow her folks guzzled the stuff get me a canister would you mom said still cranking sure liz pulled a small one off the shelf it was yellow plastic most of the decal of a green and red hen still survived to show which side was the front liz thought it was ugly most people from the home timeline would have she would have bet that most people from the s would have too but nobody in this alternate could make plastic any more here the ugly little canister was a symbol of better days all the locals who saw it exclaimed over it and it had an airtight lid it would keep the ground coffee fresh there we go mom put the coffee in then made sure the lid was on the way it should be now your father and i can pry our eyes open in the morning i wish i could liz said in the home timeline she got her caffeine from cokes and chocolate cokes and other sodas survived here only as legends once in a blue moon chocolate came up from the south but it was much rarer and more expensive than coffee and once in a blue moon a care package from the home timeline included real cokes those had to stayand be drunkin a concealed basement storeroom it lay behind reinforced concrete and had a passworded voice lock the locals werent likely to figure out so she mostly stayed decaffeinated in this alternate when she had to have a jolt she put up with coffees bitterness i dont know why you dont like coffee better her mother said liz stopped listening mom had been telling her that since she was twelve years old and first started trying to drink the nasty brew what was the point of i dont know why you the only answer was because i dont thats why liz had said it again and again it didnt seem to help because mom didnt want to hear it a lot of the time dad would be sensible when mom wasnt not here he liked coffee too and couldnt see why other people didnt where coffee was concerned liz couldnt win and sometimes mom could be sensible where dad wasnt anything that had to do with boys dad wasnt as bad as some of her friends parents but he wasnt good eithernot even close liz hadnt said much about dan to him she worried what he would do if she did itll be okay liz her mother might have picked her fretting right out of her head she wondered if somebodyd hooked up a news crawl above her eyes and connected it to her brain while she wasnt looking well i hope so she let it go at that guard duty in front of the mendozas didnt last as long as dan wished it would have pretty soon things in westwood village settled down the westsiders started getting used to the idea that king zev s men were there to stay and the valley soldiers stopped carrying off everything that wasnt nailed down a lot of men went farther south to hold the santa monica freeway line against any westside counterattacks maybe theyd push past the old freeway themselves that would be something captain kevin s company stayed behind in westwood though somebody had to remind the locals that theyd changed hands one valley soldier got knocked over the head and nobody owned up to it not long after that five westsiders were hanged from lampposts a lot of the posts still stood as they did in the valley but their lamps hadnt shone since the old time next time it will be ten lieutenant hank warned you cant play those games with us not after your soldiers lost nobody bushwhacked any more valley soldiers dan was glad of that he didnt want to walk his patrols always looking over his shoulder wondering if some westsider with a brick or a knife was sneaking up behind him he was starting to realize he didnt make a great soldier oh he could do the job but he liked people too wellhe didnt want to hurt anybody some of the men in his company seemed to think the westsiders had it coming just because they were westsiders dan didnt feel that way liz for instance he got assigned to patrol the ucla campus because he could read a map and wouldnt get lost ucla had a reputation even up in the valley it was supposed to be a place where old time knowledge still lived not everybody liked thattoo many people remembered what old time knowledge had done to the world but when you thought about cars and planes and light that made nighttime bright as day and medicines that made people healthy all the time and all the other lost marvels hadnt there been at least as much good as bad in those days dan thought so and then he stopped thinking about stuff that would never be anything but pictures in books with yellowing pages even the pictures were marvelous he knew what photographs were but hardly anyone could take them anymore there was liz walking south from the direction of the tall building that looked like a waffle on its side he waved hi what are you doing here i was in the library she pointed toward the lower plainer building to the left and in back of the big waffle what were you doing there reading things what do you think id be doing in a library fishing dan s ears heated hed got zinged and he knew it what were you reading about he asked figuring that was safe enough when liz paused before she answered he wondered if he was right what was she doing there looking for ways to make valley soldiers uniforms catch fire or something of that sort dan didnt think anyone could do anything like that but he wasnt sure he also wasnt sure where science stopped and magic started or which worked better few people he knew were after that hesitation liz said i was trying to find out why the fire fell from the sky the russians did it dan said automatically that was one of the first lessons you learned in school hed never seen a live russian he didnt think anybody from the valleyor the westsidehad they lived far far away if any of them were still alive the fire fell on them toolots of it schoolbooks went on and on about the revenge america took ive heard that the russians say we did it liz said before dan could even get madthe nerve of some people she went on but thats not what i meant anyhow even if the russians did do it i was trying to find out why they wanted to blow up the whole world because they were evil godless communists dan parroted another lesson he didnt know just what communists were only that they were evil and godless liz s sigh made him feel as if hed got zinged again but he didnt understand why she sounded very patient though when she asked what would they say about us who cares dan blurted the idea that anybody might care what the russians said had never crossed his mind till this moment neither had the idea that the russians might say anything at all well if thats how you feel liz started to turn away that wasnt just a zing again she made dan feel about three inches tall wait he said if she didnt like him he could deal with that if she scorned him if she thought he was a jerk that was a different story he desperately cast about for a way to go on which wouldnt leave her with the notion that he drooled whenever he wasnt careful he surprised himself by finding one how do you know what the russians say liz pointed back toward the library again a lot of its in there the records are still pretty good those would be records for the old time though dan said and liz nodded see im not so dumb after all he wanted to shout it instead he went on how do you know what the russians say now about what happened way back then this time the look she gave him was cautious and measuring no you arent so dumb does that make you less of a pest or more dan didnt know that was what she was thinking but he would have bet on it traders talk to other traders she said picking her words with care news comes in from farther away than youd think sometimes it doesnt move fast but it moves news ordinary people dont hear dan asked an edge in his voice most of the time he liked being ordinary fine ordinary people were what democracy even king zev s democracy was all about werent they but sometimes being ordinary meant not finding out what the secret stuff the good stuff was all about he didnt like thinking he was on the outside trying to look in no its not news ordinary people dont hear liz told him youre hearing it from me arent you but sometimes traders do hear it first dan thought about that his nod was grudging but it was a nod iguess thats fair he said and then do you have any trader news on where cal s hiding big reward for whoever catches him no i dont know about that did liz speak too quickly now or am i imagining things dan wondered after a moment he decided he probably was he didnt know liz well enough to be sure how she usually talked well go on he said and pointed south toward her house nobody told me people couldnt look in the library im not sure how much point there is to it after all these years but it doesnt hurt anything wow thanks a bunch when liz was sarcastic she was really sarcastic she walkedstalkedpast dan with her nose in the air if shed wounded him with weapons not words she would have left him dead on the halfovergrown paving stones as things were he watched her get smaller and smaller till she finally walked around a building and disappeared even then he had to remind himself to get back on patrol i messed up liz said when she got back to the house i think i talked my way out of it but i messed up what did you do dad asked he was arranging a tray of fancy brass belt buckles the valley soldiers liked them well enough to pay through the nose for them liz explained how shed told dan what the russians in this alternate thought about who started the nuclear war we learn that when we go through training she said it didnt occur to me till too late that he wouldnt know anything about it i should have these on belts dad pointed to the buckles then i could take a belt and give you a whipping with it hardly anybody in the home timeline spanked even little children it was thought of as the next thing to child abuse or maybe not the next thing but the abuse itself but things were different in this alternate as they were in so many kids here got walloped all the time walloped and worse and so for a split second liz thought dad meant it then when she noticed the twinkle in his eyetoo late as usualshe could only glare youre impossible she said thank you i do my best he answered not without pride but you did talk yourself out of it im pretty sure liz said he didnt seem suspicious when we got done jealous maybe but not suspicious i wasnt even lying or not very muchtraders do get news before other people a lot of the time i know that thank you when dad was sarcastic he didnt lay it on with a trowel the way liz did he underplayed instead a lot of the time that made him more dangerous not less after a moment he went on i dont mind if hes jealous envys a nice ordinary feeling it can be dangerous too liz said when the valley soldiers were stealing things here i know that was bad and it might have been worse sometimes you get stuck thats all its not supposed to work this way liz said weve got the subbasement where the transposition chamber comes if we can get down there everythings golden but thats if we can dad reminded her remember all the stuff they tell you in training cause its true life doesnt come with a guarantee anything that can happen can happen to you remembering that stuff and liking it were two different things i dont know how many releases i had to sign before i could get in a transposition chamber at all enough to get sick of themi know that liz said but i figured it was all lawyer talk dad interrupted her again she nodded uhhuh well it is and it isnt her father sighed they make you sign those releases because doing this is dangerous sometimes people dont come back if anyone going out to an alternate didnt promise ahead of time not to sue if something went wrong crosstime traffic couldnt stay in business some alternates look safer than others but you never can tell your mother and i wouldntve brought you here if wed known this stupid war would start would you have come yourselves liz asked dad sighed again yeah probably but thats different were grownups we can figure the odds for ourselves that made liz mad you think i cant youre not as good at it he said which only made her madder he held up a hand dont start throwing things at me youre as smart as youll ever beim not saying you arent what are you saying then liz hoped she sounded dangerous she sure felt dangerous if we were computers youd have as much ram as i do but ive got more programs and files on my hard disk than you do that means i can judge some things better than you can because ive got more data than you do dad grinned one of his patented crooked grins and one of the things you have trouble judging is the idea that you have trouble judging things so how am i supposed to get better at it liz demanded do things sometimes youll be right sometimes you wont with a little luck youll start figuring out why and how you can do better next time its called growing up theres no way to hurry it much sometimes your folks need to give you a hand where you may not know enough to make a good choice by yourself if you were so smart you would have seen the war coming yourselves liz said you can make mistakes too and calling them bad choices doesnt make them anything but mistakes i didnt say it did im not perfecteven if i can play perfect on tv dad winked liz made a face at him he went on somebody whos a little older has more experience and a better chance to get things right thats all but it doesnt matter how old you aresometimes youll still mess up thats part of being human liz wanted to stay angry but he didnt make it easy if hed said he had all the answers and she didnt have any but he hadnt said anything like that hed just said he probably had more than she did and he was probably right no matter how little she cared to admit it okay she said sometimes life was too short for a quarrel i scanned some more newsweeks at the library today thats good her father seemed relieved to talk about more ordinary things too what kind of shape are they in not real good liz answered the papers getting crumbly theyre not as bad as something like tv guidethose fall apart if you look at them sideways but ive got to be careful handling them just the same back in the home timeline magazines like that were preserved in a nitrogen atmosphere they were also scanned so electronic images would survive even if paper didnt here considering what had happened here it was a miracle that anything from before the big war was still around the librarians at this ucla didnt fully understand what a treasure they had they did their jobs as much because their parents and grandparents had done them as because they loved books themselves but in the end why they did them didnt really matter as long as they could preserve things till civilization revived and appreciated them again they were doing something worthwhile whats the name of that book you knowthe one with the funny title liz said not quite out of the blue dad knew which book she meant too a canticle for leibowitz he said yeah that one fits this alternate pretty well and you know what else it was written before the war started so theres probably a copy in the url i wonder if the librarians ever found it liz said five dan gave the little old lady in the market square a dirty look fifteen cents for a sandwich he said what do you think i am rich or something no sir she said but i have to live too you know ill give you a dime he said now she gave him a dirty look but she nodded he handed her the little silver coin she tucked it away and gave him the sandwich thick with ham and cheese and avocado he took a big bite almost in spite oi himself he smiled it was a mighty good sandwich and thinking about sandwiches made him think about money most dimes and quarters and almost all halfdollars were silver but some were sandwiches themselves copper at the core with gray metal like the stuff from which they made nickels on the outside people argued and argued about what those sandwich coins were worth nobody nowadays could turn out anything like them which made some people think they had to be very valuable but they didnt have any truly precious metal in them so others preferred real silver even wealthy traders quarreled over that one the question mattered less to dan than it did to those wealthy traders his big problem with coinssilver or sandwichwas that he didnt see enough of them common soldiers in king zev s army made three dollars a month yes he would haggle over every nickel even if it made little old ladies dislike him shes only a westsider anyway he thought as he walked along munching who cares whether she likes me or not sergeant chuck waved to him pointing to what was left of the sandwich the underofficer said that looks tasty whered you get it that old gal there the one in the blueandyellow bell bottoms dan pointed back toward her shell try and get fifteen cents out of you but shell settle for a dime cool chuck said he made more money than dan here as anywhere rank had its privileges all rightbut he wouldnt end up with a fancy house and a fourhorse carriage and a bunch of retainers either nickels mattered to him too he hurried off to collect his sandwich everything in the market square was peaceable enough on the surface westwood seemed resigned to coming under king zev s rule some people had told dan that king zev s taxes were lower than the ones theyd paid the city council before he thought they were dumb to admit it that would only make zev more likely to bump things up but you never could tell not for sure captain kevin was back on duty with his arm in a sling he went on and on about watching out for spies some of the westsiders didnt want really didnt wantto be ruled by the valley they would pass on whatever they could find out to their friends south of the santa monica freeway line that would mean trouble for the valley soldiers in westwood so captain kevin said anyhow he also said you had to remember that spies looked like ordinary people you couldnt tell who they were by the way they acted either they were supposed to act like everyone elsethat let them do their spying so you had to be careful about what you said around any westsider dan supposed that made sense it wasnt easy though no matter how captain kevin made it sound dan looked around yes there were westsiders within earshot there almost always were unless he talked only when he was in the valley soldiers encampment westsiders would probably hear him and he couldnt just talk about things that didnt matter he looked north toward the ucla campus that was probably worth more than the knowledge any number of spies could steal from the valley soldiers whatever theyd known in the old times the secrets were hidden somewhere in the library werent they and now those secrets belonged to king zev if he could figure them out then what dan wondered would cars start running again would airplanes fly would refrigerators keep food from spoiling would filter tips make cigarettes taste great maybe but if they would why hadnt the westside city council made all those wonderful things happen dan was a good valley patriot he was sure king zev knew more about such things than cal and the other councilmen but zev didnt know enough now to make any of those things happen in the valley a slow smile crossed dan s face king zev s men knew enough to get that heavy machine gun working without it chances were they wouldnt have beaten the westsiders if the ucla library held a book about old machine guns the locals either hadnt found it or hadnt paid any attention to it that liz dan smiled again she hadnt even thought about machine guns shed worried about history of all the useless things that would have been funny if it werent so sad the smile faded faster than it had formed liz said she was interested in history how do i know thats true dan wondered he realized he didnt know it not for sure maybe shed been looking up stuff about machine guns or bazookas or cannons or tanks he wasnt quite sure what tanks were but he knew they were supposed to be very bad news he didnt want to believe that about her but how much did what he wanted to believe have to do with anything she could talk about history all she wanted ii she was really studying flamethrowers or even abombs what she talked about didnt matter dan shook his head she could study abombs as much as she wanted nobody nowadays was able to make them work maybe that meant god loved mankind too much to let it blow itself up twice but why didnt he love mankind loo much to let it blow itself up once then or maybe the people of old times had used up all the atoms there were whatever the reason the fire hadnt fallen from the sky since all kinds of other bad things had happened since then but not that one he pulled his thoughts back to liz he needed to ask her some questions about what she was really doing at the lcla library then he started to laugh if he truly believed she was trouble wouldnt he turn her over to his superiors sure he would a good dutiful soldier would anyhow maybe im not a good dutiful soldier then he thought but if he were a bad soldier he wouldnt pay any attention to her at all would he he didnt want to think of himself as a bad soldier all he wanted to do was get through the time when he had to wear king zev s uniform if he could do that without getting hurt he could go on with the rest of his life once he took off the uniform and if the rest of his life happened to involve liz he laughed again down deep he knew why he was paying attention to her and it had nothing to do with whether he was a soldiergood bad or in the middle liz was about as happy to see dan come to the house as she would have been to come down with a toothache for people in this alternate toothaches were no joke no biological repair herenot even any highspeed drills no novocaine to let dentists work without hurting their patients a few dentists did have ether or chloroform to let them pull teeth without causing pain what that meant though was basically that whenever anything went wrong with a tooth out it came lots of smiles here had gaps in them sure must be a bunch of books in that big old library dan stretched before he sat down on a bench in the courtyard there are liz agreed she could tell he was sweet on hershe recognized the signs maybe if she didnt encourage him he would take a hint and go away maybe must be books about all kinds of heavy things dan went on i guess liz wasnt sure just what he meant by heavy she wasnt sure he was sure either important probably came closest but that wasnt right either all that stuff in there from the old time dan said i bet you could find out a lot about what they knew back then if you could just figure out where to look thats what ive been trying to do liz answered interested in spite of herself i want to know what really kicked off the war yeah thats what you said dan nodded surprises me like that you worry about history and not something you could really use huh liz didnt get it and then she did he thought she was looking for high tech in the university research library that would have been funny if it werent so sad by the home timelines standards the ones she was used to nothing in the url was hightech technology from here was as oldfashioned and outofdate to her as it would have been there but people here had been able to do much more in than they could nowadays her understanding must have shown on her face nodding again dan said now you can dig it right i mean who cares about history when you can look up machine guns but i dont care about machine guns liz saidwhich was nothing but the truth sure you dont dan saidwhich was anything but agreement if you made them dont you think you or your father could sell them he didnt understand about factories how could he in this poor sorry alternate i couldnt make a machine gun neither could dad liz said i bet the westside could if it found out how in a book dan might have been right about that liz wasnt sure one way or the other if they were looking in the library for things like that they wouldnt send somebody like me to find them liz said use your head man theyd send a gunsmith who already knew most of what he needed hed be after the last few clueshe wouldnt be starting from scratch the way id have to by the look on dan s face he might have taken a big bite out of a lemon he hadnt thought of that ahead of time and it plainly made more sense than he wished it did well maybe he said not maybefor sure liz said because i dont know diddly squat about machine guns and i dont care either you should care dan said seriously if the westside had a couple of machine guns you wouldnt have lost the war well sure liz knew she was supposed to be a westside patriot taking the idea seriously wasnt easy why would anybody want to fight and die for a silly little excuse for a country like this but the question once asked answered itself people had fought and died for little tiny countries all through history athens sparta venice singapore lots of others she went on with the truth like i told you i still dont know anything about machine guns youre a trader dan made moneycounting motions wheres the profit in finding out about old time history liz started to answer that then stopped before she stuck her foot in her mouth she sent dan a sharp look he sat there in the courtyard soaking up sun like a lizard he had a patchy scratchylooking beard he didnt bathe or wash his uniform often enough liz didnt bathe often enough either nobody in this alternate did that made it a little easier to take people said that where everybody stank nobody stank it wasnt quite true but it came close enough he didnt have much educationnobody here did but he wasnt stupid after all he might be dangerously smart she hoped her pause wasnt too obvious then she said there isnt much profit in old time history or there hasnt been yet so why do you do it in that case dan pounced like a cat jumping on a hamster its my hobby i guess liz answered some people collect teacups or stamps or old time baseball cards some people have windup trains some of them even still work or ive heard they do anyhow yeah ive heard that too dan said but he didnt sound convinced he looked at her in a way she didnt like at all she would rather have had him following her with his eyes because he thought she was pretty she knew how to deal with that and also knew it wasnt dangerous in any serious way this intent thoughtful stare on the other hand he went on ill tell you what bothers me about yourhobby like it gives you the excuse to go to the library and look for things that could hurt my kingdom i dont want anybody to get away with anything like that can you blame me you bet i can liz thought what irked her was she was telling the truthmostly anyhow she didnt care about machine guns or hand grenades or tanks the home timeline had far better weapons than the ones anybody had imagined in the history of this alternate finding out exactly where its breakpoint was that really matteredto her anyhow but she could see she wouldnt be able to explain why in any way that made sense to dan so she didnt try she just said if youre going to think like that youd better put guards around the library and keep everybody from going in and out its not just me you know lots of people use the books there thats what theyre for and youd better take away all the old time encyclopedias you can find im sure they talk about weapons and things too or do you think im wrong he looked too unhappy to think she was wrong youre saying everyone who can read may be a spy he said slowly he also sounded plenty unhappy liz shook her head most people arent spies fm not a spy for heavens sake im just saying youre on my case for no good reason and i wish you werent it really bugs me man talking that way really bugged her too but she couldnt let on to herself she sounded like somebody from an ancient sitcom sorry he said but she knew he wasnt he went on you got me interested in you and now i cant help noticing the things you do thats what i was afraid ofone more thing liz couldnt say she did say like try fry as hard as you can he gave her a nasty look what would happen if we did search this place as hard as we could she glared back at him she couldnt let him see the threat worried her youd rob us again same as you did when you came in here the first time just cause we cant do anything about it doesnt mean we have to like it thais what you get for ending up on the losing side of a war dan said he wasnt even wrong five thousand years of history and countless alternates proved he wasnt to the victors went the spoils that was as old as the hills and as new as next week it could have been worse too the valley soldiers could have decided that liz and her mother were part of the spoils lots of soldiers would have decided exactly that and then things really would have turned ugly im not a soldier and im not a spy liz said i didnt do anything to you i didnt do anything to the valley or to king zev either i guess not yes dan agreed but he didnt seem convinced but theres something funny about you i dont know what it is but its there you cant tell me its not youre more foreign than most westsiders how come i dont know liz lied she knew much too well no matter how much shed trained and practiced she wasnt a real westsider and nothing could make her one somebody who really did belong to this alternate was liable to notice if he looked closely enough dan had his reasons for looking closely werent the ones that usually tripped up crosstime traffic peoplehe liked her but that made him wonder about her in the same way as if he hated her he scratched the side of his jaw those wispy whiskers rasped under his fingernails she thought the noise was gross but she couldnt tell him so well something funnys going on he said something fishy you know stuff you arent telling youre just lucky its me asking the questionsthats all ive got to say liz shook her head thats not true he glared at her for a split second she saw what he would look like if he did hate her it wasnt pretty but she made herself go on if i were lucky nobody would be asking me questions because i havent done anything to deserve it her voice broke on the last couple of words she hadnt planned that which probably made it even more effective dont cry dan exclaimed which almost made liz laugh instead yes he liked her and yes her cracking voice had done her some good he really sounded alarmed i have to ask you these questions you know he said its my patriotic duty she could hear the capital letters thud into place i think youre using your patriotic duty as an excuse to push people around liz said and how often had men and women done that in all the different histories of the world millions of times more likely billions most of them would have had the purest motives imaginablein their own minds anyhow the people they pushed around might have had a different opinion i am not he said angrily you tell me all this weird stuff about the old timeits not what i learned in school thats for sure and you know too much about the russians and everybody knows how bad they are so what am i supposed to think anyway i know what i know liz said with a shrug and how i know it is none of your business pal i dont know what schools are like in the valley or what they teach you there i dont know what westside schools are like either im a traders brat maybe thats what makes me seem different to you we travel around a lot so if my folks didnt teach me nobody would if you want to blame anybody for the way i think blame them u dan did decide to blame them well so what they could disappear back to the home timeline and so could liz where all do you travel dan asked have your folks ever seen real live russians with their own eyes have you he might have been talking about demons with horns and fangs and tails by the way he asked the question he probably thought he was ive never seen any russians liz said how could i theyre across the ocean she gestured toward the west you could see the pacific from the tops of tall buildings in westwood you could if you felt like climbing all those flights of stairs to get that high off the ground you took elevators for granted till you had to do without them when you were climbing stairs who wanted to go more than four or five flights worth what about your folks dan didnt want to let it alone do they worship devils he didnt say that but it was what he meant i dont think they ever have like i said how could they liz answered but if you really want to know youd do better asking them yourself she wondered if he would talking with somebody your own ageeven grilling somebody your own agewasnt so hard taking on somebody as old as your parents had to be a lot tougher sure dan wore the uniform of a conquering army but dad and mom wore a different kind of uniform the beginnings of gray hair and wrinkles and the invisible armor of experience she could tell he felt the burden maybe i will he said but not in a way that suggested he was looking forward to it he got to his feet i guess you arent trying to hurt the valley i guess he didnt sound sure about that eithernowhere close i dont know just what you are up to but its something funny history he shook his head and walked off toward the door he didnt quite slam it behind him but he also didnt shut it gently liz didnt know whether to laugh or to cry the only thing that interested her about this alternate was its history dan wouldnt believe her if she told him so and she couldnt tell him why it interested her or that she was from the home timeline she had to go on pretending to be something she wasnt even if it got her into trouble the trouble shed get into if he ever found out what she really was would be even worse a rock and a hard place the devil and the deep blue sea damned if you do and damned if you dont they were all clichйs of course but now liz understood how theyd got to be clichйs they put truth into a handful of words she said a handful of words herself none of them helped much saying them made her feel betterfor a little while anyway sometimes you took what you could get even il it wasnt much dan stood in line waiting for a cook to give him bread and fried chicken and sauerkraut he hated sauerkraut it was supposed to be good for you so the cooks dished it out a couple of times a week sergeants kept an eye on you to make sure you really ate it too the stuff even smelled foul one of the valley soldiers in front of dan pointed at the kettle where the sauerkraut bubbled and asked who died oh youre funny the cook said funny like a broken leg you are he also got his revenge he gave the mouthy soldier a burnt piece of bread and a chicken back with more bone than meat and he gave him a big helping of sauerkraut if the other soldier hadnt dan might have joked about the sauerkraut sure he knew annoying the cooks wasnt the smartest thing you could do but there was a difference between knowing and knowing when the other soldier popped off and paid for it that drove the lesson home dan didnt say anything at all he just held out his mess kit he got a plump thigh some unscorched bread and less sauerkraut than the joker had anyway he sat down on what had been a concrete bus bench they had those in the valley too the benches survived while buses were nothing but pictures in old time books and magazines and stories that granddads said theyd heard from their granddads once upon a time when they were little kids no no buses on the streets now no cars no trucks some rich peoples carriages had wheels and axles taken from motor vehicles somethe superfancy ones pulled by big teams of horseswere made from car bodies with the front part the part that had held the nowuseless motor cut off to save weight king zev had a carriage like that its windows still went up and down even a few valley nobles were also lucky enough to travel in style so were some traders dan hadnt seen any carriages like that here in westwood he was sure there were some the big shots here were just as rich as the ones in the valley probably richer but most of them didnt get rich by being dumb they werent showing off what they owned not when king zev ruled this place now instead of their pet city council sergeant chuck came up he had two juicylooking drumsticks in his mess kit a sergeant didnt need to butter up the cooks the way ordinary soldiers did a cook who got in trouble with a sergeant would pay for it whats happening dan chuck asked not much sergeant dan stood up so chuck could sit down on the bench the sergeant did dan didnt have to give up his placenothing in the rules said he did anyhow but chuck would have remembered if he didnt sergeants had long memories too hows that chick at the traders house chuck grinned as he asked the question that meant he knew dan liked liz a sergeant who was worth his pay kept track of what was going on with his men shes okay shes kind of weird though dan said well westside chicks are supposed to be that way chuck said that was an article of faith among valley men the westsiders thought people from the valley were a bunch of hicks but what did they know not weird like that not weird weird dan wondered if he was making any sense at all chuck nodded so maybe he was he went on i mean shes into history if you can dig that history chuck gnawed the meat off one of those drumsticks then he shook his head after he swallowed the fried chicken he said yeah thats pretty freaky all right howd you find out she was coming back from the ucla fancy library i asked her what she was doing and thats what she told me dan said chuck s eyes narrowed so did his mouth could be a cover for something else something nastier i thought so too dan answered but she really does know stuff about russians and things and she doesnt know much about guns if they were trying to get stuff out of the library wouldnt they have picked somebody who does we wouldthats for sure chuck said the westsiders though theyre kinda farout so who knows for sure he paused russians eh how does she know about russians im not quite sure dan admitted the way she made it sound traders hear stuff ordinary people dont do you think thats true chuck scratched his head dont know for sure i guess it could be they travel more than most people do thats for sure he cocked his head to one side studying dan i bet youve been trying like anything to find out what she does know well yeah dan was embarrassed he didnt think hed done anything wrong but he didnt want his private likes and dislikes to get in the way of his duty either dont sweat it man chuck said understanding his tone if you want to like her you can like her plenty of our guys have got westside girlfriends for themselves long as you remember youre a valley soldier everythings cool you know i wouldnt do anything else dan exclaimed sure sure chuck nodded id really hassle you if i had anything to worry about there he paused for a bite of bread she say anything about whats going on south of the santa monica freeway line no sergeant dan answered truthfully what is going on south of the freeway anyhow beats me chuck said but we cant push any farther the westsiders are still hanging tough down there if they make the valleywestside war j a deal with speedro well that could cause everybody a lot of trouble could cause the westside a lot of trouble dan said if they let speedros soldiers in to fight us how do they chase em out again afterwards sounds like the question to me chuck said but ive heard some talk about it so i wondered if your girlfriend said anything shes not my girlfriend dan said so sorrowfully that the sergeant laughed ears hot dan changed the subject the question people say it but can you imagine anybody whos really got that much money i bet the king does chuck said after a moments thought dan nodded that might be true of course the king collected taxes from all over the valley chuck added i wonder why we say it and why why not or beats me dan said do you want me to see ii i can find out what liz knows about whatevers happening down south sure maybe the russians will tell her all about it chuck laughed loudly at his own wit dan laughed too when a sergeant made a joke any common soldier who knew what was good for him thought it was funny chuck dug into his sauerkraut he ate every bit that the cook had given him and he didnt complain or make faces no matter how bad the pickled cabbage tasted in his own way he was setting an example for the men under him if dan had noticed he was setting an example but dan s mind was on other things he did his best not to grin from ear to ear now he had another excuse to hang around liz to see what she knew and to see if he could get her to like him he couldnt have been happier he didnt even stop to ask himself how happy shed be how do i get rid of this guy mom liz asked this side of shooting him i mean he hasnt been any bad trouble but he sticks like glue her mother was plucking a chicken no no neatly wrapped plasticcovered packages in the butchers shop at the supermarket not in this alternate if you wanted meat you had to deal with it yourself mom paused for a moment as long as hes not bad trouble why worry about it because he sticks like glue liz wondered why mom couldnt see how obvious that was he likes me and i dont like himfor sure not that way he doesnt know much and most of what he thinks he knows is wrong and he doesnt take enough baths either and he thinks im some kind of spy or something nobodys perfect mom observed the look liz sent her said she wasnt perfect herselfnot even close for a wonder mom noticed she stopped plucking pinfeathers and added now you see why weve got all these rules against getting involved with people from the alternates sure liz had long since figured that out she threw her hands in the air but what we really need are rules to keep people from the alternates from wanting to get involved with us her mother smiled which made liz want to throw the mostly plucked chicken out the window she needed sympathy and what was mom doing laughing at her if you could put on a mask that made you ugly and if you talked like an idiot that might do the trick her mother said hand me the cumin there would you liz did but doing it only made her angrier for one thing mom seemed to think getting the chicken ready for dinner was more important than the way dan kept bothering her for another she was tired of cumin and cilantro the locals used them in everything this side of apple pie and her mother naturally cooked the way people here did apples were rare imported luxuries in this southern california the trees grew fine but they needed frost to make fruit even in the valley where it got colder than it did on the westside freezes didnt come every yearor every other year either her mother started braying cumin seeds in a brass mortar and pestle you didnt buy them already ground the way you would in the home timeline you didnt punch a button on a food processor either here you were your own food processor if you didnt do the work it didnt get done since im sorta stuck being me liz said as sarcastically as she could what do you think i should do about dan i told youput up with him as long as you can her mother answered if he really gets to be a pain we can always send you back to the home timeline and say you went away i suppose but liz didnt want to go back thatd put a black mark on my record wouldnt it well it wouldnt look good mom brushed the plucked chicken with olive oil that was also a local product and surprisingly good unlike apples olives did great here she started spreading the ground cumin and some chopped cilantro leaves over the bird part of the reason you come to the alternates is to learn how to deal with the people who live in them yeah liz couldnt have sounded gloomier if shed tried thats what i figured maybe i just ought to hit him over the head with a rock if you think you can get away with it and if people here dont talk about you afterwards why not mom thrust a long iron spit with a crank handle at one end through the chickens carcass and set the bird above the fire you want to turn that for a while okay you were your own rotisserie here too before long the chicken started to smell good cooking over wood gave more flavor than gas or electricity did in the home timeline though it polluted more too the work didnt keep liz distracted more than a minute or two hes a pain mom nothing else but i ought to wear an ugly mask if i pulled out two of my front teeth hed forget i was alive mm maybe not her mother said which wasnt what she wanted to hear at all by now you know he doesnt just think youre pretty youve fascinated him with your mind too look at the questions he asks you hes trying to trap me you mean liz said he can tell im not from here my cover isnt good enough i dont think the way these people do he knows well turn the chicken anyhow dear mom said liz did feeling foolishher attention had lapsed her mother went on i just think he thinks youre weird and he thinks youre pretty and he thinks the combination is interesting shed put enough thinks in there to make liz need a few seconds to realize what she meant when liz did she shook her head i wish you were right but its more than that i can tell in that ease maybe you should go back to the home timeline mom said nobody here can do anything with the crosstime secretwe both know that but the company sure wouldnt be happy if the locals worked it out that took no time at all to understand if crosstime traffic wasnt happy with you youd be stuck in the home timeline forever if crosstime traffic really wasnt happy with you theyd throw you out on your ear and whod ever want to hire you if you couldnt hack it with the biggest most important company in the history of the world washed up at eighteen liz thought she knew she was being silly to say nothing of melodramatic part of her did anyhow the rest shed broken up with a boyfriend the summer before it wasnt the end of the world even if theyd dated for most of a year shed known that or most of her had it wasnt no but it sure felt as if it were and this felt the same way if you lost one boyfriend or one job how could you be sure youd ever land another one you couldnt turn the bird sweetheart mom said gently the secret wont come out and crosstime traffic won t blackball you forever right right liz knew she sounded shaky she thought she was entitled to for one thing she couldnt be sure the secret wouldnt slip out by accident she couldnt be sure she wouldnt get in trouble and for another what business did mom have reading her mind like that we all may have to go back to the home timeline and it wont have thing one to do with you her mother said if the war heats up again if the westsiders try to come back staying wont be safe were lucky we can get away liz said everybody who lives here is stuck in the middle turn the chicken mom said one more time six attention captain kevin shouted dan straightened and froze in place morning inspection it came every day and he hated it every time captain kevin didnt inspect the company in person sergeant chuck prowled through the ranks whenever he found somebody with a dirty weapon or ungreased boots or a missing button he let the unlucky soldier hear about it chuck cursed as well as anybody dan had ever met nohe cursed as well as anybody dan had ever imagined which covered a lot more ground chuck stared at dan with redtracked eyes dan looked straight ahead and pretended the sergeant wasnt there after what seemed like forever chuck went on to share his good cheer with the next soldier dan didnt let out a sigh of relief that might have brought the sergeant back which was the last thing he wanted after the inspection was over and punishment handed out to soldiers whod fouled up captain kevin said and now we have some good news dan blinked he didnt hear that every day a buzz ran through the company silence in the ranks chuck yelled somehow though he seemed less ferocious than usual you better listen up now he went on captain kevin s got something important to say anything the company commander said was important just because he said it so it seemed to dan anyhow he couldnt imagine any common soldier wouldnt think the same kevin strode out front and center the sling he still wore somehow lent him extra authorityit showed hed been through the worst war could do we aim to be a modern army he said we aim to have the best weapons we can get now weve captured a big westside arsenal and so our army gets to take their weapons only fair since we wonright yes sir the soldiers chorused dan loud among them who would say no cool the company commander said because of that we get to retire fifteen bows and arrows in this company and replace em with matchlocks he gestured two ordnance sergeants wheeled up a cart that probably went back to the old time on it gleamed the modern muskets and their gear kevin fished a scrap of paper from his tunic pocket the following soldiers will turn in their bows and arrows and become musketeers he began reading names dan wanted to hear his he didnt really expect tohe was very juniorbut he wanted to a matchlock of his own that would be something it might even impress liz a musketeer had to be a much more important person than a mere archer soldiers came up to claim their muskets and powder horns and leather bullet boxes and ramrods and lengths of slowmatch string soaked in water and gunpowder that burned at a set reliable rate one by one they returned to the ranks their faces glowing with pride each of them thought he was a much more important person than a mere archer then captain kevin said dan dan jumped he hadnt expected to hear his name but here he was getting a matchlock of his very own he hadnt been so happy since since forever as far as he could tell sergeant chuck poked him in the ribs go on kid get moving the sergeant stagewhispered you dont put your fanny in gear hes liable to decide to give somebody else the gun kevin wouldnt do that would he dan didnt want to find out he hurried forward one of the ordnance sergeants took his bow and bowstrings and his quiver full of arrows just for a second he wondered what would happen to them maybe some graybearded home guard would get them or maybe theyd sit in the arsenal for years and years but then dan forgot all about them because the other ordnance sergeant handed him his matchlock and everything that went with it take good care of your new stuff the sergeant growled i will dan shouldered the musket and returned to the ranks the first thing he noticed was that the gun and the bullet box were heavy the musket weighed a lot more than his bowstave had maybe the bullet box wasnt heavier than the quiver full of arrows but it packed its weight into much less space matchlock bullets were balls of lead each one as thick as his thumb they werent so deadly as the long pointed rounds old time rifles fired but you still didnt want to stop one with your face or your chest chuck snorted like his father when dad was exasperated hereyou wear them like this the sergeant put the bullet box on dan s belt the ramrod went there too he looped the powder horn over dan s left shoulder he wrapped the slowmatch around dan s right upper arm dan knew where everything was supposed to go but hed never had to worry about it himself before now he did now he was a musketeer thank you sergeant he said chuck only snorted again dan asked now when do i really get to shoot new musketeers will start practicing this afternoon chuck answered these arent like old time rifles we make the guns and the bullets and the powder ourselves they arent gone forever once we use them upwe can get more whenever we need them so youll have plenty of practice his smile turned nasty even for a sergeants and you wont have any excuses for missing what you aim at you hear yes sergeant dan said loudly saying yes sergeant as loud as you could was almost always the right answer sure enough the valley army had set up a firing range not far from the archery targets chuck scowled at the men who stood in front of him and at the uncertain way they held their matchlocks im supposed to turn you into proper musketeers he growled rolling his eyes its like asking me to turn a bunch of jackasses into racehorses and thats the truth but its what they told me to do so ive got to do it sergeants always said common soldiers were the dumbest things on two legs so dan didnt get uptight about one more insult hed heard too many he knew they didnt mean much if chuck didnt say crude things about the men under him he probably wouldnt know what to say ground your muskets he ordered and held his vertically with the stock on the ground so they would know what he meant now pour a charge of powder dan had already discovered that the tip of the powder horn came off it made a miniature horn one that held a single charge of powder he poured in the gunpowder and then carefully poured it down the muzzle of his musket one luckless fellow spilled his powder instead chuck reamed him up one side and down the other dan thanked heaven he hadnt goofed stuff in your wads chuck said in the bullet box along with the musket balls and a flask of priming powder were little squares of cloth dan took one folded it up and stuffed it down the muzzle he used the ramrod to force it down toward the bottom of the musket barrel now the bullet chuck said a couple of men laughed chuck glared at them think its funny do you when youre really fighting you can forget you canunless youre trained so you do it right without thinking about it most of you lugs dont think real good anyway so you better get it down pat the bullet in dan s hand felt heavy as if it meant business it was a tight fit when it went into the muzzle it had to be or the gas from the burning gunpowder would get around it and not push it forward chuck used the ramrod again ram that baby home he said really ram it down there dont be shyyouve got to seat it firmly dan imitated him in that step as he had in the others he felt the sweat spring out on his forehead as he thrust with the ramrod again and again you could shoot arrows faster than musket balls musket balls carried farther though and you were supposed to need less practice once you got the hang of using a matchlock too once you did yeah till you did fix your match in the serpentine chuck commanded the swiveling piece that brought the match down onto the touchhole had a groove into which the thick string would fit leave a couple of inches sticking out now pour your priming powder into the touchhole just a little mind the priming powder from the small flask in the bullet box was much more finely ground than the ordinary black powder in the powder horn that made it burn faster and more reliably now if you were in battle youd already have your match burning right chuck said yes sergeant dan chorused along with the rest of the new musketeers when it rained matchlocks werent good for much luckily that wasnt a worry very often in the valley or on the westside chuck had a lightera real old time zippo i have a devil of a time finding flints for this now but i manage he said he flicked the zippoand it lit there was no more old time lighter fluid he used strong spirits instead the flame was blue and almost invisible now nobody pull the trigger till i give the order you hear he warned youll be sorry if you do got it dig me yes sergeant dan said again chuck walked along the line of musketeers lighting one length of slowmatch after another the smell of burning gunpowder didnt make dan think of battle it smelled like fireworks and reminded him of the fourth of july and of october the day the valleys first king broke away from los angeles after the fire fell all right chuck shouted aim at the target along with the rest of the new musketeers dan did just that it wasnt much more than a hundred yards away but suddenly it seemed very small he tried not to let his hands shake he wanted a bullseye more than anything chuck got behind the soldiers with the matchlocks before he gave his next order fire dan pulled the trigger down came the serpentine the burning match set off the priming powder around the touchhole the priming powder hissed and fizzed half a heartbeat later the main charge went offboom the heavy matchlock bucked against dan s shoulder flame and a big puff of gray smoke burst from the muzzle wow dan said coughing from all the sulfurous smoke when matchlocks fired a volley they almost hid what they fired at was that where the phrase fog of war came from dan wouldnt have been surprised but now hed shot off a gun he really and truly had he felt proud enough to burst now its sale to stand in front of you people again chuck said im going to go over to the target and see how you did we slaughtered em a musketeer said yeah dan nodded he thought so too if he hadnt put his musket ball right through the center of the target chuck walked over took the paper down from the mound of earth that caught bullets and carried it back three hits he said displaying the target it was a lot bigger close up fifteen of you shooting at it and three hits maybe the rest of you wouldve scared the bad guys a little maybe but three out of fifteen i know a matchlocks not a real accurate gun even so you can do better than that you can and you will or ill know the reason why reload as dan started the complicated job of getting another bullet into the matchlock he realized being a musketeer wasnt just an honor like anything else it was a lot of work the first thing liz noticed when she opened the door and saw dan standing in the street was the matchlock on his shoulder the second thing she noticed was how proud of himself he looked she didnt laugh though she wanted to he would have got madshe could see that you had a bow before she said gravely i got promoted he said im a musketeer now athos porthos or aramis she wondered he might get that the three musketeers was a book here too the breakpoint between this alternate and the home timeline lay more than a century after it was written but liz didnt want to talk about alexandre dumas with dan she just wanted him to go away congratulations she said and then spoiled it on purpose by adding i guess i think i was the youngest soldier in my company to get a musket yes he wanted to brag about it no matter how much that made him sound like an idiot he thought he was hot stuff all he needed was a plume in his hat and he could make like dartagnan never mind that his weapon wouldve been obsolete in he didnt care it was more uptodate than a bowand arrows which was all that counted for him well good for you she said if he knew how pathetic he was but she was judging him by the home timelines standards he wasnt pathetic here by the standards of this alternate he was way cool and he knew it a girl who took those standards for granted would think he was way cool too tough beans liz thought i aint that girl even if mr musketeer thinks i am and all too plainly dan did can i come in he asked he didnt even dream she would say no what he really meant was can i show off some more liz wanted to tell him to get lost at least as much to see the look on his face as for any other reason she wanted to yes but she didnt dare you were supposed to try to get along with the locals when they werent impossibly obnoxious if you didnt you got a black mark in your database one that would stay there forever and dan wasnt quite impossible he ran his mouth yeah and he wondered whether liz was some kind of spy but hed always kept his hands to himself she almost wished he wouldnt if he tried feeling her up that would give her a real excuse for having nothing to do with him afterwards his silly talk and strutting werent nearly enough not by themselves and since they werent i guess you can liz said with a sigh she didnt even try to hide dan never noticed it she hadnt thought he would she would have bet a hundred benjamin s against a dollar that he wouldnt in fact but winning the almost worthless dollar wouldnt have mattered to her once he walked into the house she had to be more polite this alternate had rules about hospitality a guest was a guest she brought dan orange juice and bread and olive oil and had some herself they sat on a bench in the courtyard she wasnt going to take him to her roomno way that would have given him ideas he didnt need oh he probably had them already but he wouldnt do anything about them not out here she couldnt be so sure of that in a more private place there was such a thing as asking for trouble but right this minute dan was too full of himselfand of his superduper matchlock musketto turn into that kind of nuisance he unslung the musket and asked do you want to know how it works oh im dying to liz said in a tone that couldnt mean anything but you must be out of your mind charlie dan didnt get it she might have knownshe had known he wouldnt he walked her through the whole complicated process of loading and firing the gun the only reason she would have wanted to know that was so she could shoot him with it if he couldnt buy a clue could he at least rent one not a chance after hed gone through his rigmarole he said and then after youve been shooting you have to clean the inside of the barrel gunpowder builds up in therewe call it fouling by the way he said it he might have coined the word himself liz knew she had to give him some kind of answer big deal was the first thing that came to mind somehow she didnt think hed appreciate it she tried something safer how about that you couldnt get into too much trouble with three little words that didnt mean anything did you know any of this stuff before dan didnt ask it quite smoothly enough he wasnt just interested in her he still halfway thought she was some kind of spy maybe more than halfway she shook her head no not really i told youim not into guns no youre into history and thats just freaky dan said who was it whod said history is bunk henry ford that was who liz remembered it from a question on an ap test and from reading brave new world lots of peoplemost people evenin the home timeline had thought so right up into the middle of the twentyfirst century but when you could go from one alternate to another when you could see how one change in history altered everything that sprang from it and when you needed to figure out how the changes worked history wasnt bunk any more along with chronophysics history was one of the underpinnings of crosstime traffic in the home timeline that made it a very big deal indeed but not here here it was still bunk people were still trying to get out from under the disaster history had dropped on them years before understanding exactly why the disaster happened was a luxury they had no lime for she couldnt explain that to dan so she pointed to his precious matchlock and said do you think youd be carrying that if somebody wasnt interested in history he looked at her as if shed started speaking russian huh he said its true she told him we cant make guns like the ones they had just before the fire fell right well sure everybody knows that dan admitted butwhats it got to do with history or matchlocks matchlocks come from a time hundreds of years before the fire fell they arent a new invention theyre a a reinvention i guess youd call it liz said after the fire fell somebody who knew the history of guns must have figured well lets use thesetheyre the best we can make with what weve got left she waited would he think she was crazy would he understand any of what she was talking about or would he think she was making things up to freak him out he looked at the matchlock and at the powder horn on his belt i guess the same things true about machine guns huh he said after a few seconds liz nodded only more so because theyre more complicated okay i guess you make sense i hadnt thought about it like that before dan said but before liz could get too happy about enlightening him he went on you sure know a lot about guns for somebody who says she doesnt know anything about guns oops she thought she threw her hands in the air playacting only a little i dont know squat about guns i dont care about guns but dan interrupted i dont liz interrupted right back i know something about history its not the same thing cant you see that it wasnt quite the same thing anyway she hoped he wouldnt think it was she watched him wrestling with it well maybe he said but you know about russians too hed never let her live that down would he i dont know a whole lot about themi really dont she said you know more than any rightthinking americans got any business knowing dan said most of the time he thought of himself as belonging to the valley it was his kingdom and zev was his king the westside was a different country to him and to his fellow soldiersand to the westsiders too but he remembered the murdered united states on the fourth of july and whenever he talked about the russians its a democracy isnt it liz said democracy was still a potent word here even if it didnt mean what it had before the fire fell duties got split up so lots of people did themthat was democracy the rulers on the westside called themselves city councilmen and not dukesthat was democracy too liz went on so i have the right to find out about whatever i want to dont i maybe you do dan sounded troubled but just because you have it doesnt mean you should use it we gave the russians what they deserved after all they hit us first not if you listen to them but he wouldnt want to hear that and nobody knew whod launched the first missiles after years it mattered only to historians this alternate was too busy trying to take care of itself to have the time to train historians and give them a chance to work if not for people like her family people from the home timeline nobody would try to find out till all the best evidence had crumbled to dust a lot of evidence had already crumbled liz wasnt sure she and her folks would ever be sure what had happened here at least they were trying to find out though the survivors of the nuclear exchangehere and in russiawere too busy blaming each other to care about the truth whatever it turned out to be she frowned at dan youre saying i shouldnt try to know whats so if that doesnt go along with what people believe right on he didnt try to deny it if all the people believe it its so thats democracy too isnt it no she wanted to scream it but that was democracy at least the way they used the word here im sorry but i want to know whats what no matter what she said she knew she could have put it better but too bad everybody here on the westside thought wed beat your army but we didnt turn out to be right enough did we i should say not we creamed you dan frowned again this time at himself okay though i guess i see what youre trying to say liz breathed a silent sigh of relief shed wondered if he would a lot of the time il somebody knocked a hole in your argument you just pretended it wasnt there she was glad dan would admit there was a difference between what everybody thought and what was true a long time ago people thought the earth was flat they thought it was the middle of things too and the sun went around it she said it sure looks flat dan said they teach us in school that the earth goes around the sun but im dogged ii i understand why i dont know ii i believe it either il looks like it ought to be the other way around doesnt it i mean you can see the sun move and everything just like watch our shadows tears stung liz s eyes in another years people in this alternate probably would think the earth was flat again they would think the sun went around it if your own eyes told you so if everybodys eyes said the same thing that was democracy wasnt it sure it was and it was wrong wrong wrong if you try to figure out the phases of the moon or how the planets move you get better answers if you put the sun in the middle than you do if you put the earth there liz said but i dont much care about the phases of the moon i dont care about the planets at all dan said how do you figure that stuff out anyway it takes more math than i know how to do liz admitted there you go dan said even if its true its complicated but i can see the sun there it is right up there he pointed at it squinting and blinking if you watch for a while youll see it move too no youll see the earth turning liz wasnt about to quit you sound like my teacher dan laughed she taught what was in the book but who says the book was right maybe it was one of those waddayacallitsfiction books thats what i want to say i mean it just stands to reason you can see how little the sun is and how big the earth is how could we go around that and not the other way around instead of walking over to a column and banging her head on it liz said a mountain looks little cause its a long ways off the suns a lot farther away than any mountain of course it looks small ninetythree million miles dan said thats what the book said in school anyhow but how could there be that many miles and even if there were how would anybody know how many there were you couldnt go all that way yourself youd be traveling forever and you would run out of air and you would roast as you got closer to the sun and a lot of other things liz didnt mention any of them she didnt remember how you went about learning how far it was from the earth to the sun since she didnt she couldnt very well explain it to dan what she did say was well if they knew that stuff back in the old time chances are they were right about it dan grunted yeah i guess thats true he said liz had won the argument then she wondered if shed cheated he was trying to be logical about things to argue from what he could see shed hit him over the head with authority wasnt that like the church coming down on galileo because he said the earth moved the difference she told herself was that the church was wrong and she was right but the churchmen had thought they were right and theyd had authority on their side too so she felt pretty rotten when dan left but he didnt give her any more trouble about russians anyhow whether the sun went around the earth or vice versa wouldnt get him so excited she hoped after practicing like a maniac dan could load his matchlock almost fast enough to keep sergeant chuck happy he was no slower than the rest of the new musketeers chuck screamed at all of them impartially you have to keep up with the men whove been doing this for years the sergeant shouted a volleys not a volley if everybody doesnt shoot together so move you stupid clumsy lugs move dan rammed his bullet home and brought the musket up to his shoulder so did the rest of the new men all at about the same timeexcept for one luckless fellow who dropped his ramrod what chuck called him would have curdled milk tm sorry sergeant the soldier said miserably you do that in the middle of a real battle and youll be sorry youre dead you chuck found a few more compliments to pay the luckless musketeer then he growled are we ready at last wed better be dont you think lets find out ready aim fire dan pulled the trigger the match came down on the priming powder in and around the touchhole hissboom kick he coughed as the smoke went up his nose the musketeer just to his left puffed on a cigar a lot of the men who carried matchlocks smoked either cigars or a pipe that meant you usually had a hot coal handy if you needed to get your match going again dan didnt usually smoke all that often but he knew a good idea when he saw one chuck walked out to the target and brought it back he showed the soldiers the punctures their musket halls had made well youre starting to scare the enemy even if you dont always hit him but he wasnt about to let them think that was good enough he went out to the far end of the range and set up a new target now lets see how last you can give me another volley i want everybody ready when i give the command go it would have been easier if chuck hadnt gone on yelling at them while they reloaded dan wanted to hate him for that but found he couldnt hed been in battle by now he knew how much noise and chaos there was you had to block it all out if you were going to do your job if you let it rattle you you endangered yourself and your buddies nobody dropped his ramrod this time if anyone had chuck would have eaten him rawprobably without salt and the volley went off in a closepacked set of thunderclaps that left dan s ears ringing people whod used guns a lot also tended to use hearing trumpets but what could you do well you werent too slow sergeant chuck said that was about as much praise as the underofficer ever doled out he retrieved the target when he came back he looked like somebody trying hard not to smile seems like some of those people would have stopped lead thats for sure now lets see you do it again so i know its no fluke some of the musketeers groanedbut none of the men at whom chuck was looking directly he would have blistered them if theyd tried getting away with that dan didnt want to fire another volley either but he wanted to do the shooting and not get shot if he had to fight some more so he kept practicing without making any noise several volleys later the smoke was making tears run down his face from eyes that felt as if they had ground glass in them well thatll probably do for today the underofficer said he grinned a crooked grin if i told you to load for another one chances are youd aim it at me and you might even hit what you were aiming at i dont think its real likely but i dont want to take the chance either so well knock off for the day he stood only a few feet from his weary students not a hundred yards down the range if they turned their matchlocks on him he would have more holes than a colander and he had to know it but he didnt want to admit to himself or to the musketeers that they were getting the hang of it they were plenty glad to knock off for the day the sun was sliding down the western sky toward the nuclear glass and rubble of santa monica and toward the pacific beyond it supper soon and then sleep except for the ones unlucky enough to draw evening sentry duty dan always looked forward to sleep he did enough on any day of soldiering to leave him tired garrisoning westwood wasnt so bad as the strike through the sepulveda pass though then hed always wanted to curl up and grab what rest he could hed always wanted to and never been able to he didnt know how much sleep hed got in that mad dash south he did know it wasnt enough fowls were roasting on spits above cookfires cooks basted them with chilies and cilantro and other spices in olive oil the delicious smell made dan s stomach growl he could hardly wait till the savory birds got done sergeant chuck reacted differently pointing to the birds he said i wonder whose goose theyre cooking oh wow dan groaned after a joke like that sergeant it ought to be yours you could be rude to a superior as long as you used proper military courtesy when you did it and as long as you picked your spot with care chuck grinned at dan ive got no shame hows your girl and whats she really pulling out of the ucla library shes not my girl dan said regretfully liz was polite but he could tell she liked him less than he liked her he didnt know what he could do about that so far he hadnt been able to do anything sighing he went on you know what we talked about the last time i was over there tell me chuck said youre gonna laugh dan said the sergeant shook his head and held up his right hand as if to swear he wouldnt thus encouraged dan went on whether the earth really does go around the sun like you learn in school chuck stared at him then threw back his head and let loose he didnt just laughhe howled im sorry he said at last not sounding sorry at all you go visit a pretty girl and you talk about that the moon and the stars and how pretty they are sure but the sun and the earth cmon man you can do better than that see i told you you would dull embarrassment made dan s ears burn it also heated his defiance and you know what else it was interesting too so there he thought okay okay dont get all uptight about it i said i was sorry chuck replied dan realized you didnt get an apology out of a sergeant every day not if you were a common soldier so what does she think about that me i dont know if the teachers are as smart as they think they are im with you dan said if the people in the old time were all that smart would they have let the fire fall so they didnt know everything there was to knowyou can bet your sweet hippy on that there you go chuck said that sure makes sense to me howd liz like it not even a little bit dan answered you hear her talk the earth spins around to make days and it goes around the sun to make years you know what sergeant chuck said as they lined up to get their pieces of chicken or duck or whatever the cook dished out the real deal is so what i mean who cares it doesnt make a pennys worth of difference in your life or mine it wouldnt matter if the earth was shaped like acaliber bullet were just going to see this little bil of it and thats all yeah dan said back in the old time you could fly all over the world those people might not have been all that smartmust have been human in other wordsbut they knew more than their modern descendants that seemed unfair to dan he wondered what liz thought about it she knew a lot did she miss not knowing even more seven luke was a gingerbearded trader up from speedro liz didnt know whether the valley soldiers knew hed come up to deal with her folks she would have bet against it luke had the air of a man who dodged authority whenever he could and speedro and the valley werent the best of friends anyhow got me some of the things you said you were looking for he said now puffing on a nasty pipe and sipping from a glass of raw corn whiskey dad had given him dad had a drink of his own though he didnt smoke there was such a thing as taking authenticity too far wrecking your lungs crossed the line well lets have a look he said sure enough luke had a knapsack on his back and two stout flintlock pistols and a bowie knife on his belt ignoring the guns he slid off the knapsack dont quite know why you want these but i found em oh come on liz s father said you never ask that question maybe ill make a profit selling them to somebody with more money than sense maybe i want em for myself just because of how far out they are long as you make money selling them to me whats your worry the other trader gave him a crooked grin well i knowhow that works all right one fellows trash is another guys treasure the grin grew more crooked yet and were all living in the middle of the trash from the old time and i expect we will be from now till doomsday or maybe twenty minutes longer wouldnt be surprised dad said and then well well how about that luke displayed a dozen popularscience and sciencefiction magazines from and the ucla librarys files on those were less complete than they might have been sometimes the librarys holdings were less complete than the card catalogue said they should be sometime between the fall of the fire and now people had made things disappear to liz stealing from a library wasnt just a crime it was a sin and this librarys card catalogue fascinated her all the equivalents in the home timeline were electronic of course the idea of a room full of actual physical files you could shuffle through struck her as extremely slick and surprisingly once you got the hang of it it was almost as fast as accessing a database thai wasnt lair using the card catalogue was accessing a database you couldnt do il with just a computer and a keyboard or a mike but you could do it some of the things you could do without electricity startled her they still had working wind up phonographs here in the home timeline vinyl was a teenytiny niche market liz didnt think shed ever heard a real record there it was nearly all downloads here records were all theyd known about when things went boom hearing a classic like the doors first album coming out of a tinny speaker that looked like a giant ear trumpet and hearing it all full of scratches and hisses because it was so ancient was almost enough to make her cry dad sorted through the magazines he handled them with great care because the pulp paper was ancient too comparing these issues to the almostmatching ones from the home timeline wouldor at least mightgive researchers a few more clues about what had gone wrong here well i can use em he said at last how hard are you going to rip me off two dollars apiece even luke sounded amazed at how much he was asking two dollars here could buy as much as a couple of hundred benjamin sback in the home timeline liz s father had the money it meant no more to him than microsoft monopoly money did but you couldnt make a deal especially not a big onewithout haggling and haggling was a fullcontact sport here luke called dad some things well il hed said anything like that to liz she would have done her best to murder him but her father only grinned and gave back as goodor as badas he got they finally settled on a dollar and a quarter per magazine luke was one of the people who preferred silver quarters to the copperandnickel sandwich ones that had replaced them yeah i know we cant make anything like those nowadays he said when dad asked him which he wanted but silvers silver confound it id like it even better if you gave me cartwheels a cartwheel was a silver dollar and it weighed more than four quarters or two halfdollars to liz it was a just a symbol it was worth what it said it was worth and that was that to luke and to a lot of people here it was worth what it said it was worth because it had so much precious metal in it they came from different worlds not only literally but also in their minds you know what dad said i can do that and i will because youve gone to some trouble for me the difference in weight wasnt enormous it was as if he were giving luke an extranice tip at a restaurant but the traders eyes lit up when he got his hands on those fat sweetringing silver coins much obliged to you sir he said and tipped his broadbrimmed hat you didnt have to do that and i know it youre jake with me and thats the truth i take back all the stuff i called youtill i need it again next time we dicker anyways dad laughed even liz thought that was pretty funny dad said dont get yourself in an uproar man if you dont help your friends you dont have friends for long right right on luke said and im mighty glad you put it that way on account of those funky magazines werent the only reason i came all the way up here speedro was a couple of days away from westwood in this alternate no small journey in the home timeline you could hop in your car and get there in a little more than an hour if the freeways werent jammed if they wereand they often wereit took two or three times that long and felt like a couple of days well whats on your mind did dad sound cautious liz thought so she would have tooshe was sure of that luke by contrast was cagey almost coy youve got a friend with a big old dog isnt that right not anymore liz blurted not even the enormous and ferocious pots could stand up to machinegun bullets the westsidersand pots himselfhad learned that the hard way losing the terrible dog went a long way toward breaking the westsides morale it must have gone just as far toward pumping up the valleys soldiers the trader nodded to her youre right miss thats the straight skinny all right but you sure know somebody who did have a big old dog dont you whats cal got in mind here unlike in a haggle over money dad didnt have to waste time beating around the bush well he aims to throw these valley squares back where they belong and then another mile further luke replied people can aim at all kinds of things a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for dad quoted old poetry liz remembered the lines from brit lit he went on but just cause he aims to do it doesnt mean he can and where do i fit into all this well he was hoping you could let him know where the valley soldiers are at and how many theyre keeping down here luke said through you dad asked no man through the easter bunny luke snorted like a horse of course through me you gonna write him a letter like and stick a stamp on it people remembered stamps the way they remembered cars and tvs unlike cars and tvs stamps still did get made by some of the larger more stable kingdoms in this shattered alternate none of the ones in southern california qualified though and the idea of putting stuff that dangerous in writing wasnt anything to jump up and down about either nor was the idea of taking sides in the petty struggles here that was the last thing people from crosstime traffic were supposed to do on the other hand people from crosstime traffic were supposed to act as much like locals as they could and a local trader might well want to help cal against the valley soldiers if your instructions started quarreling with themselves liz waited to see what her father would do i dont usually go looking around for soldiers you know dad said cal says hed make it worth your while if you did luke answered cal didnt have anything that could make it worthwhile for someone from the home timeline and dad was holding a lot of his assets without a doubt cal could make a trader here or a couple of traders hererich from what liz had seen of him though there was a big difference between could and would maybe hed just say dad could keep what he was already holding dad also took a jaundiced view of the westside city councilman im sure cal s word is worth its weight in gold he said dryly luke needed to think about that for a couple of seconds before he got it when he did he gave a snaggletoothed grinno orthodontists hereand snorted again this time on a higher note youre a funny fellayou sure are worth its weight in gold i got to remember me that one you see what i mean then dad spread his hands well cal s slipperiern smoked eels packed in olive oil no two ways about that luke allowed and dad smiled in return the trader from speedro went on chances are hed pay off for this though he purely hates those valley dudes and he wants to get rid of em now that youre up here you could look around as well as we can liz said i could by the way luke stretched the word he didnt want to he explained why im a stranger in these parts and theyd get hinky about me in a hurry i bet they dont even look at you people twice he paused well theyd look at you twice honey but not on account of they figured you were spying liz s cheeks got hot shed thought dan s attention was the last thing she wanted now she found it was next to last having this hairy smelly old trader notice her that was way worse and she could tell him some of them already do think im spying luke grunted thats not so hot if i find anything out ill let you know luke dad said im sorry but i just havent paid that much attention till now too bad cal was hoping you would have luke heaved himself to his feet well ill be on my way much obliged for the silver dollars my friend like i say you didnt have to do that and i know it he touched a callused forefinger to the brim of his hat liz sat in the courtyard wishing she were ugly life would be so much simpler if she were dan was coming up glendon when a trader left the house where liz and her folks lived the fellow looked tough and wore not one but two pistols that meant in case of a miss he could fire again while dan was still reloading muskets were nice but they were slow the trader didnt want any trouble which was a relief he nodded politely to dan and said hello kid how ya doin dont call me kid anger automatically flared in dan then it faded and not just because the man was heavily armed gray streaked the traders hair and whiskers to him dan with his own thin scraggly scratchy beard was a kid no two ways about it so dan nodded back and said not bad you tolerable the trader considered then nodded yeah im just about tolerable cool dan said ask you something well you can always ask the older mans eyes narrowed i dont promise to answer mind you your business is yours and my business is mine that wasnt necessarily so the trader represented nobody but himself dan served the valley and king zev somehow he didnt think the trader would be much impressed if he told him so instead he said did you do any of your business with the people there and pointed to liz s house what if i did no the trader wouldnt give anything away look im not trying to get money out of you i dont care about money dan said that wasnt exactly true he cared plenty about his own money but he was willing not to worry about the traders there arent any new taxes for trading hereif there were chances were they would have sparked an uprising and im not trying to shake you down says you the trader answered if you knew how many lines ive heard but i havent heard one just like this anyways so if you arent trying to shake me down what the devil are you doing his leathery face was watchful wary he kept his hands well away from the pistols but dan would have bet he could have one in his grip in a hurry and the matchlock wasnt even loaded what i want to know is what did you bring up here to trade with those people dan said you wont believe me if i tell you try me okay remember you asked for it i unloaded some magazines from old time from the days just before the fire came down dan did believe him he sounded too pleased with himself to be lying dan was sorry hed said he wouldnt ask about moneyhe wondered how much this guy had got but what the man said fit in pretty well with what liz had told him before which also made him think the trader was telling the truth so all he asked was what kind of magazines did they have to do with old time guns and stuff nah f could see people wanting those the trader shook his head his greasy hair flipped back and forth under his hat these were just weird man i think they were mostly pretend stories why would you rare about those he sounded honestly puzzled dan was puzzled too thats all he asked thats it cross my heart and hope to die the trader made the required gesture for the first time though his eyes slipped away from dan s was he hiding something if he was dan saw no way to make him turn loose of it and the older man was impatient to be gone you gonna hassle me anymore iwasnt hassling you dan said you want to get hassled ill take you to my sergeant hell show you more about hassling than you ever saw thats okay kid if its all the same to you the traders tone warned it had better be okay with dan even so he sounded amused as he went on i have met up with a sergeant or three in my time and its a fact that they can hassle bettern just about anybody you can say that again as soon as the words were out of dan s mouth he wished he had them back now hed given the trader something to use against him that wasnt smart but he didnt think chuck would do much more than laugh he hoped chuck wouldnt anyhow sounding as gruff as he could he said you can go the trader touched the brim of his hat in what wasnt quite a salute much obliged buddy you know that traders got a daughter about your age he jerked a thumb toward the house from which hed come ive met her dan bit off the words shes smart too the older man didnt know how much trouble he was causingor maybe he did know and didnt care if i were as young as you are id try and spend some time with her i would right dan said if looks could have killed the traders fancy pistols wouldnt have done him a nickels worth of good didnt he know that dan wanted nothing more than to spend as much time with liz as he could and didnt he know that liz didnt seem the least bit interested in doing the same thing of course he doesnt know any of that dan realized the trader had just set eyes on liz for the first time unless hed come up here before the valley took westwood but dan thought that unlikely the man would have talked about her differently if he had how could he know that dan went over there whenever he found the chance how could he know dan was on his way over there now simplehe couldnt or could he his leathery weathered face was much too cunning as he said well have a nice day pal and ambled off he didnt look back over his shoulder to see whether dan knocked on liz s door maybe that meant he didnt care then again maybe it meant he already had a pretty good notion of what dan would do steaming dan tramped right past that door he was after all supposed to be on patrol but he looked back over his shoulder after hed gone half an extra block no sign of the trader if the miserable fellow had hung around to see what dan would do he was gone now and if he was gone now dan hurried back to liz s house and knocked on the door the barred little telltale at eye level opened up dan didnt think those were liz s eyes on the other side of it he turned out to be right because a mans voice said oh its you wait a second a thud meant the man was taking down the bar that held the door closed when it swung wide dan found himself looking at liz s father hello he said politelyhe couldnt bring himself to call anybody in occupied westwood sir is liz at home her father nodded yes she is but you cant see her right now shes busy in the kitchen weve got to eatnothing we can do about thatand getting food ready takes a lot of time dan nodded too he remembered his mother working a lot in her kitchen he also remembered her grumbling about it chopping and cutting and plucking and gutting and tending the fires and cleaning up afterwards sometimes shed dragooned him into helping but women did most of the work in there ask you something dan said i make a point of never saying no to a musketeer whos carrying his gun liz s father answered dan wondered if he was telling the truth like the other trader he was bound to have weapons of his own but he wasnt showing any right now and so why did you buy freaky magazines from that whiskeryscoundrel liz s father looked startled for a moment then he smiled you must have run into luke if thats his name dan said but you didnt answer my question why did you it could matter to the valley he wanted the trader to understand he wasnt just being snoopy on his own i dont see how liz s father said im interested in those kinds of magazines myself the same way liz is they remind me how much we lost when the fire fell and after i look at them i can sell them ill make good money when i do too all you had to do was look around to see how much got lost when the fire fell the buildings the rusting corpses of cars the fancy firearms the diseases people couldnt cure anymore why do you need to be reminded dan asked like i said im interested mrm dan made a noise deep in his throat are you interested because youre trying to scope out plans for old time weapons people nowadays could imitate some of them but liz s father just shook his head no can i see the magazines i need to be sure of that dan said with a shrug liz s lather said sure why not youll probably arrest me if i try to tell you no and the magazines really are what i said they are handle them carefullythats all i ask i paid more than a dollar apiece for them so much that anybody would spend so much money for something to read blew dan s mind yes the trader said he would make money on the magazines sooner or later how could he though when he threw away silver like that into the courtyard dan went savory odors wafted from the kitchen dan s nostrils twitched if that wasnt going to be a mutton stew his nose needed rewiring he wondered why people said things like that what did wires have to do with your nose wires had to do with electricity and electricity was one more thing theyd had in the old time that they didnt any more somebody had once written that electricity would propel a streetcar better than a gas jet and give more light than a horse the person who read that to dan said it was supposed to be a joke but neither one of them got it here are the magazines liz s lather said the gingerwhiskered trader luke had been right they were funky some of them had rockets on their covers others talked about gas mileage for cars dan paged through them he didnt see anything that had to do with weapons even if they were weird they seemed harmless he gave them back to liz s father i cant figure out why you think theyre so cool we were going to go to the moon the older man pointed up there it was a little more than half full pale and white in the blue daylight sky to the moon dan wed already sent rockets up there ive seen pictures that they took of craters and things just before they crashed down onto it and we were going to send people after them people all the way to the moon and back and then we used the rockets to blow ourselves up instead but we were so close he held his index fingers maybe half an inch apart whats that got to do with these dan pointed to the magazines the familiar musty smell of old old paper came from them they were sure we were going they knew we could do it liz s father said what if we really had what would we have done after that he tapped a magazine one with a rocket on the front with his finger these tell the stories of what might have been and look what we have instead all of a sudden dan s heavy matchlock didnt seem so wonderful it was about as fancy a weapon as people nowadays could make everything else was on the same level and they could have gone to the moon instead tears stung his eyes tears of rage and embarrassment isnt this a wonderful world we gave ourselves a little bit at a time it does get better liz s father said the time right after the fire fell that was really bad thats what they say dan agreed itll be a lot better once king zev gets done licking the westside well maybe the trader said do you think king zev is the one wholl put the united states back together again dont be silly dan exclaimed everybody knows los angeles is only a little part of the old united states it would have to be zevs son maybe even his grandson right liz s father said and dan had left the house before he even thought to wonder whether the older man meant it liz couldnt seem to poke her nose outside without seeing luke when she went up to ucla she would spot him sunning himself on the grass or playing solitaire when she went into the market square to buy vegetables hed be gnawing on a baked potato or haggling over the price of a cheese sandwich he always looked innocent some people had a knack for that he didnt quite have a halo glowing above his broadbrimmed hat but he seemed as if one might pop out any minute that made liz suspicious from what shed seen people who worked so hard to project that air of innocence were often chameleons and what luke might be hiding she had a pretty good idea there dad didnt want to spy for cal and the rest of the westside bigwigs whod got thrown out of westwood if luke could find out what cal wanted to know hed get the payoff at first that was the only thing liz thought of then something else occurred to her and she started to worry what if the westsiders throw the valley soldiers out again she asked her folks over supper shed earned her tacos shed made the tortillas from cornmeal and shed chopped up the beef that went into them they tasted especially good to her because of thatand no doubt because all the ingredients were fresh as could be well what if they do mom said we did business with them before we can do business with them again but now they asked us to help them and dad told them no liz said how happy will they be about that her father paused to dab at his chin with a napkin the tacos werent neat no matter how tasty they were the worst thing that happens is we go back to the home timeline a little early he said that wouldnt break my heart he gave her a crooked smile and then dan would be out of your hair and it wouldnt even look bad whats wrong with that nothing if they give you some warning first liz said then we get away sure but what if they just grab you off the street or something they can do whatever they want in that case one of the lessons crosstime traffic taught was anything that can happen can happen to you people who worked in the alternates sometimes lost sight of that they sometimes paid for losing sight of it too people everywhere lost sight of it too often in the home timeline the price might be your job or your lover in the alternates it could easily be your neck i dont think that will happen her father said theyve got no reason to grab me not like that no what about luke liz said dan wondered about us before and now hes asking questions about somebody who really does want us to spy for the westside thats not good luke s managed to live through a whole swarm of things we cant even imagine dad replied i dont think hell lose any sleep about a valley soldier who barely needs to shave the fuzz on dan s chin and cheeks and upper lip was a pretty sorry excuse for a beard i wish the guy were dumb liz said hes just ignorant though now i understand the difference her father made clapping motions that produced silent applause liz s ears got hot congratulations dad said less sarcastically than he might have a lot of people never do figure that one out thats cause most of them dont go out to the alternates i guess liz said everybodys ignorant in this alternate but you can still tell whos smart and who isnt cal s pretty smart dan s pretty smart luke would be a ceo or something in the home timeline dad broke in no flies on luke no sir how smart is king zev liz asked well i havent met him so i dont know for sure her father answered finding that heavy machine gun in good working order won him the war you dont need to be smart to have something like that happenyou just need to be lucky hes got some pretty good officersi do know that but i have the feeling hes not the brightest bulb in the hardware store how come i wondered liz said her father made an exasperated noise she went on if the westside and speedro team up to try to take westwood back how well will zev do against cal and his buddies ah gotcha dad nodded thats a good question the only good answer i can find is well find out thanks a bunch i could have done that well myself liz said sorry i dont know what you want me to say dad spread his hands and shrugged im not a prophet not from the bible and not one of the new ones either i hope not liz told him youre not dirty and shaggyenough anyway dad laughed not that she was joking in the years since the fire fell plenty of people had said they knew why god let it happen so far none of their preachings held a very big audience but who could guess what the holy books in this alternate would look like a thousand years from now in the middle of the second century how many people thought christianity would turn out to be such a big deal i wonder how much luke has found out on his own dad said in musing tones probably more than i could have told him cal will pay him plenty i bet but youve got cal s money liz said ive got some of it id be amazed if cal gave me all of it or anything close to all of it dad said if hes going to get people in speedro to do things for him hell have to pay them off and he likes to live high on the hog and that costs money toonot as much as it would in the home timeline but a lot anyway liz started to say something then stopped dad had thought about a few things she hadnt what happens if whats left of the westside and speedro do beat the valley she asked at last i dont know that either he replied im not sure they can because i dont know what all theyve got i didnt know the valley had that heavy machine gun and it made all the difference in the last round even if they do win i dont think cal can go over the hill and invade the valley hed be nuts if he tried the most he can hope for is getting westwood back which means the shooting would all be right here liz said and her father nodded none too happily she went on we never would have had any of this trouble if he hadnt built that dumb wall across the the idea that there could be a wall across what was in the home timeline one of the two or three busiest freeways in the world told what a disaster this alternate had known dad nodded and do you know what that shows no what liz said that even smart people can do dumb things he thought he could get away with it he thought king zev would put up with it he thought he could beat the valley if zev didnt put up with it and he was wrong every time you should have talked him out of it liz said get real for one thing he didnt ask me he was head of the city councilhe still is for all the good it does himand im just a trader besides why do you think he would have listened even if i got a chance to talk to him about it theres a particular kind of smart person who thinks everybody around him is a dope is that cal or isnt it sure sounds like him liz admitted but that kind of smart person isnt as smart as he thinks he is not usually no dad agreed you dont find that out till too late a lot of the time though a lot of really smart people go a long way on their own before they foul up afterwards you wonder how much further they could have got if they realized other people are really people not just ladder rungs for them to step on you treat somebody like a rung pretty soon hell break under your foot then you go splat liz said thats about the size of it dad sighed way things are now i wish we could bulletproof the walls here you think the new fights coming soon then liz said in dismay dont you dad said cal wouldnt have sent luke up here to find out what we know if he didnt aim to move luke wouldnt be sniffing around on his own if he didnt want to bring something back hes sure cal will pay oil if he does cal wouldnt pay off if he werent going to move and so yeah and so liz said everything fit together almost as neatly as in a geometry proof but no geometry proof since the days of archimedes had got anybody killed cheer up dad told her like i said youll be rid of dan thats something anyhow something yeah liz answered i dont want him to get shot thoughi dont hate him or anything she sighed you just want to yell at these people you know they had their great big stupid war but they go on fighting these little wars that are even stupider dont they learn anything from history the first thing you learn from history is that nobody ever learns anything from history or not for long her father answered people used to say that in the home timeline but now that we can look at a bunch of different histories we see its true in all of them people are like that you wish we werent but we are we already got stuck at the edges of one battle i dont want to get stuck in the middle of another one liz said well who does dad said if it gets too bad we disappear i already told you that yeah i know you did liz replied if they were all here at the house when trouble came they could do that if they werent if one of them or two of them or all of them happened to be out in westwood but dad was ignoring even the possibility liz called him on it he spread his hands i dont know what you want from me the fighting wont get here right away well know its coming ahead of lime and when we do know well be able to come back to the house so we wont get stuck right i sure hope so liz said you have to have some confidence that things will work out otherwise you cant do your job dad said i guess liz answered id like that better if this werent an alternate thats had an atomic war she got the last word then she had to decide if she really wanted it eight musketeers shoulder arms sergeant chuck yelled proudly dan did he wondered whether the other new musketeers had that tiny moment of hesitation too he still had to work to remember he was a musketeer not a noaccount archer any more the few remaining archers in captain kevin s company were already carrying their bows ready to string and shoot riflemen shoulder arms the sergeant shouted their faces serious the riflemen obeyed with their fancy old time guns and cartridges they could hit targets far beyond any a musketeer could hope to reach but they took chances musketeers didnt too a musket wouldnt explode unless you loaded several charges of powder into it without lowering the match to the touchhole old time cartridges were just plain old nowadays you never could tell about them till you pulled the trigger most of the time they did what they were supposed to you wouldnt dare use them if they didnt sometimes though they didnt do anything at all and every once in a while one would blow up in your face and wreck your rifle and you riflemen needed steady nervesand nerve period chuck nodded to kevin all ready sir very good sergeant the company commander had the sling off but his left arm still wasnt what it had been before he got shot he raised his voice forward march along with the rest of the valley soldiers dan tramped south down westwood boulevard toward the santa monica freeway line some of the people on the sidewalk glanced at the marching men others just went about their business quite a few of them were bound not to like the valley men you couldnt tell which ones though they knew better than to show a companys worth of armed men that they were hostile then the company had to stop because a wagon full of beer barrels drawn by six big horses clattered across westwood boulevard from a side street sergeant chuck yelled at the driver so did some of the soldiers the fellow on the wagon spread his hands as if to say what can i do its my job the pause let dan glance over in the direction of liz s house hed be going a couple of miles awaynot impossibly far but far enough too far really he would have felt even worse about it if he thought liz cared he sighed he didnt see her even if hed hoped to he did see luke the trader who watched the valley soldiers with keen attention was he counting them for whom he caught sergeant chuck s eye see that scraggly fellow with the whiskers he said in a low voice the guy with the pistols chuck said dan nodded what about him the underofficer asked he looks like a tough customer but so what hes a trader he says he is anyway dan said but hes mighty snoopy ive seen him prowling around kind of looking us over know what i mean and now hes doing it again how about that chuck said well when we get where were going ill put a flea in captain kevin s ear maybe hell want to pick this guy up ask him a few questions sharp questions pointed questions hot questions chuck had a very nasty smile when he felt like using it whats the guys name you know he goes by luke i think dan answered okay well well see what he goes by once we start finding out whats what chuck looked at the company and went from that special nasty smile to his usual sergeants scowl come on you muttonheads straighten it up he bellowed youre not a herd of camels galumphing down the street if you think you are im here to teach you different they straightened up doing what chuck said was easier than trying to get around him armies were made that way and had been since the beginning of lime dan didnt think about such things as long as he stayed in step with the men around him he didnt need to a couple of large old time buildings still stood on westwood boulevard even if awnings and curtains and shutters replaced almost all the glass in their windows most of the buildings though were modern shops and houses they were made from the rubble of what had stood there before stone and brick and wood and chunks of stucco with chicken wire in it made up the walls the patchwork was odd if you werent used to it dan was a lot of stuff in the valley was built the same way when they marched past a little place selling tacos and tamales and hamburgers the soldiers neat footwork faltered again the smell of greasy spicy roasting meat made spit flood into dan s mouth his stomach rumbled loudly and his wasnt the only one keep moving keep moving sergeant chuck bawled its all probably choppedup kitty and lizard anyway i dont care somebody behind dan said im hungry whos the wise guy chuck shouted furiously was that you dan no sergeant dan could tell the truth with no trouble at all that was a good thing too he might not have said anything out loud but he didnt care what was in the savorysmelling goodies either if he meowed after he ate some of them well so what chuck challenged several other soldiers marching near dan they all denied everything nobody blew the whistle on whoever had spoken up chuck fumed and swore but that was all he could do dan by contrast noted just where the little cookshop stood the freeway line didnt lie very far south of it if he got some free time he could come back and spend a dime or two the santa monica freeway line was a good one for king zev s soldiers to defend the freeway had been built above the ordinary streets around it that gave the valley men the advantage of high ground in a lot of places here and there though the overpasses that let the freeway leap above the ordinary streets had collapsed maybe that happened when the fire fell maybe earthquakes brought the overpasses down later or maybe they just fell because nobody had taken care of them for more than a century any which way that cut down the number of possible invasion routes from the south of course there were far fewer routes from the north king zev s soldiers had broken through anyhow dan wished that hadnt occurred to him he and his comrades took their place on the freeway itself west of westwood boulevard no trouble could approach unless they saw it first but some trouble was already behind them chuck spoke to captain kevin about luke dan couldnt hear what kevin said but a runner went pelting back into westwood a slow smile crossed dan s lace from here on out luke wouldnt have a very happy time of it too bad dan thought a knock on the door in the middle of the night how many books and movies and video games featured that kind of automatic suspensemaker liz had always thought it was such a clichй but when somebody banged on the door to the house where she was living her heart went thud thud thud it was dark so she had no idea what time it was ten oclock midnight three in the morning groggy with sleep she couldnt have said for sure a few watches and windup clocks with luminous dials survived from old time none was in liz s bedroom she yawned and thought about sticking her head under the pillow she decided she wouldnt imitate an ostrichor what people said was true about ostriches besides whoever was knocking out there didnt seem ready to go away she walked out into the hall feeling her way in the darkness she almost screamed when she bumped into somebody her father said something pungent whats going on she asked in the face of unknown trouble she felt like a little kid again dont know dad answered i think id better find out though he was nothing but a darker shadow in a hallway full of gloom liz had never missed electricity so much as she did right then do you have a gun she asked a question she never would have thought of in the home timeline you better believe it sweetie her father said stay here okay that way i have one less thing to worry about it what if you need help liz squawked im here and ive got a gun too her mother answered out of nowhere do you no liz said in a small voice then stay here like dad told you muttering liz did she listened to her fathers soft footfalls as he approached the door whos there he asked the knocking stopped which was a relief standing there m the hall liz shivered even in summertime los angeles nights could get chilly thinking this one was gave her a reason not to think she was scared she couldnt hear the answer from whoever stood out there she did hear dad say oh for heavens sakeand then something stronger than that a moment later he unbarred the door and opened it the man outside came in dad barred the door again in a hurry then he called light a lamp there was always a lire in the kitchen liz scurried across the courtyard she lit a twig from the hot embers and used it to light a lamp the smell of hot olive oil filled her nose the lamp didnt shed much lighteven a toy flashlight would have put it to shame shadows jumped and swayed crazily as liz carried the lamp toward the doorway she didnt need much light to recognize the newcomer though luke she said what are you doing here shed more than half expected it would be dan well little lady everybodys gotta be somewhere the trader answered her temper went off like a firecracker if you dont tell me what i asked you youll be out on the street again so fast itll make your head swim she snapped luke blinked shed always played the girl who didnt speak up for herself most girls in this alternate were like that but she was from the home timeline and she had more selfrespect and her father nodded yes luke youd better speak up what are you doing here whos after you somebody is right the trader seemed to wilt reluctantly he nodded its those valley clowns he said they think im spying on them well you are again liz spoke up where a local girl would have kept her mouth shut that doesnt mean i want to get killed on account of it luke exclaimed he turned to her father you got some place you can like hide me man nobody from this alternate knew about the subbasement or was likely to find it all the same liz thought no as loud as she could she didnt want luke going down there that was where transposition chambers materialized nobody from this alternate had any business seeing such things how far behind you are they dad asked not far enough luke answered theyll know to come here liz said people will remember hes visited us or maybe the valley soldiers have bloodhounds i took care of thati put down ground pepper the ghost of a smile crossed luke s face as if on cue two dogs started baying frantically well that bought me a little time anyways when he talked about pepper he meant the red kind it grew in the new world black pepper was a rare luxury here most of it came from old time supermarket shelves the plants from which black peppercorns came grew only across the sea ocean traffic aboard windjammers was even more erratic than hauling goods overland dad looked very unhappy and pepper had nothing to do with it they will come here liz is dead right about that he growled i ought to turn you lose and see how fast you can run wouldnt try that luke s right hand dropped toward a pistol wouldnt try that mom said from out of the darkness luke frozeher voice carried conviction very slowly and carefully he moved his hand away she didnt say anything else not even thats better no point to letting him know exactly where she was well come on dad said and led luke into the courtyard no liz wanted to yell again biting her lip she made herself keep quiet dad didnt send luke down to the subbasement instead he got a ladder and nudged it up against the ceiling of a storeroom theres a hideyhole up there he said push aside a couple of boards get in and put em back and keep quiet from then on out if you know whats good for you luke touched the brim of his hat much obliged to you sir yes dad said you are now climb the trader from speedro did and disappeared into the hideyhole i didnt even know that was there liz said in a low voice life is full of surprises sometimes dad answered which might have meant anything or nothing liz didnt get much of a chance to figure out what it meant because more knocks came from the front door the valley men she squeaked dad took down the ladder mm i dont suppose its the tooth fairy or the great pumpkin he agreed wed better answer it dont you think he sounded almost indecently calm open up in the name of king zev the men outside shouted liz was pretty sure the great pumpkin didnt go around yelling things like that dad did open the door liz went with him mom stayed out of sightand kept the pistol where she could use it in a hurry hello dad told the valley men who did have a couple of bloodhounds with them you probably want to know about luke the trader dont you better believe we do growled the sergeant who held the dogs leashes you got him here theres a twentydollar reward on his head twenty dollars in this alternate was a lot of money dad sounded impressed when he said good grief what did he do spied for the enemy thats what the sergeant answered and he wasnt lying luke had done just hat im gonna ask you one more time buddyyou got him here he sounded tough and mean dad looked sorry as he shook his head he made a better actor than liz would have given him credit for with that kind of reward i wish i did but i sent him off with a flea in his ear i dont want any trouble with anybody can we track him another sergeant asked the dog handler then he asked liz s father which way did he go liz thought she would have asked those questions in the opposite order that way dad pointed south i dont know the sergeant with the bloodhounds looked almost as sorrowful as they did that personwhich wasnt exactly what he saidhas some kind of smelly stuff to mess up his trail rocky and bullwinkle got all fubared before we came here rocky and bullwinkle liz thought they arent dogs but they were here and now and what was fubared supposed to mean the english they spoke around here was mostly easy to follow but every once in a while the bloodhounds did pick up a scent it was probably the one luke had left the last time he walked out of the house the valley soldiers seemed happy enough to let them follow it one of the men nodded politely to liz and her father as the group hurried off down the street dads shoulders slumped in relief when he reached for the bar to close up the door again im getting too old for this he muttered im getting too old for this and im a lot younger than you are liz said that got her a weary grin do field work they told me dad said you cant really understand anything without field work they said ill tell you what i understandi understand how you can be scared out of your gourd all the time when youre doing field work thats what yeah liz said and there are plenty of alternates worse than this one too tell me about it her father exclaimed there are probably some of them where they give you your money back if you dont have a coronary the first day youre there he snapped his fingers and i understand one more thing too whats that liz asked id better get luke some water and a honey bucket he answered with luck a honey bucket with a lid a honey bucket liz said and then oh most of the time euphemisms made her impatient that one though she found she liked she added youd better let him know youre not giving him to the valley soldiers too sounds like a plan dad said i think hes liable to shoot first and ask questions later he sang out as he hauled the ladder into place again its just me ive come with your fresh cauliflowers cauliflowers liz wondered dad could be weird sometimes she didnt believe this was the right moment for it but maybe she was wrong luke opened the hideyhole and he didnt shoot first without bothering to ask questions later they gone he askedquietly now so his voice wouldnt carry questions first the right way for now anyway dad answered how long do you want to stay there he asked questions too i was thinking till tomorrow night if thats cool the trader from speedro said that way they wont jump up and down so much you know what i mean if i went and split tonight theyd still be all uptight like groovy dad said a small smile on his face he enjoyed talking like a twentiethcentury hippie liz was fried if she could see why it made him sound like a jerk she sure thought so anyhow i brought you some goodies then dad went on he handed up the water and the honey bucket then from the top of the ladder he told liz why dont you get our friend some bread and a chunk of that chicken we had tonight because i dont want to because im not more than fiftyone percent convinced he is our friend because id rather give him a clout in the teeth than a drumstick all of that went through liz s mind in a fraction of a second none of it came out the only thing that did was sure dad as she hurried away luke laughed softly dont think your daughter trusts me for beans dont be silly dad played the good host well of course he was a good host if he werent a good host those bloodhounds would have been baying at luke in here pepper or no pepper how did he know liz wondered as she cut luke a big chunk of bread and brought not a drumstick but a whole chicken leg back to the ladder how could he tell she was positive shed been not just polite but even eagersounding but she hadnt fooled himnot even close so what did she do wrong she wanted to ask but that would mean admitting she didnt trust him she didnt want to do thatit would be too embarrassing thanks dear dad said when she brought him the food he handed it up to luke thanks is right luke echoed these are better rats than id see at most of the inns around town if your room up here was just a little less cramped you could make good money renting it out he laughed again thais not rat its chicken was liz s first indignant thought but she was listening to this alternates english with ears from the home timeline rats came from military slang not hippie talk it had nothing to do with mickey mouse s bigger cousins it was short for rations this is the kind of room where if you start advertising it nobody wants to stay in it anymore dad said he was bound to be right about that ii everybody knew about a hiding place what good was it well friend in that case im going to pull my hole in after myself again luke said dad took the ladder away luke put up the boards once more as far as liz could tell the hideyhole vanished completely dad sighed not the kind of game i like to play to settle my digestion he set a hand on liz s shoulder you did real well mow do you think youre up to going back to sleep beats me she answered i sure aim to try though to her surprise she did it she didnt know what that proved probably how tired she was to begin with when dan saw a valley patrol with bloodhounds working its way toward the santa monica freeway he wondered what was going on you guys looking for luke the trader he called to them that won him more attention than he really wanted the whole patrol converged on him he was used to attention from sergeant chuck now he had the undivided attention of two sergeants at once and discovered it was at least four times as bad how come you wanna know kid demanded the one with the dogs howd you hear about luke anyway the other one growled the bloodhounds didnt say anything but in the torchlight their long sad faces declared they were angry to have to pause in their search for even a minute if it werent for me you guys wouldnt know about him dan spoke to the sergeants he hoped theyd make the bloodhounds understand have you been to the traders house on glendon yeah we were there said the sergeant with the dogs you really do know too much dont you howd you know about that house well its the girl there now dan knew he sounded a little sheepish did you see her oh the girl that was the dog handler all of a sudden things seemed to make sense to him i mightve known the other sergeant grunted even the bloodhounds seemed sniffy in a different way dan wondered if his ears were on fire they sure felt that way dont you guys have girls he askednot that he had liz or anything he just wished he did weve got girls the sergeant with the dogs said but we dont have westside girls the other one added not like that we dont for fun yeah not for real to dan s amazement his ears got hotter yet he hadnt thought they could how can you tell he asked to make him feel like a complete idiot his voice cracked in the middle of the question both sergeants laughed themselves silly dan thought the dogs laughed too but maybe that was his imagination the handler said you sound goofy when you talk about her thats why now dan was the one who said oh then he changed the subject as fast as he could what about luke he was there but he got away maybe three jumps ahead of us the dog handler frowned im not sure how fresh this trail is though the dogs arent all that stoked about it and we know hes been down this way before so why are you following it dan asked yes talking about luke was a lot easier than talking about liz cause its what weve got said the sergeant who didnt take care of dogs and cause that rotten villain messed up the trail before it got to the traders house added the one who did he put down something that almost made em jump out of their skins that was saying somethingthe bloodhounds had a lot of skin to jump out of the sergeant went on it was as bad as though somebody turned on an old time electric flashlight right in front of your face wow dan said oh wow electric lights were supposed to be bright all right he didnt know exactly how bright because hed never seen one work he didnt know anybody who had either yeah the dog handler said so if we ever do catch this guy well make him sorry you bet we will i bet hes sneaky dan said he looks sneaky he sounds sneaky tooive talked with him was that really fair dan remembered luke teasing him if that didnt exactly make the trader sneaky it came close enough didnt it he must be or he wouldnt have got away from us said the sergeant without the dogs if we want to catch him wed better be sneaky too said the one in charge of the bloodhounds if hes still here for us to catch the other sergeant said if he got over the freeway line hes a gone goose how could he do that dan asked we have it plugged tight both sergeants looked at him as if he were still making messes in his drawers kid if hes that sneaky chances are he can find a way the one without the dogs replied his voice was surprisingly gentle he might have been explaining that the easter bunny wasnt real well maybe dan admitted the valley soldiers were watching out for an attack from the south not for one man trying to get past them and going that way but if he is that sneaky the dog handler said yeah what about it the other sergeant wasnt much impressed listen said the threestriper with the bloodhounds they put their heads together and talked in low voices dan did his best to listen without seeming to the sergeants must have noticed because they moved a couple of steps farther away dan muttered under his breath he hadnt caught much anyway the older men both nodded then they headed back up westwood boulevard toward westwood village they said not a word to dan about whatever theyd decided he thought that was rude w hat did they figure that hed tell luke what they were up to if he knew after a moment he decided that had to be just what they figured he couldnt remember the last time anything had made him angrier he was a good valley patriot so what if he thought a westside girl who knew luke was cute that had nothing to do with anything he could see himself explaining all this to the sergeants he could see them both listening and then laughing their heads off and because he could see all that so very well he didnt even bother to try nightfall in westwood the sun sinking towards and then into the pacific far fewer tall buildings between liz and the ocean than there would have been in the home timeline the bomb that flattened santa monica into glass took out the ones that were there in and not many had gone up since as twilight deepened toward true night luke came down from his hiding place between the ceiling and the roof he tipped his hat to the mendozas again like i said much obliged to you folks you saved my bacon there when you go after somebody with dogs most of the time you dont deserve to catch him dad said luke started to say something then checked himself you know what im gonna have to think about that one for a while probably wont do you any lasting harm liz s father remarked again the trader started to answer again he seemed to think better of it he sent dad a cautious stare youre trouble you know that oh no he has no idea liz said before dad could get a word in that made him and luke both look at her they both started to laugh at the same time heaven help her boyfriends man luke said i dont know what youre talking about dad answered deadpan they laughed again louder liz let out an indignant squawk for some reason her father and the hairy trader from speedro thought that was funnier yet well im gonna slide on out of here luke said when he was done with his uncouth guffaws that was how liz thought of them anyway luke went on thanks one more time for putting me up my friend he might have been talking about a night on the couch not a day in a hiding place liz hadnt even known about any time dad said just as casually you want to be careful out there you know what i mean i can dig it man as if to prove as much luke dropped his right hand to one of his pistols and i expect i can take care of myself okay okay dad spread his hands to show he hadnt meant anything much i wasnt hassling you or anything but in case those valley guys havent forgotten about you the trader sneered liz didnt think shed ever seen anybody more than twelve years old do that before but she did now negative perspiration he said she had to translate that into something that resembled the english she knew dont sweat it he had to mean then why didnt he say so he did go on if i cant give em the slip i dont deserve to get out of here theyre from the valley after all he laced the word with scorn yeah well just remember thats what the westsiders thought too look what it got them dad said luke didnt want to listen ill send you a postcard man he said that would have been snarky in the home timeline given what the mails were like in this alternate it was a lot snarkier here out the door he went dad barred it behind him then let out a sigh well im not sorry to see him go he said and why is that liz asked just because he put us all in danger might have a little something to do with it her father replied then things outside came unglued liz had heard the bloodhounds baying the night before now they sounded twice as excitedand twice as fierce too a voice with a valley accent yelled hold it right there freak after maybe half a second another voice yelled from a different place keep your hands away from your guns or its the last dumb thing you ever do dad said something under his breath that probably wasnt any hotter than what liz was saying under hers she didnt know why the valley soldiers hadnt believed the mendozas story last night but they hadnt and that meant nothing but trouble outside liz heard running feet a gun bangeda matchlock musket not an old time repeater someone shouted hold it again then another matchlock fired a cry of pain split the night got him said the voice that had told luke to hold it oh wow dad said which fit what liz was thinking almost perfectly for one thing the valley soldiers look a long chance their matchlocks werent very accurate they would have to reload after firing if theyd both missed luke they would have been at his mercy but one of them got him and oh wow fit too well another way too now the valley soldiers knew luke had come out of this house they wouldnt be very happy about that from their point of view they had every right to be unhappy liz didnt care about their point of view she did care about the hassles that were bound to come and they did in no time at all soldiers started pounding on the door open up in the name of king zev they shouted open up in there what do we do dad liz asked we cant let them in tell me about it her father was usually cool as an iceberg in january not now she couldnt remember the last time shed heard him so rattled he raised his voice sarah call for a chamber im doing it mom answered she didnt sound exactly calm either we hear you the soldiers yelled open up when the mendozas didnt something thumped against the doora mans shoulder liz thought how strong is the bar she asked it wasnt a question shed ever thought she would have to worry about well find out wont we now dad sounded more like his usual self but that wasnt the answer she wanted to hear either more quietly he went on i think wed better head for youknowwhere that was smart he didnt want the goons outside to hear that they were heading for the subbasement the goons didnt know the house had a subbasement maybe luke would tell them about the attic hiding place but he couldnt talk about the subbasement because he also didnt know about it more thumps came from the door and then one that brought a groan and a crackle as the hinges started to give way the valley soldiers bayed in triumph cmon hit it again one of them said by then liz was hotfooting it down the stairs to the storerooms in the regular basement the room with the computer link to the home timeline was there when mom came out the door she closed behind her was all but invisible its hinges were a lot stronger than the ones to the front door all the same she carried the macbook under her arm its coming which means its here she said the door to the subbasement was as well concealed as the one to the computer room dad latched it from below after liz and her mother hurried down the stairs then he followed them his shoes clattering on metal stairs the transposition chamber waited for them its door slid open automatically trouble eh the operator said as they got inside oh maybe a little dad answered drylyyes he had himself back together again after what felt like fifteen minutes and was really no time at all they were back in the home timelinewhich didnt mean their hassles were over nine dan was pacing his patrol beat atop the santa monica freeway when sergeant chuck and another private from the company came up to him sidney will take the rest of your shift chuck told him some guys down below need to talk to you pronto whats happening dan asked if they needed to talk to me they wouldve talked to me chuck jerked his thumb towards a ladder leading down on the north side of the freeway go on get moving okay uh yes sergeant dan corrected himself in a hurry chuck didnt even growl at him which proved things were weird when he got to the bottom he wasnt astonished to see the dog handler and the other sergeant hed spoken with before he was surprised to see a captain with them he came to attention and saluted musketeer dan reporting as ordered at ease the captain said and dan let his spine relax max and mike herethe captain pointed to the two sergeantsand your chuck say you probably know more about the traders on glendon than anybody else from the valley does is that the straight skinny i have no idea sir dan answered i mean i was over there a few times but thats all you liked the girl the captain didnt make it a question dan noddedit was true he hoped it didnt land him in trouble the captain said well that puts you one jump ahead of everybody else yes sir dan said when you were a common soldier that was always the right answer to give an officer come on then the captain told him maybe youll be able to help us figure out where the devil theyve gone gone dan felt like somebody trying to play a game whose rules he didnt know i heard some gunshots last night that was us when we caught that soandso of a luke the captain said max got him right where he wont sit down for quite a while the sergeant who was usually in charge of the bloodhounds looked proud of himself the captain went on then we went and broke down the door to the mendozas house they were in therewe could hear em talking to each other they wereand then they werent sergeant max snapped his fingers gone like that whered they go dan asked did they have some secret way out well we turned rocky and bull winkle loose in there to see if they could find the freshest trail max looked unhappy what happened did they disappear into a wall or something dan thought such things were impossible he thought so yeah but you never could tell almost the dog handler answered the hounds went down to the basement and they just kind of parked there right in the middle of the floor and theres nothing there so maybe the mutts are wrong it can happen i guess but i sure dont know where else those people couldve gone they didnt get out the back door sergeant mike put in we had somebody posted there and they just didnt besides that doors still barred from the inside was luke in that house sir did he have a hiding place there dan asked the captain we talked to him about that he finally told us where it was at the officer replied dan wondered how theyd persuaded luke to talk some things he decided he might be better off not knowing the captain still didnt look very happy we found the hideout we could have looked for a month if we didnt know it was there and we never would have no sign the traders had used it though oh dan chewed on that whered they go then good question the captain looked hard at him cmon back to the house with us if anybody on our side has a chance of figuring it out youre the one yes sir ill try sir dan felt he had to add i dont think i can promise you anything lp westwood boulevard he went with sergeant max and sergeant mike and the captain whose name he still didnt know some of the other valley soldiers on the street gave him stern looks others stares full of sympathy he felt embarrassed a common soldier in the company of two sergeants and an officer almost had to be in dutch well maybe i am dan thought maybe i just dontknow it yet they turned right on wilshire and went over to glendon which was the next street east then up a couple of blocks towards ucla and there stood the house with soldiers outside the front door they saluted as the captain approached if they couldnt find liz and her folks how am i supposed to dan wondered dont know where theyre hiding maybe they really did work magic and disappear he shrugged he had to try he went inside with the officer and the underofficers everything was familiar but everything was very quiet the captain took him to a ladder leaned up against the inner courtyard wall go on up the older man said have a look yes sir dan said and he did sure enough it was a hiding place about as comfortable as a cramped one could be this is where luke was he asked he says so the captain answered do you know about any others no sir i didnt know about this one dan said i guess the only way to find others would be to take a close look at all the walls and ceilings well do that eventually the captain didnt sound thrilled about it dan had trouble blaming him he went on now come down from there and have a look at the basement yes sir dan said again and descended he followed the captain and mike and max downstairs to the belowground level it held crates full of trade goods and sacks of beans and barley and parched cornabout what he would have expected sergeant max stepped on a flagstone this is where rocky and bullwinkle think they went he said but its just floor i guess dan got down on his hands and knees only a couple of lamps burned in there could i have one of those he said even though he forgot the please max handed him one the smell of the hot olive oil took him back to when he was a little tiny kid he held the lamp as close to the floor as he could what are you looking for max asked beats me anything really dan held his nose as close to the floor as he could too he squinted staring as hard as he could his sight hadnt started to lengthen so he could peer closer than the captain or the sergeants could he tried to stick his fingernail into a crack between flagstones then he thrust the blade of his belt knife into the crack excitement surged in him the dogs are right i bet this looks like a doorway see he traced a rectangle with the knife and the cement here isnt just like the rest of it the captain stood on the rectangle and stomped hard he cocked his head considering the sound might be something hollow under there what do you boys think the question included the sergeants it plainly didnt include dan mike stomped too he was a big heavyset man with a lot of weight to put behind his boot dog my cats if there isnt sir now how do we go about prying it up they tried the most basic way first they wedged another knife in there and used it for a lever the blade promptly snapped it was sergeant max s knife he had several unpleasant things to say they ended up needing army engineers the engineers had trouble getting the door up too they dug up a flagstone beside the door only to discover concrete beneath it something funnys going on here one of the engineers said i wonder if this is an old time fallout shelter dan shuddered at the thought fallout was poisonhe knew that much nobody in the valley knew much more if it is it would make a perfect hiding place now wouldnt it the captain said sure would the engineer agreed i bet theres a lock on the other side of that trap door gonna take some work to break it but with that other stone gone weve got more room to pry they needed till late afternoon before they finally defeated the lock you found the door kid the captain told dan you can go down there first if you want to gee thanks dan thought but he couldnt look afraid even if he was yes sir he said holding a lamp he went down into the blackness the soles of his boots clanged on metal stairs he held the lamp high now but it didnt throw much light all it did was push the darkness back a littlehe still couldnt see the walls of this chamber he supposed it did have some he couldnt see the floor either not till just before his feet came down on it it was hard like asphalt or concreteit felt too smooth for flagstones he bent down with the lamp at the base of the stairs for a closer look yes that had to be concrete well the captain called from up above he wasnt coming down till he found out whether the fallout had eaten dan well what sir dan let a touch of impatience show you couldnt come right out and say an officer had no guts but he would have bet the sergeants got the message even if the captain didnt its a plain old room thats all he straightened up took a couple of steps forward and proved himself wrong it wasnt a plain old room whatever else it was when he walked out toward the middle the lights in the ceiling went on he stopped and stared up at them his mouth falling open like a fools who could blame him those had to be electric lightsthey were too bright for anything else but he was as sure as made no difference that nobody had seen electric lights since the fire fell and ended the old time what did you just do soldier the captain asked in a very small voice i didnt do anything sir dan said even if he wasnt exactly sure that was true they came on all by themselves he looked around here were these miraculous lights but they sure didnt light up much he might have been inside a concrete box with a glowing lid the floor had yellow lines painted on it outside of the lines were words also in yellow paint and plainly done with stencils keep clearcrosstime traffic reg a dan scratched his head what was that supposed to mean did it mean anything not to him it didnt slowly cautious the captain and the two sergeants descended what is this place sergeant max asked in a low voice beats me dan said i dont think anybodys hiding here though sergeant mike walked over to a wall and thumped on it with his fist he got back a good solid thunk he moved over a couple of feet and did it again thunk and again and again till hed gone all the way around the chamber i dont think there are any secret rooms he said didnt sound like it max agreed i wonder what rocky and bullwinkle would tell us why dont you go get them sergeant the captain kept staring up at the lights in the ceiling they werent bulbs or what dan thought of as bulbs they were more like tubes of light seen through the kind of glass that survived here and there in bathroom windows how do those work the officer whispered how can they work theres electricity somewhere in this house dan looked at the floor again as if expecting to see it sneak along there maybe it did he wouldnt have recognized it had he seen it had he seen anything strange then he would have called it electricity but he didnt the floor was only a floor with that big painted rectangle and some kind of funky warning on it the captain looked at that too whats crosstime traffic he asked as if dan were supposed to know cant tell you sir dan denied everything dyou think its something the westsiders know about electricity the captains gaze went back to those impossible ceiling panels dan could answer that question no way sir nohow we havent seen anything like this anywhere else the two sergeants solemnly nodded dan went on besides if the westsiders had it theyd use it above ground wouldnt they they wouldnt hide it in a basement under a basement i sure wouldnt sergeant max agreed well neither would i the captain said so that means these traders arent ordinary westsiders what are they in that case he looked at dan as if still expecting the common soldier could come right out and tell him but dan said sir i only wish i knew and that was nothing but the truth who was liz really what was she really he wondered if hed ever find out and then he stared up at those magical glowing electric tubes again looking at them blinking at the impossible light they shed he realized liz was only part of the question and probably a small part at that part of liz was glad to be back in the home timeline again cars cell phones hot showers microwaves supermarkets tv radio the net fasartas flush toilets you didnt know how much you missed your comforts till you went without them for a while the home timeline held other pleasures too a ucla campus that wasnt a crumbling ruin overgrown with weeds a santa monica that wasnt grass trying to push up through the glass that nuclear strikes had fused a los angeles that wasnt divided up into a bunch of squabbling little kingdoms no the home timeline wasnt perfect not even close she knew that all too well but her time in that postatomic alternate had taught her more than shed ever imagined about the difference between better and worse but we ought to go back she told her father a couple of days after theyd escaped from the valley soldiers i know he said we were really getting close to finding out what started the war there thats what the grant was for if we give incomplete results he sighed well if we do we wont see any more research money for crosstime travel thats for sure he sighed again stuck in the home timeline if you had to be stuck anywhere there were lots of worse places liz understood that in ways she never had before even so she said i dont want to be stuck anywhere dad smiled you arent sweetie even if i turn out to be you arent they wont come down on you because of this i got the grant so i get the blame and i deserve it if i didnt hide luke they would have shot him liz broke in they shot him anyway dad reminded her but for you its no harm no foul youve still got to go to college and get your career going nobodyll hold anything that happened when you were eighteen against you its not like you robbed a store or something i blame me even if nobody else does she said if dan hadnt kept coming around he wouldnt have got suspicious of us id bet my last benjamin that thats what made them come looking for luke the second night you dont know for sure you cant know for sure her father said besides what youre really blaming yourself for is being a pretty girl theres nothing wrong with that believe me there isnt there is when it causes trouble and it does liz thought but that didnt want to come out instead she said i should have told him to get lost when he started visiting all the time you would have been out of character if you did dad said i didnt think hed turn out to be such a pest she said as if her father hadnt spoken after all hes just a barbarian from an alternate where everybodys a barbarian dad finished for her she wouldnt have put it quite the same way which didnt mean she thought he was wrong he went on and yeah he is a barbarian hes ignorant he has fleas and lice and bad breath and he doesnt smell good but none of that makes him dumb he can see when things are peculiar he sure can liz interrupted in turn i kept making little mistakes and he kept pouncing on them making little mistakes and getting pounced on because of them is the biggest problem we have going out to the alternates her lather said almost everybody does it its like going to a foreign country you can speak perfect french but youll still have a devil of a time making a real parisian believe you grew up on the left bank speaking perfect french or almost any other language was easy like everybody else liz had a computer implant behind her left ear it interfaced with the speech center in her brain so software could feed her the words and the grammar and the logic behind a language she wished learning history and math and literature were that simple maybe one day they would be software engineers improved implants all the time but that was a distraction now she said can we get back to that alternate without giving ourselves away a lot of people know who we are tell me about it her father said unhappily i wish we had another outlet for a transposition chamber closer than speedro he muttered to himself maybe i should count my blessings a lot of alternates theres only one for the whole world we cant be traders again not if we go back up into westwood what would we be instead liz liked acting she was pretty good at it she had to remind herself her life would depend on her performance here maybe just people looking for work dad said there are always people scrounging in that alternate because there isnt enough to go around liz wasnt so sure she liked that people looking for work would go hungry a lot of the time people pretending to look for work would go hungry too and how do i get back to the ucla library for more research the people there know me too well theyre westsiders they wouldnt give you away to the valley soldiers but her father checked himself and did some more muttering only they might it just takes one to sell you out and weve never yet found an alternate where some people wont do things like that people who didnt wouldnt be human liz said no i guess not dad agreed we havent gone to any alternates where the people arent human beings there are bound to be some but the transposition chambers havent traveled that far yet probably just as well w hat do you mean ii we make little mistakes in the alternates where people are just like us how would we pretend to fit in where theyre really really different oh liz chewed on that i dont know hut i bet we could be back up to the westside in disguise i always wanted to see how id look in a blond wig youd look silly thats how he wasnt wrong not when liz was slim and dark like most people in the home timelines los angeles the westside and the valley in the bombravaged alternate had many more fairskinned people lots of waves of immigration hadnt happened there but even if dad was rightmaybe especially because he was right liz gave him a dirty look youre mean she said why because i told you the truth sometimes telling the truth is the meanest thing you can do that brought dad up short he thought it over then nodded well youve got something there but i dont think im guilty this time around honest i dont id look silly in a blond wig too liz eyed his closecropped black hair he was starting to get some gray at the temples when did that happen some time when i wasnt looking liz thought what did her parents think they were doing by getting older behind her back that was pretty sneaky she nodded to herself they should cut it out blond wigs or no blond wigs do you think we can get back up to the westside without giving ourselves away she asked sure dad said what could go wrong they could recognize us and shoot us for spies liz suggested they could torture us before they shoot us for spies how many bad adventure videos have you downloaded lately he asked that kind of thing doesnt happen if youre careful if we were careful enough they never would have got suspicious of us in the first place liz said well do you want to stay behind when your mother and i go back dad asked you can do that it wont look bad on your record or anything you can just start college a quarter earlier than you would have no liz didnt even need to think about that i dont want you sticking your necks out if im not there and i do want to go back and find out what was going on in that alternate in she paused looking inside herself and i want to find out how things turn out there now too her father gave her a sly smile and you want to find out how dan s doing too right she sniffed iwont let him get my goat she told herself i just won t dan can do whatever he does as long as he does it a long way from me she said if he sees me after we go back thats trouble mm so it is dad agreed he nodded as if making up his mind okay well see what we can set up cool liz grinned speedro here we come the strap on dan s binoculars was new the binoculars themselves dated back to the old time tasco they said whatever a tasco was and made in japan he knew where japan was hed been to school alter all it was on the far side of the pacific thousands and thousands of miles away once in a blue moon a sailing ship from japan would come in to speedro but those were fishing boats blown off course in storms he tried to imagine a steamboatthere still were some steamboats for coastal trade or a big sailing ship crossing the ocean full of binoculars and what would america have sent back to japan m that steamboat or in another one guns maybe or automobiles he knew he was just guessing he raised the binoculars to his eyes and peered south from the santa monica freeway everything there leaped closer binoculars werent magic any more than old time guns were still even though hed been to school he didnt understand how they worked he did understand that they worked which was all that really counted he scanned back and forth looking for any signs that the westsiders were getting frisky he spotted one fellow who was plainly a soldier the man was standing on the roof of a tall building maybe half a mile south of the freeway he was looking north through binoculars do his say tasco too dan wondered and then is he looking straight at me he raised his left arm and waved after a moment the guy on the rooftop waved back why not they might be enemies but they both had the same job and nobody was shooting at anybody right this minute a gong stood only a few feet from dan if he did see anything that looked like trouble he was supposed to clang on it for all he was worth that would send valley soldiers running to help him if nobodyd shot him before they got here in the meantime he waved to the other soldier again and fought against a yawn this wasnt a very interesting duty necessary maybe but dull but he could still think about all the mysteries at liz s house he understood those even less than he understood how binoculars worked which only made him more eager to try to figure them out electric lights nobody in the world had electric lights as far as dan knew but liz s house did and they came on when you went down onto that floor and moved around w hen you walked back up the stairs they went out how did they know was somebody watching to make them go on and off dan didnt see how that was possible he couldnt imagine any other way it would work either does that make me dumb he wondered if it did everybody else in the valley was as dumb as he was sergeant max and sergeant mike were floored and werent too shy to admit it the captain dan had finally found out his name was horace was baffled too captain horace had gone looking for scholars at ucla hed brought back one fellow who claimed he understood electricity the scholar wore a dirty white coat and a frayed necktie from old time he looked like a bright man he talked like a bright man and when he saw those ceiling lights come on dan had been down there with him and watched him stare the way everybody else did impossible he said youre looking at it it must be possible captain horace said that sure made sense to dan not to the guy from ucla impossible he said again no battery could hold its charge from the time when the fire fell till now maybe these are new batteries dan had suggested captain horace beamed at him by the way the scholar looked at him he was an idiot whod never wise up enough to become a moron i know what batteries can do i know what kind of batteries we can make nowadays the man said fiddling with the knot on his tie fm familiar with the research not just here but in frisco and vegas and as far away as salt lake city nobody can do anything like this nobody how long does it take for research news to get from salt lake city to here captain horace asked less time than youd think the scholar said the telegraph between salt lake and vegas works most of the time course you only get an outline on the telegraph the real journal articles arrive after a couple of years but people couldnt keep anything like this a secret and why would they want to captain horace had no answer for that neither did dan the officer did have a question of his own if this stuff is impossible whats it doing here kindly tell me that the scholar couldnt he just stared up at the glowing ceiling some more as far as i can see its a miracle he said a lot of people believed god was angry at the world and stopped working miracles after the fire fell didnt that explain why things were so messed up nowadays but some people said it was a miracle anybody lived through the russianamerican war dan didnt know what to believe he did know thinking about that stuff was a lot more interesting than sweeping the southern horizon with his binoculars he wondered what was going on at liz s house right this minute he didnt want to be on duty here in the sun he would rather have gone back to the basement under the basement and stared at the electric lights fluorescents they were called fluorescents so the scholar said anyhow it was an awfully fancy name he tried to explain how they were different from ordinary light bulbs but dan didnt get it he wondered if the scholar made up the word to sound smart captain horace didnt seem to think so though right now they were fluorescing or doing whatever fluorescents did and fm not there to see them dan thought angrily ihave to stay out here to try to make sure cats soldiers dont sneak up and murder us it hardly seemed fair you couldnt tell you were going anywhere when you rode in a transposition chamber and in a very real sense you werent going anywhere you got out in exactly the same place as the one youd left the same place yes but not the same alternate details details liz thought traveling between alternates was as boring as flying coach more boring really you didnt have a video screen inside a transposition chamber and you couldnt look out the window transposition chambers had no windows and if they did all youd see out of them was nothing with a capital n she sighed she just had to sit in her seat and sog like breakfast cereal soaking up milk going between the home timeline and the nuked alternate didnt seem to take any longer than coming back had in reality neither took any time at all but the body perceived something that felt like time while the chamber shuttled between worlds duration the chronophysicists called it a few lights on the control panel at the front of the chamber went from amber or red to green were here the operator announced liz and her mother and father stepped out of the transposition chamber the bare concretewalled chamber in which they stood was a lot like the one from which theyd departed but it wasnt the same chamber and even if they were in the same place they were also in a new place theyd left san pedro the harbor district of los angeles in california in the united states now theyd come to the independent kingdom of speedro behind them the transposition chamber disappeared chambers never hung around long once theyd delivered their passengers the always had something else to do some other alternate to go to hello there someone called from up above where the trap door opened we knew you were coming so we baked a cake the stoyadinoviches who ran crosstime traffics speedro trading center turned out to be very nice people a lot of the sailors and fishermen in speedro were descended from serbs so the stoyadinoviches fit right in and just as george said his wifeher name was irma really had baked a cake it was sweetened with honey and raisins because sugar was rare and expensive here that didnt mean it wasnt good george stoyadinovich had an amazing mustache asterix and obelix and even vitalstatistix would have envied it the ends hung down onto his chest he also had a good grasp of what was going on in speedro yeah theyre all hot to help the westside he said if cal gets westwood back speedro will take some of the south bay as payment for giving him a hand and if cal doesnt get westwood back speedro will grab some of the south bay anyhow irma stoyadinovich added in that case the westside wont be strong enough to do anything about it can we get over the border between speedro and the westside dad asked sure mr stoyadinovich nodded which made his soupstrainer waft up and down long as youre carrying something the westside army can usebullets boots whatevertheyll give you a big hug and a kiss whats going on up at the santa monica freeway line liz asked both stoyadinoviches frowned well thats a long way off mrs stoyadinovich said it wasnt more than fortyfive minutes by car unless the traffic was bad but that was in the home timeline here it was a couple of days away at least yeah we arent so sure about the news we get from up there george stoyadinovich agreed most of the time its gone through six or eight people by the time it gets to us who knows how weird it gets while its doing that its like playing telephone at a party you know liz nodded by the time a phrase got whispered from a dozen mouths into a dozen ears and came back to the person who started it it sounded nothing like what that person said at first there isnt much shooting right nowwere pretty sure of that mr stoyadinovich went on you guys are going to try to sneak back up into westwood right gotta do it dad answered we got the grant to see why things went kablooie here and the yrls the best place to look the url mom reminded him its the url here dad made a face he hated making mistakes liz took alter him there mom was more easygoing about it rut if he said that around locals theyd wonder where the devil he came from and it was such an easy slip to make liz shook her head no wonder dan got so curiousor suspiciousabout her did she betray herself every time she opened her mouth she could hope not anyway that mustache made mr stoyadinovich s frown a fearsome thing well you know what youre doing i guess but if they chased you out of there once i sure wouldnt want to go back so soon if the grant runs out dad didnt go on or need to mr and mrs stoyadinovich both nodded yeah i know that song he said but watch yourselves just the same youve got a wagon and a team for us dont you mom said sure do the stoyadinoviches said in chorus george went on youll dig it bodys made from an old time station wagon so itll hold a lot and youll look rich and the horses are as gentle as you please to liz that mattered more than the rest till she came here horses were animals that ran races or lived on farms shed never dreamt how important they could be in alternates where machines didnt work oh shed known but she hadnt seen with her own eyes that made all the difference in the world now how will i get back into the url she wondered somebody from her family would have to figure out a way well they still had some time to think about it they wouldnt get up to the westside right away in an alternate like this nothing happened in a hurry ten dan pulled the trigger on his matchlock the serpentine swept down the glowing end of the match set off the priming powder around the touchhole the charge inside the barrel of the gun exploded the matchlock bucked against dan s shoulder sergeant chuck went down the range to examine the target howd i do dan called after him well you hit it chuck didnt sound as happy as he should have like a lot of sergeants he was allergic to sounding happy no matter what and he had another bone to pick with dan i dont see how you hit it you arent getting enough practice and you know you arent i cant help it sergeant dan said they want me to help them find out stuff about the traders house he didnt mention liz s name that would only have set chuck off again chuck turned out to need zero help from him so they found electric lights there big deal he said all ive got to tell you is they may have found electric lights but theyre ruining somebody who was a pretty good soldier that might have been the first time hed ever said he thought dan made a pretty good soldier it was just like him to say it so it suggested dan had been but wasnt any more if im all ruined and everything sergeant how did i hit the target dan asked luck chuck answered at once nothing but dumb luck i bet i do it again dan knew he was taking a chance the matchlock wasnt a very accurate weapon even a good shot could go astray if his did chuck would make him pay for it oh would he ever but the sergeant shook his head nah dont bother even if you hit it doesnt really prove anything besides youre getting soft because youre not exercising enough you cant tell me you are either since dan couldnt he tried to change the subject im just doing what the officers tell me to do sergeant yeah like officers know anything chuck said scornfully are they gonna figure out electric lights get serious are you gonna help em figure those lights out what do you know about electricity nothing sergeant dan gave the only honest answer he could well then triumph filled chuck s voice but neither does anybody else dan said and youre gonna be the one who finds out ha dont make me laugh even though dan didnt think that was real likely either he didnt like the sergeant teasing him about it and he had a good way to get chuck off his back i do need to go back they want me there the more fools them chuck said but he couldnt tell dan not to go not when dan had orders he did tell dan to clean his musket first dan did he took keeping the musket clean very seriously then he hurried off to the traders house on glendon even if liz hadnt lived there he would have been glad to go every time the electric lights came on and how by magic he fell as ii he were back in the old time ii he only had some gasoline he might have gone looking for an automobile to see if he could make it start captain horace had put sentries at the front door he didnt want anybody who wasnt supposed to be there gelling in and gawking at the lights the sentries knew who dan was he had no trouble getting past them sergeant max and his bloodhounds were in the courtyard by now the bloodhounds knew who dan was too they came over and sniffed ins boots he patted their heads and scratched them behind the ears they looked as happy as you could if your face was made for saying your grandmother had just died do you expect them to find anything here after all this time dan asked max the sergeant shook his head nah not really but i can give em a rest from running around so thats cool you know they re good dogs they wont get into any trouble okay dan said if you argued with a sergeant you lost unless you were an officer sometimes you lost even if you were an officer a lot of young lieutenants let their sergeants run their platoons more often than not that was smart too because sergeants usually had a better notion of what was going on dan went downstairs he wanted to look at the electric lights again even if he didnt understand them he liked being around them they told him something about how marvelous old time really was to have lights like those whenever you wanted them how cool was that captain horace was clown there too with a grayhaired man whose hair stuck out in tufts that went every which way dan recognized him straight off dr saul was the closest thing to a scientist the valley had up till now dan had thought he was the smartest man in the world maybe he was these days but now dan couldnt help wondering how he stacked up against a real old time scientist was he still smart or nothing but a bumbling fool then again no matter how clever the old time scientists were they went and blew up the world how smart did that make them really right now dr saul was pitching a fit those lights have got to have a power source somewhere he shouted at captain horace where the officer askedreasonably dan thought what does it look like i dont know yes dr saul sounded plenty peeved if i knew things like that id be able to do them myself where do the wires from the fluorescent tubes go beats me captain horace sounded cheerful admitting how ignorant he was far as i know nobodys looked there are wires up there you say dan thought dr saul would blow a gasket he wasnt quite sure what a gasket was but the scientist sure looked ready to blow something he tore at his hair dan had never seen anybody do that before though people talked about tearing their hair all the time no wonder dr saul s looked as if hed never heard of a comb maybe he was lucky to have anv hair at all nobodys looked he roared loud enough to raise echoes in the basement under the basement are you people blind or just really really stupid why havent you looked he suddenly rounded on dan why havent you looked he demanded as if it were all dan s fault sir i dont know anything about electricity i dont know anything about wires dan answered im still learning how to take care of a matchlock well do you suppose you can learn to get me a ladder dr saul said somebodys got to do the work around here by the way he said it he meant he had to do everything himself but he didnt have to find a ladder and then lug it down two flights of stairs that was work for the likes of dan once the ladder was in place dr saul climbed it as nimbly as a monkey that was one more thing people said without thinking about how nimble were monkeys dan had never seen one he didnt know anybody who had either the scientist got a cover off so he could look right at the fluorescent tube under it he cautiously reached out and touched the tube isnt it hot dan asked no i didnt think it would be but dr saul sounded relieved enough to show he hadnt been sure he gave the tube a twist and it came away from something set into the ceiling lt also stopped glowing which made the underground room noticeably gloomier did you kill it captain horace asked no no no dr saul shook his head his hair went on moving after his head stopped i want a look at the socket cautiously he lugged at the socket its set into the concrete confound it the wire must go through there are you sure theres a wire the officer said of course i am of course there is dr saul said this isnt magic you know but wed have to chip away that concrete to get at the wire and trace it back to the power source he muttered to himself wed probably break something if we suddenly started chipping concrete who would do the real work it wouldnt be dr saul he thought about thingshe didnt actually do them it wouldnt be captain horace or any sergeant no it would be somebody a lot like dan somebody who wasnt good for anything else theyd look at it like that anyhow dan slid up the stairs and out the trap door while dr saul was still talking nobody noticed him go who paid attention to common soldiers when you needed one you went and grabbed him otherwise forget it by the time they might have thought about needing dan he was already back on the santa monica freeway line with the rest of his company he could hope they would grab somebody closer to chip concrete they likely did they didnt come grab him anyhow that suited him fine liz had seen several wagons like the one the stoyadinoviches gave the mendozas it was made from an old chevrolet a brand still alive in the home timeline the engine and the fenders and the roof were gone losing the engine saved a lot of weight losing the fenders saved weight too and let the wainwright install big wooden wheels with iron rims to replace metal wheels and rubber tires that had rotted away and in place of the roof were iron hoops and a cloth cover that reached up much higher and let the auto body hold more when liz looked at the team hitched to that contraption she cracked up whats so funny george stoyadinovich asked theyre good horsesyou wont find better ones this side of santa anita im sure they are she said but its a car right and whats a car a horseless carriage right and so this is a horseless carriagewith horses how crazy is that mr stoyadinovich thought about that for a few seconds then he started to laugh too i never looked at it that way before he turned to dad keep an eye on her shes dangerous really i never would have noticed dad said deadpan mr stoyadinovich laughed harder than ever liz stuck her nose in the air and sniffed that only made mrs stoyadinovich and morn bust up liz glared at her mother who ignored her sometimes you couldnt win youve got a pretty good cargo there too mr stoyadinovich said people go out and party when they find old time levis in good shape and they should because it doesnt happen very often any more and the ones youre taking north theyre just like new he winked liz knew what the wink meant the jeans in the wagon werent just like new from some unearthed clothing store they were new from the home timeline the locals wouldnt know the difference these were special trade levi s made in a style that wouldnt have been out of place in the s the chevy wagons doors and front seal were still intact the windshield could have survived but the driver needed to be able to use the reins when he sat behind the steering wheel is that a cool set of wheels or what george stoyadinovich said winking again by the standards of this alternate the wagon was without a doubt a cool set of wheels by the standards of the home timeline i think its what liz said for a moment george didnt get it then he did and laughed twice as hard to show he did you are a troublemaker he said he aimed his right forefinger at liz and brought his thumb down bang she mimed being shot and staggered all over the place too much ham in your sandwich dad told her lets go mom was the relentlessly practical one in the family the sooner we get started the sooner we make it up to the westside again dad sat behind the wheel springs creaked when liz got in beside him the old upholstery had long since rotted away the new upholstery was leather which made liz a little queasy people in the home timeline didnt think leather was quite so bad as fur but they used imitations almost all the time there were no imitations here all the old time naugahyde was long gone and naugas seemed to be extinct in this alternate so the locals used the real stuff and didnt lose any sleep about it this couldnt have been any more realit smelled powerfully of cow giddyap dad flicked the reins he had a whip too in case the horses didnt feel like moving but they leaned into the traces and started to pull slowly at first then at a more respectable speed the wagon headed toward the harbor freeway it had its southern end in speedro in the home timeline people called the harbor freeway the as often as not it was part of the us interstate highway system here it hadnt joined that system when the fire fell a sign left over from the old time told the world it was state highway they had to pay a twentyfivecent toll to get on what was still known as a freeway even if it wasnt free dad passed the silver coin to the toll collector without a murmur old as it was beatup as it was the harbor or or or whatever you called it was far and away the best route north not far from where the harbor freeway joined the also called the san diego freewaya hotair balloon floated five hundred meters in the air tethered to the ground by a rope speedro kept it up there to watch for trouble from a long way off seeing it made tears sting liz s eyes in the home timeline a goodyear blimp took off and landed right about there she wondered if the balloons gastight skin had once been part of a blimp the san diego freeway swung northwest the harbor freeway went straight north in the home timeline it went straight north to downtown los angeles in this alternate it went straight north to nothing several big bombs had taken out downtown here the stump of city hall still stood it looked like a candle that had burned most of the way down and then slumped over in the home timeline los angeles county had more people than fortytwo or fortythree states liz couldnt remember which even with cars burning clean hydrogen that los angeles still had smog and so did this one even with far less than a tenth as many people the way the mountains and the breezes worked air pollution always got trapped here when the spaniards first saw santa monica bay they called it the bay of smokes so tears of sorrow werent the only things bothering liz s eyes the horses plodded up the when you lived in a world without cars without phones without tv and the net nothing happened in a hurry dad tried to use the steering wheel to keep the chevy wagons wheels from going into potholes sometimes he could and sometimes he couldnt when they did hit a bump liz s teeth came together with a click the springs were as old as the rest of the chassis other wagons used the freeway so did people on horseback people on foot people on boneshaking bicycles and one guy on a skateboard of sorts hed found old time roller skates and nailed them to the ends of a board when he pushed himself along he could go faster than he would have walking dad eyed his style hes not ready for the x games thats for sure they have the sense to wear helmets when they do those stunts mom said knee pads and elbow pads too if he falls down its just him and the asphalt i bet the asphalt wins people arent nearly as safe here as they are in the home timeline liz said they worry about it a lot less though its funny its crazy her mother said but its true liz insisted people here figure somethings going to get them and it usually does dad said in the home timeline they think they ought to stay safe so they try more and you know what sooner or later something gets them anyway thats true but it usually takes longer than it would here mom said and dad couldnt very well disagree they pulled off the freeway at the rosecrans ramp which was still in decent shape a large sign directed them to gordon s good eats liz knew that offramp in the home timeline because her family used it to visit cousins a dennys sat at that corner there she stared at gordon s oh my god she said its the same building it sure is mom agreed prices will be better here dad said which was bound to be true he added i wouldnt be surprised if the food is too you couldnt get a hamburger with avocado and vineripened tomatoes at a dennys on the other hand you couldnt get an icecream sundae or even a coke at gordon s good eats though the orange juice was better than dennys when it came to restrooms dennys won hands down as she usually did in this alternate liz came out of this one wrinkling her nose there was a guarded campground next to gordon s camping behind barbed wire cost another quarter to slay in character dad grumbled when he paid it afterwards he winked at liz there hadnt been quarters in the home timeline for years and years there a quarter wasnt enough to worry about neither was a dollar even if they still had dollar coins dad asked people coming south what things were like on the westside theres gonna be a rumble man one traveler said hasnt happened yet but theres gonna be another man nodded can we get through dad didnt say anything about stopping you never could tell who was a spy or for whom the traveler coming down from the north shrugged you can try like i wouldnt give you no moneyback guarantee some of the phrases of old time advertising had stuck in the language here the back of the seat reclined in the chevy it went back farther than an airplane seat would you could sleep on it after a fashion liz and her parents lay side by side one of them wiggling was liable to wake somebody else liz had passed plenty of nights she enjoyed more by what had to be a miracle gordon s good eats had coffee the next morning liz didnt usually like it but she thought of it as medicine now her folks poured down cup after cup it wasnt cheap not by this alternates standards but dad didnt say boo they got back on the they didnt have to pay a toll this timeand started north again with luck they would get up to westwood as the sun was setting liz thought that was good for all kinds of reasons if it was dark the valley soldiers would have a harder time recognizing them then dad passed mom the reins he ducked into the back of the wagon when he returned his beard was gone he didnt look like the same person any more after he took back the reins mom did up her hair instead of letting it fall down over her shoulders she put on a pair of glasses to replace her contacts she looked different too even if not so much as dad did your turn liz she said when she got through liz put her hair up too mom showed her how she looked in a mirror from an old time compact she did seem different but different enough maybe for somebody whod met her only a couple of times if dan sees me hell know who i am she said gloomily well what are the odds dad said theres only one of him after all and we wont be going right back to where we were besides theyre probably still trying to figure out how we disappeared mom said they cant think wed come back again i sure hope not liz said curiosity drew dan back to the house that had been liz s he knew what they said about cats he knew he ran the risk of hard unpleasant work he went anyway he was a soldier but he wasnt an old soldier sure enough somebodya luckless common soldier not named dan had chipped away a lot of concrete from the roof of the basement under the basement some other soldieror maybe the same onehad swept up most of it most but not all little chunks still gritted under the soles of dan s boots dr saul was up on a ladder again he was poking around up there with a stick hed said something about electricity not biting wood dan didnt follow all ol that but dr saul knew his own business best or maybe nobody knew anything this cant be the power pack that keep these lights going dr saul insisted it cant be i tell you its too smallway way too small well if its not what is captain horace asked i dont know dr saul yelled and then he said something dan wouldnt have expected to hear from a distinguished scientist captain horace was about to say something just as lovely when somebody yelled from up above theyre clanging the alarm what horace said then made dr saul s remark seem like sweet talk by comparison what dan said made both the officer and the scientist gape at him he never knew it though he was clattering up the stairs and paid no attention to whatever went on behind him he dashed up the stairs from the basement to ground level too by then he noticed captain horace wasnt real far behind him but the captain couldnt catch him dan ran out ol the house down glendon to wilshire down wilshire to westwood boulevard and down westwood boulevard to the freeway line the shooting had already started by the time he got there westsiders to the south were banging away at valley soldiers up on the freeway take your place sergeant chuck yelled when he saw dan dan did he started loading his matchlock he could see plumes of smoke that showed where enemy musketeers were firing he worried more about what he couldnt see riflemen with old time weapons could shoot at him from ranges at which he couldnt hope to reply they used smokeless powder too unless he saw a muzzle flash he wouldnt even know where they were shooting from and if they hit him no he didnt want to think about that then he heard a bigger explosion and saw a bigger flash from a distant window good chuck yelled dog my cats if that wasnt an old time rifle blowing up ammunition two long lifetimes old could get touchycould and did yes riflemen needed several different kinds of courage a more familiar boom made horace duck a cannonball flew over his head and landed with a crash somewhere north of the freeway westside artillerymenor would they be from speedrostarted reloading their piece where are our rifles chuck yelled an old time rifle could shoot as far as one of those cannon a matchlock couldnt come close dan didnt waste ammunition trying the valleys fearsomecaliber machine gun could make hash of the enemy gun crew in nothing flat where was it nowhere close enough to use anyway valley riflemen did start shooting then every round they fired meant scrounging for more what would happen when it all finally ran out or grew too unstable to use the matchlock musketeer would reign supreme that was what in spite of the riflemen the cannon boomed again this time the roundshot thudded into one of the freeway supports it felt like an earthquake to dan the supports had to be strong theyd stood up through real earthquakes but dan was pretty sure they werent meant to stand up to cannon fire what would happen if one fell down then a stretch of freeway falls down too dummy then you fall down he wanted lo do what any soldier in a spot like that would want to do he wanted to run away but he couldnt his superiors would hang him for being a cowardunless they decided to do something even more interesting and painful that wasnt his biggest worry though letting his buddies down was so he stayed where he was posted under cover of the rifle and cannon fire enemy soldiers ran toward the freeway line he fired at one of them the fellow went down maybe dan s bullet hit him maybe someone elses did dan never knew for sure and didnt much care all he knew was that he had to reload as fast as he could and he did the chevy wagon had come a long way up the when the gunfire to the north started up oh dear liz s mother said oh no liz said what liz s father said meant about the same thing as oh dear and oh no still it was a good thing the wagon that had been a car carried no more gasoline what dad said would have made the stuff explode then he said something a little calmer but no less disgusted timing is everything isnt it how are we supposed to get through that mom asked carefully dad suggested mom and liz both gave him the same kind of look the look you gave somebody being difficult on purpose he sounded hurt as he went on well i dont see how else we can make it through that unless we feel like getting filled full of holes which isnt what i had in mind let me put it another way liz said when dad was being difficult sometimes the best thing to do was be difficult right back how do we go around that or how do we get to westwood without getting shot those were two other ways as a matter of fact and the second one let dad keep on being difficult if he felt like it moms warning cough worked as well as a lions warning growl would have did i say anything dad asked plaintively not yet mom said i suggest you dont unless it helps okay the only way to get to westwood by going around the fighting is probably by going through one of the dead zones liz wasnt sure that helped even if she was pretty sure her father was right dead zones were the places where bombs had landed they were the reason the harbor freeway didnt make it up to downtown los angeles in this alternate they were the reason the santa monica freeway didnt make it all the way into santa monica they werent radioactive any more not after years but they were still so battered that hardly anybody lived in them can we get the wagon through mom asked wont we stand out like bugs on a plate liz said at the same time i dont know dad told mom to liz he said no we wont stand out that bad things are flat in the dead zones but not flat flat if you know what i mean thats not what worries me about the whole thing and what worries you about the whole thing is mom prompted whether the westside and speedro will try to sneak soldiers through the dead zone and get into westwood that way dad said does the valley have troops looking west if they dont the other side will turn their flank just like that he snapped his fingers a split second later so did liz i bet thats what luke was trying to find out i bet youre right her father said one thing we can be pretty sure of thoughif he did find out he didnt pass it on to the people farther south of course we dont know if he was the only spy they had if they were smart he wouldnt have been i dont like the idea of maybe needing to leave the wagon behind mom said how can we be traders if we dont have trade goods and does the valley have soldiers posted at the edge of the santa monica dead zone good question dad said if there are no other questions class is dismissed you say that when you mean you dont know liz said i never worried about it did you dad said liz had to shake her head he added besides they could have sent them out after we uh disappeared from this alternate what it all boils down to is which stupid chance do we want to take mom finished for him he nodded couldnt have put it better myself the santa monica freeway line held through the first day of fighting valley riflemen and musketeers kept westside and speedro soldiers from breaking through for a couple of hours then the heavy machine gun arrived it fired off a burstpock pock pock pock those big heavy booms couldnt be mistaken for anything else neither could the way the big heavy bullets chewed through wood and bricksand fleshout to a mile and beyond as soon as the machine gun opened up the enemy lost his enthusiasm for advancing ha sergeant chuck yelled thought we forgot about it did you well lets see how you like it the westsiders didnt like it a bit one of their cannon thundered the ball flew over the machinegun crews heads you couldnt hide a cannon not with all the smoke it spat the machine gunners started banging away at it as soon as it fired if dan had served the cannon he would have run for cover as soon as it fired but what did you do then you couldnt shoot once and vanish not if you wanted to win and so the cannoneers had to come out again and try to reload their piece one of the men in the machinegun crew had binoculars much like the tascos dan used on sentry duty as soon as he saw the artillerymen stirring he let out a yell the machine gun fired several more bursts another cannon fired and another one cannonball cut a valley soldier in half about six feet from the machine gun dan tried not to look at that but it had a sick fascination to it the poor mans top half didnt die fast enough to suit dan or probably the fellow himself but the near miss was also just one of those things to the machinegun crew they went on shooting as if nothing had happened before dan went into battle himself he wouldnt have understood that he did now if the machine gunners had the shakes they didnt have time to indulge them doing your job doing what you could for your friends came first that was also true for the westsiders and the soldiers from speedro who seemed to be their allies they pushed forward again and again even though the terrible machine gun and the valley riflemen and musketeersand once or twice even the archerspunished them when they tried medics with red crosses on their smocks dragged the wounded to cover you werent supposed to shoot at medicsit wasnt sporting accidents did happen for the most part they were real accidents not cheating dan glanced at the sun which was sliding down toward the pacific that was how he thought about it he didnt worry about the earth turning he worried about whatll we do when it gets dark depends on what those sweet and charming people do sergeant chuck said or words more or less to that effect okay cool far out even man dan said whatll they do what do we do if they try a night attack gotta have fires chuck answered we get some big fires going theyll show us anybody who tries sneaking up he went on thinking out loud gotta get fuel together then we should have done that already but i dont think we have or not enough he eyed dan in a sweet and charming way hey dan squawked he didnt like shooting at people he really didnt like people shooting at him but he didnt want to chop wood and carry it either cmon mancut me some slack i was the one who made you think of this well yeah the sergeant admitted he wasnt even slightly used to backing down after a moment he reached over and thumped dan on the arm anybody whod sooner stay and fight than get out of its okay in my book mm all of a sudden dan wondered whether squawking had been such a good idea but once you chose something you didnt get to take it over if you got to try again to do things differently wouldnt you have another world alter a while maybe better maybe worse but for sure not the same sergeant chuck went to talk to captain kevin maybe kevin had to talk with higherups too any which way some of kevin s company and some of the reinforcements came down off the freeway line before long dan heard them hacking away with axes he heard them cussing too they liked their newduty no more than he would have like it or not they got the job done thecaliber machine gun laid down covering fire so they could move the wood out in front of the freeway lineout to the south a couple of soldiers got wounded doing that but only a couple at sunset the valley men lit the bonfires the wind had been coming out of the west off the ocean it swung around after the sun went down and started blowing from the mountains to the sea if flying embers spread the fires toward bombravaged santa monica well so what dan watched them burn that way with if anything a certain sense of relief anybody trying to sneak through the dead zone would be sorry eleven once upon a time in both this alternate and the home timeline the section of los angeles called venice had really had canals they were long gone there and they were long gone here too the mendozas wagon rolled north through venice toward the wasteland that was santa monica liz tried not to think about the gunfire to the northto the northeast now not thinking about it wasnt easy because it got louder and closer every minute she wasnt calm or anything close to calm to keep from driving her parents crazy she had to pretend she was after a while she wondered if they were pretending too so they wouldnt drive her squirrely if they were they made better actors than she did the farther north she and her folks went the stranger the looks people gave them you fixing to go into the dead zone a cobbler called looking up from the boot he was resoling what if we are dad said well plenty of folks go in there the local answered not so many come out again you look like nice people wouldnt want to see anything bad happen to you a ferretfaced fellow corning out of the tavern next door leered at the chevy wagon wouldnt want to see anything bad happen to you while we aint around to grab the leftovers he said oh shut up stu the cobbler said and then to the mendozas dont pay him no mind hes got as much in the way of brains as my cat only i dont have a cat erright dad said any which way i expect we can take care of ourselves he displayed a modern copy made in the home timeline of an old time tommy gun well said the cobbler who didnt seem to know quite what it was pretty fancy piece you got there buddy he turned aint it stu stu where the devil did he go hed turned green and ducked back into the tavern liz watched him do it he knew exactly what dad was showing off and how many bullets it could spray he clearly wasnt a predatorhe had no taste for a fight hewas a scavenger if somebody else did the mendozas in hed scrounge what he could from the things the real robbers didnt want are you sure that was a good idea mom asked as the wagon rolled on one of those guns is worth a mint here we may have people coming after us on account of it anybody who tries will be sorry dad said we dont just have one tommy gunweve got three liz was anything but thrilled about shooting people but she wasnt thrilled about people shooting her either she supposed she could pull the trigger if she had to if she did end up killing somebody shed probably heave her guts out right afterwards when she said so dad replied as long as it is afterwards in the meantime do what youve got to do you can be sorry about it later you dont talk like a history professor mom said i hope not he told her i know enough history to know thinking like a history prof from the home timeline while were here is liable to get us killed i dont want that to happen its too permanent houses and shops with people in them got thinner and thinner on the ground piles of rubble and obviously empty buildings grew more and more common but just because a building was obviously empty that didnt mean it really and truly was empty maybeprobablybandits lurked in some of the sorry structures that looked about ready to collapse under their own weight dad handed mom and liz their submachine guns that put a lot of firepower on display were the bandits on vacation or did they figure they didnt want to tackle a wagon defended by three tommy guns liz had no way to know she did know she was glad things stayed quiet and then they got into the dead zone where the bomb hit there mostly wasnt enough of anything left to make rebuilding worthwhile everything looked charred and melted even after years the scrubby weeds pushing up through racks in the glassy crust didnt do much to hide that nothing could it was like looking at a dead body in a threadbare suit liz thought about santa monica in the home timeline she thought about the beach and the malls she thought about all the people especially on weekends and she thought about the rand corporation the russians had likely used a bomb here to make sure they knocked it out well they did along with the united states they knocked almost everything out liz started to cry whats the matter mom asked its all ruined liz sniffed no matter what we do we cant fix it itd be like unscrambling an egg i wish i could say you were wrong sweetheart dad told her but youre not all we can do is help a little and try to find out what went wrong its not enough he nodded i know its what we can do though and its more than most of the bombedout alternates ever see easier and cheaper just to leave them alone we dont have the people or the resources to do anything else we dont want to bother liz made it into an accusation we dont care dad only nodded again mostly we dont he agreed were spread too thin the way things are anil crosstime traffic needs to show a profit not a loss and so so we make like a bunch of vultures and watch things die liz said we do pass on antibiotics when we can did dad sound defensive if he didnt why not and we showed them how to make the anthrax vaccine more of their cows and sheep live so more of them live too oh boy liz s sarcasm was largely wasted because the gunfire from the santa monica freeway line changed note dad paid more attention to that than he did to his own daughter his head came up like a wolfs when it took a scent the valley soldiers are using that heavy machine gun again he said heaven help anybody coming at them then mom said yeah dad nodded one more time only thing i worry about now is whether cal s boys will try an endaround through the dead zone if they do weve got problems but they didnt not while the light held liz wondered why not scavengers and scroungers did come in here sometimes most people in this alternate stayed away from places where hbombs had fallen though they had to know the fallout wasnt poisonous any more or the scavengers wouldnt go in still lingering fear or superstition kept almost everybody away the sun went down the stars started coming out dad stopped the horses and gave them their feed bags they chomped happily on oats and hay the mendozas not so happily ate bread and smoked pork and sauerkraut and raisins they drank rough red wine that would have got any vintner in the home timeline fired it was safer than the local water which was guaranteed to give you the runs isnt this fun dad said as they got ready to sleep in the cramped wagon isnt this cozy fun liz said as a matter of fact no too blasted cozy if anybody wants to know what i think mom added everybodys a critic dad said liz gave him a dirty look he could fall asleep in thirty seconds and keep sleeping through anything this side of the crack of doom trouble was he thought everybody else could do the same thing most normal human beings couldnt and he didnt get it warmer tomorrow mom said breeze isnt off the ocean anymore thats true dad sniffed you can smell the smoke from all the fires the horses could smell it too and they didnt like it they snorted and shifted their feet as if to say they would rather be somewhere else liz would rather have been somewhere else too then she noticed a redgold glow on the eastern horizon she watched it for a little while and decided she wasnt imagining things pointing she said that fires getting closer dont be silly its dad broke off he started watching the fire too after a few seconds he said something incendiary himself then he said something even worse youre right he jumped out of the wagon what are you doing liz asked harnessing the horses he answered no fire departments around here worth the paper theyre printed on weve got to get away because nobody will put that out before it gets here and horses are faster than people that all made good sense however much liz wished it didnt she also wished he could hitch up the horses faster the job looked easy but it wasnt not if you wanted to do it right while he worked of course the flames didnt stop mom said you want to hurry that along there she sounded much calmer than she could possibly have felt i am hurrying dad snapped well hurry faster mom told him the breeze blew harder it sent a puff of smoke that made liz cough stop that she thought but it didnt after what seemed forever dad jumped back into the wagon he flicked the reins the horses went off at a trot without so much as a giddyap theyd probably wondered what was taking so long too from everything liz had heard fire made horses stupid from everything shed seen horses were no big threat to get fives on their ap tests anyway but this once panic worked for the mendozas not against them the horses wanted to get away from the fires and so did the people they were pulling it was going to be closer than it had any business being in the home timeline dad would have been on his cell phone yelling his head off a waterdropping plane or helicopter would have splatted the leading edge of the flames that would have slowed them down enough to let endangered people get away and of course in the home timeline they wouldnt have been stuck in a horsedrawn wagon to begin with no cell phones here no waterdropping airplanes or copters either and the wagon was the fastest way to escape they had the only other choice was getting out and running if the horses freaked and stood still they would have to try that liz didnt think it seemed like a whole lot of fun things ran past them in the night coyotes and raccoons and feral cats hated the fire and feared it too so did rats and mice and hamsters and squirrels and everything really when she looked back on that night none of it stuck in her mind as a whole lot of fun the fire got closer and closer and hotter and hotter the smoke got thicker and nastier till she felt as if she were smoking about ten packs of cigarettes every time she breathed in mom gave her a hanky soaked in water to put over her nose and mouth it helped sometill it dried out that didnt take nearly long enough she soaked it herself the next time mom splashed the fabric of the wagon to keep embers from catching mom also rigged makeshift breathing masks for herself and dad shall i make some for the horses too she asked i dont think theyd put up with it dad answered besides do you want to stop and find out mom automatically looked back over her right shoulder so did liz and wished she hadnt the harries were much too close much too big and much much too hot dads question kind of answered itself in case it didnt mom took care of things now that you mention it no about what i figured dad snapped the whip above the horses backs they were already doing all they could but he wanted to make sure they kept on paying attention what happens if the smoke gets them liz asked through the bit of cloth that wasnt keeping as much smoke out of her lungs as she wished it would we jump down and we hold on to each other and we hustle dad said next question liz decided she didnt have a next question the answer to the one shed just asked gave her plenty to chew on all by itself mom looked over her shoulder again liz admired her nerve she didnt want to know exactly how close those leaping crackling flames were if things were going to turn out badly couldnt it be a surprise if you knew you were about to get roasted well what could you do scream maybe and then stick an apple in your mouth except she didnt have an apple she didnt think the flames would stop when she was just done to a turn eithernot that it would matter to her one way or the other at that stage of things then mom said were gaining what liz wasnt sure shed heard right nobody ever talked about how loud a really big fire was up close the people who knew things like that were mostly either firefighters or dead were gaining mom said again liz could hear her better this time maybe mom talked louder maybe they were a little farther from the flames if they were were gaining liz said joyfully she looked over her shoulder then the flames were still too close but they werent way too close any more that looked like progress all right just hope sparks and embers dont set the wagon roof on fire dad said liz gave him a reproachful stare not because that wasnt possible but because it was they couldnt stop it if it did happen so she didnt want to hear about it heart pounding as loud as the flames were roaring she looked over her shoulder once more the fire was definitely farther away now she approved of that she would have approved even more if it were a mile beyond the moon a few minutes later dad let the horses slow down im pretty sure were good he said its burning straight west pretty much and weve got north of it what do we do now mom asked how about we sleep for a week dad said works for me liz said and you know what else i bet weve got so much soot on our faces nobody can recognize us that works too mom said i was going to say we should wash in the morning but maybe not in the meantime in the meantime liz had no trouble at all falling asleep in the wagon back in the valley dan hadnt thought about sleeping on asphalt wrapped in no more than a blanket that didnt mean he couldnt do it if you got tired enough you could sleep anywhere he proved that sergeant chuck had to shake him awake when the sun came up the next morning yawning dan started to sit up straight then he didnt you never could tell whether westside snipers were waiting for somebody to do something that dumb chuck was on his hands and knees hed been ready to push dan down if dan forgot where he was since dan didnt chuck relaxed relaxed or not he didnt look so good he needed a shave and smoke from last nights watchfires streaked his cheeks and forehead boy sarge you ought to clean up dan said look whos talking youd stop a clock at fifty yards chuck retorted he was probably right dan had been firing a matchlock musket all day every time the gun went off it belched out a great cloud of fireworkssmelling gunpowder smoke how much of that was he wearing on his face what do we do today dan asked wait and see what our loving neighbors to the south try chuck saidor something like that anyhow if they want more trouble we can give it to them if they sit tight were not going to go after them or anything what would the king of the valley do with land south of the santa monica freeway rule it dan thought as soon as he did he wondered but how it would take a long time to get messages and orders back and forth between zevs palace up in mortriridge and these lands way down here back in the old time people said you could talk to anybody right away no matter how far apart the two of you were radio tv telephones dan believed in them but they werent around anymore the telegraph survivedwhere people didnt steal wires for their copper anywaybut who really wanted to pay attention to orders in morse code dan knew he wouldnt have they started shooting yet he asked no but its still early sergeant chuck answered i dont know that they wont and neither does anybody else dan s stomach growled it had ideas of its own and wasnt shy about letting the rest of him know about them will anyone bring us breakfast he asked i heard they were supposed to be making sandwiches but i sure havent seen any chuck looked around waitspeak of the devil kitchen helpers with big cloth sacks crawled up and down the freeway dealing out sandwiches and old time soda bottles full of watered wine dan s sandwich was smoked pork and pickled tomato on a hard roll something that wouldnt go bad in a hurry he made it disappear in a hurry so how long it would keep didnt matter chuck s breakfast was the same and vanished even faster its not bacon and eggs and hash browns but itll do the sergeant said yeah sarge but think what army cooksd do to bacon and eggs and hash browns dan said chances were the cooks would do fine by them he didnt let that bother him complaining about army cooks probably went all the way back to the old time theyre pretty lousy all right chuck agreed sergeants complained about cooks too sergeants complained about everything it was part of their job here and there valley soldiers started standing along the freeway line when nobody fired at the first few more men did the same dan and chuck stood up at the same time not soon enough to take a big chance and not late enough to seem yellow getting shot wasnt part of anybodys job except when it was dan musketeer dan somebody farther down the freeway called im here dan sang out whats happening man they want you back at the traders house so step on it the messenger answered may i go sergeant dan asked how can i say no chuck replied if the westsiders attack well just have to try and fight the war without you i dont know that weve got much of a chance then but well do our best propelled by such pungent sarcasm dan was glad to get away he let the messenger lead him down to the level of the ordinary streets and take him back to the house where liz had lived of course her parents had lived there too but he didnt think about them very much with electric lights down there in the bottom basement could they have had tv and a telephone too a moments thought made dan decide that was silly what would they watch whom would they call he couldnt ask the messenger you werent supposed to gossip about what was in that house he would be violating an order if he did and hed be making the other soldier violate one too he kept quiet when he got to the house he asked captain horace whats up sir you know the way you found the door down into the room with the electric lights the valley officer said yes sir well we found another door like that horace said under the basement sir dan asked whats in it he could imagine all kinds of things each more marvelous than the last a tv set that worked an auto that worked why think small what about an airplane that worked if only you could fly but captain horace shook his head no not under there its set into the wall in the regular basement the room above the one with the lights oh dan knew he sounded disappointed a room there wouldnt be so big you couldnt put a car into it let alone an airplane but maybe you could put other cool stuff in there how do we get in i hope you can help us figure that out horace said so far we havent had much luck as if to show what he meant somebody started banging on the wall with what had to be a sledgehammer boom boom boom the racket made dan s head ache got to be a better way than that he said itd be nice if there were the captain agreed what can you come up with if you can get us in there without tearing the place apart ill make you a sergeant on the spot dan imagined three stripes on his sleeve he imagined the look on sergeant chuck s face when the underofficer saw him with three stripes on his sleeve that look would be worth ten dollarsno twenty and twenty dollars was a lot of money ill do what i can he said see what you come up with thats all we dont expect miracles horace s mouth twisted in a crooked grin i sure wouldnt mind one though he went to the top of the stairs and shouted down to the basement knock it off knock it off mercifully the banging stopped horace breathed a sigh of relief thats better now the top of ray head doesnt want to fall off yes sir dan said again hed had the same idea he thought like a captainor the captain thought like him what would sergeant chuck say about that if he were ever rash enough to mention it out loud something interesting and memorablehe was sure of that he went downstairs a burly valley common soldier was leaning on the handle of his sledgehammer the musclebound man didnt look sorry to take a break nodding to dan he said youre the guy with smart ideas huh i dont know well see dan said wheres this door at anyway in the wall there if you look real close you can just see the crack the other soldier answered pointing i sure hope you psych something out man this walls gotta be reinforced concrete or else whatevers tougher than that i could keep banging away at it from now till everything turns blue and i dont know if id ever bust in okay dan peered at the wall the way hed peered at the floor when he found the trap door he wasnt sure he would have spotted this hairline crack if the muscular man hadnt pointed it out he wondered how anybodyd found it in the dim light down here when he said as much the guy with the sledgehammer said dr saul went over the whole wall with a magnifying glass thats how oh dan said how scientific of him you had to be thorough to do something like that you also had to be a little bit crazy or more than a little bit except if it paid off the way it had here you werent really crazy were you or maybe you were and lucky too what are you gonna do the other soldier didnt sound as if he thought dan could do anything a moment later he explained why dr saul tried everything under the sun he sure couldnt get in groovy dan had just been thinking how lucky dr saul was well so much for that he eyed the almost invisible door he eyed the sledgehammer and the broadshouldered sweaty soldier whod been swinging it he eyed the tiny handful of concrete chips on the floor no brute force didnt seem to be the way to go what then if you couldnt break down a door how did you go about tricking one he remembered a story hed read one that seemed to have been all the rage right around the time the fire fell it wasnt a true storyor people nowadays didnt think so anyhow but the wizard and his followers had got stuck outside a door into a mountainside that didnt want to open dan pointed at this one friend he said nothing happened he laughed at himself he might have known then another idea struck him what was that word before he could remember it the guy with the sledgehammer started laughing at him f know what youre doing he said my folks read me that story too but its only like a story man never argue with somebody with a sledgehammer especially when his shoulders are twice as wide as yours that was an old rule dan had just made up instead of arguing he said yeah its only a story what have i got to lose though i mean do you want to pound reinforced concrete for however long it takes the other soldier looked at the pitifully small bits of concrete hed managed to break loose he looked at dan his wave of invitation was almost a bow go for it man i will as soon as i dan snapped his fingers the elvish word did come back to him he pointed at the doorway even though he had no idea whether that made any difference mellon he said silently and without any fuss the door swung open valley soldiers did guard the westfacing approaches to westwood liz supposed that made sense with all the fighting the day before the westsiders might have tried to sneak a column through the dead zone but shed hope she and her folks would be able to get into westwood and start selling their jeans before the occupiers noticed they were around no such luck the soldier who seemed to pop up out of nowhere didnt have a matchlock he carried an old time rifle his us army helmet was two lifetimes old halt he called and his voice said theyd belter do it who are you people and what are you doing here whoa dad called to the horses he pulled back on the reins the animals stopped then he said we were coming up here with a load of denim pantsgenuine old time levis fresh like they were made yesterdaywhen all the shooting started we couldnt go through so we went around and here we are levi s fresh like yesterday huh the rifleman laughed ive heard traders sling it before but youve got more nerve than anybody how about telling me one ill believe pull out a pair liz dad said cool as a superconductor let doubting thomas here see for himself sure liz scrambled over the seat and into the back of the wagon she grabbed a pair of jeans and showed them to the soldier see with a zipper and everything the only trousers in this alternate that didnt close with buttons used zippers recycled from old time clothes but not many zippers still worked and not many tailors bothered with them buttons did the job zippers were mostly for show the way cuff buttons on suit jackets were in the home timeline before asking for a closer look the valley soldier called hey harvey yo a voice came from nowhere whats happening man cover me i need to check something out you got it harvey still didnt show himself now let me see those jeans the soldier whod challenged the wagon told liz she didnt make any sudden moves when she handed them to him maybe his father was a tailor or maybe he was when he didnt carry a gun he felt the fabric he held the pants up against the sun to see if they had any thin spots he worked the zipper several times and peered at the way it was sewn to the rest of the fly the more he examined them the more surprised he looked see liz said yeah the valley rifleman seemed to nod in spite of himself unless this is just one supercool pair to show people youve got a whole bunch of these in the back there liz nodded you better believe it look for yourself if you want to were no ripoff artists she made herself sound angry the way a trader whod been unfairly challenged naturally would ill do that the soldier said his expression said a lot of the people who protested hardest were the biggest thieves that only made liz mad for real nobody liked getting called a liar even if just by a raised eyebrow and she wasnt lying she walked around to the back of the wagon and pointed to the big old stack of levi s go ahead pick any pair you want the rifleman trusted her far enough to sling his weapon for a moment anyhow he leaned forward and pulled a pair out of the middle of the stack he gave them the same onceover he had with the ones liz offered him when he finished he said well i take my hat off to you and he really did lift the oldfashioned steel pot off his head these are the real mccoy i dont know where you found em but i bet well want to buy em pass on miss pass on they didnt go to the market square just south of the ucla campus thai was too close to their old house there was another market square a ritzier one north of sunset boulevard in brentwood the only reason that square was ritzier was that the neighborhood had been ritzier before the fire felland still was as dad guided the horses towards it he said if we were proper traders wed go to the other market its bigger and there are more valley soldiers around all the more reason for staying away mom said thats what i was thinking dad agreed the people who do buy from us may think were kind of dumb for setting up there but they wont think were anything more than kind of dumb you hope mom said dad nodded you bet i do its not too bad liz said the librarys up near the north end of campus we wont be any farther from it than we were before as long as the librarians dont tip off the valley soldiers as soon as i go in there i know it can happen i hope it wont dad said theyre all people whove been there since the city council ran things maybe theres a quisling or two but we can hope not anyhow with a little luck well get the job done yet that would be good liz said that would be wonderful mom said not seeing this alternate again wouldnt break my heart get used to it hon if we land another grant well be back one of these days dad said by the look on her face mom had no trouble curbing her enthusiasm ignoring her expression or at least pretending to dad went on thats what happens when you have an academic specialty you keep coming back to it ill be coming back here when the beard im not wearing right now is all whiteif i can keep getting grant money and if you dont have wanted posters with your face on them in every little kingdom from frisco all the way down to teejay mom added well yes there is that by the look on his face dad kind of liked the idea he glanced over at liz of course by then we wont have liz to help get us in trouble hey what are you blaming me for you were the one who decided to hide luke liz said yeah but if dan didnt think you were cute none of the other valley soldiers would have paid any special attention to us dad said i cant help that liz knew her voice went higher and shriller than she would have liked i didnt say you could dad answered which was sort of true but you wont come to this alternate to stir up the boys here by the time my beards all white youll be through with school by then and youll find some other alternate to be especially interested inor maybe something in the home timeline who knowsand then youll if you say ill stir up the boys therewell dont say it thats all liz broke in you cant prove i was going to dad said youre lucky she cant too mom told him if she could youd be in even more trouble than youve already got yourself into and they said it couldnt be done dad sounded proud of himself for being such a pest he probably was hes not the stuffy kind of professor anyway liz thought that would be worse i think dad sure wasnt stuffy after they got set up in the brentwood market square he put some levi s out on a card table with folding legs that could have come from the old time like the jeans it really came from the home timeline then he started yelling and carrying on about how wonderful they were he even pulled out a bugle heaven only knew where hed got that maybe from the stoyadinoviches wherever he blew a long tuneless blast on it he couldnt have been hokier if he tried and he was trying all kinds of ways and it worked the people who lived in brentwood put down silver for the levi s pair after pair disappeared before too long a valley sergeant strode over to inspect the goods he wasnt a warrior he was at least fifty with a pot belly and shrewd eyes he was a quartermaster sergeant somebody who got fighting men what they needed to fight with mo army in the world kept going without people like that and they won exactly zero glory this one didnt seem to care he examined the jeans even more carefully than the valley rifleman had he carried a magnifying glass to help his aging eyes look at them up close once he was satisfied he said how many pairs have you got left dad told him he nodded and asked whats your price again dad told him liz waited for the sergeant to pitch a fit he just said okay ill take fifty pairs assorted sizes it was as simple as that twelve when dan stepped into the room hed found with a word from the lord of the rings lights in the ceiling came on they were just like the ones in the room under the basement so they had to be electric lights somehow he wasnt much surprised and then a moment later not being surprised surprised him the room was full of strange mostly plastic furniture a rectangular metal box sat against the far wall the front had hinges and a handle which made it likely to be a door oh wow man the guy with the sledgehammer pointed to it like what is that thing its one of those refrigerators isnt it dan said you found them in houses every now and then they could be dangerous little kids sometimes got them open and went inside for some dumb reason refrigerator doors didnt work from the inside out too often kids playing games suffocated before anybody found them yeah i guess youre right they kept stuff cold in the old time right the other soldier said i think so i wonder if this one still works dan looked up at the bright ceiling the lights do oh wow the muscular soldier said again go get captain horace dan said he needs to see this okay the other guy let the sledgehammer fall over with a clatter dan was half surprised he didnt carry it with him horace came down the stairs on the double he walked through the newly opened door he looked at the furniture at the refrigerator and then at dan congratulations sergeant he said now dan was the one who said oh wow then he said thank you sir and then he walked over to the refrigerator could this thing work beats me captain horace said which struck dan as a pretty honest answer the officer continued why dont you open it and find out why dont yousir dan thought what if it didnt work what if it blew up instead the captain would say well so what he was a captain while dan was only a justpromoted sergeant everybody in the whole kingdom of the valley would agree with him well everybody but dan and nobody would care what he thought he reached out grabbed the door handle and pulled obviously that was what you were supposed to do the door wasnt real easy to open but it sure wasnt hard either as soon as it swung open about three inches a light came on inside the refrigerator where does it go when the door closes dan wondered but he had other things to worry about by then he felt chilly air on his legs it does keep stuff cold he exclaimed captain horace came up beside him why not now the captain knew it was safe it sure does he said he reached out to touch a shelf then he jerked his hand back its as cold as a winter night in there dan was eyeing the cans on the shelf hed seen tin cans before in las warm dry climate they didnt rust away very fast these to look at them might have been made yesterday they were red with fancy swirly letters that ran along the whole length from top to bottom the letters were so fancy they were hard to read when dan finally puzzled them out he said oh wow one more time cocacola captain horace read the name as if he had trouble believing it well so did dan there were lots and lots of waspwaisted green glass bottles around all of them carrying that same swirling script you dont think is there real cocacola inside those things nobodyd tasted cocacola since the old time or not long after it dan picked up a can it had to be the coldest thing hed ever touched so cold he almost dropped it how are you supposed to open this thing he wondered but the can had a metal tab on top he worked it with his thumb to see how it operated if you pushed up from under it the other end went down and ssss the sudden hiss nearly made dan drop the can again some brown bubbly stuff came out of the opening hed made he started to taste it then paused and sniffed instead what if it was rotten or something but it smelled spicyintriguing he took a cautious sip it had bubbles they tickled his tongue and then tickled his nose from the inside out it tasted like he didnt know what it tasted like it was pretty good though he took another sipa bigger one this time well captain horace asked dan handed him the can he sipped too its like sweet champagne he said is it wine then dan asked he knew champagne was wine with bubbles in it but hed never had any it was expensive stuff no way the officer said youd taste the booze in it if it were dan nodded he was like anybody else he drank beer or wineoften watered downinstead of water whenever he could water would do at a pinch but you always took a chance with it what is it then dan said it isnt water it isnt wine it isnt cider or grape juice it isnt anything he wanted things to fit into their own neat little slots well who didnt captain horace took a bigger swig its cocacola thats what it is he handed the can back to dan dan drank some more too horace wasnt wrong something like this deserved a name for itself all right it wasnt like anything else it was something out of the old time how did it end up here in the modern world the captain let out a loud burp a moment later so did dan he looked at the can of cocacola its the bubbles thats what it is he said well sure captain horace said indulgently then his gaze sharpened how did these traders get their hands on cocacola though its an old time thing it doesnt really belong here neither does a refrigerator that works neither do electric lights dan said i know the officer took the can back again and drained it dan almost got mad but the impossible refrigerator held more impossible cans captain horace belched again its all righteously freaky man really dan agreed his mind leaped what if the traders arent from now what if theyre really from the old time that would explain why they acted funny sometimes too they were trying to like lake it you know they didnt exactly grok how we do things nowadays i dont know that doesnt sound very scientific to me captain horace said it doesnt sound very likely either sir none of this stuff is very likely either dan s wave took in the lights the refrigerator and the can the officer was still holding but its here whats that thing the great detective says when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth captain horace knew what he was talking about all right he went on but everything here seems impossible how do we go about eliminating any of it it may be impossible but its here dan reached in and took out another can of cocacola this one was easier to open than the last one had beennow he knew how he drank from it it tasted like the real thing all right going back onto the ucla campus brought liz the usual almost pleasant pain they still respected learning there even if they embalmed it instead of helping it to grow that was good a lot of the buildings were familiar which wasnt true down in westwood but it was like looking at an old friend filthy and starving and dressed in rags it did hurt havent seen you for a while one of the librarians said when she walked in lifes been complicated she answered the librarian nodded liz had the feeling that was true no matter which alternate you visited just how complicated was life though did this bespectacled fellow report to the valley soldiers occupying westwood if he did would he slip away to let them know she was back one thing for sure he couldnt phone them in this alternate she went upstairs and started going through the bound issues of newsweek she had a pretty good notion of what had happened in in the home timeline most of what had happened in this alternate seemed about the same maybe the soviet union really had started the war here maybe the communist leaders reacted differently to something vietnam the sixday warfrom the way they did in the home timeline if that was so american news magazines wouldnt have such a good idea of what was happening on the other side of the iron curtain or would they something would have leaked out wouldnt it here was a story about vyacheslav molotov going back to moscow from his post at the international atomic energy agency for consultations molotov s name rang a bell with liz from the ap euro course he was the longtime russian foreign minister in the middle of the twentieth century she didnt remember that hed been on the iaea in excitement tingled through her maybe in the home timeline he hadnt what did that mean did it mean anything she couldnt be sure she didnt know enough but she made sure she scanned the story she was mighty glad these newsweeks hadnt crumbled to dust between the time when the fire fell and now how many people had looked at them in those years not manyshe was sure of that one reason they were still around was that not many people ever looked at them liz wanted to find the missing puzzle pieces and put the whole thing together herself she knew that wasnt real likely mom and dad knew more about the s in the home timeline than she did and they knew as much as anybodyincluding the natives of this alternateabout the s here it wasnt enough yet to let them know what went wrong she didnt think they knew about molotov though well they would once she told them and she had the data inside the little handheld scanner from what she remembered molotov was a hardliner a tough guy if he had a more important slot in this than in the home timeline that said something about the way the russians minds had worked here did it say enough there was no transposition chamber that ended in this alternates moscow or leningrador was it petrograd here or st petersburg she couldnt remember it had got nuked too most major cities here had any which way there wouldnt be a chamber that could reach either place here unless somebody waved lots and lots of benjamins under crosstime traffics nose ct wasnt in business for its health no way the mendozas could come up with that kind of money on their own but if they landed another grant maybe finding out about molotov would help them do that liz could hope so she didnt think she wanted to make a career out of studying this alternate but her folks already had if she could give them a hand while she was working with them well why not she closed the bound volume of newsweeks a scrap of old brittle paper fluttered down and fell to the floor she didnt think it had any printing on it but sooner or laterprobably soonerall these magazines would get too fragile to read and then theyd crumble to dust and be gone forever except for what ive scanned she thought that was a funny feeling she had history in her scanner she didnt just have it either she felt like its custodian what she and her folks took back to the home timeline had a better chance of lasting than anything that stayed here maybe this alternate would rebuild two or three hundred years from now it would want to know what had made the fire fall maybe people from the home timeline could give back this information then were custodians all right she thought sed quis custodiet ipsos custodesa bit of latin came back to her who would watch the watchmen there was no guarantee that the home timeline would be in great shape by the time this alternate was ready to find out about its past not long before her folks were born the home timeline was right on the edge of going down the tubes too many people not enough resources finding out how to go crosstime saved everybodys bacon which didnt mean everybody in the home timeline was happy all the time old political and religious rivalries remained very much alive and national governments were still figuring out how to deal with crosstime traffic which was as big and as rich as any of them well complications came with being alive the simplest alternates were the ones where the atomic wars had killed everybody and everything a graveyard the size of a planet liz shivered this alternate hadnt missed by much she got the next volume of newsweek down from the shelf paging through the ads in the first issue she thought about how confident everybody seemed no one had any idea the usa and ussr were on the edge of blasting each other to kingdom come no one seemed to suspect that even if the superpowers left each other alone the alternate would have run out of energy and food and drinkable water inside of a lifetime would they have found out how to go between alternates here she doubted it she doubted it like anything in factthat had happened only once or if it had happened more than once nobody from crosstime traffic had ever found any evidence of it other hightech alternates exploited the rest of the solar system as best they could too bad it was a less inviting place than sciencefiction writers from the midtwentieth century thought it would turn out to be still other hightech alternates ruthlessly limited population and energy use if they couldnt get more theyd make do with less that worked after a fashion but liz was glad she didnt live in one of those alternates they were tyrannies and tight ones they had to be to keep people from having too many babies and consuming too much shed grown up free and was glad of it she scanned all the stories she could find about russia and vietnam and the middle east none of them grabbed her by the arm and yelled hey look at me im different she had the data though maybe her folks could run with it if she couldnt when the sun got low in the west she put away the bound volume and left the library no electric lights here none anywhere in this alternate except in the secret rooms of the house the mendozas had used and at the stoyadinoviches place down in speedro the locals would never find any of those dan didnt know why he came back to the ucla campus he was tempted to go into the big fancy library if he could find out anywhere whether time travel was possible that would be the place but he didnt think he could if somebody back then knew how to do that it would have been a heavyduty secret a bigger secret than the fire and something else occurred to him as he tramped along the cracked weedinfested concrete why would anybody from the old time want to see this they had things so much better back then everybody knew that next to what theyd had and thrown away what was left was just a mess people were lucky anything at all was leftif this counted for luck that was one side of the dime the other side was where did all that stuff in the traders house come from if it didnt come from the old time nobody nowadays could make any of those things and keep them working fluorescent lights a refrigerator cocacola a door that opened when you said the right word no none of that was part of the world dan knew he laughed at himself he didnt know which world he was really in not any more if mellon hadnt made the door open the next thing he would have tried was open sesame he was pretty sure ali baba and the forty thieves was nothing but a madeup story but when you ran into marvels like the ones under the traders house how could you be certain about anything you couldnt it was that simple there was bunche hall the university research library sat a little north and a little west of the taller building dan still wondered how the devil liz and her folks had managed to disappear from her house so did a lot of other people from the valley if they didnt have a timetravel machine what did they have he laughed again he told himself he wouldnt have been real surprised to see liz come out of the url just the way she had before all this weird stuff started two heartbeats later liz came out of the url just the way she had before all this weird stuff started dan turned out to be wrong he was so surprised he tripped over his own feet and barely saved himself from falling on his face the wild stumble and flail kept him from yelling out her name as he caught himself he realized that might not be such a good idea she and her folks were fugitives after all they wouldnt want anybody to know they were back in westwood if liz found out he knew wouldnt she disappear right before his eyes could she do that he shrugged he didnt know she couldnt and he didnt want to take the chance so instead of yelling he followed her she headed north away from the house where shed been stayingas if she had not a care in the world he skulked along behind her using everything hed learned as a soldier not to be noticed it was getting dark which helped him what to do what to do if he just trailed her shed have a chance to get away when he went off to tell somebody about it and get help if he grabbed her she might disappear when all your choices were bad which one did you pick the one that didnt look worst whichever that happened to be he decided she had less chance of disappearing if he grabbed her than she did of getting away if he left her alone for a while maybe he was right maybe he was wrong but at least he was doing something shed almost got to sunset boulevard when he broke cover and ran toward her calling halt in the name of king zev she whirled there was just enough light to let him see that she looked as astonished as he had a few minutes earlier then he was on her if she wouldnt halt he had to make her do it next thing he knew shed grabbed his outstretched arm he went up over her shoulder flew through the air with the greatest of easeand with a startled gruntand landed thump on his back liz made a mistake then she had pretty good combat reflexes but not perfect ones instead of getting out of there as fast as she could she stood and admired what shed done and dan had combat reflexes of his own crashing to the ground made them kick in he snaked an arm around her ankle and brought her down she let out a startled grunt of her own and then a squawk when her bottom bounced off the dirt he was bigger and stronger than she was she had more skill she didnt mind fighting dirty either she tried to do something that would have ended the fight in a hurry but he took her knee on the point of his hip instead it hurt but it didnt ruin him is that how they fought in the old time he panted are you nuts what are you talking about she said and then cautiously truce he thought about it as cautiously he nodded truce they both got to their feet she didnt try to kick him again where it would do the most good he couldnt try to shoot her his matchlock wasnt loaded just clouting her with the musket took a moment to cross his mind by the time it did shed moved back too far to let him do it could he run her down if he had to maybe probably even did he want to that was a different question what am i talking about ill tell you what dan was still panting liz didnt seem to be did that mean he couldnt run her down if they just talked he wouldnt have to find out cocacola electric lights mellon thats what she looked almost comically amazed youve read the lord of the rings i didnt know i wasnt supposed to dan answered but the movies are from the start of the twentyfirst century she said more to herself than to him are the books that much earlier what movies dan asked he had only a vague idea of what a movie wassort of like tv only bigger sort of like a play except it wasnt really there in front of you it was like a photo that moved he knew what photos were hed seen them people still knew how to take them even if not in color any more how they were supposed to move that he didnt understand he didnt know anything about movies of the lord of the rings he was sure nobody else did either especially not movies from around the year nobody could make movies thenit was after the fire fell and liz clapped both hands over her mouth the way somebody would after blurting out a secret she didnt mean to tell oh she said and then something that would have made sergeant chuck s ears turn green dan was almost too surprised to be shockedthat was not the kind of thing he expected to hear from a girl he liked but neither was talk about movies you really are a time traveler from the days before the fire fell he exclaimed nobody wanted to believe me everyone said i was nuts you are nuts liz said you cant travel forwards and backwards in timeits impossible she had a scratch on her cheek and a bigger one on the heel of her hand dan noticed he had sore ribs along with an ache on his hipbone where her knee had got him shed hurt him other places too but those were the bad ones yeah sure he said so how did you get heresideways liz didnt look amazed this timeshe looked horrified if i tell you the answer to that ill have to kill you she said and she sounded dead serious it wouldnt do you any good dan hoped he was right he didnt like the calculating look in liz s eyes no you said nobody believed you if you had an accident if she really intended to kill him shed just try to do it she wouldnt warn him she was thinking about itwould she no way dan decided liz was a lot of things but not even slightly stupid and the way shed looked when he guessed sideways hed hit on something there even if he didnt know just what how could you be from sideways in time he asked whats sideways from here imnot supposed to tell you liz answered seriously it wont do you any good if you find out and it wont hurt me any but im not supposed to why not dan said knowing stuff is supposed to help isnt it that was what they taught in school anyhow how much can knowing something help when you cant do anything about it even if you know liz said dan only shruggedhe couldnt imagine anything like that she must have seen as much because she sighed before going on okay remember you asked for it i promise he said yeah right she told him but she didnt stop talking ill tell you whats sideways from here everything is pretty much there are alternates where the nazis wonyou know who the nazis were right there are alternates where the russians won and there was no atomic war and theres the one im from in my world there was no atomic war and the west won and we just kept going forward from the way things were in what looks all superscientific and cool to you seems silly and oldfashioned to me there thats the truth what are you going to do about it youve gotyour people haveall the stuff they had back in the old time and then some dan said slowly if he hadnt seen the secret rooms in her house he never would have believed it but he had and he did liz nodded thats right you arent so dumb after all hed just thought the same thing about her gee thanks a lot he said but he had a hard time feeling insulted why arent you helping us more then he demanded look at us were a mess you could make us more like vou maybe for the first time since hed known her liz looked embarrassed im sorry she said i really amim sorrier than i know how to tell you but theres no money in fixing up an alternate its that simple there just isnt besides do you have any idea how big a whole world is you cant go and fix something that size once its messed up too much to do too much even to try no money in it dan paid the most attention to the first part of what she said what are you doing here then she looked even more embarrassed well my dad got a grant a grant it sounded like the english word dan understood but he didnt know what it meant here liz nodded thats right he teaches at uclathe ucla in the alternate i come from we call it the home timeline but never mind that somebodys paying him money to come to this alternate and find out why you guys blew yourselves up the russians did it dan said automatically the reds the commies he didnt know quite what a commie was but it had something to do with being a russian he was pretty sure of that as a matter of fact think youre righthere liz said but there are some other alternates where were pretty sure america launched first and there are a few where the chinese started the big war and some where the nazis did and even one where the kaisers germany didand won the war and still is top dog today all kinds of different possibilities dan thought one of the possibilities right then was that his head would explode it wasnt that he thought liz was lying to him he didnt nobody could make up a story like that and have so many details straight but hed heard people talk about getting their minds blown now he knew exactly what that meant he stabbed out an angry forefinger at her what if i tell my officers about you people about all this she only shrugged what if you do wholl believe you and even if somebody does what can he do about it ill show you he sprang next thing he knew he was on the ground again with the wind knocked out of him he fought to breathe anything more than that forget it liz said i probably ought to kill you for real but i wont youre just doing what youre supposed to do he tried to knock her off her feet once more but she was wary this time he wanted to tell her off or to yell for help or to do anything else that might be useful what with struggling to breathe he couldnt besides i know you were sweet on me liz added at this stage it was insult on top of injury he thought so anyway till she kicked him in the head he spiraled down into blackness dad and mom were taking down the display when liz came back to the brentwood market square weve got to get out of here she said sorry but we do what went wrong dad assumed something must have and boy was he ever right liz told him what had gone wrong she finished if he were only a little bit betteri mean a littlethe valley soldiers would be asking me questions instead of you she hadnt counted all her bruises and scrapes yet she did count herself lucky that they were only bruises and scrapes how soon will he wake up how much will he remember when he does mom asked i dont know i kicked him pretty good liz s foot hurt too dan had a hard head but i dont think we ought to waste any time you know maybe he wont remember anything about the other alternates we can hope not anyway dad sighed as he walked over to the horses and led them back to the wagon did you have to tell him about that we arent supposed to spill the crosstime secret you know yeah yeah yeah liz said impatiently but even if theyve got it here what can they do about it they wont have the technology for hundreds of years if they ever do and even if they do by then thisll be a legend if they havent forgotten all about it the horses snorted they didnt want to go back to work at night some other merchants were eyeing the mendozas the locals had to be wondering why they were getting ready to bail out that wasnt so good if the valley soldiers asked them they might say which way the wagon went i did find some stuff about molotov at the international atomic energy agency in liz said we arent leaving with no answers or i hope we arent molotov at the iaea in dad fired questions in bursts liz nodded after each one he whistled that does sound important it shows this alternate had already split off from the home timeline by then mom agreed so the breakpoints somewhere earlier well we wont worry about where it is right now dad said when dan comes to the valley soldiers will all want to find out what our breakpoint is liz wouldnt have put it like that which didnt mean her father was wrong how long will he be out mom asked how were you supposed to answer a question like that about this long liz mimed how hard shed kicked him no way to tell for sure not with something like that dad said maybe a few seconds maybe a few minutes maybe longer maybewith a little luckhe wont remember what you were talking about before you punted him i wish you didnt have to do that mom said in this culture guys feel ashamed when girls beat them i know he liked you but now all hell think of is getting even in this culture liz and dad spoke in the same breath its the same way in ours liz added though she admitted it is worse here as far as she was concerned everything was worse here sexism sure was of course without an industrial society and modem medicine women really were the weaker sex there were plenty of alternates more sexist than this one which still kept memories of more nearly equal times but there were also plenty that did better we can worry about that later too mom said and then to dad dont you have those horses hitched yet you said it yourselfno telling when dan will come to we dont want to be here when he does were ready dad got behind the wheel of the chevy wagon to prove it liz and mom jumped in behind him as they rolled away from the brentwood market square mom said its kind of a shame for somebody from this alternate he wasnt bad iguess liz said which was politer than are you out of your mind but meant the same thing dad lit a lantern and set it in a holder on the dashboard you were supposed to show a light if you drove at night he hadnt in santa monica but nobody enforced traffic rules there here a wagon without a light was likely to get stopped because it didnt have one he wanted to look as normal as he could you didnt tell dan what kind of wheels we had or anything mom asked no way liz started to laugh i told him all the big secrets but none of the little ones well the big ones will freak him out even if he does remember them dad said he turned right on to sunset boulevard sunset ran all the way to the ocean here the same as it did in the home timeline the resemblance ended there i was thinking the same thing liz said let him tell whoever he wants nobodyll believe him and even if somebody does what can they do about it be more alert for people from the home timeline dad answered which was something liz hadnt thought of we need to warn the stoyadinoviches about that a squad of valley foot soldiers came east on sunset toward them liz tensed one of the soldiers called you folks are out late the men kept marching liz tried not to be too noisy with her sigh of relief she must have done well enoughnone of the valley men stopped and looked back at her when they got to the and sepulveda boulevard dad turned right again and went down onto sepulveda what are you doing mom asked with exaggerated patience speedros the other way i know dad said if theyre looking for us anywhere theyll be looking at the santa monica freeway line and at the edge of things between westwood and santa monica if we go north instead we go up into the valley mom broke in is that where we want to be good question liz thought but dad said sure why not its the last place the soldiers down here will look for us and we can go east from there go around the dead zone in downtown la and get back to speedro thats better than trying to sneak south through santa monica dont you think what else would they be looking for that was also a good questiona better one than liz wished it were dad liked to take a backwards slant on things sometimes that worked really well sometimes it didnt work at all but santa monica especially after the latest fire wasnt any place liz wanted to be how much can they learn from what they find in our house mom asked not enough dad sounded confident as he guided the wagon up the onramp to the theyll see that electric lights shine that refrigerators keep things cold and that coke tastes good and what can they do with any of that a horsedrawn wagon plodding along a freeway built for speeding cars seemed almost unbearably sad to liz it also went a long way toward proving dads point thirteen when dan woke up he felt as bad as if somebody had kicked him in the head oh yeah he said and then oh wow somebody had kicked him in the headhe remembered that much and now he wished his head would fall off so he didnt have to put up with the pounding throbbing ache in there somebody who that didnt come back right away but he hadnt decided to lie down here on the ground in the gloom by himself no hed been talking with someone and theyd had an argument and then a fight i lost he said sadly i must have lost that didnt make him feel like much of a soldier he looked around though turning his head hurl too come to that almost everything hurt twilight hadnt altogether faded the sun had been setting when whatever happened happened so he hadnt been out too long whoeverd licked him hadnt taken his matchlock that was good he imagined trying to tell sergeant chuck how hed lost it that would have hurt worse than the thumping hed taken hard to believe but it would have what would chuck have done to him for losing his gun to a westside rebel nothing pretty or was it a westside rebel liz he exclaimed and with the name things started flooding back he hadnt just lost hed lost to a girl and what were they talking about before she tried using his poor aching skull for a football he had trouble coming up with that it made him madit was important he was sure it was it was even more important than his humiliating defeat where did she learn to fight like that must have been in the home timeline dan muttered for a second the words didnt mean anything to himthey were only words then he remembered what lay behind them a whole world where the fire didnt fall a whole world where they still had electricity and refrigerators and cocacola a whole world that didnt give two cents for this one a whole world that just wanted to find out what had gone wrong in this one that didnt care anything about fixing it up rage filled him was that fair not even close if they could catch liz and her folks maybe they could do what dan wondered something anyhow they had to be able to do something he heaved himself to his feet and started dogtrotting back to the house where the tradersthe traders from that other worldhad lived he was in good hard shape the way a soldier needed to be he should have made it back to that house without even breathing hardit wasnt much more than a mile he took about three strides and then stopped fighting not to be sick hed never got kicked in the head before not by a girl not by a horse not by anybody or anything he didnt know how very badly that kind of injury could mess someone upadventure stories didnt talk about such things he might not have known but he found out in a hurry trying to do anything fast left him dizzy and wondering if his skull would split in two as a matter of fact he hoped it would but he had to get back even if he couldnt do it fast if he couldnt run he would walk if i cant walk ill crawl he thought it didnt quite come to that he could walk as long as he didnt try to hustle little by little he realized he was glad the sun had gone down the torches and lamps he saw as he got into westwood seemed to pierce his eyes and stab his brain like needles cooking odors and the general town stink were much stronger than usual too he gulped several times he was hungry but maybe it was just as well he had an empty stomach the traders house still had guards posted in front of it and torches in the sconces by the front door dan narrowed his eyes against what felt like an intolerable glare the torchlight let the sentries get a good look at him look what the cat dragged in one of them jeered drinking on duty the other one asked ive got three stripes now you cant talk to me like that dan said the men stiffened to attentionrank did have its privileges that his speech wasnt slurred also helped he went on is captain horace still in there yes sergeant the sentries chorusedthey didnt sound snotty any more one of them ventured uh what happened to you sergeant whats it look like i got beat up dan didnt say liz had done it he supposed he would have to tell horace but he didnt want these yahoos being the first to know he went inside he went downstairs he had to squint even harder against electric lights than he had against the torchesthey were that much brighter captain horace stared at him as the sentry had he asked what happened to you sir i saw liz you know the traders daughtercoming out of the ucla library i came up to her and i i lost the fight thats all horace s eyebrows leaped for the sky how in blazes did a girl whip you sir she fights better than our dirtyfighting coaches thats the truth where could she have learned to fight like that the officer demanded in the home timeline sir dan answered itd have to be what the devil is the home timeline dan explainedas well as he could anyhow looking back he didnt know how good a job he did all he knew was the little liz had told him and he was trying to remember it after shed knocked him cold when he got done captain horace said thats the craziest thing i ever heard in my life yes sir dan said you didnt want to argue with officers even when you were right you were wrong if you did something like that but the electric lights overhead hurt his sensitive eyes pointing to them he went on where in this world do we have lights like that where do we have all the other stuff here where do we have cocacola thats a good question sergeant horace said slowly and i wish i had a good answer for you this liz was heading north you say yes sir then she and her folks are likely at the brentwood market square eh well send some men up there right away the captain scowled but chances are theyll already be gone i wouldnt hang around anyway not after i got into a fight with one of king zev s soldiers in his own way he was tactful he didnt remind dan that liz had not only got in a fight but won it so well also pass the word to the border stations they must have come up from the south right id think so yes sir dan replied then well catch em when they try to escape thats all no one can assault a valley soldier and expect to get away with it captain horace sounded plenty confident that all sounds good sir the only thing is the only thing is theyre sneaky dan had the feeling his superior was missing something trouble was he had no idea what it had something to do with liz and her folks and how sneaky they were but what his poor battered brain wouldnt tell him i dont care how sneaky they are they can only go one way horace said and when they do weve got em the chevy wagon reached the top of sepulveda pass this was the place where the westside had built its stupid greedy wall the one that touched off the war with the valley looking north liz could see all the lights of king zev s domain flickering in the darkness what she saw was how few and faint those lights were when you came to the lop of the pass in the home timeline and started down toward the valley all the neon and fluorescent lights blazed out at you these fires seemed pathetic by comparison doesnt seem to be anybody after us mom said nope dad sounded smug we wouldve heard people on our trail with no motors or anything you can hear a long way in this alternate as if to prove his point an owl hooted in the hills off to one side of the pass liz never would have heard that driving along in a car with a million other cars all around now they had the old freeway almost to themselves they must think we are heading down to speedro liz said sometimes the fastest way to get somewhere is the long way around dad said that sounded as if it ought to make sense in a zen kind of way almost everything dad said sounded as if it ought to make sense sorting out what really did from what didnt could be a fulltime job though we can sell jeans to king zev himself mom said who wouldnt want a pair of brand new old time jeans theyd be fit for a king if we have a pair that fits him liz said isnt he supposed to be sort of short and round hes a bowling ball with a mustache dad said which gave her a case of the giggles but he is fairly smart i think which wont help him fit into denim mom started to snore liz was jealous she was also way too wound up even to try to sleep escaping from occupied westwood was bad enough but that shed been in a fight with somebody she knew that shed hurt him she didnt like the idea not even a little bit if shed lost dan and his buddies would be questioning her right now they wouldnt be gentle about it she understood all that perfectly well shed done what she had to do if she wanted to stay safe remembering that truth made her feel betterbut not enough better the owl hooted again or maybe it was another one a coyote howled at the moon for all the world as if it were a dog she wouldnt have heard that zooming along in a car eitheror stuck in traffic not zooming at all no morning and afternoon rush hours in this alternate mom stirred i think were all right she said sleepily if they were going to come after us they really would have done it by now its my fault i feel bad about it liz said if dan hadnt liked me too much nobody would have paid any attention to our house then none of this would have happened it would have been like another alternate maybe it is maybe its one where we know the breakpoint dad said maybe theres a whole mendoza family going on about its business in an alternate almost like this one except dan didnt like you or didnt meet you and we never ran into any trouble i dont think so liz said they hadnt found any alternates with breakpoints after the discovery of crosstime travel otherwise there wouldnt be a home timeline there would be a bunch of home timelines each a little different from all the others and if that didnt make your head want to explode probably not its not a big enough deal mom said but that kind of thing could happen one of these days itllbe a mess if it does too dad said weve never found another alternate that goes crosstime right if we cant find others well just have to make our own he might call it a mess but he sounded cheerful about it brr liz shivered though the night was mild the idea gave her the horrors they didnt talk about that kind of thing in school she knew why not too it would give people even more to worry about than they already had as if life wasnt complicated enough after a while dad said i think we can pull off onto the shoulder and stop they havent realized we might have headed north a good thing too or wed be in even more trouble mom said but she turned around on the seat and grabbed a couple of blankets sleeping in the wagon was cramped but it wouldnt be chilly the horses seemed glad to stop some scraggly grass grew by the side of the road they nibbled at that dad spread some oats on the ground too and put out a water bucket for each animal they arent like cars he remarked youve got to take care of them all the time not just lube and oil them every seventyfive thousand kilometers they might as well be people liz said and i sure could use a lube and oil change right now she shifted under the blankets trying to get comfortable next thing she knew it was dawn she yawned and stretched shed meant it about the lube jobshe really was stiff and sore by the way her folks grumbled so were they yeah they were older than she was but they hadnt had a valley soldier try to throw them into the middle of next week and almost succeed down the north side of the sepulveda pass went the wagon dad had to ride the brake which made the wheels squeal otherwise on the downhill slope the wagon would have bumped the horses backsides he breathed a sigh of relief when the terrain leveled out he got off the at victory here we are in the wonderful romantic valley he said it didnt look wonderful or romantic to liz it looked a lot like westwood a relative handful of people living in what had been part of a great city without imported water and food the los angeles basin couldnt support anything close to the population it had in the home timeline ruined tumbledown houses and shops spread as far as the eye could see the dead zone in the valley lay off to the northwest where the aerospace factories had stood the russians knew that of course and gave them a bomb a man selling avocados on a street corner called what have you got blue jeansgenuine old time levis dad answered top quality too i dont have many left how many avocados you want for a couple of pairs whoa dad told the horses not stopping would have been out of character he and the man with the avocados haggled for a while levi s were hard to come by while avocados grew all over the place in southern california on the other hand as the local pointed out you couldnt eat blue jeans when the man threw in a beatup basket to hold the avocados dad made the deal we can eat some on the way and give the rest to the stoyadinoviches he said do we have more to worry about than avocados mom pointed up the street marching their way came a platoon of valley soldiers archers musketeers and a few toughlooking riflemen well i hope not dad steered the wagon over to the curb the way youd steer a car in the home timeline if an ambulance or a fire engine or police car came at you the platoon tramped past with no more than a couple of sidewise glances toward the traders whew liz said as the wagon started rolling again i didnt think the soldiers in westwood would have got word about us up here so fast dad said still i wouldnt have liked to find out i was wrong that made liz look back over her shoulder she saw the valley troops other people on foot people on horseback and a few carts and carriages and wagons everything looked normal normal for this alternate anyhow she told herself she was jumpy about nothing then she told herself to believe she was jumpy about nothing herself laughed at her i wish you could step on the gas and make the horses go faster mom said that made liz feel bettershe wasnt the one with the jitters then matter of fact so do i dad said but i cant he flicked the reins maybe the horses went a tiny bit faster and maybe they didnt step on the gas that was a funny phrase cars in the home timeline burned clean hydrogen so it made sense there but people in this alternate also said it when they meant hurry up cars in when the fire fell hadnt burned hydrogen theyd burned nasty stinky polluting petroleum petroleum wasnt a gasit was a liquid she knew that she needed a moment to remember that the part of the petroleum old time cars burned was called gasoline people must have clipped that to gas even thought the stuff wasnt victory went east straight as a string for a long way dad stopped to rest the horses and bought lunch at a roadside taco stand he could have done that in the home timeline too though people there would have had conniptions if hed driven a team of horses on the street the tacos were pretty good they were handmade not cranked out in a factory and nuked when the order came in that helped nuked in the home timeline you nuked something when you threw it in the microwave oh it meant using nuclear weapons too but most people didnt dwell on that the home timeline had escaped atomic war and with a little luck would go right on escaping it they didnt have microwaves here nuking something meant just one thing in this alternatedestroying it altogether studying the way languages changed from one alternate to another was a field that was just taking off on they went on and on and on right where victory finally curved a little south two customs posts straddled the road the mendozas needed only a couple of minutes to clear the valley post the men at the other one wore green uniforms not king zev s khaki welcome to beautiful downtown burbank one of them said it didnt look beautiful to liz it didnt look like downtown either it looked like the border between a couple of tinpot kingdoms that had forgotten they should have been suburbs for some reason dad seemed to think the burbank customs mans greeting was funny liz could tell but she hoped the local couldnt dad certainly sounded serious enough when he said thank you sir anything to declare the customs man asked well were traders dad answered weve got whats left of a nice load of levi s in the back of the wagon we sold a good many in the valley and i expect we can move some more of them here the customs man took a look at them those are pretty fine all right anybody can see they come from the old time we charge duty on things we make ourselves so our people will buy from burbank craftsmen instead of foreigners clothes like that though with the zippers and everything we cant make anything quite like em ourselves even if we are getting closer i dont know where you found these pal but im jealous they look like theyre brand new they do dont they dad still kept his lace straight yeah the customs man sighed i wish i had the cash to buy clothes like that they probably arent dutiable but maybe id better check the regulations why dont you find a pair that fits you sir dad said smoothly why dont your other inspectors do the same a real trader from this alternate probably would have been furious at the polite shakedown he wouldnt have dared to show it though dad really had no reason to get upset and plenty of reason to keep these people sweet thats mighty nice of you pal the burbank customs man said he turned to his colleagues melvin frodo cmere frodo liz thought yes they knew about the lord of the rings in this alternate no wonder the password in the basement hadnt been good enough as soon as the burbank customs men found jeans that fit them the senior man swung aside the gateway pass on he said dad called giddyap to the horses they pulled the wagon through the customs inspector closed the gate liz and mom and dad all grinned at one another they were out of the valley they werent home free yet but they were on their way captain horace was not a happy man where the devil are they he growled they arent at that brentwood market squarepeople saw them go they arent anywhere in westwood that weve been able to find and i swear they havent sneaked past us heading south so where are they sir dan said what no horace wasnt happy not even a little bit what if they didnt go south sir dan saidit was about the worst thing he could think of what if they went north instead north by the way the officer said it it might have been a dirty word why thedickens would they want to go and do a stupid thing like that if it throws us off the track like is it really stupid dan asked captain horace bit down on that like a man crunching into a cherry pit his expression was as dour as if he really had bitten down on something painful it could be he said at last each word plainly tasting worse than the one before yes it could be and if it is weve wasted an awful lot of time waiting for something to happen when it wont why didnt you think of this sooner confound it sir was all dan said the unfairness of the crack took his breath away me i just made sergeant youre so smart captain horace why didnt you think of it for yourself but then horace let out a sheepish laugh well you werent the only one herei admit it why didnt i come up with it on my own i wonder if the telegraph between here and army hq in the valley is working maybe wed better find out sir dan said the telegraph worked by electricity and modern people still managed to use it some of the time anyhow dan didnt understand how they could do that but not make things like electric lights and refrigerators he asked captain horace as i understand it those need a lot more power than the telegraph does horace said but just because i understand it that way doesnt prove its so i know a lot about electricityfor an army officer if you want to get the straight skinny though you need to talk to somebody like dr saul id like to do that sir one of these days dan said for now we probably ought to see if we can catch the traders right going to the telegrapher took more time somewherewas it really somewhere up north somewhere in the valleythe traders wagon was getting farther and farther away will i ever see liz again dan wondered his head still ached dreadfully from the kick shed given him do i want to see her again after she did that he did in spite of everything he did the things she could tell him about the way her world workedand the way this one did he still thought she was cute too how could you think somebody was cute after she almost fractured your skull he didnt know but he did anyway he was also sorrowfully aware that she didnt think he was cute she probably looked at him the same way he looked at the wild men whod lost all traces of civilization dan didnt think that was fair well the wild men probably didnt think his opinion of them was fair either he didnt care what the wild men thought liz was much too likely not to care what he thought captain horace had him describe liz and her parents for the telegrapher he knew them better than anyone else from the valley but do i know them at all he wondered the captain described their wagon neither he nor dan had seen thatthey relied on what theyd heard from the traders in the brentwood market square would it be enough dan couldnt know he had to hope the telegraphers clever finger sent morse code north not long after he did his clicker started making noise in reply it wasnt magic though dan didnt fully understand why it wasnt they have the message sir the telegrapher told the captain theyll do what they can right on horace said far out how far out was it dan had his doubts the brass up in the valley hadnt seen the marvels down here with their own eyes how hard would they try to catch liz and her folks would they put real effort into it or just go through the motions and how much did any of that matter if the traders had headed north wouldnt they be long gone by now dan hoped not they knew so much they could do so much how much could they help this world if only they wanted to but they didnt liz had made that much too clear there was no money in it for them if they hadnt been studying this alternate they wouldnt have come here at all alternates the idea made dan s head spin even worse than liz s foot had all those possibilities and each one coming true a world where the fire didnt fall that one by itself was plenty to take dan s breath away but it was far from the only thing that might have happened he could see that too he had a friend whod become a secretary because a teacher praised his handwriting if the teacher hadnt norm probably would have been a leatherworker like his father and there were the guys who just happened to wind up at the wrong spot in a battle if theyd stood a couple of feet to the left or right they would have been fine as things were they stopped a bullet with their chest or their head so easy to see how changes big changes could turn a persons life upside down and inside out and if a persons life could change that way why couldnt a countrys or a whole worlds no reason at all not that dan could see when he thought about it in those terms he had no trouble understanding why he believed liz besides how could anybody make up a story like hers and even if somebody did how could she back it up with things that had been gone since the old time dan didnt think it was possible maybe well catch them yet captain horace said i bet we do yes sir maybe we will dan answered what else can i say he wondered and didnt see anything else but he didnt believe it the traders had too long a start and they could disappearthey really could what else was traveling between alternates but disappearing from one and appearing in another one how were you going to catch somebody who could do that very late that afternoon a wire came in about somebody whod got two pairs of denims from some people who might have been liz and her folks they were heading east toward beautiful downtown burbank if they got there king zev s soldiers would never lay a hand on them again zev might threaten war to get them dan laughed at himself not a chance with the valley still fighting the westside and speedro zev couldnt make beautiful downtown burbank mad at him too fighting one war was bad enough fighting two wars at once had to be four times as bad or maybe eight do you think theyll stay in beautiful downtown burbank horace asked him or are they more likely to go somewhere else from there if they do go somewhere else where do you think it would be this is the stuff youre supposed to worry aboutyoure the officer dan was learning to think like a sergeant in a hurry but he did know liz and her family better than the captain did well from what we found out they came up from the south he answered my guess is theyd go back that way too maybe theyve got another watchamacallita transposition chamber down there somewhere how far down there captain horace persisted the part of the westside we didnt take speedro sandago teejay sir dan said mournfully i have no idea so many things about liz and her folks he didnt know so many things he wanted to know so many things he knew hed never find out so many things hed wonder about for the rest of his life one surfaced right now if she came from this world or i came from hers would she have liked me better he could hope so anyhow and that led to another thought if she was still working in the ucla library she and her folks hadnt found all of their answer whatever it was maybe shed be back one day to look for it if we make this world more like the one she comes from would people from there and people from here get along better again dan could hope so and he could do more than hope he could work to make it so he realized he suddenly had something to do with however much time he had left hed never known a feeling like that before he decided he liked it be it ever so humble theres no place like the stoyadinoviches trading post dad looked pleased with himself thats an old saying i just made up i never would have guessed liz grinned as she zinged him now children mom sounded amused or maybe just resigned liz thought about asking which then decided shed rather not know i wish we could have stayed longer this time around but we did pretty well anyway dad said that stuff we found out about molotov nobody knew that about this alternate before whos this we mom wondered you and your tapeworm liz did all the finding youre just the guy wholl write the articles about it guilty dad agreed thats guilty guilty guiltyalways quote from the classics if you cant make up your own old sayings but i will give her credit i may borrow but i dont stealmuch and its definitely an important lead if the soviet government here was more hardnosed than in the home timeline well its not a smoking gun but a smoking mushroom cloud dont you mean liz put in or dont i get to make up old sayings too that one fits this alternate too well mom said gulls wheeled overhead you could see the oceanand when the wind blew in as it did more often than notsmell it too its clean salt tang helped cut the usual city reek of speedro sailboats and a few wood or coalburning steamboats glided across the water those were only details though for the most part speedro was like any other part of laany other part of this whole alternateafter the fire fell the buildings were put together from some new bricks and a lot of pieces of what had been here in there were lots of open spaces because far fewer people lived here now groves of citruses and olives and almonds and avocados grew where houses and shops and factories had stood once upon a time pigs and chickens and ducks and turkeys made a racket so did stray dogs and scrawny children speedros flaga white sailing ship on a blue backgroundflew over it all the stoyadinoviches greeted the mendozas like longlost siblings in this alternate they were the two families shared years of experience no one else here had whats the password for your safe room down below liz asked rosebud george stoyadinovich answered why you want to get a soda or something long as you stay down there to drink it help yourself no thanks i was just thinking its from before the breakpoint so maybe you ought to change it liz told him what had gone wrong up in westwood we never imagined they could figure out something like that but they did the movies of the lord of the rings are from the start of this century but the books are older i dont think rosebud is a problem dad said its from before the breakpoint yeah but its from a movie i dont believe there is a book to citizen kane and nobody here has watched any movies since before the big war liz hadnt thought about that slowly she nodded the risk with the stoyadinoviches password was bound to be smaller than with the one her family had picked she didnt think there was no risk at all though well change it mr stoyadinovich said i know what well useshaquille he was from long after the breakpoint he played baseball didnt he liz knew she was guessing mr stoyadinovich and dad grinned in a way that told her shed guessed wrong basketball they said together she shrugged as long as he came from after it didnt matter did you get any research done up there irma stoyadinovich asked you werent gone very long we did quite a bit matter of fact dad said mom coughed well liz did the digging he acknowledged looks like the soviets were more hardline here than they were in the home timeline so chances are they did push the button first cant nail it down a hundred percent but it seems a lot more likely mr stoyadinovich nodded makes sense so coming back turned out to be worthwhile sure did dad nodded too mom set a hand on liz s shoulder tell them what else your darling daughter did dear she kod the valley soldier who recognized her and tried to grab her pride rang in dads voice that bought us the time we needed to get away good for you sweetheart george stoyadmovich boomed i guess liz said i mean i know it was but its sad too the only reason dan did recognize me is because he liked me which didnt keep you from kicking him in the head when he needed it dad said i know but even so the fight embarrassed liz more than it made her proud it was something shed needed to do dad had that rightbut not something shed wanted to do i mean he was nice enough if he came from the home timeline he wouldnt have been too bad thats more than you ever said before mom told her well ill never see him again so i can say what i think liz answered and even if i did see him again now hed want to shoot me i bet and not just cause hes a valley soldier guys dont keep on liking girls who knock them cold well mr stoyadinovich said solemnly twirling his mustache youre right liz didnt tell him how much of the crosstime secret shed spilled to dan she didnt aim to say anything about that to anyone but her folks not that the locals could do anything with it but all the same if crosstime traffic found out they knew more than they should the company could assume it was because of what theyd found in the underground rooms if dan hadnt liked her he wouldnt have listened anyhow he would have gone on trying to deck her and he might have done it shed needed the breathing space maybe more than he did and if hed decked her the valley soldiers might have got her folks too she knew she was talking herself into something but she didnt much care a greek philosopher had called man the rational animal and that was true but man was also the rationalizing animal you did what you had to do or what you wanted to do and you worried about why later when you had the chance i got away we got away liz said it wasnt pretty and it wasnt neatwhat is in this alternate but we did it thats what counts dad said everybody nodded the mendozas would go back to the home timeline soon and dan poor dan liz did feel sorry for him she wondered what he thought he ought to do now she was absolutely positively sure shed never find out
