the lust lizard of melancholy cove by christopher moore this ones for mom prologue september in pine cove is a sigh of relief a nightcap a longdeserved nap soft autumn light filters through the trees the tourists go back to los angeles and san francisco and pine coves five thousand residents wake up to discover that they can once again find a parking place get a table in a restaurant and walk the beaches without being conked by an errant frisbee september is a promise rain will come at last and turn the golden pastures around pine cove green the tall monterey pines that cover the hills will stop dropping their needles the forests of big sur will stop burning the grim smile developed over the summer by the waitresses and clerks will bloom into something resembling real human expression children will return to school and the joy of old friends drugs and weapons that they missed over the summer and everyone at last will get some rest come september theophilus crowe the town constable lovingly clips the sticky purple buds from his sensimilla plants mavis down at the head of the slug saloon funnels her topshelf liquors back into the well from whence they came the tree service guys with their chain saws take down the dead and dying pines lest they crash through someones roof with the winter storms woodpiles grow tall and wide around pine cove homes and the chimney sweep goes to a twelvehour workday the sunscreen and needless souvenir shit shelf at brines bait tackle and fine wines is cleared and restocked with candles flashlight batteries and lamp oil monterey pine trees have notoriously shallow root systems and an affinity for falling on power lines at the pine cove boutique the hideous reindeer sweater is marked up for winter to await being marked back down for the tenth consecutive spring in pine cove where nothing happens or at least nothing has happened for a long time september is an event a quiet celebration the people like their events quiet the reason they came here from the cities in the first place was to get away from things happening september is a celebration of sameness each september is like the last except for this year this year three things happened not big things by city standards but three things that coldcocked the beloved status quo nonetheless forty miles to the south a tiny and not very dangerous leak opened in a cooling pipe at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant mavis sand advertised in songwriter magazine for a blues singer to play through the winter at the head of the slug saloon and bess leander wife and mother of two hung herself three things omens if you will september is a promise of what is to come admitting you have a problem dear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday everything went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle lewis carroll alices adventures in wonderland one theophilus crowe as dead people went bess leander smelled pretty good lavender sage and a hint of clove there were seven shaker chairs hung on pegs on the walls of the leanders dining room the eighth was overturned under bess who hung from the peg by a calico cloth rope around her neck dried flowers baskets of various shapes and sizes and bundles of dried herbs hung from the open ceiling beams theophilus crowe knew he should be doing cop stuff but he just stood there with two emergency medical technicians from the pine cove fire department staring up at bess as if they were inspecting the newly installed angel on a christmas tree theo thought the pastel blue of besss skin went nicely with her cornflowerblue dress and the patterns of the english china displayed on simple wooden shelves at the end of the room it was am and theo as usual was a little stoned theo could hear sobs coming from upstairs where joseph leander held his two daughters who were still in their nightgowns there was no evidence of a masculine presence anywhere in the house it was country cute bare pine floors and bent willow baskets flowers and rag dolls and herbflavored vinegars in blownglass bottles shaker antiques copper kettles embroidery samplers spinning wheels lace doilies and porcelain placards with prayers from the dutch not a sports page or remote control in sight not a thing out of place or a speck of dust anywhere joseph leander must have walked very light to live in this house without leaving tracks a man less sensitive than theo might have called him whipped that guys whipped one of the emts said his name was vance mcnally he was fiftyone short and muscular and wore his hair slicked back with oil just as he had in high school occasionally in his capacity as an emt he saved lives which was his rationalization for being a dolt the rest of the time he just found his wife hanging in the dining room vance theo pronounced over the heads of the emts he was sixfootsix and even in his flannel shirt and sneakers he could loom large when he needed to assert some authority she looks like raggedy ann said mike the other emt who was in his early twenties and excited to be on his first suicide call i heard she was amish vance said shes not amish theo said i didnt say she was amish i just said i heard that i figured she wasnt amish when i saw the blender in the kitchen amish dont believe in blenders do they mennonite mike said with as much authority as his junior status would afford whats a mennonite vance asked amish with blenders she wasnt amish theo said she looks amish vance said well her husbands not amish mike said how can you tell vance said he has a beard zipper on his jacket mike said amish dont have zippers vance shook his head mixed marriages they never work she wasnt amish theo shouted think what you want theo theres a butter churn in the living room i think that says it all mike rubbed at a mark on the wall beneath besss feet where her black buckled shoes had scraped as she convulsed dont touch anything theo said why she cant yell at us shes dead we wiped our feet on the way in vance said mike stepped away from the wall maybe she couldnt stand anything touching her floors hanging was the only way not to be outdone by the detective work of his protégé vance said you know the sphincters usually open up on a hanging victimleave an awful mess im wondering if she actually hanged herself shouldnt we call the police mike said i am the police theo said he was pine coves only constable duly elected eight years ago and reelected every other year thereafter no i mean the real police mike said ill radio the sheriff theo said i dont think theres anything you can do here guys would you mind calling pastor williams from the presbyterian church to come over i need to talk to joseph and i need someone to stay with the girls they were presbyterians vance seemed shocked he had really put his heart into the amish theory please call theo said he left the emts and went out through the kitchen to his volvo where he switched the radio over to the frequency used by the san junipero sheriffs department then sat there staring at the mike he was going to catch hell from sheriff burton for this north coast is yours theo all yours the sheriff had said my deputies will pick up suspects answer robbery calls and let the highway patrol investigate traffic accidents on highway thats it otherwise you keep them out of pine cove and your little secret stays secret theo was fortyone years old and he still felt as if he was hiding from the junior high vice principal laying low things like this werent supposed to happen in pine cove nothing happened in pine cove he took a quick hit from his sneaky pete smokeless pot pipe before keying the mike and calling in the deputies joseph leander sat on the edge of the bed hed changed out of his pajamas into a blue business suit but his thinning hair was still sticking out in sleep horns on the side he was thirtyfive sandyhaired thin but working on a paunch that strained the buttons of his vest theo sat across from him on a chair holding a notepad they could hear the sheriffs deputies moving around downstairs i cant believe shed do this joseph said theo reached over and squeezed the grieving husbands bicep im really sorry joe she didnt say anything that would indicate she was thinking about doing something like this joseph shook his head without looking up she was getting better val had given her some pills and she seemed to be getting better she was seeing valerie riordan theo asked valerie was pine coves only clinical psychiatrist do you know what kind of pills zoloft joseph said i think its an antidepressant theo wrote down the name of the drug on his notepad then bess was depressed no she just had this cleaning thing everything had to be cleaned every day shed clean something then go back five minutes later and clean it again she was making life miserable for the girls and me shed make us take our shoes and socks off then wash our feet in a basin before we came into the house but she wasnt depressed theo wrote down crazy on his notepad when was the last time bess went to see val maybe six weeks ago when she first got the pills she really seemed to be doing better she even left the dishes in the sink overnight once i was proud of her where are her pills joseph medicine cabinet joseph gestured to the bathroom theo excused himself and went to the bathroom the brown prescription bottle was the only thing in the medicine cabinet other than disinfectants and some qtips the bottle was about halffull im going to take these with me theo said pocketing the pills the sheriffs deputies are going to ask you some of these same questions joseph you just tell them what you told me okay joseph nodded i think i should be with the girls just a bit longer okay ill send up the deputy in charge theo heard a car start outside and went to the window to see an ambulance pulling away the lights and siren off bess leanders body riding off to the morgue he turned back to joseph call me if you need anything im going to go talk to val riordan joseph stood up theo dont tell anyone that bess was on antidepressants she didnt want anyone to know she was ashamed i wont call me if you need me theo left the room a sharply dressed plainclothes deputy met him at the bottom of the steps theo saw by the badge on his belt that he was a detective sergeant youre crowe john voss he extended his hand and theo shook it were supposed to take it from here voss said what have you got theo was at once relieved and offended sheriff burton was going to push him off the case without even talking to him no note theo said i called you guys ten minutes after i got the call joseph said she wasnt depressed but she was on medication he came downstairs to have breakfast and found her did you look around voss asked this place has been scoured there isnt a smudge or a spot anywhere its like someone cleaned up the scene she did that theo said she was a clean freak voss scoffed she cleaned the house then hung herself please theo shrugged he really didnt like this cop stuff im going to go talk to her psychiatrist ill let you know what she says dont talk to anybody crowe this is my investigation theo smiled okay but she hung herself and thats all there is dont make it into anything its not the family is in pretty bad shape im a professional voss said throwing it like an insult implying that theo was just dicking around in law enforcement which in a way he was did you check out the amish cult angle theo asked trying to keep a straight face maybe he shouldnt have gotten high today what right youre the pro theo said i forgot and he walked out of the house in the volvo theo pulled the thin pine cove phone directory out of the glove compartment and was looking up dr valerie riordans number when a call came in on the radio fight at the head of the slug saloon it was am mavis it was rumored among the regulars at the head of the slug that under mavis sands slack wrinkled liverspot ted skin lay the gleaming metal skeleton of a terminator mavis first began augmenting her parts in the fifties first out of vanity breasts eyelashes hair later as she aged and the concept of maintenance eluded her she began having parts replaced as they failed until almost half of her body weight was composed of stainless steel hips elbows shoulders finger joints rods fused to vertebrae five through twelve silicon wafers hearing aids pacemaker insulin pump advanced polymer resins cataract replacement lenses dentures kevlar fabric abdominal wall reinforcement titanium knees ankles and pork ventricular heart valve in fact if not for the pig valve mavis would have jumped classes directly from animal to mineral without the traditional stop at vegetable taken by most the more inventive drunks at the slug little more than vegetables themselves swore that sometimes between songs on the jukebox one could hear tiny but powerful servomotors whirring mavis around behind the bar mavis was careful never to crush a beer can or move a full keg in plain sight of the customers lest she feed the rumors and ruin her image of girlish vulnerability when theo entered the head of the slug he saw exscreamqueen molly michon on the floor with her teeth locked into the calf of a grayhaired man who was screeching like a mashed cat mavis stood over them both brandishing her louisville slugger ready to belt one of them out of the park theo mavis shrilled you got ten seconds to get this wacko out of my bar before i brain her no mavis theo raced forward and knocked maviss bat aside while reaching into his back pocket for his handcuffs he pried mollys hands from around the mans ankle and shackled them behind her back the grayhaired mans screams hit a higher pitch theo got down on the floor and spoke into mollys ear let go molly youve got to let go of the mans leg an animal sound emanated from mollys throat and bubbled out through blood and saliva theo stroked her hair out of her face i cant fix the problem if you dont tell me what it is molly i cant understand you with that guys leg in your mouth stand back theo mavis said im going to brain her theo waved mavis away the grayhaired man screamed even louder hey theo shouted pipe down im trying to have a conversation here the grayhaired man lowered his volume molly look at me theo saw a blue eye look away from the leg and the bloodlust faded from it he had her back thats right molly its me theo now whats the problem she spit out the mans leg and turned to look at theo mavis helped the man to a bar stool get her out of here mavis said shes eightysixed this time forever theo kept his eyes locked on mollys are you okay she nodded bloody drool was running down her chin theo grabbed a bar napkin and wiped it away careful to keep his fingers away from her mouth im going to help you up now and were going to go outside and talk about this okay molly nodded and theo picked her up by the shoulders set her on her feet and steered her toward the door he looked over his shoulder at the bitten man you okay you need a doctor i didnt do anything to her ive never seen that woman before in my life i just stopped in for a drink theo looked at mavis for confirmation he hit on her mavis said but thats no excuse a girl should appreciate the attention she turned and batted her spiderlike false eyelashes at the bitten man i could show you some appreciation sweetie the bitten man looked around in a panic no im fine no doctor im just fine my wifes waiting for me as long as youre okay theo said and you dont want to press charges or anything no just a misunderstanding soon as you get her out of here ill be heading out of town there was a collective sigh of disappointment from the regulars who had been placing side bets on who mavis would hit with her bat thanks theo said he shot mavis a surreptitious wink and led molly out to the street excusing himself and his prisoner as they passed an old black man who was coming through the door carrying a guitar case i spose a man run outta sweet talk and liquor he gots to go to mo direct measures the old black man said to the bar with a dazzling grin someone here lookin fo a bluesman molly michon theo put molly into the passenger side of the volvo she sat with her head down her great mane of graystreaked blonde hair hanging in her face she wore an oversized green sweater tights and hightop sneakers one red one blue she could have been thirty or fiftyand she told theo a different age every time he picked her up theo went around the car and climbed in he said you know molly when you bite a guy on the leg youre right on the edge of a danger to others or yourself you know that she nodded and sniffled a tear dropped out of the mass of hair and spotted her sweater before i start driving i need to know that youre calmed down do i need to put you in the backseat it wasnt a fit molly said i was defending myself he wanted a piece of me she lifted her head and turned to theo but her hair still covered her face are you taking your drugs meds they call them meds sorry theo said are you taking your meds she nodded wipe your hair out of your face molly i can barely understand you handcuffs whiz kid theo almost slapped his forehead idiot he really needed to stop getting stoned on the job he reached up and carefully brushed her hair away from her face the expression he found there was one of bemusement you dont have to be so careful i dont bite theo smiled well actually oh fuck you you going to take me to county should i ill just be back in seventytwo and the milk in my refrigerator will be spoiled then id better take you home he started the car and circled the block to head back to the fly rod trailer court he would have taken a back way if he could to save molly some embarrassment but the fly rod was right off cypress pine coves main street as they passed the bank people getting out of their cars turned to stare molly made faces at them out the window that doesnt help molly fuck em fans just want a piece of me i can give em that ive got my soul mighty generous of you if you werent a fan i wouldnt let you do this well i am huge fan actually hed never heard of her until the first time he was called to take her away from hps cafe where she had attacked the espresso machine because it wouldnt quit staring at her no one understands everyone takes a piece of you then theres nothing left for you even the meds take a piece of you do you have any idea what im talking about here theo looked at her i have such a mindnumbing fear of the future that the only way i can function at all is with equal amounts of denial and drugs jeez theo youre really fucked up thanks you cant go around saying crazy shit like that i dont normally its been a tough day so far he turned into the fly rod trailer court twenty rundown trailers perched on the bank of santa rosa creek which carried only a trickle of water after the long dry summer a grove of cypress trees hid the trailer park from the main street and the view of passing tourists the chamber of commerce had made the owner of the park take down the sign at the entrance the fly rod was a dirty little secret for pine cove and they kept it well theo stopped in front of mollys trailer a vintage fifties singlewide with small louvered windows and streaks of rust running from the roof he got molly out of the car and took off the handcuffs theo said im going to see val riordan you want me to have her call something in to the pharmacy for you no ive got my meds i dont like em but i got em she rubbed her wrists why you going to see val you going nuts probably but this is business you going to be okay now i have to study my lines right theo started to go then turned molly what were you doing at the slug at eight in the morning how should i know if the guy at the slug had been a local id be taking you to county right now you know that i wasnt having a fit he wanted a piece of me stay out of the slug for a while stay home just groceries okay you wont talk to the tabloids he handed her a business card next time someone tries to take a piece of you call me i always have the cell phone with me she pulled up her sweater and tucked the card into the waistband of her tights then still holding up her sweater she turned and walked to her trailer with a slow sway thirty or fifty under the sweater she still had a figure theo watched her walk forgetting for a minute who she was without looking back she said what if its you theo who do i call then theo shook his head like a dog trying to clear water from its ears then crawled into the volvo and drove away ive been alone too long he thought two the sea beast the cooling pipes at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant were all fashioned from the finest stainless steel before they were installed they were xrayed ultrasounded and pressuretested to be sure that they could never break and after being welded into place the welds were also xrayed and tested the radioactive steam from the core left its heat in the pipes which leached it off into a seawater cooling pond where it was safely vented to the pacific but diablo had been built on a breakneck schedule during the energy scare of the seventies the welders worked double and triple shifts driven by greed and cocaine and the inspectors who ran the xray machines were on the same schedule and they missed one not a major mistake just a tiny leak barely noticeable a minuscule stream of harmless lowlevel radiation wafted out with the tide and drifted over the continental shelf dissipating as it went until even the most sensitive instruments would have missed it yet the leak didnt go totally undetected in the deep trench off california near a submerged volcano where the waters ran to seven hundred degrees fahrenheit and black smokers spewed clouds of mineral soup a creature was roused from a long slumber eyes the size of dinner platters winked out the sediment and sleep of years it was instinct sense and memory the sea beasts brain it remembered eating the remains of a sunken russian nuclear submarine beefy little sailors tenderized by the pressure of the depths and spiced with piquant radioactive marinade memory woke the beast and like a child lured from under the covers on a snowy morning by the smell of bacon frying it flicked its great tail broke free from the ocean floor and began a slow ascent into the current of tasty treats a current that ran along the shore of pine cove mavis mavis tossed back a shot of bushmills to take the edge off her frustration at not being able to whack anyone with her baseball bat she wasnt really angry that molly had bitten a customer after all he was a tourist and rated above the mice in the walls only because he carried cash maybe the fact that something had actually happened in the slug would bring in a little business people would come in to hear the story and mavis could stretch speculate and dramatize most stories into at least three drinks a tell business had been slowing over the last couple of years people didnt seem to want to bring their problems into a bar time was on any given afternoon youd have three or four guys at the bar pouring down beers as they poured out their hearts so filled with selfloathing that theyd snap a vertebra to avoid catching their own reflection in the big mirror behind the bar on a given evening the stools would be full of people who whined and growled and bitched all night long pausing only long enough to stagger to the bathroom or to sacrifice a quarter to the jukeboxs extensive selfpity selection sadness sold a lot of alcohol and it had been in short supply these last few years mavis blamed the booming economy val riordan and vegetables in the diet for the sadness shortage and she fought the insidious invaders by running twoforone happy hours with fatty meat snacks the whole point of happy hour was to purge happiness wasnt it but all her efforts only served to cut her profits in half if pine cove could no longer produce sadness she would import some so she advertised for a blues singer the old black man wore sunglasses a leather fedora a tattered black wool suit that was too heavy for the weather red suspenders over a hawaiian shirt that sported topless hula girls and creaky blackonwhite wing tips he set his guitar case on the bar and climbed onto a stool mavis eyed him suspiciously and lit a tarryton shed been taught as a girl not to trust black people name your poison she said he took off his fedora revealing a gleaming brown baldness that shone like polished walnut you gots some wine cheapshit red or cheapshit white mavis cocked a hip gears and machinery clicked them cheapshit boys done expanded used to be jus one flavor red or white whatever sweetest sweetness mavis slammed a tumbler onto the bar and filled it with yellow liquid from an icy jug in the well thatll be three bucks the black man reached outthick sharp nails skating the bar surface long fingers waving like tentacles searching the hand like a sea creature caught in a tidal washand missed the glass by four inches mavis pushed the glass into his hand you blind no it be dark in here take off your sunglasses idjit i cant do that maam shades go with the trade what trade dont you try to sell pencils in here i dont tolerate beggars im a bluesman maam i hear yall lookin for one mavis looked at the guitar case on the bar at the black man in shades at the long fingernails of his right hand the short nails and knobby gray calluses on the fingertips of his left and she said i should have guessed do you have any experience he laughed a laugh that started deep down and shook his shoulders on the way up and chugged out of his throat like a steam engine leaving a tunnel sweetness i got me more experience than a busload o hos aint no dust settled a day on catfish jefferson since god done first dropped him on this big ol ball o dust thats me call me catfish he shook hands like a sissy mavis thought just let her have the tips of his fingers she used to do that before she had her arthritic finger joints replaced she didnt want any arthritic old blues singer im going to need someone through christmas can you stay that long or would your dust settle i spose i could slow down a bit too cold to go back east he looked around the bar trying to take in the dinge and smoke through his dark glasses then turned back to her yeah i might be able to clear my schedule ifand here he grinned and mavis could see a gold tooth there with a musical note cut in itif the money is right he said youll get room and board and a percentage of the bar you bring em in youll make money he considered scratched his cheek where white stubble sounded like a toothbrush against sandpaper and said no sweetness you bring em in once they hear catfish play they come back now what percentage did you have in mind mavis stroked her chin hair pulled it straight to its full three inches ill need to hear you play catfish nodded i can play he flipped the latches on his guitar case and pulled out a gleaming national steel body guitar from his pocket he pulled a cutoff bottleneck and with a twist it fell onto the little finger of his left hand he played a chord to test tune pulled the bottleneck from the fifth to the ninth and danced it there high and wailing mavis could smell something like mildew moss maybe a change in humidity she sniffed and looked around she hadnt been able to smell anything for fifteen years catfish grinned the delta he said he launched into a twelvebar blues playing the bass line with his thumb squealing the high notes with the slide rocking back and forth on the bar stool the light of the neon coors sign behind the bar playing colors in the reflection of sunglasses and his bald head the daytime regulars looked up from their drinks stopped lying for a second and slick mccall missed a straightin eightball shot on the quarter table which he almost never did and catfish sang starting high and haunting going low and gritty theys a mean ol woman run a bar out on the coast im telling you theys a mean ol woman run a bar out on the coast but when she gets you under the covers that ol woman turn your buttered bread to toast and then he stopped youre hired mavis said she pulled the jug of white cheapshit out of the well and sloshed some into catfishs glass on the house just then the door opened and a blast of sunlight cut through the dinge and smoke and residual blues and vance mcnally the emt walked in and set his radio on the bar guess what he said to everyone and no one in particular that pilgrim woman hung herself a low mumble passed through the regulars catfish put his guitar in its case and picked up his wine sho nuff a sad day startin early in this little town sho nuff sho nuff said mavis with a cackle like a stainlesssteel hyena valerie riordan depression has a mortality rate of fifteen percent fifteen percent of all patients with major depression will take their own lives statistics hard numbers in a very squishy science fifteen percent dead val riordan had been repeating the figures to herself since theophilus crowe had called but it wasnt helping her feel any better about what bess leander had done val had never lost a patient before and bess leander hadnt really been depressed had she bess didnt fit into the fifteen percent val went to the office in the back of her house and pulled bess leanders file then went back to the living room to wait for constable crowe at least it was the local guy not the county sheriffs and she could always fall back on patient confidentiality truth was she had no idea why bess leander might have hung herself she had only seen bess once and then for only half an hour val had made the diagnosis written the scrip and collected a check for the full hour session bess had called in twice talked for a few minutes and val had sent her a bill for the time rounded to the next quarter hour time was money val riordan liked nice things the doorbell rang westminster chimes val crossed the living room to the marble foyer a thin tall figure was refracted through the doors beveled glass panels theophilus crowe val had never met him but she knew of him three of his exgirlfriends were her patients she opened the door he was dressed in jeans sneakers and a gray shirt with black epaulets that might have been part of a uniform at one time he was cleanshaven with long sandy hair tied neatly into a ponytail a goodlooking guy in an ichabod crane sort of way val guessed he was stoned his girlfriends had talked about his habits drriordan he said theo crowe he offered his hand she shook hands everyone calls me val she said nice to meet you come in she pointed to the living room nice to meet you too theo said almost as an afterthought sorry about the circumstances he stood at the edge of the marble foyer as if afraid to step on the white carpet she walked past him and sat down on the couch please she said pointing to one of a set of hepplewhite chairs sit he sat im not exactly sure why im here except that joseph leander doesnt seem to know why bess did it no note val asked no nothing joseph went downstairs for breakfast this morning and found her hanging in the dining room val felt her stomach lurch she had never really formed a mental picture of bess leanders death it had been words on the phone until now she looked away from theo looked around the room for something that would erase the picture im sorry theo said this must be hard for you im just wondering if there was anything that bess might have said in therapy that would give a clue fifteen percent val thought she said most suicides dont leave a note by the time they have gone that far into depression they arent interested in what happens after their death they just want the pain to end theo nodded then bess was depressed joseph said that she appeared to be getting better val cast around her training for an answer she hadnt really diagnosed bess leander she had just prescribed what she thought would make bess feel better she said diagnosis in psychiatry isnt always that exact theo bess leander was a complex case without compromising doctorpatient confidentiality i can tell you that bess suffered from a borderline case of ocd obsessive compulsive disorder i was treating her for that theo pulled a prescription bottle out of his shirt pocket and looked at the label zoloft isnt that an antidepressant i only know because i used to date a woman who was on it right val thought actually you used to date at least three women who were on it she said zoloft is an ssri like prozac its prescribed for a number of conditions with ocd the dosage is higher thats it get clinical baffle him with clinical bullshit theo shook the bottle could someone od on it or something i heard somewhere that people do crazy things sometimes on these drugs thats not necessarily true ssris like zoloft are often prescribed to people with major depression fifteen percent of all depressed patients commit suicide there she said it antidepressants are a tool along with talk therapy that psychiatrists use to help patients sometimes the tools dont work as with any therapy a third get better a third get worse and a third stay the same antidepressants arent a panacea but you treat them like they are dont you val but you said that bess leander had ocd not depression constable have you ever had a stomachache and a runny nose at the same time so youre saying she was depressed yes she was depressed as well as having ocd and it couldnt have been the drugs to be honest with you i dont even know if she was taking the drug have you counted them uh no patients dont always take their medicine we dont order blood level tests for ssris right theo said i guess well know when they do the autopsy another horrendous picture flashed in vals mind bess leander on an autopsy table the viscera of medicine had always been too much for her she stood i wish i could help you more but to be honest bess leander never gave me any indication that she was suicidal at least that was true theo took her cue and stood well thank you im sorry to have bothered you if you think of anything you know anything that i can tell joseph that might make it easier on him im sorry thats all i know fifteen percent fifteen percent fifteen percent she led him to the door he turned before leaving one more thing molly michon is one of your patients isnt she yes actually shes a county patient but i agreed to treat her at a reduced rate because all the county facilities are so far away you might want to check on her she attacked a guy at the head of the slug this morning is she in county no i took her home she calmed down thank you constable ill call her well then ill be going constable she called after him those pills you havezoloft isnt a recreational drug theo stumbled on the steps then composed himself right doctor i figured that out when i saw the body hanging in the dining room ill try not to eat the evidence goodbye val said she closed the door behind him and burst into tears fifteen percent she had fifteen hundred patients in pine cove on some form of antidepressant or another fifteen percent would be more than two hundred people dead she couldnt do that she wouldnt let another of her patients die because of her noninvolvement if antidepressants wouldnt save them then maybe she could three theo theophilus crowe wrote bad freeverse poetry and played a jimbai drum while sitting on a rock by the ocean he could play sixteen chords on the guitar and knew five bob dylan songs all the way through allowing for a dampening buzz any time he had to play a bar chord he had tried his hand at painting sculpture and pottery and had even played a minor part in the pine cove little theaters revival of arsenic and old lace in all these endeavors he had experienced a meteoric rise to mediocrity and quit before total embarrassment and selfloathing set in theo was cursed with an artists soul but no talent he possessed the angst and the inspiration but not the means to create if there was any single thing at which theo excelled it was empathy he always seemed to be able to understand someones point of view no matter how singular or farfetched and in turn could convey it to others with a succinctness and clarity that he seldom found in expressing his own thoughts he was a born mediator a peacemaker and it was this talent after breaking up numerous fights at the head of the slug saloon that got theo elected constable that and heavyhanded endorsement of sheriff john burton burton was a hardline rightwing politico who could spout law and order accent on order over brunch with the rotarians lunch with the nra and dinner with mothers against drunk drivers and wolf down dry banquet chicken like it was manna from the gods every time he wore expensive suits a gold rolex and drove a pearlblack eldorado that shone like a starry night on wheels rapt attention and copious coats of carnuba from the grunts in the county motor pool he had been sheriff of san junipero county for sixteen years and in that time the crime rate had dropped steadily until it was the lowest per capita of any county in california his endorsement of theophilus crowe someone with no law enforcement experience had come as more than somewhat of a surprise to the people of pine cove especially since theos opponent was a retired los angeles policeman whod put in a highly decorated five and twenty what the people of pine cove did not know was that sheriff burton not only endorsed theo he had forced him to run in the first place theophilus crowe was a quiet man and sheriff john burton had his reasons for not wanting to hear a peep out of the little north county burg of pine cove so when theo walked into his little tworoom cabin he wasnt surprised to see a red seven blinking on his answering machine he punched the button and listened to burtons assistant insisting that he call right awayseven times burton never called the cell phone theo had come home to shower and ponder his meeting with val riordan the fact that she had treated at least three of his exgirlfriends bothered him he wanted to try and figure out what the women had told her obviously theyd mention that he got high occasionally well more than occasionally but like any man it worried him that they might have said something about his sexual performance for some reason it didnt bother him nearly as much that val riordan think him a loser and a drug fiend as it did that she might think he was bad in the rack he wanted to ponder the possibilities think away the paranoia but instead he dialed the sheriffs private number and was put right through what in the hell is the matter with you crowe you stoned no more than usual theo said whats the problem the problem is you removed evidence from a crime scene i did talking to the sheriff could drain all of theos energy instantly he fell into a beanbag chair that expectorated styrofoam beads from a failing seam with a sigh what evidence what scene the pills crowe the suicides husband

money motive and mommy and daddy werent fighting they talked to the kids of course they talked to the kids theyre detectives they investigate things now get over there and get them out of north county id send them over to get the pills from you but i wouldnt want them to find your little victory garden would you im leaving now theo said this is the last i will hear of this burton said he hung up theo hung up the phone closed his eyes and turned into a human puddle in the beanbag chair fortyone years old and he still lived like a college student his books were stacked between bricks and boards his bed pulled out of a sofa his refrigerator was empty but for a slice of pizza going green and the grounds around his cabin were overgrown with weeds and brambles behind the cabin in the middle of a nest of blackberry vines stood his victory garden ten bushy marijuana plants sticky with buds that smelled of skunk and spice not a day passed that he didnt want to plow them under and sterilize the ground they grew in and not a day passed that he didnt work his way through the brambles and lovingly harvest the sticky green that would sustain his habit through the day the researchers said that marijuana was only psychologically addictive theo had read all the papers they only mentioned the night sweats and mental spiders of withdrawal in passing as if they were no more unpleasant than a tetanus shot but theo had tried to quit hed wrung out three sets of sheets in one night and paced the cabin looking for distraction until he thought his head might explode only to give up and suck the piquant smoke from his sneaky pete so he could find sleep the researchers obviously didnt get it but sheriff john burton did he understood theos weakness and held it over him like the proverbial sword that burton had his own achilles heel and more to lose from its discovery didnt seem to matter logically theo had him in a standoff but emotionally burton had the upper hand theo was always the one to blink he snatched sneaky pete off his orange crate coffee table and headed out the door to return bess leanders pills to the scene of the crime valerie dr valerie riordan sat at her desk looking at the icons of her life a tiny digital stock ticker that she would surreptitiously glance down at during appointments a gold mont blanc desk set the pens jutting from the jade base like the antennae of a goldbug a set of bookends fashioned in the likenesses of freud and jung bracing leatherbound copies of the psychology of the unconscious the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsmiv the interpretation of dreams and the physicians desk reference and a plastercast bust of hippocrates that dispensed postit notes from the base hippocrates that wily greek who turned medicine from magic to science the author of the famous oath that val had uttered twenty years ago on that sunny summer day in ann arbor when she graduated from med school i will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment but i will never use it to injure or wrong them i will not give poison to anyone though asked to do so nor will i suggest such a plan the oath had seemed so silly so antiquated then what doctor in their right mind would give poison to a patient but in purity and in holiness i will guard my life and my art it had seemed so obvious and easy then now she guarded her life and her art with a custom security system and a glock mm stashed in the nightstand i will not use the knife on sufferers from stone but i will give place to such as are craftsmen therein shed never had a problem with that part of the oath she was loathe to use the knife shed gone into psychiatry because she couldnt handle the messy parts of medicine her father a surgeon himself had been only mildly disappointed at least she was a doctor of sorts shed done her internship and residency in a rehab center where movie stars and rock idols learned to be responsible by making their own beds while val distributed valium like a flight attendant passing out peanuts one wing of the sunrise center was druggies the other eating disorders she preferred the eating disorders you havent lived until youve forcefed minestrone to a supermodel through a tube she told her father into whatsoever houses i enter i will do so to help the sick keeping myself free from all intentional wrongdoing and harm especially from fornication with woman or man bond or free well abstinence from fornication hadnt been a problem had it she hadnt had sex since richard left five years ago richard had given her the bust of hippocrates as a joke he said but shed put it on her desk just the same shed given him a statue of blind justice wearing a garter belt and fishnets the year before to display at his law office hed brought her here to this little village passing up offers from corporate law firms to follow his dream of being a country lawyer whose daily docket would include disagreements over pig paternity or the odd pension dispute he wanted to be atticus finch puddnhead wilson a jimmy stewart or henry fonda character who was paid in freshbaked bread and baskets of avocados well hed gotten that part vals practice had supported them for most of their marriage shed be paying him alimony now if theyd actually divorced country lawyer indeed he left her to go to sacramento to lobby the california coastal commission for a consortium of golf course developers his job was to convince the commission that sea otters and elephant seals would enjoy nothing better than to watch japanese businessmen slice titleists into the pacific and that what nature needed was one long fairway from santa barbara to san francisco maybe sand traps at the pismo and carmel dunes he carried a pocket watch for christs sake a gold chain with a jade fob carved into the shape of an endangered brown pelican he played his frontporch rockingchairwise country lawyer against their botany sophistication and pulled down over two hundred grand a year in the bargain he lived with one of his clerks an earnest doeeyed stanfordite with surfer girl hair and a figure that mocked gravity richard had introduced val to the girl ashley or brie or jordan and it had been ohsoadult and ohsogracious and later when val called richard to clear up a tax matter she asked so howd you screen the candidates richard first one to suckstart your lexus maybe we should start thinking about making our separation official richard had said val had hung up on him if she couldnt have a happy marriage shed have everything else everything and so had begun her revolving door policy of hustling appointments prescribing the appropriate meds and shopping for clothes and antiques hippocrates glowered at her from the desk i didnt intentionally do harm val said not intentionally you old buggerer fifteen percent of all depressives commit suicide treated or not whatsoever in the course of practice i see or hear or even outside my practice in social intercourse that ought never to be published abroad i will not divulge but consider such things to be holy secrets holy secrets or do no harm val asked envisioning the hanging body of bess leander with a shudder which is it hippocrates sat on his postits saying nothing was bess leanders death her fault if she had talked to bess instead of put her on antidepressants would that have saved her it was possible and it was also possible that if she kept to her policy of a pill for every problem someone else was going to die she couldnt risk it if using talk therapy instead of drugs could save one life it was worth a try val grabbed the phone and hit the speed dial button that connected her to the towns only pharmacy pine cove drug and gift one of the clerks answered val asked to speak to winston krauss the pharmacist winston was one of her patients he was fiftythree unmarried and eighty pounds overweight his holy secret which he shared with val during a session was that he had an unnatural sexual fascination with marine mammals dolphins in particular hed confessed that hed never been able to watch flipper without getting an erection and that hed watched so many jacques cousteau specials that a french accent made him break into a sweat he kept an anatomically correct inflatable porpoise which he violated nightly in his bathtub val had cured him of wearing a scuba mask and snorkel around the house so gradually the red gasket ring around his face had cleared up but he still did the dolphin nightly and confessed it to her once a month winston val riordan here i need a favor sure dr val you need me to deliver something to molly i heard she went off in the slug this morning gossip surpassed the speed of light in pine cove no winston you know that company that carries all the lookalike placebos we used them in college i need you to order lookalikes for all the antidepressants i prescribe prozac zoloft serzone effexor the whole bunch all the dosages order in quantity i dont get it val what for val cleared her throat i want you to fill all of my prescriptions with the placebos youre kidding im not kidding winston as of today i dont want a single one of my patients getting the real thing not one are you doing some sort of experiment control group or something something like that and you want me to charge them the normal price of course our usual arrangement val got a twenty percent kickback from the pharmacy she was going to be working a lot harder she deserved to get paid winston paused she could hear him going through the glass door into the back of the pharmacy finally he said i cant do that val thats unethical i could lose my license go to jail val had really hoped it wouldnt come to this winston youll do it youll do it or the pine cove gazette will run a frontpage story about you being a fishfucker thats illegal you cant divulge something i told you in therapy quit telling me whats illegal winston im married to a lawyer id really rather not do this val cant you send them down to the thrifty mart in san junipero i could say that i cant get the pills anymore that wouldnt work would it winston the people at the thrifty mart dont have your little problem youre going to have some withdrawal reactions how are you going to explain that let me worry about that im quadrupling my sessions i want to see these people get better not mask their problems this is about bess leanders suicide isnt it im not going to lose another one winston antidepressants dont increase the incidence of suicide or violence eli lilly proved that in court yes and oj walked court is one thing winston the reality of losing a patient is another im taking charge of my practice now order the pills im sure the profit margin is going to be quite a bit higher on sugar pills than it is on prozac i could go to the florida keys theres a place down there where they let you swim with bottlenose dolphins you cant go winston you cant miss your therapy sessions i want to see you at least once a week you bitch im trying to do the right thing what day is good for you ill call you back dont push me winston i have to make this order he said then after a second he said dr val what do i have to go off the serzone well talk about it in therapy she hung up and pulled a postit out of hippocrates chest now if i keep this oath and break it not may i enjoy honor in my life and art among all men for all time but if i transgress and forswear myself may the opposite befall me does that mean dishonor for all time she wondered im just trying to do the right thing here finally she made a note to call winston back and schedule his appointments four estelle boyet as septembers promise wound down a strange unrest came over the people of pine cove due in no small part to the fact that many of them were going into withdrawal from their medications it didnt happen all at oncethe streets were not full of middleclass junkies rocking and sweating and begging for a fixbut slowly as the autumn days became shorter and as far as they knew because val riordan had called every one of them they were experiencing the onset of a mild seasonal syndrome sort of like spring fever call it autumn malaise the nature of the medications kept the symptoms spread out over the next few weeks prozac and some of the older antidepressants took almost a month to leave the system so those people slipped into the fray more slowly than those on zoloft or paxil or wellbutrin which was flushed from the system in only a day or two leaving the deprived with symptoms resembling a lowgrade flu then a scattered disorientation akin to a temporary case of attention deficit disorder and in some a rebound of depression that dropped on them like a smoky curtain one of the first to feel the effects was estelle boyet a local artist successful and semifamous for her seascapes and idealized paintings of pine cove shore life her prescription had run out a day before dr val had replaced the supply with sugar pills so she was already in the midst of withdrawal when she took the first dose of the placebo estelle was sixty a stout vital woman who wore brightly colored caftans and let her long gray hair fly around her shoulders as she moved through life with an energy and determination that inspired envy from women half her age for thirty years she had been a teacher in the decaying and increasingly dangerous los angeles unified school district teaching eighth graders the difference between acrylics and oils a brush and a pallet knife dali and degas and using her job and her marriage as a justification for never producing any art herself she had married right out of art school joe boyet a promising young businessman the only man she had ever loved and only the third she had ever slept with when joe had died eight years ago she had nearly lost her mind she tried to throw herself into her teaching hoping that by inspiring the children she might find some reason to go on herself in the face of the escalating violence in her school she resigned herself to wearing a bulletproof vest under her artist smocks and even brought in some paintball guns to try to gain the pupils interest but the latter only backfired into several incidents of driveby abstract expressionism and soon she received death threats for not allowing students to fashion crack pipes in ceramics class her studentschildren living in a hyperadult world where playground disputes were settled with mmseventually drove her out of teaching estelle lost her last reason to go on the school psychologist referred her to a psychiatrist who put her on antidepressants and recommended immediate retirement and relocation estelle moved to pine cove where she began to paint and where she fell under the wing of dr valerie riordan no wonder then that estelles painting had taken a dark turn over the last few weeks she painted the ocean every day waves and spray rocks and serpentine strands of kelp on the beach otters and seals and pelicans and gulls her canvases sold in the local galleries as fast as she could paint them but lately the inner light at the heart of her waves titanium white and aquamarine had taken on a dark shadow every beach scene spoke of desolation and dead fish she dreamed of leviathan shadows stalking her under the waves and she woke shivering and afraid it was getting more difficult to get her paints and easel to the shore each day the open ocean and the blank canvas were just too frightening joe is gone she thought i have no career and no friends and i produce nothing but kitschy seascapes as flat and soulless as a velvet elvis im afraid of everything val riordan had called her insisting that she come to a group therapy session for widows but estelle had said no instead one evening after finishing a tormented painting of a beached dolphin she left her brushes to harden with acrylic and headed downtownanywhere where she didnt have to look at this shit shed been calling art she ended up at the head of the slug saloonthe first bar shed set foot in since college the slug was full of blues and smoke and people chasing shots and running from sadness if theyd been dogs they would have all been in the yard eating grass and trying to yak up whatever was making them feel so lousy not a bone gnawed not a ball chasedall tails went unwagged oh life is a fast cat a short leash a flea in that place where you just cant scratch it was dog sad in there and catfish jefferson was the designated howler the moon was in his eye and he was singing up the sum of human suffering in aminor while he worked that bottleneck slide on the national guitar until it sounded like a slow wind through heartstrings he was grinning of the hundred or so people in the slug half were experiencing some sort of withdrawal from their medications there was a selfpity contingent at the bar staring into their drinks and rocking back and forth to the delta rhythms at the tables the more social of the depressed were whining and slurring their problems into each others ears and occasionally trading hugs or curses over by the pool table stood the agitated and the aggressive the people looking for someone to blame these were mostly men and theophilus crowe was keeping an eye on them from his spot at the bar since the death of bess leander there had been a fight in the slug almost every night in addition there were more pukers more screamers more criers and more unwanted advances stifled with slaps theo had been very busy so had mavis sand mavis was happy about it estelle came through the doors in her paintspattered overalls and shetland sweater her hair pulled back in a long gray braid just inside she paused as the music and the smoke washed over her some mexican laborers were standing there in a group drinking budweisers and one of them whistled at her im an old lady estelle said shame on you she pushed her way through the crowd to the bar and ordered a white wine mavis served it in a plastic beer cup she was serving everything in plastic lately evidently the blues made people want to break glasson each other busy estelle said although she had nothing to compare it to the blues sure packs em in mavis said i dont much care for the blues said estelle i enjoy classical music three bucks said mavis she took estelles money and moved to the other end of the bar estelle felt as if shed been slapped in the face dont mind mavis a mans voice said shes always cranky estelle looked up caught a shirt button then looked up farther to find theos smile she had never met the constable but she knew who he was i dont even know why i came in here im not a drinker something going around theo said i think maybe were going to have a stormy winter or something people are coming out of the woodwork they exchanged introductions and theo complimented estelle on her paintings which hed seen in the local galleries estelle dismissed the compliment this seems like a strange place to find the constable estelle said theo showed her the cell phone on his belt base of operations he said most of the trouble has been starting in here anyway if im here already i can stop it before it escalates very conscientious of you no im just lazy theo said and tired in the last three weeks ive been called to five domestic disputes ten fights two people who barricaded themselves in the bathroom and threatened suicide a guy who was going house to house knocking the heads off garden gnomes with a sledgehammer and a woman who tried to take her husbands eye out with a spoon oh my sounds like one day in the life of an la cop this isnt la theo said i dont mean to complain but im not really prepared for a crime wave and theres nowhere left to run estelle said pardon people come here to run away from conflict dont you think come to a small town to get out of the violence and the competition in the city if you cant handle it here theres nowhere else to go you might as well give up well thats a little cynical i thought artists were supposed to be idealists scratch a cynic and youll find a disappointed romantic estelle said thats you theo asked a disappointed romantic the only man i ever loved died im sorry theo said me too she drained her cup of wine easy on that estelle it doesnt help im not a drinker i just had to get out of the house there was some shouting over by the pool table my presence is required theo said excuse me he made his way through the crowd to where two men were squaring off to fight estelle signaled mavis for a refill and turned to watch theo try to make peace catfish jefferson sang a sad song about a mean old woman doing him wrong thats me estelle thought a mean old worthless woman selfmedication was working by midnight most of the customers at the slug had given in and started clapping and wailing along with catfishs blues quite a few had given up and gone home by closing time there were only five people left in the slug and mavis was cackling over a drawer full of money catfish jefferson put down his national steel guitar and picked up the twogallon pickle jar that held his tips dollar bills spilled over the top change skated in the bottom and here and there in the middle fives and tens struggled for air there was even a twenty down there and catfish dug in after it like a kid going for a cracker jack prize he carried the jar to the bar and plopped down next to estelle who was gloriously eloquently crocked hey baby catfish said you like the blues estelle searched the air for the source of the question as if it might have come from a moth spiraling around one of the lights behind the bar her gaze finally settled on the bluesman and she said youre very good i was going to leave but i liked the music well you done stayed now catfish said look at this he shook the money jar i got me upward o two hundred dollar here and that mean old woman owe me least that much too what you say we take a pint and my guitar and go down to the beach have us a party id better get home estelle said i have to paint in the morning you a painter i never knowed me a painter what you say we go down to the beach and watch us a sunrise wrong coast estelle said the sun comes up over the mountains catfish laughed see you done saved me a heap of waiting already lets you and me go down to the beach no i cant it cause im black aint it no cause im old right no cause im bald you dont like old bald men right no estelle said cause im a musician you heard we irresponsible no cause im hung like a bull right no estelle said catfish laughed again well you wouldnt mind spreadin that one around town just the same would you how would i know how youre hung well catfish said pausing and grinning you could go to the beach with me you are a nasty and persistent old man arent you mr jefferson estelle asked catfish bowed his shining head i truly am miss i truly am nasty and persistent and i am too old to be trouble i admits it he held out a long thin hand lets have us a party on the beach estelle felt like shed just been bamboozled by the devil something smooth and vibrant under that gritty old downhome shuck was this the dark shadow her paintings kept finding in the surf she took his hand lets go to the beach ha catfish said mavis pulled a louisville slugger from behind the bar and held it out to estelle here you wanna borrow this they found a niche in the rocks that sheltered them from the wind catfish dumped sand from his wing tips and shook his socks out before laying them out to dry that was a sneaky old wave i told you to take off your shoes estelle said she was more amused than she felt she had a right to be a few sips from catfishs pint had kept the cheap white wine from going sour in her stomach she was warm despite the chill wind catfish on the other hand looked miserable never did like the ocean much catfish said too many sneaky things down there give a man the creeps thats what it does if you dont like the ocean then why did you ask me to come to the beach the tall man said you like to paint pictures of the beach lately the oceans been giving me a bit of the creeps too my paintings have gone dark catfish wiped sand from between his toes with a long finger you think you can paint the blues you ever seen van gogh catfish looked out to sea a threequarter moon was pooling like mercury out there van goghvan goghfiddle player outta st louis thats him estelle said catfish snatched the pint out of her hand and grinned girl you drink a mans liquor and lie to him too i know who vincent van gogh is estelle couldnt remember the last time shed been called a girl but she was pretty sure she hadnt liked hearing it as much as she did now she said whos lying now girl you know under that big sweater and them overalls they might be a girl then again i could be wrong youll never know i wont now that is some sad stuff there he picked up his guitar which had been leaning on a rock and began playing softly using the surf as a backbeat he sang about wet shoes running low on liquor and a wind that chilled right to the bone estelle closed her eyes and swayed to the music she realized that this was the first time shed felt good in weeks he stopped abruptly ill be damned look at that estelle opened her eyes and looked toward the waterline where catfish was pointing some fish had run up on the beach and were flopping around in the sand you ever see anything like that estelle shook her head more fish were coming out of the surf beyond the breakers the water was boiling with fish jumping and thrashing a wave rose up as if being pushed from underneath theres something moving out there catfish picked up his shoes we gots to go estelle didnt even think of protesting yes now she thought about the huge shadows that kept appearing under the waves in her paintings she grabbed catfishs shoes jumped off the rock and started down the beach to the stairs that led up to a bluff where catfishs station wagon waited come on im comin catfish spidered down the rock and stepped after her at the car both of them winded and leaning on the fenders catfish was digging in his pocket for the keys when they heard the roar the roar of a thousand phlegmy lionsequal amounts of wetness fury and volume estelle felt her ribs vibrate with the noise jesus what was that get in the car girl estelle climbed into the station wagon catfish was already fumbling the key into the ignition the car fired up and he threw it into drive kicking up gravel as he pulled away wait your shoes are on the roof he can have them catfish said they better than the ones he ate last time he what the hell was that you know what that was ill tell you soon as im done havin this heart attack five the sea beast the great sea beast paused in his pursuit of the delicious radioactive aroma and sent a subsonic message out to a gray whale passing several miles ahead of him roughly translated it said hey baby hows about you and i eat a few plankton and do the wild thing the gray whale continued her relentless swim south and replied with a subsonic thrum that translated i know who you are stay away from me the sea beast swam on during his journey he had eaten a basking shark a few dolphins and several hundred tuna his focus had changed from food to sex as he approached the california coast the radioactive scent began to diminish to almost nothing the leak at the power plant had been discovered and fixed he found himself less than a mile offshore with a belly full of sharkand no memory of why hed left his volcanic nest but there was a buzz reaching his predators senses from shore the listless resolve of prey that has given up depression warmblooded food dolphins and whales sent off the same signal sometimes a large school of food was just asking to be eaten right near the edge of the sea he stopped out past the surf line and came to the surface in the middle of a kelp bed his massive head breaking though strands of kelp like a zombie pickup truck breaking sod as it rises from the grave then he heard it a hated sound the sound of an enemy it had been half a century since the sea beast had left the water and land was not his natural domain but his instinct to attack overwhelmed his sense of selfpreservation he threw back his head shaking the great purple gills that stood out on his neck like trees and blew the water from his vestigial lungs breath burned down his cavernous throat for the first time in fifty years and came out in a horrendous roar of pain and anger three of the protective ocular membranes slid back from his eyes like electric car windows allowing him to see in the bitter air he thrashed his tail pumped his great webbed feet and torpedoed toward the shore gabe it had been almost ten years since gabe fenton had dissected a dog but now at three oclock in the morning he was thinking seriously about taking a scalpel to skinner his threeyearold labrador retriever who was deep in the throes of a psychotic barking fit skinner had been banished to the porch that afternoon after he had taken a roll in a dead seagull and refused to go into the surf or get near the hose to be washed off to skinner dead bird was the smell of romance gabe crawled out of bed and padded to the door in his boxers scooping up a hiking boot along the way he was a biologist held a phd in animal behavior from stanford so it was with great academic credibility that he opened the door and winged the boot at his dog following it with the behaviorreinforcing command of skinner shut the fuck up skinner paused in his barking fit long enough to duck under the flying l l bean then true to his breeding retrieved it from the washbasin that he used as a water dish and brought it back to the doorway where gabe stood skinner set the soggy boot at the biologists feet gabe closed the door in skinners face jealous skinner thought no wonder he cant get any females smelling like fabric softener and soap the food guy wouldnt be so cranky if hed get out and sniff some butts skinner always thought of gabe as the food guy then after a quick sniff to confirm that he was indeed the don juan of all dogs skinner resumed his barking fit doesnt he get it skinner thought theres something dangerous coming danger food guy danger inside gabe fenton glanced at the computer screen in his living room as he returned to bed a thousand tiny green dots were working their way en masse across the map of the pine cove area he stopped and rubbed his eyes it wasnt possible gabe went to the computer and typed in a command the map of the area reappeared in wider scale still the dots were all moving in a line he zoomed the map to only a few square miles the dots were still on the move each green dot on the map represented a rat that gabe had livetrapped injected with a microchip and released into the wild their location was tracked and plotted by satellite every rat in a tensquaremile area was moving east away from the coast rats did not behave that way gabe ran the data backward looking at the rodents movements over the last few hours the exodus had started abruptly only two hours ago and already most of the rats had moved over a mile inland they were running fulltilt and going far beyond their normal range rats are sprinters not longdistance runners something was up gabe hit a key and a tiny green number appeared next to each of the dots each chip was unique and each rat could be identified like airplanes on the screen of an air traffic controller rat hadnt moved outside of a twometer range for five days gabe had assumed that she had either given birth or was ill now was half a mile from her normal territory anomalies are both the bane and bread of researchers gabe was excited by the data but at the same time it made him anxious an anomaly like this could lead to a discovery or make him look like a total fool he crosschecked the data three different ways then tapped into the weather station on the roof nothing was happening in the way of weather all changes in barometric pressure humidity wind and temperature were well within normal ranges he looked out the window a low fog was settling on the shore totally normal he could just make out the lighthouse a hundred yards away it had been shut down for twenty years used only as a weather station and as a base for biological research he grabbed a blanket off of his bed and wrapped it around his shoulders against the chill then returned to his desk the green dots were still moving he dialed the number for jpl in pasadena skinner was still barking outside skinner shut the fuck up gabe shouted just as the automated answering service put him through to the seismology lab a woman answered she sounded young probably an intern excuse me she said sorry i was yelling at my dog yes hello this is dr gabe fenton at the research station in pine cove just wondering if you have any seismic activity in my area pine cove can i get a longitude and latitude gabe gave it to her i think im looking for something offshore nothing minor tremor centered at parkfield yesterday at am point zerofivethree you wouldnt even be able to feel it have you picked something up on your instruments i dont have seismographic instruments thats why i called you this is a biological research and weather station im sorry doctor i didnt know im new here did you feel something no my rats are moving as soon as he said it he wished he hadnt pardon me never mind i was just checking im having some anomalous behavior in some specimens if you pick up anything in the next few days could you call me he gave her his number you think your rats are predicting an earthquake doctor i didnt say that you should know that theres no concrete data on animals predicting seismic activity i know that but im trying to eliminate all the possibilities did it occur to you that your dog might be scaring them ill factor that in gabe said thank you for your time he hung up feeling stupid nothing seismic or meteorological and a call to the highway patrol confirmed that there were no chemical spills or fires he had to confirm the data perhaps something was wrong with the satellite signal the only way to find out was to take out his portable antenna and track the rats in the field he dressed quickly and headed out to his truck skinner you want to go for a ride skinner wagged his tail and made a beeline for the truck about time he thought you need to get away from the shore food guy right now inside the house ten green dots were moving away from the others toward the shore the sea beast the sea beast crawled up the beach roaring as his legs took the full weight of his body and the undertow sucked at his haunches the urgency of killing his enemy had diminished now and hunger was upon him in response to the effort of moving out of the ocean an organ at the base of his brain that had disappeared from other species when mans only living ancestors were tree shrews produced an electric signal to call food there were many prey here that same organ sensed the sea beast came to the fiftyfoot cliff that bordered the beach reared back on his tail and pulled himself up with his forelegs he was a hundred feet long nose to tail and stood twentyfive feet tall with his broad neck extended to its full height his rear feet were wide and webbed his front talonlike with a thumb that opposed three curved claws for grasping and killing prey on the dry grass above the beach some of the prey he had called already waited raccoons ground squirrels a few skunks a fox and two cats cavorted on the grasssome copulated others dug at fleas with blissful abandon others just rolled on their backs as if overcome by a fit of joy the sea beast swept them into his great maw with a flick of his tongue crunching a few bones on the way down but swallowing most whole he belched and savored the skunky bouquet his jaws smacking together like two wet mattresses and a flash of neon color ran across his flanks with the pleasure he moved over the bluff across the coast highway and into the sleeping town the streets were deserted lights off in all the businesses on cypress street a low fog splashed against the pseudotudor halftimbered buildings and formed green coronas around the streetlights above it all the red texaco sign shone like a beacon the sea beast changed the color of his skin to the same smoky gray as the fog and moved down the center of the street looking like a serpentine cloud he followed a low rumbling sound coming from under the red beacon broke out of the fog and there he saw her she purred taunting and teasing him from the front of the deserted texaco station that comehither rumble that low sexy growl those silver flanks reflecting fog and the red texaco sign called to him begged him to mount her the sea beast flashed a rainbow of color down his sides to display his magnificent maleness he fanned the gill trees on his neck sending bands of color and light into their branches the sea beast sent her a signal which roughly translated into hey baby havent seen you around before she sat there purring playing coy but he knew she wanted him she had short black legs a stumpy tail and smelled as if she may have recently eaten a trawler but those magnificent silver flanks were too much to resist the sea beast turned himself silver as well to make her feel a little more comfortable then reared up on his hind legs and displayed his aroused member no response just that shy purring he took it as an invitation and moved across the parking lot to mount the fuel truck estelle estelle placed a mug of tea in front of catfish then sat down across the table from him with her own catfish sipped the tea and grimaced then pulled the pint from his back pocket and unscrewed the cap estelle caught his hand before he could pour you have some explaining to do first mr bluesman estelle was more than a little rattled when they were only half a mile away from the

western it goes like this you pay your dues do your time behind the wheel put in long hours on boring roads your vertebrae compress and your stomach goes sour from too much strong coffee and finally just when you get a goodpaying job with benefits and youre seeing the light at the end of the retirement tunnel just when you can hear the distant siren song of a bass boat and a case of miller calling to you like a willing truck stop waitress named darlin a monster comes along and fucks your truck and you are plum blowed up als story al was drowsing in the cab of his tank truck while unleaded liquid dinosaurs pulsed through the big black pipe into the underground tanks of the pine cove texaco the station was closed there was no one at the counter to shoot the bull with and this was the end of his run but for a quick jog down the coast to a motel in san junipero on the radio turned low reba sang of hard times with the full authority of a crosseyed redheaded millionaire when the truck first moved al thought he might have been rearended by some drunk tourist then the shaking started and al was sure he was in the middle of the bull moose earthquake of the centurythe big onethe one that twisted cities and snapped overpasses like dry twigs you thought about those things when you towed around ten thousand gallons of explosive liquid al could see the tall texaco sign out of the windshield and it occurred to him that it should be waving like a sapling in the wind but it wasnt only the truck was moving he had to get out and stop the pump the truck thumped and rocked as if rammed by a rhino he pulled the door handle and pushed it didnt budge something blocked it blocked the whole window a tree had the roof over the pumps come down on him he looked to the passenger door and something was blocking that one too not metal not a tree it had scales through the windshield he saw a dark wet stain spreading over the concrete and his bladder emptied oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit he reached behind his seat for the tire thumper to knock out the windshield and in the next instant al was flaming bits and smoking pieces flying over the pacific a mushroom cloud of greasy flame rose a thousand feet into the sky the shock wave leveled trees for a block and knocked out windows for three half a mile away in downtown pine cove motion detector alarms were triggered and added their klaxon calls to the roar of the flames pine cove was awakeand frightened the sea beast was thrown two hundred feet into the air and landed on his back in the flaming ruins of berts burger stand five thousand years on the planet and he had never experienced flight he found he didnt care for it burning gasoline covered him from nose to tail his gill trees were singed to stumps jagged shards of metal protruded between the scales of his belly still flaming he headed for the nearest water the creek that ran behind the business district as he lumbered down into the creek bed he looked back to the place where his lover had rejected him and sent out a signal she was gone now but he sent the signal anyway roughly translated it said a simple no would have sufficed molly the poster covered half of the trailers living room wall a younger molly michon in a black leather bikini and spiked dog collar brandishing a wickedlooking broadsword in the background red mushroom clouds rose over the desert warrior babes of the outland in italian of course mollys movies had only been released to overseas theatersdirect to video in the united states molly stood on the wirespool coffee table and struck the same pose she had fifteen years before the sword was tarnished her tan was gone the blonde hair had gone gray and now a jagged fiveinch scar ran above her right breast but the bikini still fit and muscles still raked her arms thighs and abdomen molly worked out in the wee hours of the morning in the vacant space next to her trailer she spun the broadsword like a deadly baton she lunged and thrust and leapt into the improbable back flip that had made her a star in thailand anyway at two in the morning while the village slept around her molly the crazy lady became once again kendra warrior babe of the outland she stepped off the coffee table and went to her tiny kitchen where she opened the brown plastic pill bottle and ceremoniously dropped one tablet into the garbage disposal as she had every night for a month now then she went out the trailer door careful not to let it slam and wake her neighbors and began her routine stretches firstthe splits in the high wet grass then a hurdlers hamstring stretch touching her forehead to her knee she could feel her vertebrae pop like a string of muted firecrackers as she did her back stretches now with dew streaking her legs her hair tied back with a leather boot lace she began her sword work a twohanded slash a thrust riposte leap over the blade spin and slashslowly at first working up momentumone handed spin pass to the other hand reverse pass the sword behind her back speeding up as she went until the sword cut the air with a whistling whirr as she worked up to a series of backflips executed while the sword stayed in motion one two three she tossed the sword into the air did a back flip reached to catch it in midspina light sweat sheeted her body nowreached to catch itthe sword silhouetted against a threequarter moonreached to catch it and the sky went red molly looked up as the shock wave rocketed through the village the blade slashed the back of her wrist to the bone and stuck in the ground quivering molly swore and watched the orange mushroom cloud rise in the sky over pine cove she held her wrist and stared at the fire in the sky for several minutes wondering if what she was seeing was really there or if perhaps shed been a little hasty about stopping her meds a siren sounded in the distance then she heard something moving down in the creek bedas if huge rocks were being kicked aside mutants she thought where there were mushroom clouds there were mutants the curse of kendras nukedout world molly snatched the sword and ran into her trailer to hide theo the shock wave from the explosion had dissipated to the level of a sonic boom by the time it reached theos little cabin two miles out of town still he knew that something had happened he sat up in bed to wait for the phone to ring a minute and a half later it did the dispatcher from san junipero was on the line constable crowe youve had some sort of explosion at the texaco station on cypress street in pine cove there are fires burning nearby ive dispatched fire and ambulance but you should get over there theo struggled to sound alert anyone hurt we dont know yet the call just came in it sounds like a fuel tank went up im on my way theo swung his long legs out of bed and pulled on his jeans he snatched his shirt cell phone and beeper from the nightstand and headed out to the volvo he could see an orange corona from the flames in the sky toward town and billowing black smoke streaking the moonlit sky as soon as he started the car the radio crackled with the voices of volunteer firemen who were racing to the site of the explosion in pine coves two fire engines theo keyed the mike hey guys this is theo crowe anyone on scene yet eta one minute theo came back at him ambulance is on scene an emt from the ambulance came on the radio the texaco is gone sos the burger stand doesnt look like the fire is spreading i dont see anyone around but if there was anybody in those two buildings theyre toast delicate vance very professional theo said into the mike ill be there in five the volvo bucked over the rough dirt road theos head banged on the roof and he slowed enough to buckle his seat belt berts burger stand was gone gone and the minimarket at the texaco gone too theo felt an empty rumbling in his stomach as he pictured his beloved minimarket nachos going black in the flames five minutes later he pulled in behind the ambulance and jumped out of the volvo the firefighters seemed to have the fire contained to the asphalt area of the texaco and the burger stand a little brush had burned on the hill behind the texaco and had charred a few trees but the firemen had drenched that area first to keep the fire from climbing into the residential area theo shielded his face with his hands the heat coming off the burning texaco was searing even at a hundred yards a figure in firefighting regalia approached him out of the smoke a few feet away he pulled up the shield on his helmet and theo recognized robert masterson the volunteer fire chief robert and his wife jenny owned brines bait tackle and fine wines he was smiling theo youre gonna starve to deathboth your food sources are gone theo forced a smile guess ill have to come to your place for brie and cabernet anyone hurt theo was shaking he hoped robert couldnt see it by the light of the fire and the rotating red lights of the emergency vehicles hed left his sneaky pete pipe on the nightstand we cant locate the driver of the truck if he was in it we lost him still too hot to get close to it the explosion threw the cab two hundred feet that way robert pointed to a burning lump of metal at the edge of the parking lot what about the underground tanks should we evacuate or something no theyll be fine theyre designed with a vapor lock no oxygen can get down there so no fire were going to have to let whats left of the minimart just burn out some cases of slim jims caught fire and they burn like the sun we cant get close theo squinted into the flames i love slim jims he said forlornly robert patted his shoulder itll be okay ill order some for you but you cant tell anyone im carrying them and theo when this is all over come see me at the shop well talk about what robert pulled off his fire helmet and wiped back his receding brown hair i was a drunk for ten years i quit i might be able to help you theo looked away im fine thanks he pointed to a tenfootwide burned strip that started across the street and led away from the fire in a path to the creek what do you make of that looks like someone drove a burning vehicle out of the fire ill check it out theo got a flashlight from the volvo and crossed the street the grass was singed and there were deep ruts cut into the dirt they were lucky this had happened after the rainy season had started two months earlier and they would have lost the town he followed the track to the creek bed fully expecting to find a wrecked vehicle pitched over the bank but there was nothing there the track ended at the bank the water wasnt deep enough to cover anything large enough to make a trail like that he played the flashlight around the bank and stopped it on a single deep track in the mud he blinked and shook his head to clear his vision then looked again it couldnt be anything over there robert was coming across the grass toward him theo jumped down onto the bank and kicked the mud until the print was obliterated nothing theo said must have just been some burning fuel sprayed out this way what are you doing stomping out the last of a burning squirrel must have gotten caught in the flames and ran over here poor guy you really need to come see me theo i will robert for sure i will eight the sea beast he knew he should return to the safety of the sea but his gill trees were singed and he didnt relish the idea of treading water until they healed if hed known the female was going to react so violently he would have retracted his gills into the folds beneath his scales where they would have been safe he made his way down the creek bed until he spotted a herd of animals sleeping above the bank they were ugly things pale and graceless and he could sense parasites living in every one of them but this was no time to be judgmental after all some brave beast had to be the first to eat a mastodon and who would have thought that those furballs would turn out to be the tasty treats that they were he could hide among this wormy herd until his gills healed then perhaps hed take one of the females on a grateful hump but not now his heart still ached for the purring female with the silvery flanks he needed time to heal the sea beast slithered up the bank into an open space among the herd then curled his legs and tail under his body and assumed their shape the change was painful and took more effort than he was used to but after a few minutes he was finished and he quietly fell asleep molly no this wasnt what she had planned at all she had stopped taking her meds because they had been giving her the shakes and shed been willing to deal with the voices if they came back but not this she hadnt counted on this she was tempted to run to her kitchen area and gulp down one of her blue pills stelazinethe smurfs of sanity she called them to see if it could chase the hallucination but she couldnt tear herself from the trailer window it was too realand too weird could there be a big burnt beast lumbering out of the creek and if so had she just watched it turn into a doublewide trailer hallucinations that was one of the five symptoms of schizophrenia molly kept a list of all the symptoms in fact shed stolen a desk drawer version of the dsmivthe diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the book psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnessfrom valerie riordan according to the dsmiv you had to have two of the five symptoms hallucinations were one okay that was a possibility but delusions no way she wasnt the least bit deluded she knew she was having hallucinations number three was disorganized speech or incoherence shed give it a try hi molly how the heck are you she asked not well thank you im worried that my speech may be disorganized she answered well you sound fine to me she said by way of being polite thanks for saying so she replied with genuine gratitude i guess im okay youre fine nice ass by the way thanks youre not too bad yourself see not disorganized at all she said not realizing that the conversation was over symptom four was grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior she looked around her trailer most of the dishes were done the videotapes of her movies were arranged chronologically and the goldfish were still dead in the aquarium nope nothing disorganized in this place schizo sanity number five negative symptoms such as affective flattening alogia or avolition well a woman hits her forties of course theres a little affective flattening but she was sure enough that she didnt have the other two symptoms to not even look them up but then there was the footnote only one criterion required if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the persons behavior or thoughts so she thought if i have a narrator im batshit in most of the kendra movies there had been a narrator it helped tie a story together that was supposed to take place in the nukedout future when in fact it was being filmed in an abandoned strip mine near barstow and narration was easy to dub into foreign languages because you didnt have to match the lips so the question she had to ask herself was do i have a narrator no way said the narrator fuck said molly just when shed settled into having a simple personality disorder she had to learn to be psychotic all over again being schizo wasnt all bad being diagnosed schizo ten years ago had gotten her the monthly disability check from the state but val riordan had assured her that since then her status had changed from schizophrenic paranoid type single episode in partial remission with prominent negative symptoms persecutorytype delusions and negative stressors molly liked to think of the negative stressors as special sauce to a much more healthy postmorbid shizotypal personality disorder bipolar type no special sauce to make the latter you had to fulfill the prerequisite of at least one psychotic event then hit five out of nine symptoms it was a much tougher and more subtle form of batshit mollys favorite symptom was odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms the narrator said so the magical thinkingthat would be that you believe that in another dimension you actually are kendra warrior babe of the outland fucking narrator again molly said youre not going away are you i dont need this symptom you cant really say that your magical thinking affects your behavior can you the narrator asked i dont think you can claim that symptom oh hell no molly said im just out practicing with a broadsword at two in the morning waiting for the end of civilization so i can claim my rightful identity simple physical fitness regimen everyones trying to get into shape these days so they can hack apart evil mutants sure nautilus makes a machine for that mutant master thats a crock sorry ill shut up now id appreciate that i really dont need the voices symptom thanks youve still got the monstertrailer hallucination outside i thought you were going to shut up sorry thats the last youll hear from me really jerk bitch you said sorry so without voices all she had to deal with was the hallucination the trailer was still sitting there but admittedly it just looked like a trailer molly could imagine trying to tell the shrink at county about it when they admitted her so you saw a trailer thats right and you live in a trailer park yep i see the shrink would say and somewhere between those two little words the judgment would be pronounced crazy no she wasnt going to go that route she would confront her fears and go forward just as kendra had in the mutant slayer warrior babes ii she grabbed her sword and left her trailer the sirens had subsided now but she could still see an orange glow from the explosion not a nuclear blast she thought just some sort of accident she strode across the lot and stopped about ten feet away from the trailer up close it lookedwell it looked like a damn trailer the door was in the wrong place on the end instead of the side and the windows were frosty as if theyd iced over there was a thin patina of soot over its entire length but it was a trailer it didnt look like a monster at all she stepped forward and ventured a poke with her sword the aluminum skin of the trailer seemed to shy away from the sword point molly jumped back a warm wave of pleasure swept through her body for a second she forgot why she had come out here and let the wave take her she poked the trailer again and again the pleasure wave washed over her this time even more intense there was no fear no tension just the feeling that this was exactly where she should bewhere she should always have been she dropped her sword and let the feeling take her the frosty layer on the trailers two end windows seemed to lift revealing the slitlike pupils of two great golden eyes then the door began to open not from side to side but splitting itself in the middle and opening like a mouth molly turned on her heel and ran wondering even as she went why she hadnt just stayed there by the trailer where everything felt so good estelle estelle was wearing a leather fedora a pair of dark sunglasses a single lavender sock and a subtle and satisfied smile sometime after her husband had diedafter shed moved to pine cove and started taking the antidepressants after shed stopped coloring her hair or giving a damn about her wardrobeestelle had vowed that no man would ever see her naked again at the time she considered it a fair trade carnal pleasures of which there were few for guiltfree cookies of which there were many now having broken that vow and lying in her feather bed next to this sweaty stringy old man who was teasing her left nipple with his tongue and who didnt seem to mind that said nipple was leading her breast over her arm rather than jutting skyward like the cupola on the taj mahal estelle felt like she understood at last the mona lisas smile mona had been getting some and she had her cookies too you are some storyteller estelle said a spidery black hand crawled up her thigh and parked an index finger moistly on her pleasure buttonjust settled thereand she shuddered i didnt finish catfish said you didnt then what was all that hallelujah lord im comin home followed by the barking i didnt finish the story catfish said his enunciation remarkably clear considering he didnt miss a lick harmonica player estelle thought she said im sorry i dont know what came over me and she didnt one minute they were sipping spiked tea and the next there was an explosion and she had her mouth locked over his moaning into him like a saxophonist playing passion you didnt see me fightin you catfish said we got time we do sho but you gonna have to pay my way now you done chased the blues off me and i feels like they aint never comin back im out a job estelle looked down to see catfish grinning in the soft orange light and grinned herself then she realized that they hadnt lit any candles and she didnt have any orange lights somewhere in the tussle between the kitchen and the bedroom amid the tossing of clothes and groping of flesh they had turned the lights out the orange glow was coming through the window at the foot of the bed estelle sat up the town is on fire it is in here catfish said she pulled the sheets up to cover herself we need to do something i got an idea a somethin we can do he moved his spidery fingers and her attention was taken away from the window already seem soon to me too girl but im old and this could be my last one thats a cheery thought im a bluesman yes you are she said then she rolled over on him and stayed there off and on until dawn nine when mikey the collector plotznik wheeled into town and saw that the texaco station had blown up leaving a charred circle two hundred yards wide around it he knew that it was going to be a great day it was a shame about the burger stand going up too and hed miss their spicy fries but hey you dont often get to see the toasting of a major landmark like the texaco the fire was all out now but several firemen were still sifting through the wreckage the collector waved to them as he wheeled by they waved back somewhat reticently for the collectors reputation preceded him and made them nervous today would be the day mikey thought the texaco was an omen the star in the sky over his lifelong dream today hed catch molly michon naked and when he did and brought back the proof his reputation would grow to mythic proportions he patted the disposable camera he carried in the front pouch of his hooded sweatshirt oh yes hed have evidence to back up his story they would believe himand bow to him at this point in his life the collector was more interested in explosions than in naked women he was only ten and it would be a couple of years before his interests moved to girls freud never identified a stage of development known as pyrotechnic fascination but that was only because there wasnt an abundant supply of disposable lighters in nineteenthcentury vienna tenyearold boys blow shit up its what they do but today a strange new feeling had come over mikey a feeling he couldnt put a word to but if he could the word would have been horny as he rollerbladed through town tossing the los angeles times into the shrubs and gutters of businesses along cypress street he felt a tightness in his shorts that until now he had associated with having to take a raging pee in the morning today it signified a need to see the crazy lady in a state of undress paperboys are the carriers of preadolescent myth on every paper route there is a haunted house a kideating dog an old woman who tips with twenties and a woman who answers the door in the nude mikey had never actually seen any of these things but that never stopped him from spinning wild stories for his buddies at school today he would get proof he could feel it in his loins he skated down the driveway into the fly rod trailer court chucked a paper into the rose bushes in front of mr nunezs trailer then made a beeline for the crazy ladys house he could see a blue glow coming through her windows a tv she was home and awake yes he pulled up a couple of doors down and noticed that a new trailer had moved in next to the crazy lady a new customer why not give it a try the crazy lady didnt receive the paper so his pretense for knocking on her door was to get her to subscribe he could practice on these new people as he skated up to the front door of the new trailer lights came on in the two front windows yes someone was home strange curtainsthey looked like cats eyes through a part in the curtains molly watched the kid come down the road into the trailer park she liked kids but she didnt like this kid at least once a week he knocked on her door and tried to get her to subscribe to the paper and once a week she told him to go away and never come back sometimes he would bring one of his little buddies along she could hear them skulking around her trailer trying to peek in the windows swear to god shes got a dead guy in there that she does it with ive seen him and she ate a kid once the kid was heading for the monster trailer in the background a videotape was playing on her tvmechanized death warrior babe viiand the scene was coming up molly looked away from the window and watched the scene for the thousandth time kendra is standing in the back of a jeep manning a rack of net guns as the jeep pursues the evil warlord across the desert the driver turns as he is supposed to throwing up a fishtail of dust but the front wheel of the jeep hits a rock and the jeep rolls kendra is thrown fifty feet in the air and lands in a heap the steel bra she is wearing cuts deep into her chest and blood sprays out across the dust the bastards every time she watches the scene she cant believe the bastards left it in the accident was real the blood was mollys and when she returned to the set ten days later a security guard escorted her to the producers trailer i can pay you extras wages as a mutant the producer said but lets face it babe you didnt get your billing because of your acting ability you think im gonna hold up filming for ten days when the whole schedule is only three weeks long we got a new kendra wrote the accident and the facial reconstruction into the script shes a cyborg now now you can get in line with the mutants to pick up your bag of rags or you can get the fuck off the set my audience wants perfect bodies and you were getting up there anyway with that scar you dont sell anymore molly had just turned twentyseven years old she pulled herself from the scene and looked out the window again the kid was there right there in front of the monster trailer she should warn him or something she pounded on the window and the kid looked up not startled but with a dreamy expression on his face molly gestured for him to move away the window she was looking out of didnt open trailers built in those days were designed so people would burn up in case of a fire the manufacturers thought it would keep the lawsuits down the kid just stood there his fist poised before the door as if he were frozen in the middle of knocking as molly watched the door began to open not on the hinges but vertically like a garage door molly pounded furiously on the window with the hilt of her sword the kid smiled a huge red tongue snaked out of the door wrapped around the kid and slurped him in rollerblades paper satchel and all molly screamed the door slammed shut molly watched stunned not knowing what to do a few seconds later the mouth opened and expectorated a soccerballsized wad of newspaper theo the hours of theos day had moved like slugs crawling on razor wire by four in the afternoon he felt as if hed been awake for a week and the cups of french roast hed been drinking had turned to foaming acid in his stomach mercifully there hadnt been a single call for a bar fight or domestic dispute so he had spent the entire day at the scene of the fuel truck explosion talking to firemen representatives from texaco oil and an arson investigator sent up from the san junipero fire department much to his surprise going all day without a hit from his sneaky pete pot pipe had not sent him into fits of anxiety as it usually did he was a little paranoid but he wasnt sure that that wasnt just an informed response to the world anyway at a quarter past four the arson investigator crossed the charred parking lot to where theo was leaning on the hood of his volvo the investigator was in his late twenties cleancut and carried himself like an athlete even in the orange toxic waste suit he carried a plastic space helmet under his arm like a tumorous football constable crowe i think thats about all i can do today itll be dark soon and as long as we keep the area closed off im sure everything will still be here in the morning whats your call so far well we generally look for evidence of accelerants gas kerosene paint thinnerand id say there were definitely some flammable liquids involved here he smiled a weary smile so you dont know what happened offhand id say a fuel truck blew up but without further investigation id hate to make a commitment at this time again the smile theo smiled back so no cause the driver probably didnt seal the hose correctly and a cloud of fumes got set off there wasnt much wind last night so the fumes would have just clung to the ground and built up anything could have set it off the driver could have been smoking the pilot lights at the hamburger place a spark in the truck exhaust right now id say it was totally accidental it was a companyowned store and it was turning a profit so there really isnt a financial motive for arson texaco will definitely be building your town a new burger stand and probably paying off some nuisance settlements from people claiming trauma duress and irritation i have the information on the driver theo said ill check to see if he was a smoker i asked him hes keeping quiet came a voice from a few yards away theo and the arson investigator looked up to see vance mcnally coming toward them holding up a ziploc bag full of white and gray powder ive got him right here the emt said you want to interrogate him very funny vance theo said theyre going to have to do the autopsy with a flour sifter vance said the investigator took the ziploc from vance and examined it you find any remains of a cigarette lighter anything like that not my job vance said the fire was so hot it turned the seat springs to liquid even incinerated the bones except for those little bits of calcium in there honestly this might not all be our boy we might be giving his wife a bag full of burntup truck parts to put in an urn on the mantel the investigator shrugged and handed the bag back to vance then to theo he said im going home ill come back tomorrow and look around some more as soon as i give the okay the oil company will send in a crew to drain the ground tanks thanks theo said the investigator left in a county car vance mcnally turned the ziploc bag of truck driver in the air theo this ever happens to me i want you to get all my friends together have a big party and snort me okay you have friends vance okay it was just an idea vance said he turned and carried his bag to the waiting ambulance theo sipped his coffee and noticed something moving in the charred brush beyond the texaco it looked as if someone was holding up a tv antenna and getting altogether too close to the yellow tape he had run around the perimeter jeez was he going to have to stay here all night guarding the scene he pried himself off the volvo and headed for the offender hey there theo called gabe fenton the biologist emerged from the brush indeed holding up some kind of antenna followed by his labrador retriever skinner the dog ran to meet theo and greeted him with two muddy paw prints on the chest theo rubbed skinners ears to hold him at bay the classic slobbering labrador control move gabe what in the hell are you doing down here the biologist was covered with burrs and foxtails his face striped with soot from the charred brush he looked exhausted yet there was a note of excitement bordering on ecstasy in his voice you wont believe this theo my rats moved en masse this morning theo tried but couldnt match gabes enthusiasm thats swell gabe texaco blew up last night gabe fenton looked around at the surrounding area as if seeing the destruction for the first time what time about four in the morning hmmm maybe they sensed it they the rats around am they all started moving west i cant figure out what caused it here look at the screen gabe had a laptop computer strapped into a harness around his waist he turned it so theo could see the screen each of these dots represents an animal i have implanted with a tracking chip heres their location at am he clicked a key and the screen drew a topographical map of the area green dots were scattered pretty much evenly along the creek bed and the business district of pine cove gabe hit another key now here they are at two all but a few of the dots had moved into the ranchland east of pine cove uhhuh theo said gabe was a nice guy spent too much time with vermin but he was a nice guy gabe needs to talk to humans occasionally theo thought well dont you see they all moved at once except for these ten over here that moved to the shore uhhuh theo said gabe the texaco blew up a guy was killed i was talking to firemen in space suits all day every paper in the county has called me the battery is almost out on my cell phone i havent eaten since yesterday and i only slept an hour last night help me find the significance in rat migration okay gabe looked crestfallen well i dont know the significance yet im tracking the ten that didnt move east hoping the anomalies will give a clue to the behavior of the larger group strange thing is four of the ten disappeared off my screen a little after two even if they were killed the chips should still transmit i need to find them and i wish you the best of luck but this area may still be dangerous you cant be here buddy maybe there were fumes gabe said but that doesnt explain why they all moved in the same direction some even came through this area from the shore theo couldnt bear to express to gabe how little he cared you had any dinner gabe no ive been doing this since last night pizza gabe we need pizza and beer ill buy but i need to youre a single guy gabe you need pizza every eighteen hours or you cant function properly and i have a question to ask you about footprints but i want you to watch me drink a few beers before i ask so i can claim diminished capacity come gabe let me take you to the land of pizza and beer theo gestured to his volvo you can stick the antenna out the sunroof i guess i could take a break theo opened the passenger door and skinner leapt into the car leaving sooty paw prints on the seat your dog needs pizza its the humane thing to do okay gabe said i want to show you something over by the creek bed what a footprint or whats left of one ten minutes later they sat over frosty mugs of beer at pizza in the pines pine coves only pizza parlor theyd taken a window table so gabe could keep an eye on skinner who was bouncing up and down outside giving them an everchanging view of the street then the street with dog face ears akimbo then the street then the street with dog face again other than to order a beer gabe fenton hadnt said a word since theyd gone to the creek bed will he just keep doing that theo asked until we take him a slice of pizza yes amazing gabe shrugged hes a dog always the biologist one needs to keep the mind limber well what do you think i think that you obliterated most of what you thought was a footprint gabe it was a footprint a talon or something there are a thousand explanations for a depression in the mud like that theo but one of them is not an animal track why not well for one there hasnt been anything that large on this continent for about sixty million years and for another animals tend to leave more than one track unless its a creature especially adapted for hopping gabe grinned the flying dog head pogoed by the windowsill there were a lot of people and vehicles around there the other tracks might have been wiped out theo dont let your imagination run away with you youve had a long day and and im a pothead i wasnt going to say that i know im saying it tell me about your rats what will you do when you find them well first im going to keep searching for the stimulus of their behavior then ill catch a few of the group that migrated and compare their brain chemistry to those that headed toward the shore does that hurt them you have to blend up their brains and run the liquid in a centrifuge i guess so then the waitress brought their pizza and gabe was severing cables of cheese from his first slice when theos cell phone rang the constable listened for a second then stood and dug into his pocket for money ive got to go gabe whats up the plotznik kid is missing no ones seen him since he left on his paper route this morning probably hiding that kid is evil he rigged up something with his remote control car that affected the chips in my rats once i spent three weeks trying to figure out why they were running figure eights in the parking lot outside the grocery story before i found him lurking in the weeds with the controller i know theo said mikey told me that if he wired ten of your rats together he could pick up the discovery channel i still have to find him he has parents skinner is a pretty good tracker want to take him thanks but i doubt that the kid had a pizza in his pocket theo folded his phone snagged a slice of pizza for the road and headed out the door ten val riordan leaned against her office door trying to catch her breath and maintain her temper nothing in her clinical experience compared to the sessions she held on the day after the texaco exploded she had seen twenty patients in ten hours and every one of them had wanted to talk about sex and not abstract sex either not issues or attitudes about sex just squishy thumping sex itself it was unnerving shed anticipated a spike in libido among her patients it was a common symptom of withdrawal from antidepressants but the books said not more than five to fifteen percent would have a reactionabout the same number that experienced a loss of libido upon taking the drugs but today shed hit one hundred percent it was as if she were running a kennel for hopeless horndogs rather than a psychiatric practice after the last patient shed come out of her office to find her new receptionist chloe furiously masturbating her feet hooked into the edge of the desk her steno chair squeaking like a tortured squirrel val had excused herself turned on her heel walked back into her office and shut the door chloe twentyone had maroon hair an entire wardrobe rendered in black and a sapphire nose ring val had begun treating the girl in her teens for bulimia then hired her when the volume of appointments skyrocketed after the placebo went into effect chloe worked in exchange for therapy val had thought it would be a good financial move frankly shed liked her better when she just threw up a lot val was still trying to figure out exactly what to do when there was a soft knock on the door yes sorry chloe said through the door uh chloe that is not appropriate office behavior well your last appointment had left i thought that you would be working on your notes or something for a while im really sorry thats it my last appointment leaves so let the wild rumpus begin am i fired val thought for a second there were twenty more patients to see tomorrow and twenty the day after that if the weirdness didnt kill her the workload would she couldnt afford to lose chloe now no youre not fired but please no more of that in the office do you have time to talk i know my next session isnt until next week but i really need to talk to you wouldnt you prefer to go home and uh think about things you mean finish no im finished for now thats what i want to talk to you about that wasnt the first time today val gulped it was highly unprofessional to talk to a patient through a door she steeled herself and opened it come in she returned to her desk without looking at the girl chloe took a seat across from her so this wasnt the first time today val was the psychotherapist now not the boss if shed been the boss she would have come over the desk and strangled the little slut no i cant seem to get enough i well it started about two in the morning and i went straight though until time to get ready for work then once or twice while each patient was in session vals jaw dropped sixteen hours of intermittent masturbation the other patients she had seen had cited two in the morning as when their sexual adventures had started too she said and how do you feel about that i feel okay my wrist hurts a little do you think i could have carpal tunnel chloe if you think that youre going to file a workmens compensation claim for this no no no i just want to stop did something happen to set this off something at two in the morning a dream perhaps her other patients had described various sexual dreams winston krauss the pharmacist with the sexual obsession for marine mammals confessed to dreaming of having sex with a blue whale riding it through the depths like ahab with a hardon upon awakening hed abused his inflatable flipper until it would no longer hold air chloe shifted uncomfortably in her chair her long maroon hair hid her face i dreamed i was having sex with a tank truck and it blew up a tank truck i came sexual dreams are completely normal chloe right a tank truck thats normal tell me was there fire in your dream pyromaniacs derived sexual pleasure from setting and watching fires thats how they caught them look in the crowd for a grinning guy with a woody and gas stains on his shoes no no fire i woke up at the explosion val whats wrong with me all i want to do is you know do it and you feel that you might do something impulsive chloe put on her cynical gothgirl face if you mean something like buffing the muffin while im at work yes dr riordan im a little worried cant you adjust my medication or something there it was in the past that would have been the answer increase the prozac to eighty milligrams about four times the dose for the average depressed patient and let the side effect of reduced libido do the work val had used the method to treat a nymphomaniac when she was an intern and it had worked marvelously but what now duct tape oven mitts to her receptionists hands although her typing probably wouldnt suffer much it might make the patients nervous val said chloe masturbation is a natural thing everyone does it but obviously there are appropriate times and places perhaps you should just cut back allow yourself to masturbate as a reward for controlling your urges chloes face went slack cut down im worried about driving home safely i have a stick shift i need both hands to drive but i dont think im going to have them do you have a patch you can prescribe like they do for smoking a patch val suppressed a laugh she imagined a twitching moaning line of people around the block at the pharmacy there to pick up their prescriptions for the orgasm patch it would make heroin look like gummi bears no theres no patch chloe youre just going to have to try to control yourself i have a feeling that this is a side effect of your medication it should pass in a day or two i want to hear more about this dream of yours well talk tomorrow okay chloe stood obviously not satisfied with the help her therapist was offering which was none ill try she left the office closing the door behind her val let her head fall to the desk jesus joseph and mary why didnt i go into pathology she thought it would be so peaceful sitting around boiling up beakers of urine and culturing bugs no wackos no stress okay occasionally youd be exposed to some deadly anthrax spores but at least other peoples sex lives stay in the bedroom and the tabloids where they belong her appointment with martin and lisbeth luder rose in her head they were in their seventies had been in counseling because they hadnt had a decent conversation since and today they had come in and dumped a half hour of explicit sexual narrative on her an account of perversions theyd indulged in the night before starting at around am the visual conjured in vals mindall that parched wrinkled flesh in furious frictionculminated in flames as if some giant cosmic boy scout had decided to rub two old people together to make a fire the worst of it the absolute worst of it is that shed found herself getting turned on while listening shed had to change her panties between appointments four times today she considered pouring herself a hefty tumbler of brandy and settling down in front of the television but that wasnt going to do it batteries she needed four ccell batteries and she needed them now then it was time to dig through her lingerie drawers and find a longforgotten friendand hope that it still worked molly long past dark and molly was still staring though the gap in the curtains at the trailer that ate the kid the problem with being nuts she thought is that you dont always feel as if youre nuts sometimes in fact you feel perfectly sane and there just happens to be a trailershaped dragon crouching in the lot next door not that she was ready to go out and proclaim that fact to anyone because no matter how sane you feel some stuff just sounds too crazy so she watched still wearing her warrior babe outfit hoping someone else would come along and notice around eight someone did she saw theophilus crowe going from door to door in the park he came into view two trailers down at the morales home spoke briefly with mr morales at the door then headed for the dragon trailer molly was torn she liked theo yes hed taken her to county once or twice but hed always been kind to herwarned her about the guy in the day room who cheated at parcheesi by eating the marbles and he never spoke to her like she was a crazy woman theo was a fan as theo was raising his black mag lite to tap on the dragon trailers door molly saw the two windows on the end slowly open revealing the catseye pupils theo obviously didnt see them he was looking at his shoes she threw up the aluminum sash and shouted theyre not home the constable turned toward molly just a second she said she bolted out the door of her trailer and stopped by the street where theo could see her they arent home come here a second she repeated theo tucked his mag lite into his belt molly how are you fine fine fine i need to talk to you okay over here okay she didnt want to tell him why what if the eyes werent there what if it was just a trailer shed be on her way to county in a heartbeat theyre not home then theo said pointing over his shoulder to the dragon trailer he was staring at her now at the same time trying not to stare he had a goofy grin on his face the same sort molly had seen on the kid right before he got slurped nope gone all day whats with the sword oh shit she forgot shed grabbed the sword on the way out i was just making some stirfry chopping up some veggies that ought to do it broccoli stems she said as if that explained everything he was looking at the leather bikini and she watched his eyes stop on the scar above her breast then look away she covered the scar with her hand one of my old kendra costumes everything else is in the dryer sure hey you dont get the times do you nope why the kid that delivers it mikey plotznik left for his route this morning and no one has seen him since looks like the last paper he delivered was a few doors down you didnt happen to see him did you about ten blond kid rollerblades kinda evil thats him nope havent seen him she watched the eyes of the dragon trailer close behind theo and took a deep breath you seem a little tense molly you okay fine fine just wanted to get back to my stirfry you hungry did val riordan get hold of you yep she called im not nuts of course not id like you to keep an eye out for this kid molly one of his buddies fessed up that mikey had a little bit of an obsession with you me no kidding he might be creeping around your trailer really if you see him give me a call would you his folks are worried about him ill do that thanks and ask your neighbors when they get home would you you betcha molly realized he was stalling just staring at her with that goofy grin on his face they just moved in i dont know them very well but ill ask thanks he said still just standing there like a twelveyearold ready to make an assault on the wallflowers at his first dance id better go theo i have broccoli in the dryer no she had wanted to say she had to get back to dinner or to her laundry not both okay see ya she ran into her trailer slammed the door and leaned against it through the window she could see the dragon trailer open an eye and close it quickly she could have sworn it was winking at her theo a niggling voice in theos head told him that finding the crazy lady attractiveextremely attractivewas an indicator that he was less than sane himself on the other hand he didnt feel that bad about it he didnt feel bad about anything not since hed walked into the trailer park anyway he had to deal with an explosion a lost kid the recent increase in general nuttiness in towna virtual shit storm of responsibilitybut he didnt feel all that bad and in that moment outside of mollys trailer reflecting and waiting for the tide of lust to ebb he realized that he hadnt smoked any pot all day strange normally this long without nursing from his sneaky pete and his skin would be crawling he was heading back to his volvo to resume the search for the lost boy when his cell phone rang sheriff john burton didnt say hello get to a land line burton said im in the middle of trying to find a lost kid theo replied a land line now crowe my private line you have five minutes theo drove to a pay phone outside the head of the slug saloon and checked his watch when fifteen minutes had passed he dialed burtons number i said five minutes yes you did theo smiled to himself in spite of burtons tone which was on the verge of screaming no one goes on the ranch crowe the lost kid is not on the ranch do you hear me its standard procedure to search all the ranchland emergency services has the area gridded out we have to cover the whole grid i was going to call in some deputies to help us the volunteer fire guys are exhausted from the explosion this morning no none of my guys dont call the highway patrol or the ccc either and no aircraft if the grid on the ranch has to be checked off then check it off no one goes on that land is that clear and what if the kid actually is on the ranch youre talking about a thousand acres of pasture and forest that wont be searched oh bullshit the kid is probably in a tree house somewhere with a stack of playboys hes only been missing for what twelve hours what if hes not there was silence on the line for a moment theo waited watching three new couples leave the head of the slug in less than a minute new couples in pine cove everyone knew who everyone else was dating and these were people who didnt go together not that unusual a phenomenon perhaps on a friday night at am but this was wednesday and it was barely eight oclock maybe he wasnt the only one feeling a wave of horniness the couples were groping each other as if trying to get all the foreplay out of the way before they reached the car burton came back on the line ill see that the ranchland is searched and call you if they find the kid but i want to be the first to know if you find him that it find that little fucker crowe burton hung up theo got into his volvo and drove to his cabin at the edge of the ranch there were at least twenty citizen volunteers searching for mikey plotznik the effort could spare him long enough to catch a shower and change his smokesaturated clothes as he parked the volvo an expensive trickedout red pickup truck pulled into the ranch entrance and rolled slowly by as they passed a hispanic man sitting in the bed laughed and saluted theo with the barrel of an ak assault rifle theo looked away and walked to the dark cabin wishing that there was someone there waiting for him eleven catfish catfish awoke to find a paintspattered woman padding about the house in nothing but a pair of wool socks in which she had stuck several sable brushes that delivered ochre olive and titanium white strokes to her calves whenever she moved canvases were propped on easels chairs counters and windowsillsseascapes every one estelle moved from canvas to canvas palette in hand furiously painting details in the waves and beaches yall woke up inspired catfish said it was past dusk they had slept away the daylight estelle painted by the light of fifty candles and the orange glow that washed from the open doors of the wood stove color correctness be damned these paintings should be viewed by fire estelle stopped painting and raised her brush arm to cover her breasts they werent finished i knew something was missing when i painted them but i didnt know what until now catfish cinched his pants around his waist and walked shirtless among the paintings the waves writhed with tail and scale and teeth and talon predator eyes shone out of the canvases brighter it seemed than the candles that lit them you done painted that old girl in all of em its not a girl its male how you know that i know estelle turned and went back to her painting i feel it how you know it look like that it does doesnt it it looks like this catfish scratched the stubble on his chin and pondered the

they sat there at the table for a while holding hands catfish let his coffee go cold in the cup estelle ran the story around in her head both relieved and fearful that the shadows in her paintings now had a shape somehow as fantastic as it was catfishs story seemed familiar she said catfish did you ever read the old man and the sea by ernest hemingway he that boy write about bullfights and fishing i met him once down florida way why you met him yeah that sumbitch didnt believe that story neither said he like to fish but he dont believe me why you ask never mind estelle said if this thing eats

me and if i lose this gig cause they thinkin im crazy i have to be movin on then you understand estelle took catfishs cup from the table and placed it in the sink youd better get ready to go play twelve molly to distract herself from the dragon next door molly had put on her sweats and started to clean her trailer she got as far as filling three black trash bags with junk food jetsam and was getting ready to vacuum up the collection of sow bug corpses that dotted her carpet when she made the mistake of windexing the television outland steel kendras revenge was playing on the vcr and when the droplets of windex hit the screen they magnified the phosphorescent dots making the picture look like an impressionist painting seurats sunday afternoon on the island of le grande warrior babe perhaps molly froze the frame on the gratuitous shower scene there was always a shower scene in the first five minutes of her films despite the fact that kendra lived on a planet almost completely devoid of water to address this problem one young director had gotten the bright idea of using antiradioactive foam in the shower scene and molly had spent five hours with whipped ivory snow suds being blown on to her by an offscreen shopvac she ended up playing the rest of the film in a bedouin burnoose to cover the rash that developed all over her body art film molly said sitting on the floor in front of the tv dowsing it with windex for the fiftieth time i could have been a model in paris in those days not a chance said the narrator he was still around too skinny they liked fat chicks back then im not talking to you youve used half a bottle of windex for this little trip to paris seems like cheap travel to me molly said even so she got up and took two glasses from the top of the tv she was taking them to the kitchen when the doorbell rang she opened the door with the rims of the glasses pinched in one hand outside two women in dresses and heels and lots of hair spray were standing on her steps they were both in their early thirties blonde and wore stiff smiles of either insincerity or drug use molly couldnt be sure which avon molly asked no the blonde in front said with a titter im marge whitfield this is katie marshall were from the coalition for a moral society wed like to talk to you about our campaign to reinstate school prayer i hope we havent caught you at a bad time katie was in pink marge in pastel blue im molly michon i was just cleaning up a little molly held up the two glasses come on in the two women stepped in and stood in the doorway as molly took the glasses to the sink you know its interesting molly said but if you put diet coke in one glass and regular coke in another and let them sit for oh say six months then come back there will be all sorts of green stuff growing on the regular coke but the diet coke will be as good as new molly returned to the living room can i get you two something to drink no thank you marge droned in robot response she and katie were staring at the paused image of a wet and naked molly on the television screen molly breezed by them and flipped off the television sorry an art film i made in paris when i was younger wont you sit down the women sat down next to each other on mollys tattered couch their knees pinched together so tight they could have crushed diamonds to powder i love your air freshener katie said trying to pull out of her terror it smells so clean thanks its windex what a cute idea marge said this was good molly thought normal people if i can hold myself together for normal people like these ill be okay this is good practice she sat down on the floor in front of them so your name is marge you dont hear that outside of detergent commercials anymore did your parents watch a lot of tv marge tittered its short for margaret of course my grandmothers name katie jumped in molly were very concerned that our childrens education is totally without any spiritual instruction the coalition is collecting signatures for reinstatement of prayer in school okay molly said youre new in town arent you why yes weve both moved here from los angeles with our husbands a small town is just a better place to raise children as im sure you know right molly said they had no idea who she was thats why i brought my little stevie here stevie was mollys goldfish who had died during one of her stays in county now he lived in a ziploc in her freezer and regarded her with a frosty gaze every time she retrieved some ice and how old is stevie uh seven or eight i forget sometimes it was a long labor hes a year behind my tiffany marge said well hes a little slow and your husband is dead im so sorry katie said no need you probably didnt kill him anyway katie said wed really like to have your signature to send to the state senate single mothers are an important part of our campaign and were also collecting donations for the campaign to have the constitution amended she put on an embarrassed smile gods work needs funding too i live in a trailer molly said we understand marge said finances are difficult for a single mother but your signature is just as important to gods work but i live in a trailer god hates trailers beg pardon he burns them up freezes them out tears them up with tornadoes god hates trailers are you sure i wouldnt be hurting your cause katie giggled oh mrs michon dont be silly just last week i read where a womans trailer was picked up by a tornado and dropped almost a mile away and she survived she said that she was praying the whole time and that god had saved her you see then who sent the tornado in the first place the two pastel women squirmed on the couch the blue one spoke first wed love to have you at our bible study group where we could discuss that but we have to be getting along would you mind signing the petition she pulled a clipboard out of her oversized purse and handed it over to molly with a pen so if this works kids will be able to pray in school why yes marge brightened so the muslim kids can turn to mecca seven times a day or whatever and it wont count against their grades the blue and pink pastel ladies looked at each other well america is a christian nation mrs michon molly didnt want them to think she was a pushover she was a smart woman but kids of other faiths can pray too right i suppose so katie said to themselves oh good molly said as she signed the petition because i know that stevie could move up to the red jets reading group if he could sacrifice a chicken to vigoth the worm god but the teacher wont let him why did i say that why did i say that what if they ask where stevie is mrs michon what hed do it at recess molly said its not like it would cut into study time we are working on behalf of the one true god mrs michon the coalition is not an interfaith organization im sure that if you had felt the power of his spirit you wouldnt talk that way oh ive felt it you have of course you can feel it too right now what do you mean molly handed the clipboard back to katie and stood up come next door with me itll only take a second i know youll feel it theo theos hopes of finding mikey plotznik rose as he drove through the residential areas of pine cove nearly every neighborhood had two or three people out searching with flashlights and cell phones theo stopped and took reports from each search party then made suggestions as if he had the slightest idea what he was doing who was he kidding he couldnt even find his car keys half the time most of pine coves neighborhoods were without sidewalks or streetlights the canopy of pine trees absorbed the moonlight and darkness drank up theos headlights like an ocean of ink he plugged his handheld spotlight in the lighter socket and swept it across the houses and into the vacant lots spotting nothing but a pair of mule deer eating someones rosebuds as he drove by the beach parka grass playground the size of a football field surrounded by cypress trees and blocked from the pacific wind by an eightfoot redwood fencehe spotted a flash of white moving on one of the picnic tables he pulled into the parking strip beside the park and pointed the volvos headlights as well as the spotlight at the table a couple was going at it right there on the table the flash of white had been the mans bare ass two faces turned into the light eyes as wide as the two deer theo had surprised earlier normally theo would have driven on he was used to finding people in the act in cars behind the head of the slug or parked along the more rugged strips of coastline he wasnt the sex police after all but tonight he was irritated by the scene it had been almost a whole day since hed had a hit from his sneaky pete maybe its a symptom of withdrawal he thought he turned off the volvo and got out taking his flashlight with him the couple scrambled into their clothes as he approached but didnt try to escape there was nowhere for them to go except over the fence where a narrow beach was bordered on both sides by cliffs and washed by treacherous freezing rip tides when he was halfway across the park theo recognized the fornicators and stopped the woman a girl really was betsy butler a waitress down at hps cafe she was struggling to pull down her skirt the man bald ing and slackchested was the newly widowed joseph leander theo flashed on the image of bess leander hanging from a peg in the spotless dining room a little discretions in order here you think joe theo shouted as he walked toward them uh its joseph constable theo felt his scalp go hot with anger he wasnt an angry man by nature but nature hadnt been working the last few days no its joseph when youre doing business or when youre grieving over your dead wife when youre boning a girl half your age on a picnic table in a public park its joe iwethings have been so difficult i dont know what came over usi mean me i mean i dont suppose youve seen a kid around here tonight a boy about ten the girl shook her head she was covering her face with one hand and staring into the grass at her feet joseph leanders gaze darted around the park as if a magic escape hatch would open up in the dark if he could only spot it no i havent seen a boy technically theo knew he could arrest them both on the spot for indecent exposure but he didnt want to take the time to process them into county justice go home joe alone your daughters shouldnt be by themselves right now betsy do you have a ride without uncovering her face she said i only live two blocks away go home now theo turned and walked back to the volvo no one had ever accused theo of being clever except for the time at a college party when he fashioned an emergency bong out of a twoliter coke bottle and a bic pen but he was feeling somewhat less than clever for not having investigated bess leanders death more carefully it was one thing to be hired because youre thought to be a fool its quite another to live up to the reputation tomorrow he thought first find the kid molly molly stood in the mud with the two pastel christian ladies looking at the dragon trailer can you feel it why whatever do you mean marge said thats just a dirty old trailerexcuse memobile home until a second ago she had only been concerned with her powderblue high heels sinking into the wet turf now she and her partner were staring at the dragon trailer wideeyed they could feel it molly could tell she could feel it too a lowgrade sense of contentment something vaguely sexual not quite joy but close youre feeling it the two women looked to each other trying to deny that they were feeling anything their eyes were glazed over as if theyd been drugged and they fidgeted as if suppressing giggles katie the pink one said maybe we should visit these people she took a tentative step toward the dragon trailer molly stepped in front of her theres no one there its just a feeling you two should probably go fill out your petition its late said powder blue maybe one more visit then we have to go no molly blocked their path this wasnt as fun as she thought it would be she had wanted to freak them out a little not harm them she had the distinct feeling that if they got any closer to the dragon trailer school prayer would be losing two wellgroomed votes you two need to get home she took each by a shoulder and led them back to the street then pushed them toward the entrance of the trailer park they looked longingly over their shoulders at the dragon trailer i feel the spirit moving in me katie marge said molly gave them another push right thats a good thing off you go and she was supposed to be the crazy one go go go molly said i have to get stevies dinner ready were sorry we missed meeting your little boy katie said where is he homework see ya bye molly watched the women walk out of the park and climb into a new chrysler minivan then she turned back to the dragon trailer for some reason she was no longer afraid youre hungry arent you stevie the dragon trailer shifted shape angles melting to curves windows going back to eyes but the glow wasnt as intense as it had been in the early dawn molly saw the burned gill trees the soot and blistered flesh between the scales soft blue lines of color flashed across the dragons flanks and faded molly felt her heart sink in sympathy this thing whatever it was was hurting molly took a few steps closer i have a feeling youre too old to be a stevie and the original stevie might be offended how about steve you look like a steve molly liked the name steve her agent at caa had been named steve steve was a good name for a reptile as opposed to stevie which was more of a frozen goldfish name she felt a wave of warmth run through her amid the sadness the monster liked his name you shouldnt have eaten that kid steve said nothing molly took another step forward still on guard you have to go away i cant help you im crazy you know i have the papers from the state to prove it the sea beast rolled over on his back like a submissive puppy and gave molly a pathetically helpless look no easy task for an animal capable of swallowing a volkswagen no molly said the sea beast whimpered no louder than a newborn kitten oh this is just swell molly said imagine the meds dr val is going to put me on when i tell her about this the vegetable and the lizard thats what theyll call us i hope youre happy peer pressure but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here im mad youre mad how do you know im mad said alice you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here lewis carrol alices adventures in wonderland thirteen breakfast somehow through the night the residents of pine cove especially those who had been withdrawing from antidepressants found a satisfied calm had fallen over them it wasnt that their anxiety was gone but rather that it ran off their backs like warm rain off a naked toddler who has just discovered the splash and magic of mud there was joy and sex and danger in the airand a euphoric need to share morning found many of them herding at the local restaurants for breakfast gathering together like wildebeests in the presence of a pride of lions knowing instinctively that only one of them is going to fall to the fang the one that is caught alone jenny masterson had been waiting tables at hps cafe for twelve years and she couldnt remember a day out of the tourist season when it had been so busy she moved between her tables like a dancer pouring coffee and decaf taking orders and delivering food catching the odd request for more butter or salsa and snatching up a dirty plate or glass on her way back to the window no movement wasted no customer ignored she was goodreally goodand sometimes that bugged the hell out of her jenny was just forty slender and fairskinned with killer legs and long auburn hair that she wore pinned up when she worked with her husband robert she owned brines bait tackle and fine wines but after three months of trying to work with the man she loved and after the birth of her daughter amanda who was five she returned to waitressing to save her marriage and her sanity somewhere between college and today she had become a bull moose waitress and she never ceased to wonder how in the hell that had happened how had she become the repository for local information bordering on gossip and how had she become so damn good at picking up her customers conversations and following them as she moved around the restaurant today the restaurant was full of talk about mikey plotznik who had disappeared along his paper route the day before there was talk of the search and speculation on the kids fate at a few of her twotops were seated couples who seemed intent on reliving their sexual adventures from the night before andif the pawing and fawning were any indicationwere going to resume again after breakfast jenny tried to tune them out there was a table of her oldguy coffee drinkers who were trading misinformation on politics and lawn care at the counter a couple of construction workers intent on putting in a rare saturdays work read the paper over bacon and eggs and over in the corner val riordan the local shrink was scribbling notes on a legal pad at a table all by herself that was unusual dr val didnt normally make appearances in pine cove during the day stranger than that estelle boyet the seascape painter was having her tea with a black gentleman who looked as if he would jump out of his skin at the slightest touch jenny heard some commotion coming from the register and turned to see her busgirl arguing with molly michon the crazy lady jenny made a beeline for the counter molly youre not supposed to be in here jenny said calmly but firmly molly had been eightysixed for life after she had attacked hps espresso machine i just need to cash this check i need to get some money to buy medicine for a sick friend the busgirl a freshman at pine cove high bolted into the kitchen tossing i told her over her shoulder as she went jenny looked at the check it was from the social security administration and it was above the amount she was allowed to accept im sorry molly i cant do it i have photo id molly pulled a videotape out of her enormous handbag and plopped it on the counter there was a picture of a halfnaked woman tied between two stakes on the cover the titles were in italian thats not it molly im not allowed to cash a check for that much look i dont want any trouble but if howard sees you in here hell call the police the police are here came a mans voice jenny looked up to see theophilus crowe towering behind molly hi theo jenny liked theo he reminded her of robert before he had quit drinkingsemitragic but goodnatured can i help here i really need to get some money molly said for medicine jenny shot a look to the corner where val riordan looked up from her notes with an expression of dread on her face the psychiatrist obviously didnt want to be brought into this theo took the check gently from molly and looked at it then said to jenny its a government check jenny im sure its good just this once medicine he winked at jenny from behind mollys back howard will kill me when he sees it every time he looks at the espresso machine he mutters something about spawn of evil ill back you up tell him it was in the interest of public safety oh okay youre lucky were busy today and i have the cash to spare jenny handed molly a pen just endorse it molly signed the check with a flourish and handed it over jenny counted out the bills on the counter thanks molly said then to theo thanks hey you want a collectors edition of warrior babes she held the videotape out to him uh no thanks molly i cant accept gratuities jenny craned her neck to look at the cover of the tape its in italian but you can figure it out molly said theo shook his head and smiled okay molly said gotta go she turned and walked out of the restaurant leaving theo staring at her back i guess she really was in movies jenny said did you see the picture on the cover nope theo said amazing did she look like that theo shrugged thanks for taking her check jenny ill find a seat just some coffee and an english muffin any luck finding the plotznik kid theo shook his head as he walked away gabe skinner barked once to warn the food guy that he was about to collide with the crazy woman but it came a little too late and as usual the dense but goodhearted food guy didnt get the message skinner had finally talked the food guy into stopping work and going to get something to eat catching rats and hiking around in the mud was fun but eating was important gabe covered with mud to the knees and burrs to the shoulder was head down digging in his backpack for his wallet as he approached hps cafe coming out molly was counting her money not looking at all where she was going she heard skinner bark just as they conked heads ouch excuse me gabe said rubbing his head i wasnt watching where i was going skinner took the opportunity to sniff mollys crotch nice dog molly said did he produce b movies in his last life sorry gabe grabbed skinner by the collar and pulled him away molly folded her money and stuffed it into the waistband of her tights hey youre the biologist huh thats me how many grams of protein in a sow bug what a sow bug you know rolypolies pill bugsgray lotsa legs designed to curl up and die yes i know what a sow bug is how many grams of protein in one i have no idea could you find out i suppose i could good molly said ill call you okay bye molly ruffled skinners ears as she walked off gabe stood there for a second distracted from his research for the first time in thirtysix hours what the hell skinner wagged his tail to say lets eat dr val val riordan watched the lanky constable coming through the restaurant toward her she wasnt ready to be official thats why shed taken herself out to breakfast in the first placethat and she didnt want to face her assistant chloe and her newfound nymphomania she was months no years behind on her professional journals and shed packed a briefcase full of them in hope of skimming a few over coffee before her appointments began she tried to hide behind a copy of pusher the american journal of clinical psychopharmacological practice but the constable just kept coming dr riordan do you have a minute i suppose she gestured to the chair across from her theo sat down and dove right in are you sure that bess leander never said anything about problems with her marriage fights joseph coming home late anything i told you before i cant talk about it theo took a dollar out of his pocket and slid it across the table take this why i want you to be my therapist i want the same patient confidentiality that youre giving bess leander even though that privilege isnt supposed to extend beyond the grave im hiring you as my therapist for a dollar im not a lawyer constable crowe i dont have to accept you as a patient and payment has nothing to do with it val was willing him to go away she had tried to bend people to her will since she was a child shed spoken to her therapist about it during her residency go away fine take me as a patient please im not taking any new patients one session thirty seconds long im your patient i promise youll want to hear what i have to say in session theo have you ever addressed well your substance abuse problem it was a snotty and unprofessional thing to say but crowe wasnt exactly being professional either does that mean im your patient sure okay thirty seconds last night i saw joseph leander engaging in sexual relations with a young woman in the park theo folded his hands and sat back your thoughts jenny couldnt believe shed heard it right she hadnt meant to she was just delivering an english muffin when the gossip bomb hit her unprepared bess leander not even cold in the grave and her straitlaced presbyterian husband was doing it with some bimbo in the park she paused as if checking her tables waited for a second then slid the muffin in front of theo can i bring you anything else not right now theo said jenny looked at val riordan and decided that whatever she needed right now was not on the menu val was sitting there wideeyed as if someone had slapped her with a dead mackerel jenny backed away from the table she couldnt wait for betsy to come in to relieve her for the lunch shift betsy always waited on joseph leander when he came in the cafe and made comments about him being the only guy with two children who had never been laid shed be blown away betsy of course already knew gabe gabe tied skinner up outside and entered the cafe to find all the tables occupied he spotted theophilus crowe sitting at a fourtop with a woman that he didnt know gabe debated inviting himself to their table then decided it would be better to approach theo under the pretense of a rat news update and hope for an invitation gabe pulled his laptop out of his shoulder bag as he approached the table theo you wont believe what i found out last night theo looked up hi gabe do you know val riordan shes our local psychiatrist gabe offered his hand to the woman and she took it without looking away from his muddy boots sorry gabe said ive been in the field all day nice to meet you gabes a biologist he has a lab up at the weather station gabe was feeling uncomfortable now the woman hadnt said a word she was attractive in a madeup sort of way but she seemed a little out of things stunned perhaps im sorry to interrupt we can talk later theo no sit down you dont mind do you val we can finish our session later i think i still have twenty seconds on the books thats fine val said seeming to come out of her haze maybe youll be interested in this gabe said he slipped into an empty chair and pushed his laptop in front of val look at this like many scientists gabe was oblivious to the fact that no one gave a rats ass about research unless it could be expressed in terms of dollars green dots val said no those are rats funny they look like green dots this is a topographical map of pine cove these are my tagged rats see the divergence these ten that didnt move the other night when the others did val looked to theo for an explanation gabe tracks rats with microchips in them theo said its only one of the things i do mostly i count dead things on the beach fascinating work val said with no attempt to hide her contempt yeah its great gabe said then to theo anyway these ten rats didnt move with the others right you told me this you thought they might be dead they werent at least the six of them that i found werent it wasnt death that stopped them it was sex what i livetrapped twenty of the group of rats that moved but when i went to find the group that hadnt i didnt have to trap them there were three pairs all engaged in coitus so what made the others move i dont know but the other ones were uh mating i watched one pair for an hour they did it a hundred and seventeen times in an hour rats can do that they can but they dont but you said they did its an anomaly but all three pairs were doing it one of the females had died and the male was still going at her when i found them theos face was becoming strained with the effort of trying to figure out what in the hell gabe was trying to tell him and why he was telling him in the first place what does that mean i have no idea gabe said i dont know why there was a mass evacuation of the large group and i dont know why the smaller group stayed in one place copulating well thanks for sharing food and sex gabe said maybe you should eat something gabe theo signaled for the waitress what do you mean food and sex val asked all behavior is related to obtaining food and sex gabe said how freudian no darwinian actually val leaned forward and gabe caught a whiff of her perfume she actually seemed interested now how can you say that behavior is much more complex than that you think so i know so and whatever this is this radio rat study of yours proves it she swiveled the screen of the laptop so they all could see it you have six rats that were engaged in sex but if i have this straight you have well a lot of rats that just took off for no reason at all right there was a reason i just dont know it yet but it wasnt food and it obviously wasnt sex i dont know yet i suppose they could have been exposed to television violence theo was sitting back and watching now enjoying two people with three decades of education between them puffing up like schoolyard bullies im a psychiatrist not a psychologist our discipline has moved more toward physiological causes for behavior over the last thirty years or hadnt you heard val riordan was actually grinning now im aware of that im having the brain chemistry worked up on animals from both groups to see if theres a neurochemical explanation how do you do that again theo asked you grind up their brains and analyze the chemicals gabe said thats got to hurt theo said val riordan laughed i only wish i could diagnose my patients that way some of them anyway val val riordan couldnt remember the last time shed enjoyed herself but she suspected it was when shed attended the neimanmarcus sale in san francisco two years ago food and sex indeed this guy was so naive but still she hadnt seen anyone so passionate about pure research since med school and it was nice to think about psychiatry in terms other than financial she found herself wondering how gabe fenton would look in a suit after a shower and a shave after hed been boiled to kill the parasites not bad she thought gabe said i cant seem to identify any outside stimulus for this behavior but i have to eliminate the possibility that its something chemical or environmental if its affecting the rats it might be affecting other species too ive seen some evidence of that val thought about the wave of horniness that seemed to have washed over all of her patients in the last two days could it be in the water do you think something that might affect us could be if its chemical it would take longer to affect a mammal as large as a human you two havent seen anything unusual in the last few days have you theo nearly spit his coffee out this towns a bughouse im not allowed to talk about my patients specifically val said she was shaken of course there was some weird behavior shed caused it hadnt she by taking fifteen hundred people off of their medication at once she had to get out of here but in general theo is right i am theo said he is gabe said jenny had returned to the table to fill their coffees sorry i overheard but id have to agree with theo too they all looked at her then at each other val checked her watch ive got to get to an appointment gabe id like to hear the results of the brain chemistry test you would yes val put some money on the table and theo picked it up and handed it back to her along with the dollar hed put there earlier for her fee i need to talk to you about that other matter val call me i dont know if i can help though bye val left the cafe actually looking forward to seeing her patients if for no other reason than to imagine grinding up each of their brains anything to address the responsibility of driving an entire town crazy but perhaps by driving them a little crazy she could save some of them from selfdestruction not a bad reason for going to work gabe ive got to go too theo said standing up gabe should i have the county test the water or something i have to go into san junipero to the county building today anyway not yet i can do a general toxins and heavy metals test i do them all the time for the frog population studies you wanna walk out with me i have to order something to go for skinner didnt you say that you had ten rats that diverged from the pack yes but i could only find six what happened to the other four i dont know they just disappeared funny these chips are nearly indestructible too even if the animals are dead i should be able to pick them up with the satellites out of range maybe not a chance the coverage is over two hundred miles more if i look for them then where did they go they last showed up down by the creek near the fly rod trailer court youre kidding thats where the plotznik kid was last seen you want to see the map no i believe you ive got to go theo turned to leave gabe caught him by the shoulder theo is uh what is val riordan single divorced do you think she likes me theo shook his head gabe i understand i spend too much time alone too what i was just asking ill see you hey theo you look uh well more alert today not stoned you mean sorry i didnt mean its okay gabe thanks i think hang tough jenny as jenny passed estelle boyets table she heard the old black gentleman say we dont need to tell nobody nothin been fifty years since i seen that thing it probably done gone back to the sea still estelle said theres a little boy missing what if the two are connected aint nobody ever called you a crazy nigger did they not that i can remember well they have me for some twenty years after i talked about that thing the last time i aint sayin nothin to no one its our secret girl i like it when you call me girl estelle said jenny went off to the kitchen trying to put the morning together in her mind pieces of conversations as surreal as a dali jigsaw puzzle there was definitely something going on in pine cove fourteen molly pine cove was a decorative townbuilt for showonly one degree more functional than a disneyland attraction and decidedly lacking in businesses and services that catered to residents rather than tourists the business district included ten art galleries five winetasting rooms twenty restaurants eleven gift and card shops and one hardware store the position of hardware clerk in pine cove was highly coveted by the towns retired male population for nowhere else could a man posture well past his prime pontificate and generally indulge in the arrogant selfimportant chestpounding of an alpha male without having a woman intercede to remind him that he was patently full of shit crossing the threshold of pine cove hardware and breaking the beam that rang the bell was tantamount to setting off a testosterone alarm and if theyd had their way the clerks would have constructed a device to atomize the corners with urine every time the bell tolled or at least thats the way it seemed to molly when she entered that saturday morning the clerks three men broke from their heated argument on the finer points of installing a wax toilet seal ring to stare snicker and make snide comments under their breath about the woman who had entered their domain molly breezed past the counter focusing on an aisle display of gopher poison to avoid eye contact raucous laughter erupted from the clerks when she turned down the aisle for roofing supplies the clerks frank bert and lesall semiretired balding paunchy and generally interchangeable except that frank wore a belt to hold up his double knits while the other two sported suspenders fashioned to look like yellow measuring tapeplanned to make molly beg oh theyd let her wander around for a while let her try to comprehend the arcane function of the gizmos geegaws and widgets binned and bubblewrapped around the store then she would have to come back to the counter and submit it was franks turn to do the condescending and he would do his best to dropkick her ego before finally leading the little lady to the appropriate product where he would continue to question her into full humiliation well is it a sheet metal screw or a wood screw threeeighths or sevensixteenths do you have a hex head screwdriver well then youll need one wont you are you sure you wouldnt rather just call someone to do this for you tears andor sniffles from the customer would signal victory and confirm superior status for the male race frank bert and les watched molly on the security monitor exchanged some comments about her breasts laughed nervously after five minutes passed without her surrender and tried to look busy when she emerged from the aisle carrying a fivegallon can of roofpatching tar a roll of fiberglass fabric and a longhandled squeegee molly stood at the counter shifting her weight from foot to foot bert and les squinted into a catalog set on a rotating stand while concentrating on sucking in their guts frank manned the register and pretended he was doing something complex on the keyboard when in fact he was just making it beep molly cleared her throat frank looked up as if hed just noticed she was there find everything you need i think so molly said taking both hands to lift the heavy can of tar onto the counter you need some resin for that fiberglass fabric les said and some hardener bert said frank snickered some what molly said you cant patch a trailer roof with that stuff miss you live down at the fly rod dont you they all knew who she was and where she lived she was often the subject of hardware store gossip and speculation even though shed never set foot in there before today im not going to patch a roof well you cant use that on a driveway you need asphalt sealer and it should be applied with a brush not a squeegee how much do i owe you molly said you should wear a respirator when you work with fiberglass you have one at home right bert asked yeah right next to the elves and the gnomes les said molly didnt flinch hes right frank said those fibers get down in your lungs and they could do you a world of harm especially with those lungs the clerks all laughed at the joke ive got a respirator out in the truck les said i could come by after work and give you a hand with your little project that would be great molly said what time les balked well i um ill pick up some beer molly smiled you guys should come along too i could really use the help oh i think les can handle it cant you les frank said as he hit the total key that comes to thirtyseven sixtyfive with tax molly counted her money out on the counter so ill see you tonight les swallowed hard and forced a smile you bet he said thanks then molly said brightly then she picked up her supplies and headed for the door as she broke the doorbell beam frank whispered crazy slut under his breath molly stopped turned slowly and winked once she was outside the clerks made miserable old white guy attempts at trading highfives while patting les on the back it was a hardware store fantasy fulfilledmuch better than just humiliating a woman les would get to humiliate her and get her naked as well for some reason theyd all been feeling a little randy lately thinking about sex almost as often as power tools my wife is going to kill me les said what she dont know wont hurt her the other two said in unison theo theo actually felt his stomach lurch when he went into his victory garden and clipped a handful of sticky buds from his pot plants they werent for himself this time but the reminder of how much this little patch of plants ruled his life made him ill and how was it that he hadnt felt the need to fire up his sneaky pete for three days a twentyyear drug habit suddenly ends no withdrawal no side effects no cravings the freedom was almost nauseating it was as if the weirdness fairy had landed in his life with a thump popped him on the head with a rubber chicken bit him on the shin then went off to inflict herself on the rest of pine cove he stuffed the marijuana into a plastic bag tucked it into his jacket pocket and climbed into the volvo for the fortymile drive to san junipero he was going to have to enter the bowels of the county justice building and face the spider to find out what he wanted to know the pot was grease for the spider he would stop by a convenience store on the way down and pick up a bag full of snacks to augment the bribe the spider was difficult arrogant and downright creepy but he was a cheap date through the safetyglass window theo could see the spider sitting in the middle of his web five computer screens with data scrolling across them illuminated the spider with an ominous blue glow the only other light in the room came from tiny red and green power indicator lights that shone through the darkness like crippled stars without looking away from his screens the spider buzzed theo in crowe the spider said not looking up lieutenant theo said call me nailgun the spider said his name was irving nailsworth and his official position in the san junipero sheriffs department was chief technical officer he was fivefootfive inches tall weighed three hundred and thirty pounds and had taken to wearing a black beret when he perched in his web early on nailsworth had seen that nerds would rule the world and he had staked out his own little information fiefdom in the basement of the county jail nothing happened without the spider knowing about it he monitored and controlled all the information that moved about the county and before anyone recognized what sort of power that afforded he had made himself indispensable to the system he had never arrested a suspect touched a firearm or set foot in a patrol car yet he was the thirdhighestranking officer on the force besides a taste for raw data the spider had weaknesses for junk food internet porn and highquality marijuana the latter was theos key to the spiders lair he put the plastic baggie on the keyboard in front of nailsworth still without looking at theo the spider opened the bag and sniffed pinched a bud between his fingers then folded the bag up and stuffed it into his shirt pocket nice he said what do you need he peeled the marshmallow cap off a hostess sno ball shoved it into his mouth then threw the cake into a wastebasket at his feet theo set the bag of snacks down next to the wastebasket i need the autopsy report on bess leander the nailgun nodded no easy task for a man with no discernible neck and theo wasnt sure what questions to ask nailsworth seldom volunteered information you had to ask the right question it was like talking to a rotund sphinx i was wondering if you could come up with something that might help me find mikey plotznik theo knew he didnt have to explain the spider would know all about the missing kid the spider reached into the bag at his feet and pulled out a twinkie let me pull up the autopsy his fat fingers flew over the keyboard you need a printout that would be nice it doesnt show you as the investigating officer thats why i came to you the mes office wouldnt let me see the report says here cause of death was cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation suicide yes she hung herself i dont think so i saw the body i know hanging in the dining room so what do you mean you dont think so the ligature marks on her neck were postmortem according to this neck wasnt broken so she didnt drop suddenly theo squinted at the screen trying to make sense of the data there were heel marks on the wall she had to have hung herself she was depressed taking zoloft for it not according to the toxicology what they ran the toxicology for antidepressants because you put it on the report but there was nothing it says suicide right there yes it does but the date doesnt corroborate the timing looks like she had a heart attack then she hung herself afterward so she was murdered you wanted to see the report it says cardiac arrest but ultimately cardiac arrest is what kills everyone catch a bullet in the head get hit by a car eat some poison the heart tends to stop eat some poison just an example crowe its not my field if i were you id check and see if she had a history of heart problems you said it wasnt your field its not the spider hit a key and a laser printer whirred in the darkness somewhere i dont have much on the kid i could give you the subscription list for his paper route theo realized that he had gotten all he was going to get on bess leander i have that how about giving me any known babyrapers in the area thats easy the spiders fingers danced over the keyboard you think the kid was snatched i dont know shit theo said the spider said no known pedophiles in pine cove you want the whole county why not the laser printer whirred and the spider pointed through the dark at the noise everything you want is back there thats all i can do for you thanks nailgun i appreciate it theo felt a chronic case of the creeps going up his spine he took a step into the dark and found the papers sitting in the tray of the laser printer then he stepped to the door you wanna buzz me out the spider swiveled in his chair and looked at theo for the first time theo could see his piggy eyes shining out of deep craters you still live in that cabin by the beer bar ranch yep theo said eight years now never been on the ranch though have you no theo cringed could the spider know about sheriff burtons hold over him good the spider said stay out of there and theo yeah sheriff burton has been checking with me on everything that comes out of pine cove after the leander death and the truck blowing up he got very jumpy if you decide to pursue the leander thing stay lowkey theo was amazed the spider had actually volunteered information why was all he could say i like the herb you bring me the spider patted his shirt pocket theo smiled you wont tell burton you gave me the autopsy report why would i said the spider take care theo said the spider turned back to his screens and buzzed the door molly molly wasnt so sure that life as pine coves crazy lady wasnt harder than being a warrior babe of the outland things were pretty clear for a warrior babe you ran around halfnaked looking for food and fuel and occasionally kicked the snot out of some mutants there was no subterfuge or rumor you didnt have to guess whether or not the sand pirates approved of your behavior if they approved they staked you out and tortured you if they didnt they called you a bitch then they staked you out and tortured you they might release starving radioactive cockroaches on you or burn you with hot pokers they might even gangrape you in foreignrelease directorscuts only but you always knew where you stood with sand pirates and they never tittered molly had had all the tittering she could handle for the day at the pharmacy they had tittered four elderly women worked the counter at pine cove drug and gift while above them behind his glass window winston krauss the dolphinmolesting pharmacist lorded over them like a rooster over a barnyard full of hens it didnt seem to matter to winston that his four hens couldnt make change or answer the simplest question nor that they would retreat to the back room when anyone younger than thirty entered the pharmacy lest they have to sell something embarrassing like condoms what mattered to winston was that his hens worked for minimum wage and treated him like a god he was behind glass tittering didnt bother him the hens started tittering when molly hit the door and broke titter only when she came to the counter with an entire case of economysized neosporin ointment are you sure dear they kept asking refusing to take mollys money perhaps we should ask winston this seems like an awful lot winston had disappeared among the shelves of fauxantidepressants when molly entered the store he wondered if he should have ordered some fauxantipsychotics as well val riordan hadnt said look molly finally said im nuts you know it i know it winston knows it but in america it is your right to be nuts i get a check from the state every month because im nuts the state gives me money so i can buy whatever i need to continue being nuts and right now i need this case of ointment so ring it up so i can go be nuts somewhere else okay the hens huddled and tittered or do i need to buy a case of those huge fluorescent orange prelubricated condoms with the deelybobbers on the tip and blow them up in your card section you never have to get this tough with sand pirates molly thought the hens broke their huddle and looked up in terror i hear theyre like thousands of tiny fingers urging you to let go molly added between the four of them it only took ten minutes more to ring up mollys order and figure her change within the nearest dollar as molly was leaving she turned and said in the outland you would have all been made into jerky a long time ago fifteen steve getting blown up had put the sea beast in a deep blue funk sometimes when he felt this way he would swim to the edge of a coral reef and lie there in the sand while neon cleaner fish nipped at the parasites and algae on his scales his flanks flashed a truce of color to let the little fish know that they were safe as they darted in and out of his mouth grabbing bits of food and grunge like tiny dental hygienists in turn they emanated an electromagnetic message that translated roughly to i wont be a minute sorry to bother you please dont eat me he was getting a similar message from the warmblood that was ministering to his burns and he flashed the truce of color along his sides to confirm that he understood he couldnt pick up the intentions of all warmbloods but this one was wired differently he could sense that she meant him no harm and was even going to bring him food he understood that when she made the steve sound she was talking to him steve molly said stop making those colors do you want the neighbors to see its broad daylight she was on a stepladder with a paintbrush to the casual observer she was painting her neighbors trailer in fact she was applying great gobs of neosporin oint ment to the sea beasts back youll heal faster with this stuff on you and it doesnt sting after she had covered the charred parts of the trailer with ointment she draped fiberglass fabric on as bandages and began ladling roofpatching tar over the fabric several of her neighbors looked out their windows dismissed her actions as more eccentricities of a crazy woman then went back to their afternoon game shows molly was spreading the roofing tar over the fiberglass bandages with a squeegee when she heard a vehicle pull up in front of her trailer les the hardware guy got out of the truck adjusted his suspenders and headed toward her looking a little nervous but resolved a light dew of sweat shone on his bald head despite the autumn chill in the air little lady what are you doing i thought you were going to wait for me to help you molly came down from her ladder and stood with the squeegee at port arms while it dripped black goo i wanted to get going on this before dark thanks for coming she smiled sweetlya leftover movie star smile les escaped the smile to hardware land i cant even tell what youre trying to do here but whatever it is it looks like you mucked it up pretty bad already no come here and look at this les moved cautiously to mollys side and looked up at the trailer what the hell is this thing made of anyway up close it looks like plastic or something maybe you should look at it from the inside molly said the damage is more obvious in there the hardware clerk leered molly felt him trying to stare through her sweatshirt well if thats what you think lets go inside and have a look he started toward the door of the trailer molly grabbed his shoulder wait a second where are the keys to your truck i leave em in it why this town is safe no reason just wondering molly dazzled him with another smile why dont you go on in ill be in as soon as i get some of this tar off of my hands sure thing missy les said he toddled toward the front door like a man badly in need of a rest room molly backed away toward less truck when the hardware clerk laid a hand on the door handle molly called steve lunch my name isnt steve les said no molly said youre the other one les you mean no lunch molly gave him one last smile steve recognized the sound of his name and felt the thought around the word lunch les felt something wet wrap around his legs and opened his mouth to scream just as the tip of the serpents tongue wrapped his face cutting off his air the last thing he saw was the bare breasts of the fallen scream queen molly michon as she lifted her sweatshirt to give him a farewell flash before he was slurped into the waiting maw of the sea beast molly heard the bones crunch and cringed boy sometimes it just pays to be a nutcase she thought that sort of thing might bother a sane person one of the windows in the front of the dragon trailer closed slowly and opened a function of the sea beast pushing his meal down his throat but molly took it for a wink estelle dr vals office had always represented a little island of sanity to estelle a sophisticated status quo always clean calm orderly and well appointed like many artists estelle lived in an atmosphere of chaotic funk taken by observers to be artistic charm but in fact no more than a civilized way of dealing with the relative poverty and uncertainly of cannibalizing ones imagination for money if you had to spill your guts to someone it was nice to do it in a place that wasnt spattered with paint and covered with canvases that beckoned to be finished dr vals office was an escape a pause a comfort but not today after being sent in to the inner office before she even sat down in one of the leather guest chairs estelle said your assistant is wearing oven mitts did you know that valerie riordan for once with a few hairs out of place rubbed her temples looked at her desk blotter and said i know she has a skin condition but theyre taped on with duct tape its a very bad skin condition how are you today estelle looked back toward the door poor thing she seemed out of breath when i came in has she seen a doctor chloe will be fine estelle her typing skills may even improve estelle sensed that dr val was not having a good day and decided to let the assistant in oven mitts pass thanks for seeing me on such short notice i know its been a while since weve had a session but i really felt i need to talk to someone my life has gotten a little weird lately theres a lot of that going around dr val said doodling on a legal pad as she spoke whats up ive met a man dr val looked up for the first time you have hes a musician a bluesman hes been playing at the slug i met him there weve been well hes been staying at my place for the last couple of days and how do you feel about that i like it i like him i havent been with a man since my husband died i thought i would feel like well like i was betraying him but i dont i feel great hes funny and he has this sense of i dont know wisdom like hes seen it all but he hasnt become cynical he seems sort of bemused by the hardships in life not at all like most people but what about you i think i love him does he love you i think so but he says hes going to leave thats whats bothering me i finally got used to being alone and now that i found someone hes going to leave me because hes afraid of a sea monster valerie riordan dropped her pen and slumped in her chaira very unprofessional move estelle thought excuse me val said a sea monster we were at the beach the other night and something came up out of the water something big we ran for the car and later catfish told me that he was once chased by a sea monster down in the delta and that it had come back to get him he says he doesnt want other people to get hurt but i think hes just afraid he thinks the monster will come back as long as hes on the coast hes trying to get a gig in iowa as far from the coast as he can get do you think hes just afraid to commit i read a lot about that in the womens magazines a sea monster is that a metaphor for something some blues term that im not getting no i think its a reptile at least the way he describes it i didnt get a good look at it it ate his best friend when he was a young man i think hes running away from the guilt what do you think estelle theres no such thing as sea monsters catfish said that no one would believe me catfish thats his name my bluesman hes very sweet he has a sense of gallantry that you dont see much anymore i dont think its an act hes too old for that i didnt think i would ever feel this way again these are girl feelings not woman feelings i want to spend the rest of my life with him i want to have his grandchildren grandchildren sure hes had his days with the booze and the hos but i think hes ready to settle down the booze and the hos dr val seemed to have gone into some sort of fugue state working on a stunned psychiatrist autopilot where all she could do was parrot what estelle said back in the form of a question estelle needed more input than this do you think i should tell the authorities about the booze and the hos the sea monster that plotznik boy is missing you know dr val made a show of straightening her blouse and assuming a controlled staid professional posture estelle i think we may need to adjust your medication i havent been taking it but i feel fine catfish says that if prozac had been invented a hundred years ago there wouldnt have been any blues at all just a lot of happy people with no soul i tend to agree with him the antidepressants served their purpose for me after joe died but im not sure i need them now i even feel like i could get some painting doneif i can find some time away from sex dr val winced i was thinking of something besides antidepressants estelle you obviously are dealing with some serious changes right now im not sure how to proceed do you think that mr uh catfish would mind coming to a session with you that might be tough he doesnt like your mojo my mojo not your mojo in particular just psychiatrists mojo in general he spent a little time in a mental hospital in mississippi after the monster ate his friend he didnt care for the staffs mojo estelle realized that her vocabulary even her way of thinking had changed over the last few days the result of immersion in catfishs blues world the doctor was rubbing her temples again estelle lets make another appointment for tomorrow or the next day tell chloe to add it on at the end of the day if im booked up and try to bring your gentleman along with you in the meantime assure him that my practice is mojofree would you estelle stood can that little girl write with those oven mitts on shell manage so what should i do i dont want him to go but i feel like ive lost a part of myself by falling in love im happy but i dont know who i am anymore im worried estelle realized that she was starting to whine and looked at her shoes ashamed thats our time estelle lets save this for our next appointment right should i tell the constable about the sea monster lets hold off on that for now these things have a way of taking care of themselves thanks dr val ill see you tomorrow goodbye estelle estelle left the office and stopped at chloes desk outside the girl was gone but there were animal noises coming from the bathroom just down the hall perhaps she had caught one of the oven mitts on her nose ring poor thing estelle went to the bathroom door and knocked lightly are you okay in there dear do you need some help the answer came back in high moan im fine really fine thanks oh my god youre sure no thats all right im supposed to make an appointment for tomorrow or the next day the doctor said to pencil it in late if you have to estelle could hear thumping noises coming from the bathroom and it sounded as if the medicine cabinet had dumped oh wow wow oh wow the scheduling must really have been tight im sorry i wont bother you anymore call me to confirm would you dear estelle left valerie riordans house even more unsettled than she had come in thinking that it had been quite some time half a day anyway since she had had her skinny bluesman between the sheets dr val val had a break between appointments time in which to reflect on her suspicion that by taking everyone in pine cove off antidepressants she had turned the town into a squirrels nest estelle boyet had always been a tad eccentric it was part of her artist persona but val had never seen this as unhealthy on the contrary the selfimage of an eccentric artist seemed to help estelle get over losing her husband but now the woman was raving about sea monsters and worse she was getting involved in a relationship with a man that could only be construed as selfdestructive could peoplerational adult peoplestill fall in love like that could they still feel like that val wanted to feel like that for the first time since her divorce it occurred to her that she actually wanted to be involved again with a man no not just involved in love she pulled her rolodex from the desk drawer and thumbed through it until she found the number of her psychiatrist in san junipero she had been in analysis all through med school and residency it was an integral part of the training of any psychiatrist but she hadnt seen her therapist in over five years maybe it was time what sort of cynicism had come over her that she was interpreting the desire to fall in love as a condition requiring treatment maybe her cynicism was the problem of course she couldnt tell him about what she had done to her patients but perhaps a red light blinked on the tiny led panel on her phone and the incoming call screened by chloe who had obviously taken a short break from her selfabuse scrolled across the screen constable crowe line one speaking of squirrels she picked up the phone dr riordan hi dr riordan this is theo crowe i just called to tell you that you were right thank you for calling constable have a nice day you were right about bess leander not taking the antidepressants i just got a look at the toxicology report there was no zoloft in her system val stopped breathing doctor are you there all her worries about the drugs this whole perverse plan all the extra sessions the long hours the guilt the friggin guilt and bess leander hadnt been taking her medication at all val felt sick to her stomach doctor theo said val forced herself to take a deep breath why i mean when its been over a month when did you find this out just today i wasnt given access to the autopsy report no one was im sorry it took so long well thank you for letting me know constable i appreciate it she prepared to ring off dr riordan dont you have to get a medical history on your patients before you prescribe anything yes why do you know if bess leander had any heart problems no physically she was a very healthy woman as far as i know why no reason theo said oh yeah i never got your thoughts on the information i shared at breakfast about joseph leander i was still wondering if you had any thoughts the whole world had flipflopped val had stonewalled up to now on bess leander because she had assumed that her own negligence had had something to do with besss death what now though really she didnt know much about bess at all she said what exactly do you want from me constable i just need to know did she suspect her husband of having an affair or give you any indication that she might be afraid of him are you saying what i think you are saying you dont think bess leander committed suicide im not saying that im just asking val searched her memory what had bess leander said about her husband i remember her saying that she felt he was uninvolved in their family life and that she had laid down the law to him laid down the law in what way she told him that because he refused to put the toilet seat down he was going to have to sit down to pee from now on thats it thats all i can remember joseph leander is a salesman he was gone a lot i think bess felt that he was somewhat of an intrusion on her and the girls lives it wasnt a healthy relationship as if there is such a thing val thought are you investigating joseph leander id rather not say theo said do you think i should be youre the policeman mr crowe i am oh right i am anyway thanks doctor by the way my friend gabe thought you were uh interesting i mean charming i mean he enjoyed talking with you he did dont tell him i said so of course goodbye constable val hung up and sat back in her chair she had unnecessarily put an entire town in emotional chaos committed a basketful of federal crimes as well as breaking nearly every ethical standard in her field and one of her patients had possibly been murdered but she felt well sort of excited charming she thought he found me charming i wonder if he really said charming or if theo was just making that upthe pothead charming she smiled and buzzed chloe to send in her next appointment sixteen mavis the phone behind the bar rang and mavis yanked it out of its cradle mount olympus goddess of sex speaking she said and there was a mechanical ratcheting noise as she cocked a hip while she listened no i havent seen himlike i would even tell you if he was here hell woman i have a sacred trust herei cant rat out every husband who comes in for a snort after work how would i know honey you want to keep this kind of thing from happening two words long nasty blowjobs yeah well if you were doing them instead of counting words then maybe you wouldnt lose your husband oh all right hold on mavis held her receiver to breast and shouted hey anyone seen les from the hardware store a few heads shook and a fusillade of nopes fired through the bar nope hes not here yeah if i see him ill be sure and tell him that there was a screeching harpy looking for him oh yeah well ive been done doggiestyle by the better business bureau and they liked it so say hi for me mavis slammed down the phone she felt like the tin man left out in the rain her metal parts felt rusty and she was sure that her plastic parts were going to mush ten oclock on a saturday live entertainment on the stage and she still hadnt sold enough liquor to cover the cost of her blues singer oh the bar was full but people were nursing their drinks making them last making googoo eyes at each other and slipping out couple by couple without dropping a sawbuck what in the hell had come over this town the blues singer was supposed to drive them to drink but the entire population seemed to be absolutely giddy with love they were talking instead of drinking wimps mavis spit into the bar sink in disgust and there was a pinging sound from a tiny spring that had dislodged somewhere inside of her wusses mavis threw back a shot of bushmills and glared at the couples sitting at the bar then glared at catfish who was finishing up a set on the stage his national steel guitar whining as he sang about losing his soul at the crossroads catfish told the story of the great robert johnson the haunting bluesman who had met the devil at the crossroads and bargained his soul for supernatural ability but was pursued throughout his life by a hellhound that had caught his scent at the gates of hell and finally took him home when a jealous husband slipped poison into johnsons liquor truth be catfish said into the microphone i done stood at midnight at every crossroad in the delta lookin to sell my soul but wasnt nobody buyin now that there is the blues but i gots me my own brand of hellhound surely i do thats sweet fish boy mavis shouted from behind the bar come over here i gotta talk to you scuse me folks theys a call from hell right now catfish said to the crowd with a grin but no one was listening he put his guitar in the stand and ambled over to mavis youre not loud enough mavis said turn up your hearing aid woman i aint got no pickup in that national theys only so high you can go into a mike or she feed back people are talking not drinking play louder and no love songs i gots me a fender stratocaster and a marshall amp in the car but i dont like playin lectric go get them plug in play loud i dont need you if you dont sell liquor this gonna be my last night anyway get the guitar mavis said molly molly slammed the truck into the dumpster behind the head of the slug saloon glass from the headlights tinkled to the tarmac and the fan raked across the radiator with a grating shriek it had been a few years since molly had done any driving and les had left out a few parts from the doityourself brake kit hed installed molly turned off the engine and set the parking brake then wiped the steering wheel and shift knob with the sleeve of her sweatshirt to remove any fingerprints she climbed out of the truck and tossed the keys into the mashed dumpster there was no music coming from the back door of the slug only the smell of stale beer and the low murmur of conversation she scampered out of the alley and started the fourblock walk home a low fog drifted over cypress street and molly was grateful for the cover there were only a few lights on in the parks trailers and she hurried past them to where her own windows flickered with the lonely blue of the unwatched television she looked past her house to the space where steve lay healing and noticed a figure outlined in the fog as she drew closer she could see that it was not one person but two standing not twenty feet from the dragon trailer her heart sank she expected the beams of police flashlights to swing through the fog any second but the figures were just standing there she crept around the edge of her trailer pressed so close that she could feel the cold coming off the aluminum skin through her sweatshirt a womans voice cut the fog lord we have heeded your call and come unto you forgive us our casual attire as our dry cleaner did close for the weekend and we are left sorely without outfits with matching accessories it was the school prayer ladies katie and marge although molly wouldnt be able to tell which was which they were wearing identical pink jogging suits with matching nikes as she watched the two women moved closer to steve and molly could see a rippling across the dragon trailer as our lord jesus did give his life for our sins so we come unto thee o lord to giveth of ourselves the end of the dragon trailer lost its angles to curves and molly could see steves broad head extending changing the door going from a vertical rectangle to a wide horizontal maw the women seemed unaffected by the change and continued to move slowly forward silhouetted now by steves jaws which were opening like a toothed cavern molly ran around her trailer and up the steps reached in and grabbed her broadsword which was leaned against the wall just inside the door and dashed back around the trailer and toward the sea beast marge and katie were almost inside of steves open mouth molly could see his enormous tongue snaking out the side of his mouth reaching behind the church ladies to drag them in no molly leapt from a full run slamming between marge and katie like a fullback leaping through blockers to the goal line and smacked steve on the nose with the flat of her sword she landed in his mouth and rolled clear to the ground just as his jaws snapped shut behind her she came up on one knee holding the sword pointed at steves nose no she said bad dragon steve turned his head quizzically as if wondering what she was so upset about change back molly said raising the sword as if to whack his nose again steves head and neck pulled back into the shape of a doublewide trailer molly looked back at the church ladies who seemed very concerned with having been knocked into the mud in their pink jogging suits but oblivious to the fact that they had almost been eaten are you two okay we felt the call one of them said either marge or katie while the other one nodded in agreement we had to come to give ourselves unto the lord their eyes were glazed over and they stared right past her to the trailer as they spoke you guys have to go home now arent your husbands worried about you or something we heard the call molly helped them to their feet and pointed them away from steve who made a faint whining noise as she pushed the church ladies away toward the street molly stopped them at the edge of the street and spoke to them from behind go home dont come back here okay we wanted to bring the children to feel the spirit too but it was so late and we have church tomorrow molly smacked the speaker across the butt with the flat of her sword a good twohanded stroke that sent her stumbling into the street go home molly was winding up to smack the other one when she turned and held up her hand as if refusing a refill on coffee no thank you then youre going and youre not coming back right the woman didnt seem sure molly turned her grip on the sword so the edge was poised to strike right yes the woman said her friend nodded in agreement as she rubbed her bottom now go molly said as the women walked away she called after them and stop dressing alike thats fucking weird she watched them until they disappeared into the fog then went back to where steve was waiting in trailer form well she threw out her hip frowned and tapped her foot as if waiting for his explanation his windows narrowed ashamed theyll be back you know then what he whimpered the sound coming from deep inside where the kitchen would be if he were really a trailer if youre still hungry you have to let me know i can help we can find you something although there is only one hardware store in town youre going to have to diversify your diet suddenly an electric guitar screamed out of the fog wailing like a tortured ghost of chicago blues the dragon trailer became the dragon again his white skin went black then flashed brilliant streaks of red anger the bandages molly had spent all day applying shredded with the abrupt shape change his gill trees hung with tatters of fiberglass fabric as if toiletpapered by mischievous boys the sea beast threw back his head and roared rattling the windows through the trailer park molly fell in the mud as she backed up then rolled and came up on her feet with the broadsword poised to thrust into the sea beasts throat steve i think you need to take a timeout young man theo such a short period of time to have so many new experiences in just the last few days he had coordinated his first major missing person search including talking to worried parents and the milk carton company whose people wanted to know if theo could get a picture of mikey plotznik where he wasnt making a contorted goofy face at the camera if they found a better picture mikey would end up with great exposure on the two percent or nonfat cartons but if they had to go with what they had he was going on the side of the buttermilk and would only be seen by old folks and people making ranch dressing theo had also had to deal with his first major fire the hallucination of giant animal tracks and opening a real live murder investigation all without the benefit of his lifelong chemical crutch not that he couldnt nurse at his favorite pipe hed just lost the desire to do so now he had to decide how to go about investigating bess leanders murder should he pull someone in for interrogation pull them in where his cabin he didnt have an office somehow he couldnt imagine holding an effective interrogation with the suspect in a beanbag chair under a hot lava lamp talk scumbag dont make me turn the black light on that jimi hendrix poster and light some incense you dont want that and amid all the other activity he felt a nagging compulsion to go back to the fly rod trailer court and talk to molly michon crazy thoughts finally he decided to drop by joseph leanders house hoping he might catch the salesman off guard as he pulled into the driveway he noticed that weeds had grown up around the garden gnomes and there was a patina of dust on the dutch hex sign over the front door the garage door was open and josephs minivan was parked inside theo paused at the front door before knocking and made sure that his ponytail was tucked into his collar and his collar was straight for some reason he felt as if he should be wearing a gun he had one a smith wesson revolver but it was on the top shelf of his closet next to his bong collection he rang the bell then waited a minute passed before joseph leander opened the door he was wearing paintspattered corduroys and an old cardigan sweater that looked like it had been pulled out of the trash a dozen times obviously not the sort of attire that bess leander would have allowed in her home constable crowe leander was not smiling what can i do for you if you have a minute id like to talk to you may i come in i suppose leander said he stepped away from the door and theo ducked in i just made some coffee would you like some no thanks im on duty cops are supposed to say that theo thought its coffee oh right sure milk and sugar please the living room had bare pine plank floors and rag rugs an antique pew bench took the place of a sofa two shaker chairs and a galvanized milk can with a padded cushion on the top provided the other seating three antique butter churns stood in the corners of the room but for a new thirtysixinch sony by the fireplace it could have been the living room of a seventeenthcentury family a family with very high cholesterol from all that butter joseph leander returned to the living room and handed theo a handthrown stoneware mug the coffee was the color of butterscotch and tasted of cinnamon thanks theo said new tv he nodded to the sony leander sat across from theo on the milk can yes i got it for the girls pbs and so forth bess never approved of television and so you killed her leander sprayed a mouthful of coffee on the rug what theo took a sip of his coffee while leander stared at him wideeyed maybe hed been a bit too abrupt fall back regroup so did you get cable reception is horrible in pine cove without cable its the hills i think leander blinked furiously and did a tripletake on theo what are you talking about i saw the coroners report on your wife joseph she didnt die from hanging youre insane you were there leander stood and took the mug out of theos hands i wont listen to this you can go now constable leander stepped back and waited theo stood he wasnt very good at confrontation he was a peace officer this was too hard he pushed himself was it the affair with betsy did bess catch you veins were beginning to show on leanders bald pate i just started seeing betsy i loved my wife and i resent you doing this to her memory youre not supposed to do this youre not even a real cop now get out of my house your wife was a good woman a little weird but good leander set the coffee mugs down on a butter churn went to the front door and pulled it open go he waved theo toward the door im going joseph but ill be back theo stepped outside leanders face had gone completely red no you wont oh i think i will theo said feeling very much like a second grader in a playground argument dont fuck with me crowe leander spat you have no idea what youre doing he slammed the door in theos face do too theo said seventeen molly molly had always wondered about american womens fascination with bad boys there seemed to be some sort of logicdefying attraction to the guy who rode a motorcycle and had a tattoo a gun in the glove compartment or a snifter of cocaine on the coffee table in her acting days shed even been involved with a couple of them herself but this was the first one who actually well ate people women always felt that they could reform a guy how else could you explain the numerous proposals of marriage received by captured serial killers that one was a bit too much even for molly and she took comfort in the fact that no matter how crazy she had gotten shed never been tempted to marry a guy who made a habit of strangling his dates american mothers programmed their daughters to believe that they could make everything better why else was she leading a hundredfoot monster down a creek bed in broad daylight fortunately the creek bed was lined in most places by a heavy growth of willow trees and as steve moved over the rocks his great body changed color and texture to match his surroundings until he looked like nothing more than a trick of the light like heat rising off blacktop molly made him stay under cover as they approached the cypress street bridge then waited until there was no traffic and signaled him to go steve slithered under the bridge like a snake down its hole his back knocking off great hunks of concrete and he passed through in less than an hour they were out of town into the ranchland that ran along the coast to the north and molly led steve up through the trees to the edge of a pasture there you go big guy molly said pointing to a herd of holsteins that were grazing a hundred yards away breakfast steve crouched at the edge of the forest like a cat ready to pounce his tail twitched splintering a cypress sapling in the process molly sat down beside him and cleaned mud from her sneakers with a stick as the cows slowly made their way toward them this is it she asked you just sit here and they come over to be eaten a girl could lose respect for you as a hunter watching this you know that theo theo found himself trying to figure out why exactly he was driving to molly michons place when his cell phone rang before he answered he reminded himself not to sound stoned when it occurred to him that he actually wasnt stoned and that was even more frightening crowe here he said crowe this is nailsworth down at county are you nuts theo stalled while he tried to remember who nailsworth was is this a survey what did you do with that data i gave you nailsworth said theo suddenly remembered that nailsworth was the spiders real name a second call was beeping on theos line nothing i mean i conducted an interview can you hold ive got another call no i cant hold i know youve got another call you didnt hear anything from me do you hear i gave you nothing understand kay theo said the spider hung up and theo connected to the other call crowe are you fucking nuts is this a survey theo said pretty sure that it wasnt a survey but also pretty sure that sheriff burton wouldnt be happy with a truthful answer to the question which was yes i probably am nuts i thought i told you to stay away from leander that case is closed and filed theo thought for a second it hadnt been five minutes since hed left joseph leanders house how could burton know already no one got through to the sheriff that quickly some suspicious evidence popped up theo said trying to figure out how he was going to cover for the spider if burton pressed i just stopped by to see if there was anything to it you fucking pothead if i tell you to let something lie you let it lie do you understand me im not talking about your job now crowe im talking about life as you know it i hear another word out of north county and you are going to be getting your dance card punched by every aidsridden convict in soledad leave leander alone but say yes sir you bag of shit yes sir you bag of shit theo said you are finished crowe you sorry sheriff batterys going theo disconnected and headed back to his cabin shaking as he drove molly in flesh eaters of the outland kendra was forced to watch while a new breed of mutants sprayed hapless villagers with a fleshdissolving enzyme then lapped up puddles of human protein with disgusting dubbed sucking sounds that the foley artists had obtained at sea world recording baby walruses being fed handfuls of shellfish the special effects guys simulated the carnage with large quantities of rubber cement paraffin body parts that conveniently melted under the mexican desert sun and transmission fluid instead of the usual karo syrup fake blood the sugary stage blood tended to attract blowflies and the director didnt want to get notice from the aspca for abuse overall the effect was so real that molly insisted that all of kendras reaction shots be done after the cleanup to avoid her gagging and going green on camera between the carrion scene and some salmonella tacos served up by the nogalesbased caterer as well as repeated propositions by an arab coproducer with halitosis that made her eyes water molly was sick for three days but none of it even the fetid falafel breath produced the nausea she was experiencing upon watching steve yack up four fully masticated partially digested holsteins molly added the contents of her own stomach three pop tarts and a diet coke to the four pulverized piles of beefy goo that steve had expelled onto the pasture lactose intolerant she wiped her mouth on her sleeve and glared at the sea beast you have no problem gulping down a paperboy and the closet perv from the hardware store but you cant eat dairy cows steve rolled onto his back and tried to look apologeticstreaks of purple played across his flanks purple being his embarrassment color viscous tears the size of softballs welled up in the corner of his giant cats eyes so i suppose youre still hungry steve rolled back onto his feet and the earth rumbled beneath him maybe we can find you a horse or something molly said stay close to the tree line using her broadsword as a walking stick she led him over the hill as they moved his colors changed to match the surroundings making it appear that molly was being followed by a mirage theo for some reason the words of karl marx kept running through theos mind as he dug the machete out of the tool shed behind his cabin religion is the opiate of the masses it follows then that opium is the religion of the addict theo thought which is why he was feeling the gutwrenching remorse of the excommunicated as he took the machete to the first of the thick fibrous stems in his marijuana patch the bushy green weeds fell like martyred saints with each swing of the machete and his hands picked up a film of sticky resin as he threw each plant onto a pile in the corner of the yard in five minutes his shirt was soaked with sweat and the pot patch looked like a miniature version of a clearcut forest devastation stumps he emptied a can of kerosene over the wastehigh pile of cannabis then pulled out his lighter and se the flame to a piece of paper throw off the chains of your oppressors marx had said these plants the habit that went with them were theos chains the boot that sheriff john burton had kept pressed to his neck these last eight years the threat that kept him from acting freely from doing the right thing he threw the burning paper and the flames of revolution whooshed over the pile there was no elation no rush of freedom as he backed away from the pyre instead of the triumph of revolution he felt a sense of sickening loss loneliness and guilt judas at the base of the cross no wonder communism had failed he went into the cabin retrieved the box from the shelf in the closet and was beating his bong collection into shrapnel with a ballpeen hammer when he heard automatic weapons fire coming from the ranch ignacio and miguel ignacio was lying in the shade just outside the metal shed smoking a cigarette while miguel labored away inside cooking the chemicals down into methamphetamine crystals beakers the size of basketballs boiled over electric burners the fumes routed through glass tubes to a vent in the wall miguel was short and wiry just thirty years old but the lines in his face and the grim expression he always wore made him look fifty ignacio was only twenty fat and full of machismo taken with his own success and toughness and convinced that he was on his way to being the new godfather of the mexican mafia they had crossed the border together six months ago smuggled in by a coyote to do exactly what they were doing and what a sweet deal it had turned out to be because the lab was protected by the big sheriff they were never raided they never had to move on a moments notice like the other labs in california or bolt across the border until things cooled off only six months and miguel had sent home enough money for his wife to buy a ranch in michoacán and ignacio was driving a flashy dodge fourwheel drive and wearing fivehundreddollar alligatorskin tony lama boots all of this for only eight hours of work a day for they were only one of three crews that kept the lab running twentyfour hours a day and there was no danger of being stopped on the road while transporting drugs because the big sheriff had a gringo in a little van come every few days to drop off supplies and take the drugs away put out that cigarette cabrone miguel shouted do you want to blow us up ignacio scoffed and flicked his cigarette into the pasture you worry too much miguel ignacio was tired of miguels whining he missed his family he worried about getting caught he didnt know if the mix was right when the older man wasnt working he was brooding and no amount of money or consoling seemed to satisfy him miguel appeared at the doorway and stood over ignacio do you feel that what ignacio reached for the ak that was leaning against the shed what miguel was staring across the pasture but seemed to be seeing nothing i dont know it is nothing you worry too much miguel started walking across the pasture toward the tree line i have to go over there watch my stove ignacio stood up and hitched his silverstudded belt up under his belly i dont how to watch the stove im the guard you stay and watch the stove miguel strode over the hill without looking back ignacio sat back down and pulled another cigarette from the pocket of his leather vest loco he mumbled under his breath as he lit up he smoked for several minutes dreaming and scheming about a time when he would run the whole operation but by the time he finished the cigarette he was starting to worry about his partner he stood to get a better look but couldnt see anything beyond the top of the hill over which miguel had disappeared miguel he called but there was no answer he glanced inside the shed to see that everything was in order and as far as he could tell it was then he picked up his assault rifle and started across the pasture before he got three steps he saw a white woman coming over the hill she had the face and body of a hot senorita but the wild grayblonde hair of an old woman and he wondered for the thousandth time what in the hell was wrong with american women were they all crazy he lowered the assault rifle but smiled as he did it hoping to warn the woman off without making her suspicious you stop he said in english no trespass he heard the cell phone ringing back in the shed and glanced back for a second the woman kept coming we met your friend molly said who is we ignacio asked his answer came over the hill behind the woman first looking like two burned scrub oak trees then the giant cats eyes holy mary mother of god ignacio said as he wrestled with the bolt on the assault rifle theo eight years of living at the edge of the ranch and never once had theo so much as taken a walk down the dirt road he had been under orders not to but now what hed seen the trucks going in and out over the years occasionally heard men shouting but somehow hed managed to ignore it all and there had never been gunfire going onto the ranch to investigate automatic weapons fire seemed an especially stupid way to exercise his newfound freedom but not investigating well that said something about him he wasnt willing to face was he in fact a coward the sound of a man screaming in the distance made the decision for him it wasnt the sound of someone blowing off steam it was a throatstripping scream of pure terror theo kicked the shards of his bong collection off the front steps and went back to the closet to get his pistol the smith wesson was wrapped in an oily cloth on the top shelf of his closet next to a box of shells he unwrapped it snapped open the cylinder and dropped in six cartridges fighting the shake that was moving from his hands to his entire body he dumped another six shells into his shirt pocket and headed out to the volvo he started the volvo then grabbed the radio mike to call for some backup a lot of good that would do response time from the sheriffs department could run as long as thirty minutes in pine cove which was one of the reasons there was a town constable in the first place and what would he say he was still under orders not to go onto the ranch he dropped the mike on the seat next to his gun put the volvo in gear and was starting to back out when a dodge minivan pulled in beside him joseph leander waved and smiled at him from the drivers seat theo put the volvo in park leander climbed out of his van and leaned into the passenger window and looked at the lying on the seat i need to talk to you he said you werent much for talking an hour ago i am now later im just going to check something out on the ranch thats perfect leander said shoving a small automatic pistol through the window into theos face well go together eighteen dr val the bust of hippocrates stared up at val riordan from the desk first do no harm yeah bite me said the psychiatrist throwing her versace scarf over the greeks face val was having a bad day the call from constable crowe revealing that her treatment or lack of it had not caused bess leanders suicide had thrown val into a quandary shed zombied her way through her morning appointments answering questions with questions pretending to take notes and not catching a word that anyone said to her five years ago there had been a flood of stories in the media about the dangers of prozac and similar antidepressants but those stories had been set off by sensational lawsuits against the drug companies and the followups the fact that not one jury found antidepressants to cause destructive behavior had been buried in the back pages one powerful religious group whose prophet was a hack science fiction writer and whose followers included masses of deluded movie stars and supermodels had fielded a media attack against antidepressants recommending instead that the depressed should just cheer up buck up and send in some gas money to keep the mother ship running the various professional journals had re ported no studies that proved that antidepressants increased the incidence of suicidal or violent behavior val had read the religious propaganda it had the endorsement of the rich and famous but she hadnt read the professional journals yes automatically treating her patients with antidepressants had been wrong but her attempt to atone by taking them all off the drugs was just as wrong now she had to deal with the fact that she might be hurting them val hit the speed dial button to the pharmacy winston krauss answered but his voice was muted as if he had an incredibly bad cold pine cobe drug and gibt winston you sound horrible i hab on my mask and snorkle oh winston val rubbed her eyes causing her contacts to slide back in her head somewhere not at the store im in the back room his voice became clear on the last word of the sentence there i took it off im glad you called ive been wanting to talk to you about killer whales pardon im attracted to orcas ive been watching a jacques cousteau tape about them winston can we cover this in session im worried i was especially turned on by the male one does that make me a homosexual jeez it didnt worry him that he was a wannabe whalehumper as long as he wasnt a gay wannabe whalehumper as a psychiatrist shed tried to drop terms like fullblown batshit from her vocabulary even in thought yet with winston she couldnt keep the term from rising lately val felt as if she was running the batshit concession on the cave floor it had to stop winston im putting everyone back on their ssris get rid of the placebos im going to put everyone on paxil to get their levels up as quickly as possible make sure to warn the ones who were on prozac that they absolutely cant miss a day like they used to ill move those who need it later you want me to take everyone off of the placebos do you know how much money we are making start today im going to call my patients i want you to give them credit for the unused placebos they still have i wont do it i almost have enough saved to spend a month at the cetacean research center on grand bahama you cant take that away from me winston i wont compromise my patients mental health so you can go on vacation and fuck flipper i said i wont do it you were the one who started this what about your patients mental health then i was wrong im not going to put everyone back on antidepressants either so youre going to lose some revenue there too some of them didnt need the drugs in the first place no val was shocked at the conviction in winstons voice his selfesteem problem no longer seemed an issue what a crappy time for him to be making progress so you want the town to know about your little problem you wont do that you have more to lose than i do valerie if you blow the whistle on me then ill tell the whole story to the papers ill get immunity and youll go to jail you bastard ill send my patients down to the thrifty mart in san junipero then you wont even have the legitimate sales no you wont things are going to stay just the way they are dr val winston hung up valerie riordan stared at the receiver for a second be fore replacing it in its cradle how how in the hell had she given control of her life over to someone like winston krauss more important how was she going to get it back without going to jail theo joseph leander had the automatic stuck against theos ribs hed thrown theos gun into the backseat leander was wearing a tweed jacket and wool dress slacks and a film of sweat was forming on his forehead the volvo bounced over a rut in the dirt road and theo felt the barrel of the automatic dig into his ribs he was trying to remember what you were supposed to do in such a situation but all he could remember from the cop shows that hed watched was never to give up your gun joseph could you pull that gun out of my ribs or put the safety on or something this is a pretty bumpy road id hate to lose a lung because i didnt get new shocks that sounded sufficiently glib he thought professionally calm now if he could just avoid wetting himself you couldnt leave it alone could you it would have just passed into history and no one would have noticed but you had to dig things up so you did kill her lets say i helped her make a decision that shed been waffling about she was the mother of your children right and she treated me with about as much respect as a turkey baster wow you lost me there partner they use them for artificial insemination crowe you fucking stoner one squirt and you throw them away you got tired of being a turkey baster so you hung your wife her herb garden killed her foxglove tea contains huge amount of digitalis stops the heart and its almost undetectable unless youre looking for it ironic isnt it i would have never known about any of that crap if she hadnt blathered on about it constantly theo was not at all happy that leander was telling him this it meant that he was going to have to make some sort of move to save himself or he was dead ram a tree maybe he checked leanders seat belt it was buckled what kind of criminal kidnaps someone and remembers to buckle his seat belt stall for now there were heel marks on the wall nice touches i thought i dont know she may have still been alive when i hung her up there they were coming out of the forest that surrounded the ranch into an open pasture theo could see a metal shed next to a doublewide house trailer a couple of hundred yards ahead a bright red dodge truck was parked by the shed hmmm leander said they got a new trailer for the boys pull up to the shed and park theo felt panic rise in his throat like acid and fought it down keep them talking and they wont shoot hadnt he heard that somewhere so you killed your wife for a bigscreen tv and a tumble with betsy divorce never occurred to you leander laughed and theo felt a chill run through his body you really are dense arent you crowe see that shed up there well i hauled twentyeight million dollars worth of methamphetamine out of that shed last year granted i only get a piece of that but its a nice piece i move it all im a salesman a family man innocuous and unnoticeable whod suspect me mr milquetoast your wife bess found out about it funny thing is she was following me because she suspected an affair but she never found out a thing about betsy and me she was going to turn me in i had no choice theo pulled up next to the shed and turned off the volvo you have a choice now joseph you dont have to do this im not doing anything but going back to my life until theres enough money in my offshore accounts to take off dont get me wrong crowe i didnt enjoy killing bess im not a killer hell ive never even taken any drugs this isnt crime its just a wellpaid delivery route so youre not going to shoot me theo really really wanted to believe that not if you do what i tell you to do get out of the car leave the keys slide over and come out on my side theo did as he was told and leander kept the pistol trained on him the whole time where did leander learn to do that hed hadnt had a television that long guy must have taken a mailorder course or something miguel ignacio come out here leander gestured with the pistol for theo to move toward the shack go inside theo ducked to get through the door and immediately saw rack upon rack of lab glass glass tubing and plastic barrels of chemicals a single metal chair sat in front of half a dozen electric burners that were filling the shed with a brutal heat sit down leander commanded as theo sat he felt the handcuffs being yanked out of his back pocket put your hands behind you theo did as he was told and leander threaded the handcuffs through two metal bars at the back of the chair and snapped them over theos wrists ive got to go find these guys leander said probably taking a siesta what was burton thinking when he put a house trailer down here ill be back in a second then what then ignacio will shoot you im guessing molly this was a first a guy that actually did what you asked him to do when she heard a car coming down the ranch road she asked steve to make himself look like a trailer and he had done it sure she had to make a little box diagram in the air with her hands and he missed the first time trying to make himself look like the tin shed next to him a miserable failure that resulted in only his head changing and making him look like a dragon wearing an aluminum bag over his head but after a few seconds he got it what a guy okay his tail which had always hung down into the creek bed before was showing but maybe no one would notice what a guy she said patting him on his airconditioning unit or at least it was an airconditioning unit now no telling what body part it had been before he changed into a trailer shes patting my unit steve thought a low growl of pleasure rolled out of his front door molly ran and hid behind the shed peeking out to watch the white volvo pull up and stop she almost stepped out to say hi to theo then saw the other man in the car holding a gun on him she listened as the bald guy led theo into the shed and made some threats she wanted to jump out and say no ignacio wont be shooting anyone mr bald guy hes busy being digested right now but the guy did have a gun how the hell did theo let himself be taken prisoner by someone who looked like an assistant principal when it was evident that the bald guy was coming out she ran to the dragon trailer caught the edge of the airconditioning unit and swung herself up onto the roof the bald guy was going around to the front door she ran over steves back and looked down over the edge miguel ignacio the bald guy yelled get out here he seemed uncertain about going into the trailer i saw them go in there molly said the bald guy stepped back looking like he was going to go into a fit searching for where the voice had come from youre an assistant principal arent you molly said the bald guy finally spotted her and tried to hide the gun behind his back youre that crazy woman he said what are you doing here molly scooched up to the edge of the dragon trailer scuse me pardon me beg your pardon im the what he ignored her question what are you doing here excuse me excuse me excuse me she almost sang there is an asyetunapologizedfor aspersion on the floor youll have to handle that before we move on im not apologizing for anything what are you doing here where are ignacio and miguel youre not apologizing no get down from there he showed her the gun kay molly said patting steve on the headroof steve eat this impolite motherfucker shed seen it before but it was especially exciting to be sitting on steves head when he changed shape and his tongue leapt out below her to wrap around the assistant principal after the initial slurp the inevitable crunch which had bothered her before was sort of satisfying she couldnt figure out if it was because the assistant principal had pointed a gun at her friend and called her a crazy woman or if she was just getting used to it that was just swell she said she ran across steves back slid down to the top of the airconditioning unit then jumped to the ground steve growled and the angles of his trailer form melted into the curves and sinew of his dragon shape he rolled over on his side and molly watched as the scales on his belly parted and seven feet of dragon penis emerged as thick and stiff as a telephone pole luminescent colors flashed up the length of the organ wow that is impressive molly said taking a few steps backward steve sent her a message similar to the one he had sent to the fuel truck it worked better on molly her knees went wobbly a warm tingling ran up her thighs and she could feel the pulse rising in her temples she looked into steves eyes well one of them anyway stepped up to his face and gently touched him on the lips or what would have been lips if hed had them and let the sweetly acrid smell of his breath a mix of old spice manly mexicans and barfed cow wash over her you know she said i never kissed a guy with assistant principal on his breath nineteen all you need to know about that intimacies what happens between two people in private or one person and a sea beast in a pasture are not the business of anyone but the parties involved still for the sake of the voyeur in us all a tidbit or two to satisfy curiosity molly tried made a valiant effort in fact but even for a woman of such fine physical conditioning the task was too great she did however manage to locate near the shed a gaspowered weedwhacker which the late drug chefs used to clear flammables from the area and with firm but gentle application of that rude machine and a little coaxing was able to bring steve to that state the french inscrutably call the little death and soon after what at first seemed an insurmountable obstacle the size difference was turned to advantage allowing molly to join steve in that place of peace and pleasure how imagine a slow slide down a long slippery bannister of a tongue each taste bud a tease and tingle in just the right place and you can understand how molly ended up a satisfied puddle snuggled in that spot between his neck and shoulder that women so love except in steves case it didnt make his arm go to sleep yes there was a bit of the awkwardness that comes with the unfamiliarity and exploration of new lovers and theos volvo was soundly smashed before steve realized that rolling around on the ground was an inappropriate way to display his enthusiasm but a boxy swedish automobile is a small price to pay for passion in the great scheme of things and that is all you need to know about that twenty theo over the years theo had learned to forgive himself for having inappropriate thoughts at inappropriate times imagining the widow naked at the funeral rooting for a high death toll in third world earthquakes wondering whether white slavers provided inhouse financing but it worried him more than somewhat that while handcuffed to a chair waiting for his executioner he was thinking about getting laid instead of escaping or making amends with his creator sure hed tried to get away managing to do little more than tip the chair over and give himself a bugseye view of the dirt floor but shortly after that when the voices outside had stopped he was overtaken with thoughts of women hed had and women he hadnt including an erotic mental montage of the erstwhile actress and resident crazy lady molly michon so it was embarrassment as much as relief that he felt when after the sound of a weedwhacker and the crashing of metal molly popped her head into the shed hi theo she said molly what are you doing here out for a walk she didnt come in just craned her head around the corner youve got to get away from here molly theres some very dangerous guys around here not a problem you dont want any help then yes go get help but get away from here theres guys with guns i mean you dont want me to uncuff you or anything theres no time theres plenty of time where are the keys on my key ring in the ignition of my car okay be right back and she was gone theo heard some pounding and what sounded like safety glass being shattered in a second molly was back in the doorway she tossed the keys on the floor near his head can you get to those can you unlock me uh id rather not right now but youll be able to get to those eventually wont you molly yes or no sure but okay see ya theo sorry about your car and again she was gone as he scrambled in the dirt to get to the keys he was still troubled about the unwarranted wave of horniness that had overtaken him could it have been set off by the handcuffs maybe hed been into bondage all these years and never even knew it although when hed been arrested right before sheriff burton had blackmailed him into becoming constable hed spent almost two hours in handcuffs and he didnt remember it being an especially erotic experience maybe it was the death threat was he turned on by the thought of being shot man i am a sick individual he thought in ten minutes he was free of both the handcuffs and the dogging thoughts of sex and death molly joseph leander and the house trailer were gone and he stood before the ruins of his volvo with an entirely new set of questions nagging him the roof of the station wagon was now mashed down to level with the hood three of the four tires were blown and on the ground all around the car were the tracks of what had to be a very very large animal there were two trails that had matted down the grass leading away from the shed and over the hill one obviously was the track of a person the other was wider than the dirt road that led into the ranch theo dug into the volvo for his gun and cell phone having no idea what to do with either of them there was no one to calland certainly no one he wanted to shoot except maybe sheriff john burton he searched the area found joseph leanders gun and tucked it into the waistband of his jeans the keys were still in the red fourwheeler and after a minute of measuring the ethics of borrowing the truck against having been kidnapped handcuffed and almost killed he climbed into the truck and took off across the pasture following the double trail gabe gabe and the rancher stood over the pulverized remains of the holstein waving flies away from their faces while skinner crouched a few yards away his ears back growling at the mess the rancher pushed his stetson back on his head and shuddered my people have been running dairy and beef cattle on this land for sixty years and i aint never heard or seen anything like it gabe his name was jim beer he was fiftyfive going on seventy leathery from too much sun and stress and there was a note of the sad lonely under everything he said he was tall and thin but stood with the brokenbacked slouch of a beaten man his wife had left him years ago driving off in her mercedes to live in san francisco and taking with her a note worth half the value of jim beers thousand acres his only son who was to have taken the ranch over was twentyeight now and was busy getting thrown out of colleges and into rehabs all over the country he lived alone in a fourteenroom house that rattled with emptiness and seemed to suck up the laughter of the ranch hands who jim fed in his enormous kitchen every morning jim was the last of his breed and he would forever trace the beginning of his downfall to an affair hed had with the witch who once lived in theos cabin at the edge of the ranch cursed he was or so he believed if the witch hadnt run off ten years ago with the owner of the general store he would have been sure the mutilated cattle was her doing gabe shook his head i have no idea jim i can take some samples and have some test run but i dont even know what we are looking at here you think it was kids vandals kids tip cows over jim these look like theyve been dropped from thirty thousand feet gabe knew what appeared to have happened but he wasnt willing to admit it there wasnt a creature alive that could have done this there had to be another explanation so youre saying aliens no i am definitely not saying aliens im not saying aliens something was here look at the tracks satanic cult damn it jim unless you want to be on the cover of crackpot weekly dont talk that way i cant tell you what did this but i can tell you what didnt this was not aliens or satanists or bigfoot on a binge i can take some samples and run some tests and then maybe maybe i can tell you what did this but in the meantime you should call the state ag guys and get them out here i cant do that gabe why not i cant have strangers running around on my land i dont want this gettin out thats why i called you whats that gabe held up a finger to hold his place in the conversation then looked to the hills the sound of an engine in a second a red fourwheeldrive pickup appeared on the hill headed toward them youd better go jim beer said why youd just better nobodys supposed to be on this side of the ranch but me you need to go this is your land lets jump in your truck son we need to go gabe squinted to get a better look at the truck then waved thats theo crowe he said whats he doing in that thing oh shit jim beer said theo pulled the truck up next to gabes skidded to a stop and crawled out to gabe the constable looked pissed off but he couldnt be sure having never seen the expression on theo before afternoon gabe jim jim beer looked at his boots constable gabe noticed that theo had two pistols stuck in his jeans and was halfcovered with dust hi theo nice truck jim called me out to take a look i know what that is theo said tossing his head toward the mashed cow at least i think i do he strode up to jim beer who seemed to be trying to sink into a hole in his own chest jim you got a crank lab back there turning out enough product to hype all of los angeles you wanna tell me about it the life seemed to drain out of jim beer and he fell to the ground in a splaylegged sit gabe caught his arm to keep him from cracking his tailbone beer didnt look up my wife took a note for half the ranch when she left she called it in where else was i going to get three million dollars gabe looked from jim to theo as if to say what the hell ill explain later gabe i have something i have to show you anyway theo pushed jim beers stetson back so he could see the ranchers face so burton gave you the money so he could use your land for the lab sheriff burton gabe asked totally confused now shut up gabe theo snapped not all of the money payments hell what could i do my grandfather started this ranch i couldnt sell off half of it so you went into drug dealing i aint never even seen this lab youre talking about neither have my hands that part of the ranch is offlimits burton said he had you in the cabin to keep anyone from coming in the back gate i just run my cattle and mind my own business i never even asked burton what he was doing out there there million dollars what the hell did you think he was doing raising rabbits jim beer didnt answer he just stared at the ground between his legs gabe held his shoulder to steady him and looked to theo maybe finish this later theo theo turned and walked in a tight circle waving his hands in the air as if chasing away annoying spirits you okay gabe asked what the fuck do i do now what do i do what am i supposed to do calm down gabe ventured fuck that i got murders drug manufacturing some fucking giant animal of some kind a whole town thats gone nuts my car is mashed and i have a crush on a crazy womani dont have the training for this no one has the fucking training for this so calming down isnt an option right now gabe said i understand theo interrupted his anxiety tiltawhirl and wheeled on gabe and i havent smoked any pot in a week gabe congratulations its made me insane its ruined my life come on theo you never had a life gabe immediately realized that perhaps he had chosen the wrong tack in consoling his friend yeah theres that theo strode to the red truck and punched the fender ouch goddamn it he turned to gabe again and i think i just broke my hand mad cow disease worries me jim beer said from his stupor of defeat shut up jim gabe said theo has a gun guns theo shouted i stand corrected said gabe you mentioned a giant animal theo massaged his temples as if trying to squeeze out a coherent thought after a few minutes he walked to where jim beer was sitting and kneeled down in front of him jim i need you to pull it together for a second the rancher looked at theo tears had traced the creases in his cheeks jim this never happened okay you havent seen me and you havent heard anything from this side of the ranch okay if burton calls you everything is standard operating procedure you know nothing you understand no i dont understand am i going to jail i dont know that jim but i do know that burton finding out about this will only make it worse for every one i need some time to figure some things out if you help ill do my best to protect you i promise okay beer nodded ill do what you say good take gabes truck home well pick it up in an hour or so skinner watched all this with heightened interest tentatively wagging his tail between theos tirades hoping in his heart of hearts that he would get a ride in that big red truck even dogs harbor secret agendas theo these cant be real gabe said running his hand over a footprint nearly three feet across this is some sort of hoax although the depth of the claw impressions and the scuffing would indicate that whoever did this really knows something about how animals move theo was fairly calm now as if he had settled into the whole unreality of the situation and they know something about crushing a volvo too theyre real gabe ive seen a track like this before where by the creek the night the fuel truck blew up i didnt want to believe it then either gabe looked up from the track thats the night i had the mass exodus with my rats yep theres no way theo that couldnt be what happened a creature that could leave tracks like this would dwarf a t rex there hasnt been anything this size on the planet for sixty million years not anything we know about look gabe i followed the trail through the grass to the mutilated cows i thought that was where they went but evidently thats where they just came from they you think theres more than one so you accept that this thing is real no theo im just asking what you think i think that this thing was with molly michon gabe laughed theo i think the withdrawal has you addled im not joking molly was here right after i heard my car getting crunched she gave me the keys to the handcuffs when i came out she was gone and so were joseph leander and whoever he came here to see so what do you think happened to them the same thing that happened to those cows or something like it the same thing that i think happened to the plotznik kid the last time anyone saw him was at the fly rod trailer court thats where molly lives gabe stood and looked around at the pattern of tracks you havent been into town today have you theo no ive been busy les from the hardware store is missing they found his truck behind the head of the slug but theres no sign of him weve got to go to mollys gabe we theo im a biologist not a cop i say we try and track whatever this is skinners a pretty good tracker id bet we find an explanation that doesnt involve some sort of giant creature im not a cop anymore either and what if we track this thing and youre wrong gabe do you want to meet up with whatever did that to my car those cows well yes i do we can do that later it shouldnt be too hard whatever it is its pulling a house trailer what there was a trailer here when leander took me into the shed when i came out it was gone gabe checked his watch have you eaten today im not questioning you but maybe youre having a hypoglycemic reaction or something lets go get some dinner and when your head clears we can go by molly michons right im hallucinating from a bad case of the munchies gabe grabbed his shoulder theo please i have a date theo nodded mollys first then ill go to dinner deal gabe said still staring at the tracks i want to come back here with some casting materials even if this is a hoax i want a record of it theo started for the truck and pulled up when he heard the sound of a cell phone ringing inside the shed he walked into the shed located the cell phone and looked at the display for the number that was ringing in it was burtons private number he drew his magnum and blew the phone into a thousand pieces he walked out of the shed to find gabe hiding behind the fender of the red truck and skinner cowering in the bed what in the hell do you mean you have a date twentyone gabe and theo this is where i found the aberrant rats gabe said as they pulled into the fly rod trailer court thats nice theo said not really paying attention did i tell you i got the brain chemistry back from stanford its interesting but im not sure that it explains the behavior not now gabe please theo slammed on the brakes and the truck rocked to a stop what the hell there were no lights on in molly michons trailer in the empty lot next door a dozen welldressed adults stood in a circle holding candles prayer meeting gabe ventured its sunday night there was a trailer there last time i was here theo said just like the one on the ranch i know this is the lot where i found the rats with the low serotonin levels theo shut off the truck set the parking brake and climbed out then he looked back at gabe you found your rats right here the six that i could find but this is where the other ones that were last tracked disappeared as well i can show you the graphic later that would be good theo pulled his flannel shirt over the guns in his waistband and approached the circle skinner jumped out of the truck and ran ahead gabe reluctantly followed they did indeed seem to be praying their heads were bowed and a woman in a powderblue dress and pillbox hat was leading the group bless us lord for we have felt the stirrings of your power within us and heeded your call to come to this holy place on the eve of skinner drove his nose into the womans crotch and she yipped like a beestung poodle everyone in the group looked up excuse me theo said i dont mean to interrupt but what are you all doing here several of the men looked irritated and stepped up behind the powderblue woman to give support the woman held skinners nose away from her dress while trying to keep the candle flame away from her hair spray constable crowe is that right yes maam theo said the woman was younger than he was by at least five years and pretty in a texas big hair sort of way but her dress and manner of speaking made him feel as if hed just been busted by his firstgrade teacher for eating paste weve been called here constable the woman explained she reached behind her grabbed the shoulder of a woman who looked like her clone in pink and pulled her forward skinner stamped the pink womans dress with the wetnose inspection seal margie and i felt it first but when we started talking about it after services this afternoon all these other people said that they had felt drawn to this place as well the holy spirit has moved us here ask them if theyve seen any rats gabe said call your dog theo tossed over his shoulder gabe called skinner and the labrador looked around they smell fine to me food guy i say fuck em skinner thought but he got no response except a minor scolding the holy spirit called you here theo said everyone in the group nodded earnestly did any of you happen to see the woman who lives in that trailer next door the pink lady chimed in oh yes she was the one to call our attention to this place two nights ago we wondered about that at first being as how she is and all but then katie pointed outshe gestured to her friendthat our lord jesus spent time with mary magdalene and she as im sure you know waswellshe was a whore theo offered well yes and so we thought who are we to judge very charitable of you theo said but have you seen molly michon tonight no not tonight theo felt his energy reserves drain even more look folks you shouldnt be here im not sure its safe some people have gone missing oh that poor boy margie said yes and maybe some others i have to ask you all to take your meeting somewhere else please the group looked disappointed one of the men a portly bald fellow in his fifties puffed himself up and stepped forward constable we have the right to worship when and where we please im just thinking of your safety theo said this country was founded on the basis of religious freedom and theo stepped up to the man and loomed over him with all of his sixfootsix frame then start praying that i dont throw you in jail with the biggest horniest sodomite the country jail has to offer which is what im going to do if you all dont go home right now smooth gabe said make him roll over and pee on himself skinner thought the bald man made a harumph sound and turned to the group lets meet at the church to discuss the removal of our local law enforcement official yeah get in line theo said he watched as the group dispersed to their cars and drove away when the last one pulled out gabe said theories theo shook his head everyone in this town is nuts im going to check mollys trailer but i doubt shes there do you want me to take you home to shower and change clothes before your date gabe looked down at his stained work pants and safari shirt do you think i should gabe youre the only guy i know that makes me look suave youre coming along right casanova theo said compared to you i feel like casanova what gabe said its fried chicken night at hps steve steve lay under a stand of cypress trees his new lover snuggled up to his right foreleg snoring softly he let his tongue slide out and the tip just brushed her bare back she moaned and nuzzled closer to his leg she tasted pretty good but he had eaten all those other warmbloods and he wasnt really hungry when he had been a female some fifty years ago and going back another five thousand he had become accustomed to eating his lovers after mating thats just how it was done but as a male he wasnt sure he hadnt mated with his own species since hed become male and so the instinct to become passive after mating was new to him he just didnt feel like eating the warmblood she had made him feel better and for some reason he could see the pictures of her thoughts instead of just sending his own signals he sensed no fear in her and no need to send the signal to draw her to him strange for a warmblood he lay his head down on the bed of cypress needles to sleep and let his wounds heal he could eat her later somewhere in the back of his brain as he fell asleep a fear alarm went off in five thousand years of life he had never conceived of the concept of later or before only now his dna had rechained itself many times adapted to changes without waiting for the life cycles of generationshe was a unique organism in that waybut the concept of time of memory beyond the cellular level was a new adaptation through his contact with molly he was evolving consciousness and like the pragmatic mechanism that it is nature was trying to warn him the nightmare was about to have a nightmare val is this a date val sat alone at a table in the back of hps cafe shed ordered a glass of a local chardonnay and was trying to form an opinion about it that would reflect the appropriate disgust but unfortunately it was quite good she was wearing light evening makeup and an understated raw silk suit in indigo with a single string of pearls so as not to clash too badly with her date who she knew would be in jeans or cotton khaki her date if this is a date how far have i sunk she asked herself this tacky little cafe in this tacky little town waiting for a man who had probably never worn a tux or a rolex and she was looking forward to it no its not a date its just dinner its sustenance its for once not eating alone slumming in the land of the folksy and the neighborly thats what it is its a satirical performance art experience call it the bourgeois fried chicken follies it was one thing to read her journals over coffee in the local cafe but dinner gabe fenton came through the front door and val felt her pulse quicken she smiled in spite of herself as she watched the waitress point to her table then theo crowe was following gabe across the restaurant and a bolt of anxiety shot up her spine this definitely isnt a date gabe smiled and the lines around his eyes crinkled as if he were about to burst out laughing he extended his hand to her hi i hope you dont mind i asked theo to join us his hair was combed as was his beard and he was wearing a faded but clean chambray shirt not exactly dashing but a pretty goodlooking guy in a lumberjack sort of way no please val said sit down theo theo nodded and pulled a chair up to the table which had been set for two the waitress breezed in with another place setting before they were seated im sorry to intrude theo said but gabe insisted no really youre welcome constable theo please theo then val said she forced a smile what now the last time she had talked to this man it had thrown her life for a loop she found herself building a resentment for gabe that was usually reserved for relationships that were years old theo cleared his throat uh can we go on the doctorpatient confidentiality plan again doctor val nodded to gabe that usually implies a session not dinner okay then dont say anything but joseph leander killed his wife val didnt say wow almost but she didnt and you know this because because he told me so theo said he gave her tea made from foxglove evidently it can cause heart failure and is almost undetectable then he hung her in the dining room so youve arrested him no i dont know where he is but youve put a warrant out for his arrest or whatever it is that you do no im not sure that im still the constable gabe broke in weve been talking about it val i say that theo is an elected official and therefore the only way he can lose his job is through impeachment even if his immediate superior tries to kill him what do you think kill him smooth theo said grinning at gabe oh maybe you should tell her about the crank lab and stuff theo and so theo explained telling the story of his kidnapping the drug lab joseph leanders disappearance and molly michon setting him free but leaving out any theories he had about a giant creature during the telling they ordered fried chicken for theo and gabe a greek salad for val and were halfway through dinner before theo stopped talking val stared at her salad and silence washed over the table if there was going to be a murder investigation she could be found out and if they found out what she had done to her patients her career was over she might even go to jail it wasnt fair she really had tried to do the right thing for once she resisted the urge to blurt out a confessionto throw herself on the mercy of a court born of sheer paranoia instead she raised her eyes to gabe who took the signal to break the silence gabe said and i still dont know the significance of the low serotonin levels in the rats brains huh said not only val and theo but the waitress jenny who had been eavesdropping from the next table and joined the confusion at gabes non sequitur sorry gabe said to val i thought you might have a take on the brain chemistry of those rats i had tested you said you were interested and i am val said lying through her teeth but im a little overwhelmed by the news about bess leander right anyway the group of rats that didnt take part in the mass migration all had unusually low levels of serotonin the brain chemistry of the larger group the group that ran was all in normal ranges so im thinking that they were depressed val said pardon me gabe said of course theyre depressed theyre rats theo said gabe glared at him well imagine waking up to that every morning theo continued oh its a great day crap im still a rat never mind well i dont know about rats val said but serotonin levels in humans affect a lot of different things predominantly mood low levels of serotonin can indicate depression thats how prozac works it basically keeps serotonin in the brain to keep the patient from getting depressed so maybe gabes rats were too depressed to run gabe stroked his beard i never thought of that but it doesnt help that much it doesnt tell me why the majority of the rats did run well duh gabe theo said its the fucking monster what val said what said jenny who was lingering nearby can we get some dessert menus gabe asked sending jenny backing across the restaurant monster val said maybe youd better explain gabe theo said i think your scientific skepticism will make it sound more credible vals jaw dropped visibly as she listened to gabe talk about the tracks at the ranch the mutilated cattle and theos theory for the disappearances of joseph leander mikey plotznik and perhaps les from the hardware store when gabe brought up molly michon val stopped him you cant believe what she tells you molly is a very disturbed woman she didnt tell me anything theo said i just think she knows something about all this val wanted to call up theos drug history to sweep the story aside then she remembered what estelle boyet had told her in therapy im not going to say who but one of my patients mentioned a sea monster in session gabe asked who i cant say val said estelle boyet jenny said as she came up to get the dessert order damn val said i wasnt the one who told you she said to theo well she was talking about it over breakfast with that catfish guy jenny added no dessert val snapped at jenny ill bring the check so estelle has seen it theo asked no she says shes heard it shes not the type to propagate a hoax but i wouldnt put it past molly michon perhaps thats where the rumor started i can ask estelle do that theo said but its not a hoax my car is smashed thats evidence im going to mollys tonight and wait for her the door was unlocked when i checked earlier and i cant go home you think its that dangerous val asked i know it is theo stood and started to pull some bills from his pocket gabe waved him off theo said doctor can you give gabe a ride sure but thanks theo said ill call you gabe thanks for letting me join you doctor i thought youd want to know about bess im afraid ive ruined your date ill say val thought as she watched theo leave the restaurant a sense of alert exhaustion washed over her like an espresso fog bank he just quit smoking pot gabe said hes feeling the stress he has a right to you dont believe any of that stuff about a monster do you i have some theories would you like to come up to the house and explain them over a bottle of wine really i mean sure that would be nice good val said i think i need to get hammered and id like your company had she used the term hammered since college she didnt think so ill get the check gabe said of course you will i hope you dont mind having a dog in your car gabe said im not slumming she thought ive moved to the slums twentytwo theo the walls of mollys trailer were plastered with movie posters he stood in the middle of the living room among the scattered videotapes magazines and junk mail and slowly turned it was her molly she hadnt been lying all this time most of the posters were in foreign languages but every one featured a younger molly in various states of undress holding weapons or fighting off bad guys her hair flying in the wind a nukedout city or a desert littered with human skulls and burnedout cars in the background the adolescent male part of theo the part that every man tries to bury but carries to his grave reared up she was a movie star a hot movie star and he knew her had in fact put handcuffs on her if there was only a locker room a street corner or a secondperiod study hall where he could brag about it to his friends but he didnt really have any friends except for gabe maybe and gabe was a grownup the prurient moment passed and theo felt guilty about the way he had treated molly patronizing her and condescending to her the way many people treated him when he tried to be something besides a pothead and puppet he kneeled down to a bookshelf filled with videotapes found one labeled kendra warrior babe of the out land english and slipped it into the vcr and turned on the television then he turned off the lights laid his guns on the coffee table and lay down on mollys couch to wait he watched as the crazy lady of pine cove battled mutants and sand pirates for half an hour before he drifted off to sleep his mind needed a deeper escape from his problems than the movie could provide hi theo he came awake startled the movie was still casting a flickering light over the room so he couldnt have been sleeping that long she stood in the doorway half in shadow looking very much like the woman on the television screen she held an assault rifle at her side molly ive been waiting for you howd you like it she nodded toward the television loved it i never realized i was just so tired molly nodded i wont be long i just came to get some clean clothes youre welcome to stay here theo didnt know what to do it didnt seem like the time to grab one of the pistols off the table he felt more embarrassed than threatened thanks he said hes the last one theo after him there arent any more of his kind his time has passed i think thats what we have in common you dont know what it is to be a hasbeen do you i think im what they call a neverwas thats easier at least youre always looking up the ladder not down coming down is scarier how why what is he im not sure a dragon maybe who knows she leaned back against the doorway and sighed but i can kinda tell what hes thinking i guess its because im nuts who would have thought that would come in handy huh dont say that about yourself youre saner than i am molly laughed and theo could see her moviestar teeth shine in the light of the television youre a neurotic theo a neurotic is someone who thinks something is wrong with him but everyone else thinks he is normal a psychotic thinks somethings wrong with her take a poll of the locals i think id come out in the latter category dont you molly this is really dangerous stuff youre messing with he wont hurt me its not just that you could go to jail just for having that machine gun molly people are getting killed arent they in a manner of speaking thats what happened to joseph leander and the guys working the drug lab right your pal ate them they were going to hurt you and steve was hungry seemed like great timing to me molly thats murder theo im nuts what are they going to do to me theo shrugged his shoulders and sat back on the couch i dont know what to do youre not in a position to do anything right now get some rest theo cradled his head in his hands his cell phone still in the pocket of his flannel shirt began ringing i could sure use a hit right now theres some smurfs of sanity in the cupboard over the sinkneuroleptics dr val gave me antipsychoticstheyve done wonders for me obviously your phone is ringing theo pulled out the phone flipped it open hit the answer button and watched as the incoming number ap peared on the display it was sheriff burtons cell phone number theo hit disconnect im fucked theo said molly picked up theos magnum from the table held it on theo then picked up joseph leanders automatic ill give these back before i go im going to get some clean clothes and some girlie things out of my bedroom you be okay here yeah sure his head was still hung he spoke into his lap youre bumming me out theo sorry molly was gone from the room for only five minutes in which time theo tried to get a handle on what had happened molly returned with a duffel bag slung over her shoulder she was wearing the kendra costume complete with thighhigh boots even in the dim light from the television theo could see a ragged scar over her breast she caught him looking ended my career she said i suppose now they could fix it but its a little late im sorry theo said i think you look beautiful she smiled and shifted both of the pistols to one hand shed left the assault rifle by the door and theo hadnt even noticed you ever feel special theo special not like youre better than everyone else just that youre different in a good way like it makes a difference that youre on the planet you ever feel that way i dont know no not really i had that for a while even though they were cheesy b movies and even though i had to do some humiliating things to get into them i felt special theo then it went away well now i feel that way again thats why why what you asked me why before thats why im going back to steve steve you call him steve he looked like a steve molly said i have to go ill leave your guns in the bed of that red truck you stole dont try to follow okay theo nodded molly dont let it kill anybody else promise me that promise to leave us alone i cant do that okay take care of yourself she grabbed the assault rifle kicked open the door and stepped out theo heard her go down the steps pause then come back up she popped her head in the door im sorry you never felt special theo she said theo forced a smile thanks molly gabe gabe stood in the foyer of valerie riordans home looking at his hiking boots then the white carpet then his boots again val had gone into the kitchen to get some wine skinner was wandering around outside gabe sat down on the marble floor unlaced his boots then slipped them off hed once been into a levelnine clean room at a biotech facility in san jose a place where the air was scrubbed and filtered down to the micron and you had to wear a plastic bunny suit with its own air umbilical to avoid contaminating the specimens strangely hed had a similar feeling to the one he was feeling now which was i am the harbinger of filth thank god theo had made him shower and change before his date val came into the sunken living room carrying a tray with a bottle of wine and two glasses she looked up at gabe who was standing at the edge of the stairs as if ready to wade into molten lava well come on in and have a seat val said gabe took a tentative step nice place he said thanks i still have a lot to do on it i suppose i should just hire a decorator and have done with it but i like finding pieces myself right gabe said taking another step you could play handball in this room if you didnt mind destroying a lot of antiques its a cabernet from wild horse vineyard over the hill i hope you like it val poured the wine into stemmed bubble glasses she took hers and sat down on the velvet couch then raised her eyebrows as if to say well gabe joined her at the other end of the couch then took a tentative sip of the wine its nice for a local cheapie val said an awkward silence passed between them val made a show of tasting the wine again then said you dont really believe this stuff about a sea monster do you gabe gabe was relieved she wanted to talk about work hed been afraid that she would want to talk about something elseanything elseand he didnt really know how well there are the tracks which look very authentic so if they are fake whoever did them studied fossil tracks and replicated them perfectly then theres the timing of the rat migration plus theo and your patient estelle was it val set down her wine gabe i know youre a scientist and a discovery like this could make you rich and famous but i just dont believe theres a dinosaur in town rich and famous i hadnt thought about it i guess there would be some recognition wouldnt there look gabe you deal in hard facts but every day i deal with the delusions and constructions of peoples minds they are just tracks on the ground probably like that bigfoot hoax in washington a few years ago theo is a chronic drug user and estelle and her boyfriend catfish are artist types they all have overactive imaginations gabe was put off by her judgment of theo and the others he thought for a second then said as a biologist i have a theory about imagination i think its pretty obvious that fearfear of loud noises fear of heights the capacity to learn fearis something that weve adapted over the years as a survival mechanism and so is imagination everyone thinks that it was the big strong caveman who got the girl and for the most part that may have been true but physical strength doesnt explain how our species created civilization i think there was always some scrawny dreamer sitting at the edge of the firelight who had the ability to imagine dangers to look into the future in his imagination and see possibilities and therefore survived to pass his genes on to the next generation when the big ape men ended up running off the cliff or getting killed while trying to beat a mastodon into submission with a stick the dreamer was standing back thinking hey that might work but you need to run the mastodon off the cliff and then hed mate with the women left over after the gogetters got killed so nerds rule val said with a smile but if fear and imagination make you more highly evolved then someone with paranoid delusions would be ruling the world val was getting into the theory of it now how strange to talk to a man who talked about ideas not property and personal agendas val liked it a lot gabe said well we didnt miss that by far with hitler did we evolution takes some missteps sometimes big teeth worked pretty well for a while then they got too big mastodons tusks got so large they would snap the animals neck and youve probably noticed that there are no sabertoothed cats around anymore okay ill buy that imagination is an evolutionary leap but what about depression talking about mental conditions she couldnt help thinking about what shed done to her patients her crimes circled in her mind trying to get out psychiatry is looking more and more at mental conditions from a physical point of view so that fits thats why were treating depression with drugs like prozac but what evolutionary purpose is there for depression ive been thinking about that since you mentioned it at dinner gabe said he drained his wineglass and moved closer to her on the couch as if by being closer she would share in his excitement he was in his element now a lot of animals besides humans get depressed higher mammals like dolphins and whales can die from it but even rats seem to get the blues i cant figure out what purpose it serves but in humans it might be like nearsightedness civilization has protected a biological weakness that would have been weeded out by natural dangers or predators predators how i dont know depression might slow the prey down make it react less quickly to danger who knows so a predator might actually evolve that preyed on depressed animals right and its me val thought if i havent been preying on depressed people what have i been doing she suddenly felt ashamed of her home of the pure materialism of it here was an incredibly bright man who was concerned with the pure pursuit of knowledge and she had sold her integrity for some antiques and a mercedes gabe poured himself another glass of wine and sat back now thinking as he spoke interesting idea i suppose there could be some sort of chemical or behavioral stimulus that would trigger preying on the depressed low serotonin levels tend to raise libido right at least temporarily yes val said thats why the entire town has turned into horndogs she thought therefore gabe continued youd have more animals mating and passing on the depression gene nature tends to evolve mechanisms to remain in balance a predator or a disease would naturally evolve to keep the depressed population down interesting ive been feeling especially horny lately i wonder if im depressed gabes eyes snapped open wide and he looked at val with the fullblown terror of what he had just said he gulped his wine then said im sorry i val couldnt stand it anymore gabes faux pas opened the gate and she stepped through it gabe we have to talk im really sorry i didnt mean to she grabbed his arm to stop him no i have to tell you something gabe braced himself for the worst hed fallen out of the lofty world of theory into the awkward gritty world of first dates and she was going to drop the dont get the wrong idea bomb on him she gripped his arm and her nails dug into his bicep hard enough to make him wince she said a little over a month ago i took almost a third of the people in pine cove off antidepressants huh that wasnt at all what hed expected my god why because of bess leanders suicide or what i thought was her suicide i was just going through the motions in my practice writing prescriptions and collecting fees she explained about her arrangement with winston krauss and how the pharmacist had refused to put everyone back on the drugs when she finished to wait for his judgment there were tears welling up in her eyes he put his arms around her tentatively hoping it was the right thing to do why tell me this she melted against his chest because i trust you and because i have to tell someone and because i need to figure out what to do i dont want to go to jail gabe maybe all my patients didnt need to be on antidepressants but a lot of them did she sobbed on his shoulder and he began to stroke her hair then pushed up her chin and kissed her tears itll be okay it will she looked up into his eyes as if looking for a hint of disdain then not finding it she kissed him hard and pulled him on top of her on the couch a higher power and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast revelation twentythree steve what horrors can a dragon dream a creature who has in his own way ruled the planet for millions of years a creature for whom the mingy man mammals have built temples a creature who has known no predator but timewhat could he possibly dream that would frighten him call it the knowing under a stand of oak trees sexually satisfied and with a bellyful of drug dealers the dragon dreamed a vision of time past the eternal now that he had always known suddenly had history in the dream he saw himself as a larva tucked into the protective pouch under his mothers tongue until it was safe to venture out under her watchful eye he saw the hunting and the mating the forms he had learned to mimic as his mercurial dna evolved not through generations but through regeneration of cells he saw the mates he had eaten the three young he had borne as a female the last killed by a warmblood who sang the blues he remembered the changing not so long ago from female to male and he remembered all of it in pictures not in mere instinctual patterns and conditioned responses he saw these pictures in the dream brought on by the strange mating with the warmblood and he wondered why for the first time in his five thousand years he asked why and the dream answered with a picture of all the oceans and swamps the rivers and bogs and trenches and mountains beneath the sea and they were all empty of his kind as sure as if he were floating through the cold black at the end of the universe where light gives up hope and time chases its tail until it dies from exhaustion he was alone sex does that to some guys val oh my god the rat brains gabe shouted it was a different response to lovemaking val wasnt sure that she might not be hurt feeling vulnerable as she was with her knees in the vicinity of her ears a biologist on top of her and her panty hose waving off one foot like a tattered battle flag gabe collapsed into her arms and she looked over his shoulder to the coffee table to check that they hadnt kicked the wineglasses off onto the carpet are you okay she asked a little breathless im sorry but i just realized whats going on with this creature thats what you were thinking about yes her feelings were definitely hurt no not during it came to me in a flash right after somehow the creature can attract mammals with lower than normal serotonin levels and youve got what a third of the population running around in antidepressant withdrawal she was pissed now not hurt she dumped him off her onto the floor stood up pulled her skirt down and stepped away he scrambled into his pants and looked around for his shirt which lay in shreds behind the couch he had a tan that ended at the neckline and just below the shoulders the rest of him was milk white he looked up at her from the gap between the couch and the coffee table with a pleading in his eyes as if he were looking up from a coffin in which he was about to be buried alive sorry he said he wasnt looking her in the eye and val suddenly realized that he was talking to her exposed breasts she pulled her blouse closed and a battery of insults rose in her mind ready to be fired but all of them were meanspirited and would serve to do nothing but make them both feel ashamed he was who he was and he was honest and real and she knew that he hadnt meant to hurt her so she cried thinking great crying is what got me into this in the first place she plopped down on the couch with her face in her hands gabe moved to her side and put his arm around her im really sorry im not very good at this sort of thing youre fine its just too much i should go he started to stand she caught his arm in a death grip you go and ill hunt you down and kill you like a rabid dog ill stay no go she said i understand okay ill go dont you dare she threw her arms around him and kissed him hard pulling him back down onto the couch and within seconds they were all over each other again thats it she thought no more crying its the crying that does it this guy is aroused by my pain but soon they lay in a panting sweaty pile on the floor and the idea of crying was lightyears away and this time gabe said that was wonderful val noticed a wineglass overturned by her head a cabernet stain bleeding over the carpet is it salt or club soda gabe pulled away far enough to look into her eyes and saw that she was looking at the stained carpet salt and cold water i think or is that blood a drop of sweat dripped off his forehead onto her lips she looked at him you werent thinking about that creature that doesnt exist were you just you she smiled really and a weedwhacker for some reason youre kidding uh yes im kidding i was only thinking of you so you dont think im a horrible person for what ive done you were trying to do what you thought was right how could that be horrible i feel horrible its been a long time im out of practice no not about this about my patients you really think something could be preying on them its just a theory there may not even be a creature but what if there is shouldnt we call the national guard or something i was thinking of calling theo theo isnt even a real cop he deserves to know they lay there in silence for a few minutes staring at the spreading stain on the carpet feeling the sweat run down their ribs and listening to the beat of each others hearts gabe val whispered yes maybe we should go to couples counseling should we get dressed first you were serious about the weedwhacker werent you i dont know where that image came from theres supposed to be a good couples guy in san junipero unless youd rather go to a woman counselor i thought we were going to call the national guard only if it comes to that val said thinking when we tell the shrink about this im leaving out the part about the wine spilling theo is there anything more irritating than people who have just been laid especially when you have not not for a long time oh it was obvious as soon as they came through mollys front door waking theo for the second time that night gabes grin looking like the oversized grill on an old chrysler val riordan wearing jeans and almost no makeup the both of them giddy and giggling and blushing like children theo wanted to puke he was happy for them but he wanted to puke what theo said gabe was obviously amped and trying not to show it he put his hands in his pockets to keep from waving them around ihe looked at val and smiledwe think that this creature if it exists may be attracted to prey with low serum serotonin levels gabe bounced on the balls of his feet as he waited for his statement to sink in theo sat there staring at him with no discernible change in expression from the weariness hed worn since they came through the door he guessed that he was supposed to say something now molly was here theo said the creature exists it ate mikey plotznik and joseph leander and who knows who else she said its a dragon gabes grin dropped thats great i mean thats horrible but its great from a scientific point of view i have another theory about this species i think it has some specialized mechanism to affect its prey have you been horny lately theres no need to be arrogant gabe im glad you two had a good time but theres no need to rub it in no no you dont get it gabe went on to explain about val riordans decision to take her patients off antidepressants and how the lowering of serotonin levels could lead to increased libido so pine cove has been full of horny people right theo said and i still cant get a date val riordan laughed and theo glared at her gabe said the rats i found alive near this trailer where we think the creature might have been were mating when i found them there are some species of carnivorous plants that give off a sex pheromone that attracts their prey in some species the behavior of the malea display a dance a scentwill stimulate the ovaries in the female of the species without any physical contact i think thats whats happened to us our ovaries are being stimulated theo rubbed sleep from his eyes i gotta be honest with you gabe im not feeling it val turned to gabe thats not very romantic its incredibly exciting this may be the most elegant predator that the world has ever seen theo shook his head i have no home no job no car theres probably a warrant out for my arrest and you want me to be excited over the fact that we have a monster in town that makes you horny so he can eat you sorry gabe im missing the positive side of this val chimed in it may be the reason that youve been able to quit smoking pot so easily pardon me easily theo wanted to jump off the couch and bitchslap them both were you ever able to go this long before she could be right theo gabe said if this thing affects serotonin it could affect other neurotransmitters oh good theo said lets open a detox clinic well feed half of the patients to the monster and the other half will recover i cant wait theres no need to be sarcastic gabe said were just trying to help help help with what bar fight i can handle it skateboard theft im on it but my law enforcement experience hasnt prepared me for dealing with this thats true gabe val said theos little more than a rentacop maybe we should call the sheriff or the fbi or the national guard and tell them what theo asked rentacop im not even that now he thought he has a point gabe said we havent seen anything that old blues singer has val said theo nodded we need to find him maybe hell hes living with estelle boyet val said i have her address in my office twentyfour the sheriff sheriff john burton stood by the ruins of theos volvo pounding the keys of his cell phone he could smell the cow shit hed stepped in coming off his guccis and the damp wind was blowing cowlicks in his gelled silver hair his black armani suit was smudged with the ashes hed poked through at theos cabin thinking there might be a burned body underneath he was not happy didnt anybody answer their goddamn phone anymore hed called joseph leander theophilus crowe and jim beer the man who owned the ranch and no one was answering which is what had brought him to pine cove in the middle of the night in a state of near panic in the first place the second shift of crank cookers should be working in the lab right now but there was no one around his world was falling down around him all because of the meddling of a pothead constable who had forgotten that he was supposed to be incompetent crowes line was ringing burton heard a click then was immediately disconnected fuck he slammed the cell phone shut and dropped it into the pocket of his suit jacket someone was answering crowes phone either he was still alive or leander had killed him taken his phone and was fucking with him but leanders van had been parked at crowes cabin so where was he not at home burton had already checked finding nothing but a sleepy babysitter and two groggy little girls in nightgowns would leander run and not take his daughters burton pulled out the phone and dialed the data offices at the department the spider answered nailsworth the spider said burton could hear him chewing put down that twinkie you fucking tub of lard i need you to find me a name and an address its a sno ball pink i only eat the marshmallow covers burton could feel his pulse rising in his temples and made an effort to control his rage in the rush to get to pine cove hed forgotten to take his blood pressure medication the name is betsy butler i need a pine cove address joseph leanders girlfriend the spider asked how do you know that please sheriff the spider said with a snort remember who youre talking to just get me the address burton could hear nailsworth typing the spider was dangerous a constant threat to his operation and burton couldnt figure out how to get to him he was immune to bribes or threats of any kind and seemed content with his lot in life as long as he could make others squirm and burton was too afraid of what the corpulent information officer might really know to fire him maybe some of that foxglove tea that leander had used on his wife certainly no one would question heart failure in a man who got winded unwrapping a snickers no address nailsworth said just a po box i checked dmv trw and social security she works at hps cafe in pine cove you want the address its five in the morning nailsworth i need to find this woman now the spider sighed they open for breakfast at six do you want the address burton was seething again give it to me he said through gritted teeth the spider gave him an address on cypress street and said try the eggssothoth theyre supposed to be great how would you know you never leave the goddamn office ah what fools these mortals be the spider said in a very bad british accent i know everything sheriff everything then he hung up burton took a deep breath and checked his rolex he had enough time to make a little visit to jim beers ranch house before the restaurant opened the old shit kicker was probably already up and punching doggies or whatever the fuck ranchers did at this hour he certainly wasnt answering his phone burton climbed into the black eldorado and roared across the rutted ranch road toward the gate by theos cabin as he headed out to the coast highway to loop back to the front of the ranch hed be damned if hed take his caddy across two miles of cow trails someone stepped into his headlights and he slammed on the brakes the antilocks throbbed and the caddy stopped just short of running over a woman in a white choir robe there was a whole line of them making their way down the coast highway shielding candles against the wind they didnt even look up but walked past the front of his car as if in a trance burton rolled down the window and stuck his head out what are you people doing its five in the morning a balding man whose choir robe was three sizes too small looked up with a beatific smile and said weve been called by the holy spirit weve been called then he walked on yeah well you almost got to see him early burton yelled but no one paid attention he fell back into the seat and waited as the procession passed it wasnt just people in choir robes but aging hippies in jeans and birkenstocks half a dozen gen xers dressed in their sunday best and one skinny guy who was wearing the saffron robes of a buddhist monk burton wrenched his briefcase off the passenger seat and popped it open false passport drivers license social security card stickon beard and a ticket to the caymans the platinum parachute kit he kept with him at all times maybe it was time to bail skinner well the food guy finally got a female skinner thought probably because he had the scent of those mashed cows on him skinner had been tempted to roll in the goo himself but was afraid the food guy would yell at him he hated that but this was even better riding in the different car with the food guy and his female and the tall guy who always smelled of burning weeds and sometimes gave him hamburgers he looked out the window and wagged his tail which repeatedly smacked theo in the face they were stopping oh boy maybe they would leave him in the car that would be good the seats were chewy and tasted of cow but no they let him out told him to come along with them to the small house an old guy answered the door and skinner said hi with a nose to the crotch the old guy scratched his ears skinner liked him he smelled like a dog whod been howling all night being near him made skinner want to howl and he did one time enjoying the sad sound of his own voice the food guy told him to shut up the old guy said i guess i know how you feel they all went inside and left skinner there on the steps they were all nervous skinner could smell it and they probably wouldnt be inside long he had work to do it was a big yard with a lot of shrubs where other dogs had left him messages he needed to reply to them all so each could only get a short spray dog email he was only halffinished when they came back out the tall guy said well mr jefferson were going to find the monster and wed like your help youre the only one who has seen it oh i think youll know him when you see him said the old guy yall dont need my help everyone smelled sad and afraid and skinner couldnt help himself he let loose a forlorn howl that he held until the food guy grabbed his collar and dragged him to the car skinner had a bad feeling that they might be going to the place where there was danger danger food guy he warned his barking was deafening in the confines of the mercedes estelle estelle was fuming as she cleared the teacups from the table and threw them into the sink two broke and she swore to herself then turned to catfish who was sitting on the bed picking out a soft version of walkin mans blues on the national steel guitar you could have helped them estelle said catfish looked at the guitar and sang got a mean old woman lawd stay angry all the time theres nothing noble in using your art to escape life you should have helped them got a mean old woman lawd lawd lawd she just stay angry all the time dont you ignore me catfish jefferson im talking to you people in this town have been good to you you should help them catfish threw back his head and sang to the ceiling she gots no idea lawd whats hers and whats mine estelle snagged a skillet out of the dish rack crossed the room and raised it for a rocketing forehand shot to catfishs head go ahead sing another verse about your mean old woman catfish im curious what rhymes with clobbered catfish put the guitar aside and slipped on his sunglasses you know they say a woman was the one poisoned robert johnson do you know what she used estelle wasnt smiling im making my shopping list dang woman why you talk like that i aint been nothin but good to you and me to you thats why you keep singing that mean old woman song right dont sound right singin sweet old woman estelle lowered the pan tears welled up in her eyes you can help them and when its over you can stay here you can play your music i can paint people in pine cove love your music people here sayin hello to me on the street puttin too much money in the tip jar buying me drinksi aint got the blues on me no more so you have to go wreck your car or pick cotton or shoot a man in memphis or whatever it is that you have to do to put the blues on you for what its what i do i dont know nothin else youve never tried anything else im here im real is it so bad to know that you have a warm bed to sleep in with someone who loves you theres nothing out there catfish that dragon out there he always be out there so face it you got away from it before why you care because it took a lot for me to open my heart to you after what ive been through and i dont have much tolerance for cowards anymore call it like you sees it mama estelle turned and went back to the kitchen then maybe you better go ill get my hat catfish said he snapped the national back into its case grabbed his hat from the table and in a moment he was gone estelle turned and stared at the door when she heard his station wagon start she fell to the floor and felt a once warm future bleed a black stain around her meanwhile back at the ranch the cave lay under a hillside less than a mile from the ranch road at theos cabin the narrow mouth looked down over a wide grassy marine terrace to the pacific and the interior which opened into a huge cathedral chamber echoed with the sound of crashing waves fossilized starfish and trilobites peppered the walls and the rocky floor was covered with a patina of bat guano and crystallized sea salt the last time steve had visited the cave it had been underwater and he had spent a pleasant autumn there feeding on the gray whales that migrated down the coast to baja to bear their young he didnt remember the cave consciously of course but when he sensed that molly was searching for a hiding place the map in his mind that had long ago gone to instinct led them there since theyd arrived at the cave a dark mood had fallen on steve and in turn over molly shed used the weedwhacker on the sea beast several times to try to cheer him up but now the sex machine was out of gas and molly was developing a heat rash on the inside of her thighs from repeated tongue lashings it had been two days since she had eaten and even steve refused to touch his cows black angus steers now that molly knew he couldnt tolerate dairy since the coming of the sea beast molly had been in a state of controlled euphoria worries about her sanity had melted away and she had joined him in the zen moment that is the life of an animal but since the dream and the horrible selfconsciousness that had descended on steve the notion of their incompatibility had begun to rise in mollys mind like a trout to a fly steve she said leaning on her broadsword and staring him squarely in one of his basketball eyes your breath could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon the sea beast rather than go on the defensive which was fortunate for molly because the only defense he could think of was to bite her legs off let out a pathetic whimper and tried to tuck his huge head under a forelimb molly immediately regretted her comment and tried to patch the damage oh i know its not your fault maybe someone sells tic tacs the size of easy chairs well get through it but she didnt mean it and steve could sense her insincerity maybe we need to get out more she added dawn had broken outside and a beam of sunlight was streaming into the cathedral like a cops flashlight in a smoky bar maybe a swim molly said your gills seem to be healing how she knew the treelike growths on his neck were gills she wasnt sureperhaps more of the unspoken communication that passes between lovers steve lifted his head and molly thought that she might have gotten his attention but then she noticed that a shadow had come over the entrance to the cave she looked up to see half a dozen people in choir robes standing at the opening of the cathedral weve come to offer sacrifice one woman managed to say and not a breath mint among you ill bet molly said twentyfive theo hps cafe was crowded with early morning old guys drinking coffee theo downed three cups of coffee quickly which only served to make him anxious val and gabe had ordered a cinnamon roll to share and now val was feeding a piece of it to gabe as if the man had somehow managed to reach middle age and earn two phds without ever having learned to feed himself theo just wanted to blow the bitter chunks of indignation val said i certainly hope that the presence of this creature isnt responsible for how i feel right now she licked icing from her fingers right theo thought the fact that youve fucked up all the previously fuckedup people in town and committed a string of felonies in the process shouldnt be the rain on your little love parade however theo did subscribe to the honest mistake school of law enforcement and he honestly believed that she was trying to right a wrong by taking her patients off their medication so although val was currently irritating him like a porcupine suppository he was honest enough to realize that he was merely jealous of what she had found with gabe that realized gabe started to irritate him as well what do we do gabe tranquilize this thing shoot it what assuming it exists assume it theo spat im afraid if you wait for enough evidence to be sure well have to find you an ass donor because this creature will have bitten yours off no need to be snotty theo im just being sensibly skeptical as any researcher would theo val said i can write you a scrip for some valium might take the edge off your withdrawal symptoms theo scoffed he didnt scoff often so he wasnt good at it and it appeared to gabe and val that he might be gacking up a hair ball you all right gabe asked im fine i was scoffing at what at dr feelgood here wanting to give me a prescription for valium so winston krauss can fill it with mms id forgotten about that val said sorry it would appear that we have multifarious problems with which to deal and i dont have a clue where to start theo said multifarious gabe said a shitload said theo i know what it means theo i just cant believe it came out of your mouth val laughed gaily at gabes kindasorta humor theo glared at her jenny who was almost as cranky as theo for having had to close hps the night before and then open the restaurant in the morning when the morning girl called in sick came by to refill their coffees thats your boss pulling up isnt it theo she asked nodding toward the front out the window theo could see sheriff john burton crawling out of his black eldorado back door theo said urgent pleading in his eyes sure through the kitchen and howards office theo was up in a second and halfway to the kitchen when he noticed that val and gabe had missed the entire exchange and were staring into each others eyes he ran back and slapped the table with his open palm they looked at him as if theyd been dragged out of a dream attention theo said trying not to raise his voice sheriff coming in my boss deadly drug dealer were criminals well be making a break for the back door now hello im not a criminal gabe said im a biologist theo grabbed him by the front of the shirt and made for the kitchen dragging the biologist behind him the criminal shrink brought up the rear the sheriff im looking for betsy butler burton said flipping open a badge wallet as if everyone in the county didnt immediately recognize his white stetsonoverarmani look whats she done jenny asked putting herself between the sheriff and the door to the kitchen thats not your affair i just need to talk to her well im on the floor alone so you have to follow me if you want to talk or ill get behind i dont want to talk to you fine jenny turned her back on the sheriff and went to the waitress station behind the counter to start a fresh pot of coffee burton followed her suppressing the urge to put her in a choke hold do you know where she lives yes jenny said but shes not home jenny glanced back through the kitchen window to make sure that theo and his bunch had made it through to howards office burtons face was going red now please could you tell me where she is jenny thought she could jerk this guy around for another ten minutes or so but it didnt look as if it was necessary besides she was pissed at betsy for calling in anyway she called in this morning with a spiritual emergency her words by the way the flu i can understand but im working a double after closing last night over her spiritual emergency where is betsy butler the sheriff barked jenny jumped back a step the man looked as if he might go for his gun any second no wonder theo had bolted out the back she said she was going with a group up to the beer bar ranch that they were being called by the spirit to make a sacrifice pretty weird huh was joseph leander going with her no ones supposed to know about betsy and joseph i know about them was he going with her she didnt say she sounded a little spaced out does theo crowe come in here sometimes jenny wasnt volunteering anything to this creep he was rude he was mean and he was wearing enough aramis to choke a skunk has he been in here today no havent seen him without a word burton turned and stormed out the door to his cadillac jenny went back to the kitchen where gabe val and theo were standing by the fryers trying to stay out of the way of the two cooks who were flipping eggs and thrashing hash browns gabe pointed to the back door its locked hes gone jenny said he was looking for betsy and joseph but he asked about you theo i think hes going up to the beer bar to find betsy whats betsy doing at the ranch theo asked something about making a sacrifice that girl needs help theo turned to val give me the keys to your car im going after him i dont think so the psychiatrist said holding her purse away from him please val ive got to see what hes up to this is my life here and thats my mercedes and youre not taking it i have guns val yeah but you dont have a mercedes its mine gabe looked at her as if shed squirted a grapefruit in his eyes you really wont let theo use your car his voice was flat with disappointment its just a car they all stared at her even the two cooks burly hispanic men who had until now refused to acknowledge their existence val reached into her purse brought out the keys and handed them to theo as if she were giving up a child for sacrifice how will we get home gabe asked go to the head of the slug and wait ill either pick you up or call you from my cell phone and let you know whats going on it shouldnt take long with that theo ran out of the kitchen a few seconds later valerie riordan cringed at the sound of squealing tires as theo pulled out of the restaurant parking lot skinner skinner liked chasing cars as much as the next dog and they didnt get away as easily when you chased them in another car but despite the excitement of the chase skinner was anxious when he had seen the tall guy come out to the car he thought that the food guy was coming too but now they were driving away from the food guy and toward the danger skinner could feel it he whined and ran back and forth across the backseat of the mercedes leaving nose prints on the window then jumped into the front seat and stuck his head out the passenger window there was no joy to the turbocharged smells or the wind in his ears only danger he barked and scratched at the door handle to warn the tall guy but all he got for his efforts was a perfunctory ear scratching so he crawled into the tall guys lap where it felt at least a little safer the sheriff burton first noticed the mercedes behind him when he turned onto the access road to the coast highway a week ago he might not have thought twice about it but now he was seeing an enemy in every tree dea wouldnt use a mercedes and neither would fbi but the mexican mafia could except for his operation they ran the meth trade out of the west perhaps theyd decided that they wanted the whole trade that would explain the disappearance of leander crowe and the guys at the lab except that it had been a little too clean they would have left bodies as a warning and they would have burned down all of crowes cabin not just the pot patch he pulled his beretta mm out of its holster and placed it on the seat next to him he had a shotgun in the trunk but it might as well be in canada for all the good it would do him if there were two or less in the car he might take them if more they probably had uzis or mac machine guns and he would run the mexicans liked to have a crowd in on their hits burton made a quick right off the highway and stopped a block up a side street theo why hadnt he let skinner out at the cafe he hadnt been able to figure out the electric seat adjustment on the mercedes so he was driving with his knees up around the wheel anyway but now he had an eightypound dog in his lap and he had to whip his head from side to side to keep burtons caddy in sight the caddy made an abrupt turn off the highway and it was all theo could do to get the mercedes around the corner without screeching the tires by the time he could see around skinners head again the caddy was stopped only fifty yards ahead theo ducked quickly onto the passenger seat and tried to call on the force to steer as they passed the caddy the sheriff sheriff john burton was prepared for a confrontation with dea agents he was prepared for a highspeed escape he was even prepared for a shootout with mexican drug dealers if it came to that he prided himself on being tough and adaptable and thought himself superior to other men because of his cool response to pressure he was however not prepared to see a mercedes cruise by with a labrador retriever at the wheel his ubermensch arrogance shriveled as he stared gapejawed at the passing mercedes it made an erratic turn at the next corner bouncing off a curb before disappearing behind a hedge he wasnt the sort of man who doubted his own perceptionsif he saw it he saw itso his mind dropped into politician mode to file the experience that right there he said aloud is why i will never support a bill to license dogs to drive still political certainties werent going to count for much if he didnt get to betsy butler and find out what had happened to his prized drug mule he pulled a uturn and headed back to the coast highway where he found himself looking a little more closely than usual at the drivers in oncoming cars molly there were thirty of them all together six stood side by side at the cave entrance the rest crowded behind them trying to get a look inside molly recognized the one doing the talking she was the ditzy waitress from hps cafe she was in her midtwenties with short blonde hair and a figure that promised to go pearshaped by the time she hit forty she wore a white choir robe over jeans and aerobics shoes youre betsy from hps right molly asked leaning on her broadsword betsy seemed to recognize molly for the first time youre the craz molly held up her sword to hush the girl be nice sorry said betsy weve been called i didnt expect you to be here two women stepped up beside betsy the pastel church ladies that molly had chased away from the dragon trailer remember us molly shook her head what exactly do you all think you are doing here they looked to each other as if the question hadnt occurred to them before this they craned their necks and squinted into the cathedral chamber to see what was behind molly steve lay curled up in the dark at the back of the chamber sulking molly turned and spoke to the back of the chamber steve did you bring these people here what were you thinking a loud and lowpitched whimper came out of the dark the crowd at the entrance murmured among themselves suddenly a man stepped forward and pushed betsy aside he was in his forties and wore an african dashiki over khakis and birkenstocks his long hair held out of his face with a beaded headband look man you cant stop us theres something very special and very spiritual happening here and were not going to let some crazy woman keep us from being part of it so just back off molly smiled you want to be a part of this do you yeah thats right the man said the others nodded behind him fine i want you all to empty your pockets before you come in here leave your keys wallets money everything outside we dont have to do that betsy said molly stepped up and thrust her sword into the ground between the girls feet okay then naked molly said what no one comes in here unless they are naked now get to it protests arose until a short asian man with a shaved head shrugged off his saffron robes stepped forward and bowed to molly thus mooning the rest of the group molly shook her head dolefully at the monk i thought you guys had more sense then she turned to the back of the cave and shouted hey steve cheer up i brought home chinese for lunch twentysix val and gabe entered the bar then stepped out of the doorway and stood by the blinking pinball machine while their eyes adjusted to the darkness val wrinkled her nose at the hangover smell of stale beer and cigarettes gabe squinted at the sticky floor looking for signs of interesting wild life morning was the darkest part of a day at the head of the slug saloon it was so dark that the dingy confines of the bar seemed to suck light in from the street every time someone opened the door causing the daytime regulars to cringe and hiss as if a touch of sunshine might vaporize them on their stools mavis moved behind the bar with a grim if wobbly determination drinking coffee from a gargoylegreen mug while a tarryton extra long dangled from her lips dropping long ashes down the front of her sweater like the smoking turds of tiny ghost poodles she went about setting up shots of cheap bourbon at the empty curve of the bar lining them up like soldiers before a firing squad every two or three minutes an old man would enter the bar bent over and wearing baggy pantsleaning on a fourpoint cane or the last hope of a painless deathand climb onto one of the empty stools to wrap an arthritic claw around a shot glass and raise it to his lips the shots were nursed not tossed back and by the time mavis had finished her first cup of coffee the curve of the bar looked like the queue to hell crooked wheezing geezers all in a row refreshments while you wait the reaper will see you now occasionally one of the shots would sit untouched the stool empty and mavis would let an hour pass before sliding the shot down to the next daytime regular and calling theo to track down her truant most often the ambulance would slide in and out of town as quiet as a vulture riding a thermal and mavis would get the news when theo cracked the door shook his head and moved on hey cheer up mavis would say you got a free drink out of it didnt you that stool wont be empty for long there had always been daytime regulars there always would be her new crop started coming in around am younger men who bathed and shaved every third day and spent their days around her snooker table drinking cheap drafts and keeping a laser focus on the green felt lest they get a glimpse of their lives where once were wives and jobs now were dreams of glorious shots and clever strategies when their dreams and eyesight faded they filled the stools at the end of the bar with the daytime regulars ironically the aura of despair that hung over the daytime regulars gave mavis the closest thing to a thrill shed felt since she last whacked a cop with her louisville slugger as she pulled the bottle of old tennis shoes from the well and poured it down the bar to refill their shot glasses a bolt of electric loathing would shoot up her spine and she would scamper back to the other end of the bar and stand there breathless until her stereo pacemakers brought her heartbeat back down from redline it was like tweaking deaths nose sticking a kick me sign on the head of a cobra and getting away with it gabe and val watched this ritual without moving from their spot by the pinball machine val was cautious just waiting for the right moment to move to the bar and ask if theo had called gabe was as usual just being socially awkward mavis retreated to her spot by the coffeepot presumably out of deaths reach and called down to the couple you two want something to drink or you just windowshopping gabe led them down the bar two coffees please he looked quickly to val for her approval but she was fixated on catfish who was seated across from mavis near the end of the bar just beyond him was another man an incredibly gaunt gentleman whose skin was so white it appeared translucent under the haze of maviss cigarette smoke hello uh mr fish val said catfish who was staring at the bottom of a shot glass looked up and forced a smile through a face betraying hangdog sorrow its jefferson he said catfish is my first name sorry val said mavis made a mental note of the new couple she recognized gabe hed been in with theophilus crowe a number of times but the woman was a new face to her she put the two coffees in front of gabe and val mavis sand mavis said but she didnt offer her hand for years shed avoided shaking hands because the grip often hurt her arthritis now with her new titanium joints and levers she had to be careful not to crush the delicate phalanges of her customers im sorry gabe said mavis this is dr valerie riordan she has a psychiatric practice here in town mavis stepped back and val could see the apparatus in the womans eye focusingwhen the light from over the snooker table caught it right the eye appeared to glow red pleased mavis said you know howard phillips mavis nodded to the gaunt man at the end of the bar hp gabe added nodding to howard of hps cafe howard phillips might have been forty or sixty or seventy or he might have died young for all the animation in his face he wore a black suit out of the nineteenth century right down to the button shoes and he was nursing a glass of guinness stout although he didnt look as if hed had any caloric intake for months val said we just came from your restaurant lovely place without changing expression howard said as a psychiatrist does it bother you that jung was a nazi sympathizer he had a flat upperclass british accent and val felt vaguely as if shed just been spat upon ray of sunshine howard is mavis said looks like death dont he howard cleared his throat and said mavis has come to mock death since most of her mortal parts have been replaced with machinery mavis leaned into gabe and val as if guarding a secret even as she raised her voice to make sure howard could hear hes been cranky for some ten years nowand drunk most of that time i had hoped to develop a laudanum habit in the tradition of byron and shelley howard said but procurement of the substance is to say the least difficult yeah that month you drank nyquil on the rocks didnt help either hed drop off at the bar stool sittin straight up sit there asleep sometimes for four hours then wake up and finish his drink i have to say though howard you never coughed once again mavis leaned into the bar he pretends to have consumption sometimes im sure the good doctor is not interested in the particulars of my substance abuse mavis actually gabe said were just waiting for a call from theo and i think id prefer a bloody mary to coffee val said yall aint goin to talk me into chasin no monster so dont even try catfish said i got the blues on me and i got some drinkin to do dont be a wuss catfish mavis said as she mixed vals cocktail monsters are no big deal howard and me got one huh howard walk in the proverbial park howard said catfish val and gabe just stared at howard waiting mavis said course your drinking started right after the last one didnt it nonstop howard said theo it occurred to theo as he tried to keep a safe distance from the sheriffs caddy turning into the ranch that he had never been trained in the proper procedure for tailing someone hed never really followed anyone well there was a sixthmonth period in the seventies when he had followed the grateful dead around the country but with them you just followed the trail of tiedye and didnt have to worry about them killing you if they found out you were behind them he also realized that he had no idea why exactly he was following burton except that it seemed more aggressive than curling into a ball and dying of worry the black caddy turned through a cattle gate onto the section of the ranch adjacent the ocean theo slowed to a stop under a line of eucalyptus trees beside the ranch road keeping the sheriff in sight between the tree trunks the grassy marine terrace that dropped to the shoreline was too open to go onto without burton noticing he would have to let the caddy pass over the next hill nearly half a mile off the road before he dared follow theo watched the caddy bump over the deep ruts in the road the front wheels throwing up mud as it climbed the hill and suddenly he regretted not having driven the red fourwheeldrive truck the rearwheeldrive mercedes might not be able to follow much farther when the caddy topped the hill theo pulled out and gunned the mercedes through the cattle gate and into the field tall grass thrashed at the underside of the big german car as rocks and holes jarred theo and threw skinner around like a toy momentum carried them up the side of the first hill as they approached the crest theo let off the gas the mercedes settled to a stop when he applied the gas again the back wheels of the mercedes dug into the mud stuck theo left skinner and the keys in the car and ran to the top of the hill he could see more than a mile in every direction east to some rock outcroppings by the tree line west to the ocean and across the marine terrace to the north which curved around the coastline and out of sight south well hed come from the south nothing there but his cabin and beyond that the crank lab what he could not see was the black cadillac he checked the battery in his cell phone and both pistols to see that they were loaded then he set out on foot toward the rocks it was the only place the caddy could have gotten out of sight burton had to be there twenty minutes later he stood at the base of the rock outcroppings sweating and trying to catch his breath at least maybe hed get some lung capacity back now that he wasnt smoking pot anymore he bent over with his hands on his knees and scanned the rocks for any movement these were no gentle sedimentary rocks formed over centuries of settling seas these craggy bastards looked like gray teeth that had been thrust up through the earths crust by the violent burp of a volcano and the rasping shift of a fault line lichen and seagull crap covered their surfaces and here and there a creosote bush or cypress tried to gain a foothold in the cracks there was supposed to be a cave around here somewhere but theo had never seen it and he doubted that it was big enough to park a cadillac in he stayed low moving around the edge of the rocks expecting to see the flash of a black fender at every turn he drew his service revolver and led around each turn with the barrel of the gun then changed his strategy that was like broadcasting a warning he bent over double before peeking around the next corner figuring that if burton heard him or was waiting he would be aiming high the vastness of what theo didnt know about surveillance and combat techniques seemed to be expanding with every step he just wasnt a sneaky guy he skirted a narrow path between two fanglike towers of rock as he prepared to take a quick peek around the next turn his foot slipped sending a pile of rocks skittering down the hill like broken glass he stopped and held his breath listening for the sound of a reaction somewhere in the rocks there was only the crashing surf in the distance and a low whistle of coastal wind he ventured a quick glance around the rock and before he could pull back the metallic click of a gun cocking behind his head sounded like icicles being driven into his spine molly molly was sorting through the piles of clothing the pilgrims had left by the cave entrance she had come up with two hundred and fiftyeight dollars in cash a stack of gold cards and more than a dozen vials of antidepressants a voice in her head said you havent seen this many meds since you were on the lockdown ward they have a lot of gall calling you crazy the narrator was back and molly wasnt at all happy about it for the last few days her thinking had been incredibly clear yeah youre helping a lot with my mental health selfimage she said to the narrator i liked it better when it was just me and steve none of the pilgrims seemed to notice that molly was talking to herself they were all in some trancelike state stark naked seated in a semicircle around steve who lay in the back of the cave where it was dark with his head tucked under his forelegs flashing sullen colors across his flanks olive drab rust and blue so dark that it appeared more like an afterimage on the back of the eyelid than an actual color oh yeah you and steve the narrator said snidely theres a healthy couplethe two greatest hasbeens of all time hes sulking and youre robbing people who are even nuttier than you are now youre going to feed them to old lizard lick over there am not looks like none of these people has had any sun or exercise since high school gym class except for that guy who came in birkenstocks and he has that gandhitan vegetarian starvation stare that looks like hed slaughter a whole kindergarten for a pinks footlong with sauerkraut you feel okay about making them strip and prostrate themselves before the big guy i thought it would make them go away the lizard is using you we care about each other now just shut up im trying to think oh like youve been thinking so far molly shook her head violently to try and dislodge the narrator from her mind her hair whipped about her face and shoulders and stood out in a wild mess the narrator was quiet molly pulled a compact out of one of the pilgrims purses and looked at herself in the mirror she certainly couldnt have looked much crazier she braced for the narrators comment but it didnt come she tried to get in touch with the warm feeling that had been running through her since steve had appeared but it just wasnt there maybe the pilgrims were using up his energy maybe the magic had just passed she remembered sitting on a deck in malibu waiting for a producer who had just made love to her only to have his hispanic maid show up with a glass of wine and an apology that the mister had to go to the studio he very sorry you call him next week please molly had really liked the guy shed broken her foot kicking his spare ferrari as she left and had to eat painkillers through the filming of her next movie which eventually put her in detox she never heard from the producer again that was being used this was different right said the narrator sarcastically shhhhh molly said she heard someone scuffling on the rocks outside the cave she snatched up the assault rifle and waited just inside the cave mouth twentyseven val val was wishing she had a video recorder to preserve the gargantuan lie that mavis sand and howard phillips had been telling over the last hour according to them ten years ago the village of pine cove had been visited by a demon from hell and only through the combined effort of a handful of drunks were they able to banish the demon whence it came it was a magnificent delusion and val thought that she could at least get an academic paper on shared psychosis out of it being around gabe had ignited her enthusiasm for research when mavis and howard wrapped up their story catfish started in with his tale of being pursued through the bayou by a sea monster soon gabe and val were spouting the details of gabes theory that the monster had evolved the ability to affect the brain chemistry of its prey tipsy after a few bloody marys and taken by the momentum of the tale val confessed her replacement of pine coves supply of antidepressants with placebos even as she unburdened herself val realized that her and gabes stories were no more credible than the fairy tale mavis and howard had just told that winston krauss is a weasel mavis said comes in here every day acting like his shit dont stink then overcharges the whole town for something they aint even gettin shoulda known he was a fishfucker thats in strictest confidence val said i shouldnt have mentioned it mavis cackled well it aint like im gonna run tell sheriff burton on you hes weasel with a capital weas besides girl you increased my business by eighty percent when you took the wackos off their drugs and i thought it was old mopey down there mavis shot a bionic thumb toward catfish the bluesman put down his drink hey gabe said so you believe that there really is a sea monster on that ranch what reason would you have to lie said howard it would seem that mr fish is an eyewitness as well jefferson catfish said catfish jefferson shut up you chickenshit mavis spat you could have helped theo when he asked you whats that boy think hes doing following that sheriff out to the ranch anyway its not like he can do anything gabe said we dont know he just left and told us to come here and wait for his call yall some heartless souls catfish said i lost me a good woman because of all this shes smarter than she looks mavis said theo has my mercedes val added feeling out of place even as she said it suddenly she felt more ashamed of looking down on these people than she did about all of her professional indiscretions im getting worried said gabe its been over an hour i dont suppose you thought about calling him mavis asked you have his cell phone number gabe asked hes the constable its not like hes unlisted i suppose i should have thought of that said howard mavis shook her head and one of her false eyelashes sprung up like a snare trap what you three got thirty years of college between you and not enough smarts to dial a phone without a blueprint astute observation howard said i aint got no college catfish said well cheers to you for being just naturally stupid mavis said picking up the phone the daytime regulars at the end of the bar had snapped out of their malaise to have a laugh at catfish theres nothing quite so satisfying to the desperate as having someone to look down on theo the gun barrel was pushed so hard into the spot behind theos ear that he thought he could hear bone cracking burton reached around and took the and tossed it aside then he took the automatic from theos waistband and did the same on the ground facedown burton kicked theos feet out from under him then put his knee in the constables back and handcuffed him theo could taste blood where his lip had split hitting the rock he turned his head to the side raking his cheek on some lichen he was terrified every muscle in his body ached with the need to run burton smacked him across the back of the head with his pistol not hard enough to knock him out but when the whitehot light of the blow faded theo could feel blood oozing into his right ear you fucking stoner how dare you fuck with my business what business theo said hoping ignorance might buy his life i saw your car at the lab crowe the last time i talked to leander he was on his way to see you now where is he i dont know the pistol smacked theo on the other side of the head i dont fucking know theo shrieked he was at the lab then he was gone i didnt see him leave i dont care if hes alive or dead crowe and it doesnt make any difference to you either but i need to know did you kill him did he run what i think hes dead you think theo could feel burton rearing back to hit him again no hes dead hes dead i know it what happened theo tried to think of a plausible explanation something that would buy him a minute a few more seconds even but he couldnt clear his head im not sure he said ii heard gunfire i was in the shed when i came out he was gone then how do you know hes dead theo couldnt see any advantage to telling burton that molly had told him burton would track her down and put her in the same shallow grave that he was going to end up in fuck you theo said figure it out the pistol whipped across the back of theos head and he nearly passed out this time he heard a ringing in his ears but a second later he realized that it wasnt in his ears at all his cell phone was ringing in his shirt pocket burton rolled him over and put the barrel of the gun on theos right eyelid were going to answer this crowe and if you fuck up the calling party is going to hear a very loud disconnect the sheriff bent down until his face was almost touching theos and reached for the phone suddenly a series of deafening explosions went off a few feet away and bullets whined off the rocks like angry wasps burton rolled off theo and into a shallow crevice just below them theo felt someone grab his collar and pull him to his feet before he could see who it was a dozen hands closed on him and dragged him out of the sun he fell hard on his back and the gunfire stopped his phone was still ringing a cloud of bats was swirling above him he looked up to see molly michon standing over him with a smoking assault rifle and in that second she looked like what he had always imagined an avenging angel might look like except for the six naked white guys standing behind her hi theo she said hi molly molly pointed to the phone in his shirt pocket with the barrel of her rifle you want me to get that yeah it might be important theo said there was a gunshot and a bullet whined off the edge of the cave entrance and ricocheted into the darkness theo could feel the roar that rose up out of the back of the cave vibrating in his ribs the sheriff burton reached over the edge of the crevice and fired a shot in the general direction of the cave then braced himself for return fire from the ak but instead he heard a roaring that sounded like someone had dropped the entire cast of the lion king in a deep fryer burton was not a coward not by any means but a man would have to be insane not to be frightened by that noise too much weirdness too fast a woman in a leather bikini and thighhigh boots firing an ak while six naked guys dragged crowe into a cave he needed time to regroup call in backup drink a fifth of glenlivet it seemed safe here for the time being as long as he didnt move no one could get a firing angle on him without making a target of himself he pulled his cell phone from his jacket pocket then paused trying to figure out who to call a general officerintrouble call could bring anyone and the last thing he needed was television helicopters hovering around besides his goal wasnt to arrest the suspects he needed them silenced for good he could call in the guys from the crank lab if he could get hold of them but the vision of a bunch of untrained illegal immigrants running around on this hill with automatic weapons didnt seem like the best strategy either he had to call swat but only his guys eight of the twenty men on the swat team were in his pocket again he couldnt go through dispatch theyd have to be called in on private lines he dialed the number that rang into the information center deep in the basement of the county justice building the spider picked up on the first ring nailsworth its burton listen dont talk call lopez sheridan miller morales ohara crumb connelly and lemay tell them to come in full swat to the beer bar ranch north of pine cove the northern access road theres a cave here pull up whatever maps you need and give them directions do not use open channels they are not to log in or report to anyone where they are going there are at least two suspects in the cave with automatic weapons im pinned down about ten yards from the westfacing entrance have them meet south of the rocks theyll see them then have sheridan call me no aircraft find out if theres another entrance to this cave i need everyone in place asap can you do it of course the spider said its going to take them a minimum of forty minutes maybe more if i cant find them all burton could hear the spiders fat fingers blazing on his keyboard already send whoever you can find tell them to come in separate cars tell them to avoid sirens if possible on the way up definitely once they hit the ranch do you have descriptions of the suspects its theophilus crowe and a woman fiveeight one twenty twentyfive to forty years old gray hair wearing a leather bikini twentyfive to forty pretty specific the spider said sarcastically fuck you nailsworth how many women do you think are running around these hills wearing a leather bikini and shooting an ak call me when they are on the way burton disconnected and checked the battery on the phone it would last since the roaring sound had come from the cave it had been quiet but he didnt dare peek over the edge of the crevice crowe he shouted its not too late to work this out theo the naked guys were standing over theo wearing dazed smiles as if theyd all just shared a big pipe of opium jesus was that it theo asked steves roar still ringing in his ears him molly corrected holding up a finger to shush theo as she pressed the answer button on his phone hello she said into the phone none of your business who is this she covered the mouthpiece and said its gabe tell him im okay ask him where he is theo says hes okay where are you she listened for a second then covered the mouthpiece again hes at the slug tell him ill call him right back hell call you back she disconnected and tossed the phone in the pile of clothing by the door theo looked up at the naked guys he thought he recognized a couple of them but didnt want to acknowledge that he did would you guys back off a little theo said they didnt move theo looked at molly can you tell them to go somewhere theyre making me nervous why molly i dont know if youve notice but all these guys are in aa state of arousal maybe theyre just glad to see you would you tell them to back off please molly motioned for the naked guys to move away go go back to the back of the cave guys go go go she poked at a couple of them with the assault rifle slowly they turned and ambled farther back into the cave what in the hell is wrong with them what do you mean wrong theyre acting like all guys do theyre just being more honest about it molly seriously what did you do to them i didnt do anything thats how theyve been acting since they saw steve back there theo looked to the back of the cave but could only see the partially lit backs of a group of people sitting on the cave floor its like theyre in a trance or something yeah isnt it cool they came to help me get you when i asked though so theyre not total zombies im like in charge blood was dripping out of theos scalp matting his hair and leaving spots on his shirt thats great molly could you get these handcuffs off me i was going to ask you about those every time i see you youre in handcuffs do you have a fetish or something please molly theres a key in my front pocket he gave you the key its my key i see molly said with a knowing smile handcuffs all use the same key molly please help me get out of these she knelt and reached into his pocket keeping her eyes locked on his through the process his head throbbed when he rolled over so she could get to the cuffs as she pulled them off they heard burton call from outside crowe its not too late to work this out once his hands were free theo threw his arms around molly and pulled her close she dropped her rifle and returned his embrace another roar emanated from the back of the cave a couple of the pilgrims shrieked and molly let go of theo and stood up gazing back into the darkness its okay steve she said what in the hell was that burton shouted from outside that was steve molly shouted back you were asking what happened to joseph leander well that was it steve ate him how many of you are in there burton asked molly looked around a bunch who in the hell are you i am kendra warrior babe of the outland she shot a silly grin at theo who was trying to follow what was going on up here while listening to some disturbing stirring noises going on in the back of the cave what do you want burton asked without a beat molly said ten percent of the gross on all my films retroactive fifteen years an industrialstrength weedwhacker with gas and world peace seriously we can work this out okay i want sixty peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a couple of gallons of diet coke and she turned to theo you want anything theo shrugged hell as long as they were stalling a new volvo station wagon and a new volvo station wagon molly shouted and we want it with two cup holders you bastard or the deals off she turned and beamed at theo nice touch you deserve it molly said suddenly her eyes went wide as she looked past theo no steve she screamed theo rolled over to see a huge pair of jaws descending over him twentyeight the sheriff to burton it sounded like there could be thirty or forty people wailing in the cave let alone whatever was making the roaring noise it might not be as easy to get rid of witnesses as hed thought if all the people hed passed on the road earlier were in the cave the swat snipers were going to have their work cut out for them one thing was for sure he couldnt let crowe and this woman whoever she was leave the ranch alive his cell phone rang and he pushed the answer button what he set his gun down and covered his ear to shut out the noise from the cave nailsworth here the spider said theyre on the way give it forty minutes and theres no other entrance to that cave burton was not happy having to lie in this crevice for another forty minutes but once the swat team arrived it would be over nailsworth shot in the dark here but have you ever heard of someone calling themselves kendra warrior babe of the wasteland the outland the spider corrected warrior babe of the outland of course only the finest series of nukedout future movies ever made kendras a huge star was a huge star molly michon was the actresss name why never mind one of the suspects thinks shes a comedian if you want some of the cassettes i can let you have some copies for twenty bucks apiece ive got almost the whole collection nailsworth youre a pathetic piece of shit burton disconnected the wailing was still coming from the cave and the woman was screaming something he couldnt make out molly theos sneakers were still showing sticking out between steves teeth molly grabbed her broadsword ran up the sea beasts foreleg and leapt onto his broad neck she brought the broadsword down hard between his eyes and the impact made her hands go numb spit him out spit him out steve tossed his head trying to throw her off but she gripped him with her thighs and hacked away at his head chunks of his scales flew off and the blade sparked spit him out spit him out molly screamed punctuating the panicked chant with blows from the sword shed seen this before she knew that if she heard a crunch theo was finished the sea beast opened his jaws to deliver the coup de grace and molly could hear a gurgling scream come from theo she leapt to her feet on steves forehead put the tip of the broadsword in the corner of his eye and prepared to leap on the hilt to drive it into his eye socket spit him out now steve went crosseyed trying to see his attacker then made a grunting noise and hacked the constable out on the cave floor he whipped his head and molly went fly ing hitting her back hard on the cave wall ten feet away and sliding down the pilgrims wails turned to sobs as steve slunk to the back of the cave theo mired in a puddle of blood bat guano and dragon spit pushed himself up on his hands and knees and looked to molly you okay he gasped she nodded i think so you theo nodded and looked down to make sure his legs were still there yeah he crawled over to her and sat back against the cave wall beside her still heaving to get his breath back nice friends you have whyd he stop i think his feelings are hurt sorry hell get over it hes a big boy despite himself theo started laughing and before long he and molly were leaning against each other giggling uncontrollably steve huh theo said he looks like a steve dont you think molly said theo wiped the dragon spit from his mouth and leaned over to kiss her she caught his chin in her hand and pushed him away bad idea another roar rose from the back of the cave this one less angry and more sad than the last i guess so theo said what in the hell is going on in there crowe burton called from outside you dont have a lot of time to dick around here theres a swat team on the way what do you want i dont even know what the hell youre talking about theo shouted what do you want to walk away from this leave the state forget everything how much give me a figure theo looked at molly as if she might have the answer she said i thought we made our demands pretty clear hes not going to let me go molly and now hes not going to let you go either if theres a swat team on the way were in big trouble i need to go talk to steve molly stood and walked between the sobbing pilgrims to the back of the cave theo watched her fade into the dark where the sea beast was pulsing with dim spots of green and blue theo rubbed his eyes to try to clear his vision well crowe whatll it be make me an offer theo said trying to figure out some kind of insurance something that would keep him alive more than two seconds after he stepped out of the cave ill give you a hundred thousand its a fair offer crowe you cant prove anything anyway not if leander is dead take the money and walk away im dead theo said to himself the size of the bluff offer itself betrayed burtons seriousness there was no way he was letting theo get away alive well talk it over theo shouted his head was throbbing from the pistol whipping hed taken and the vision in his left eye was blurry his cell phone chirped from within the pile of pilgrims clothing and he scrambled through the clothes and pill bottles to find it his vision went black with the movement and he had to steady himself until it cleared he found the phone nestled in a pair of panty hose and hit the answer button steve he knew an enemy when he saw one he could sense waves of aggression and fear coming from them and he had felt those things coming from his warmblood lover he could feel the fear even now as she approached him through the feeder people why if she was going to find another mate did she go to the trouble of unwrapping the feeder people for him he didnt mind being hit with the sharp thing that felt good he thought she wanted to mate again but when she put it in his eye he knew she would have killed him he felt it she had turned her loyalties to another he considered biting off her head to show her how badly he felt he tucked his head under his foreleg as she approached she rubbed his gill tree and he sent a bolt of scarlet over his back to tell her to stop im sorry steve i dont have many friends i couldnt let you eat theo he could sense benevolence in her tone but he didnt trust her now maybe he would just bite off an arm as a test his back pulsed magenta and blue you have to go steve theres a swat team coming you can get past that guy outside without a problem in fact you can eat that guy outside if you want in fact id really appreciate it if youd eat that guy outside she stepped back from him steve you have to get out of here or theyre going to kill you he pulsed a dull olive drab to her and tucked his head farther under his foreleg she wanted him to go away he could feel it and he wanted to go away but he didnt want her to want him to go away he knew she could never be what he wanted and he understood never now but he didnt want the warmblood to have her either colors ran like sorrow over his scales im not rejecting you molly said im trying to save your life she pushed through the pilgrims who were all on their knees sobbing and one woman a thirtyish redhead with gravitydefying fake breasts grabbed her arm i can sacrifice the woman said i can molly pulled her arm away from the woman fuck off lady molly said martyrdoms easy it comes with the plumbing theo it was only when he answered the cell phone that theo realized one of burtons blows had caught him on the ear ouch goddamn it ouch theo limped around in a circle despite the fact that his limbs werent injured at all theo gabe said his voice tinny in the receiver yeah its me theo changed the phone to his other ear but still held it a few inches away now that it had bitten him once where are you who answered your phone that was molly michon were in that cave up on the ranch where the mushroom farm used to be burton has us pinned in here and hes called in a swat team have you seen it yeah ive seen it gabe i think you were right about the brain chemistry thing theres a bunch of people here all tranced out saying they were called to give sacrifice they all have prescriptions written by val wow gabe said wow whats it look like its large gabe could you be more specific look gabe we need some help burton is going to kill us i need witnesses up here so he cant claim that we fired on his men call the tv station and the paper get a news helicopter up here theo felt molly grab his shoulder he turned to see her shaking her head just a second gabe he covered the mouthpiece with his hand no reporters theo why not because if they find out about steve theyll put him in a cage or kill him no reporters no cameras she gripped his shoulder until it hurt and tears welled up in her eyes please theo nodded gabe he said into the phone forget the reporters no news people no cameras you guys come though i need witnesses here that dont work for burton you said there were a bunch of people there theyre all out of it i dont think theyre worth a damn besides theyre naked there was a pause gabe said why are they naked theo looked to molly why are they naked to deter them from coming into the cave to deter them from coming into the cave theo said into the phone well that didnt work very well did it gabe said why didnt she scare them off with the creature thats what ive been telling you gabe theyre here to be with the creature fascinating and molly has control over him theo looked at the dragon spit running down his jeans not exactly gabe please bring val and get your ass up here you can claim to be here for scientific reasons or something val can say shes a trained hostage negotiator these people are her patients that should help her credibility bring as many people as you can molly grabbed theos arm again and shook her head just the people who already know theo cursed under his breath scratch that gabe just you and val dont tell anyone else mavis and howard and catfish know already just them please gabe borrow maviss car and get up here theo this isnt going to help you much we might keep you from getting killed but burton is still going to arrest you guys you know it and once he gets you in his jail well you know one thing at a time theo weve got to preserve that creature this is the greatest gabe theo interrupted im trying to preserve my ass get going please youve got to get that creature out of there theo they might not shoot you if there are witnesses but they wont let the creature go he wont move hes in the back of the cave sulking sulking i dont know gabe just come okay theo disconnected and sat down to molly he said gabes right we may just be delaying the inevitable by bringing in witnesses maybe we should rush burton before swat gets here molly picked up the ak from the floor released the clip and tilted it so theo could see it was empty bad idea the head of the slug hostage negotiator val riordan said i did my residency in eating disorders the closest ive ever come to a hostage negotiation is talking a sugarjagged actress out of purging fourteen quarts of ben jerrys monkey chunks after she lost her part on baywatch that counts said gabe hed related everything that theo had told him and was ready to run to the rescue but val was reluctant i believe the flavor is chunky monkey hp said whatever said val i dont see why theo needs us if hes got a whole cave full of my patients gabe was trying to be patient but he could feel a clock ticking in the back of his brain each tick taking away his chance to save his friend and lay eyes on a living specimen from the cretaceous period i told you theo says theyre out of it perfectly logical said hp how so asked val obviously irritated at the stuffy restaurateurs tone the tradition of making sacrifice is as old as man it may be more than just a tradition the babylonians sacrificed to the serpent tiamet the aztecs and mayans sacrificed to serpent gods perhaps this creature was the serpent to which they sacrificed thats ridiculous val said this thing eats people hp chuckled people have been loving vengeful gods for thousands of years whos to say it isnt the vengeance that inspires that love perhaps as dr fenton has pointed out there is some symbiotic relationship between the hunting habits of this creature and the brain chemistry of its prey perhaps it inspires love as well as sexual stimulation that feeling neednt be reciprocal you know he could be as oblivious to his worshippers as any other god he takes the sacrifices as his due with no responsibility on his part thats a steamin bag of dog snot if i ever heard it catfish spouted i been near this thing and it aint never done nothin but scare the daylights out of me is that right mr fish hp said isnt it true that your fear of this creature has inspired a lifelong career in music perhaps you owe thanks to this beast i owe yall a ride to the booby hatch thass what i owe enough gabe shouted im going you can come or you can stay but im going to help theo and see if i can keep that creature alive mavis can i borrow your car mavis threw her keys on the bar wish i was going with you kid may i join you hp asked gabe nodded and looked at val they are your patients she pressed her back against the bar this is all going to blow up and when it all comes out im going to go to jail i should help with that yes said gabe why because its the right thing to do and because its important to me and you love me val stared at him then dragged her purse off the bar ill go but you will all be getting hate mail from me when im in jail mavis looked at catfish well yall go on i got the blues on me they started out the door dont you worry honey mavis called after them youre not going to jail mavis will see to it twentynine gabe up until the time that steve had come to town the most fearsome prehistoric beast on the central coast was mavis sands cadillac convertible it was lemonpie yellow with a great chrome grill that seemed to slurp at the road as it passed and goldplated curb feelers that vibrated in the wind like springloaded whiskers the daytime regulars called it the banana and in a fit of ambition had once even fashioned a giant blue chiquita emblem which they stuck on the trunk lid while mavis was working well mavis said more than somewhat surprised by their efforts it aint the first banana ive rode but it takes the size record by at least a foot even in his youth gabe had never driven anything like the banana before it steered like a barge and it rocked and lurched over dips and potholes like a foundering scow gabe had activated the electric top when theyd first climbed in and hadnt figured out how to put it back up gabe spotted vals mercedes parked on the side of a hill off the main ranch road there were six other vehicles parked next to it all fourwheeldrive sport utility vehicles two blazers and two larger suburbans a group of men in black jumpsuits were standing by the vehicles the tallest watching them through binoculars and talking on a radio or cell phone maybe we should have taken a more inconspicuous vehicle gabe said why didnt we take your car howard val asked she was slouched in the passenger seat howard sat in the back as stiff as a mannequin squinting as if this was his first exposure ever to sunlight i own a jaguar superior coach works none like them in the world outside of bentley and rolls walnut burl on all the interior surfaces doesnt run huh sorry said howard gabe stopped the banana at the cattle gate what should i do theyre watching us go on up there val said thats why were here she had gotten brave all of a sudden gabe wasnt quite so selfassured someone tell me again why the sheriff wont just shoot us along with theo and molly val was getting into the spirit of the thing realizing that this might be the only way to atone for what shed done to her patients im a psychiatrist gabe and you have a phd the police dont shoot people like us youre kidding right howard said does one require an advanced degree to be immune to gunfire or does a life of scholarship count as well go gabe val said well be fine gabe looked over at her and she smiled at him he smiled back sort of and pulled the banana into the pasture toward five heavily armed men who did not look happy to see them theo theo had searched the rest of the cave using the disposable lighter hed forgotten to abandon with the rest of his pot habit the cathedral chamber was closed except for the entrance where burton waited theo gave the sea beast a wide clearance on his way back to molly who stood just inside the cave mouth burton shouted from outside crowe weve got your friends locked up this is your last chance to make a deal ill give you five minutes then were using gas theo turned to molly in a panic weve got to get these people out of here molly as soon as the first gas grenade comes in its all over dont we need hostages for what hes not going to negotiate the only thing he wants is meand probably youdead why dont you call someone and tell them what you know then burton wont have a reason to kill us all i know is what ive seen with leander dead theres no one to connect him to the labs ive already told val and gabe now hes got them i was an idiot to bring them into this sorry molly said wait theo flipped open his phone and dialed the phone rang eight times and theo was glancing at the battery gauge which showed only a quartercharge when a man answered nailsworth the spider said leaving the caller to guess that they had contacted the sheriffs departments information officer nailsworth its theo crowe i need your help having a bad day theo what a prick theo thought listen im trapped i know where you are theo remember i know ev erything actually im glad you called i had something i wanted to ask you about theo fought the urge to scream at the megalomaniacal geek please nailsworth i dont know how long this battery is going to hold out i need you to do me a favor me first go theo barked well when burton called me he mentioned that your accomplice said she was kendra warrior babe of the outland so i started looking around turns out there was a molly michon admitted to county psychiatric a few times she left a pine cove address i wondered if its her theo said wow youre kidding no way shes right here theo looked at molly and shrugged look you warned me not to go on the ranch you know about burtons crank network i might nailsworth said dont be coy you know everything but what i need to know is do you have access to information that could be used as evidencemoney transfers checks offshore accounts phone records and suchstuff you could give to the state attorney why theo youre starting to sound like a cop can you get it theo theo theo dont be silly not only can i get it but ive had it ive been compiling a file for years can you get it to the attorney generals office right now whats in it for me nailsworth hes going to kill us kendra is right there with you huh i cant believe it theo shuddered halfway between panic and anger he held the phone out to molly say something kendralike molly cleared her throat and said die you scumsucking mutant pig the only thing of mine youll feel is cold steel oh my god its her the spider said yeah it is theo said now will you help i want a copy of the norwegian battle babes can i get one theo covered the receiver and looked at molly norwegian battle babes molly smiled kendra vi battle babes in the hot oil arena the norwegian version is the only version that has full nudity in all the arena scenes its very rare theos mouth had dropped open his survival had come down to this so do you have a copy sure you got it theo said into the phone ill bring kendra naked and in person to your office if you get moving now i dont think so said molly ill send the file to sacramento the spider said but that wont do you any good even if you tell burton about it hes got you in a perfect situation to kill you anyway you need media media helicopters were too far north to get anyone here in time theo said no molly shouted ill call them the spider said hold them off for twenty minutes maybe twentyfive we dont have anything but naked people and a jealous sea monster to hold them off with is that more of your drug nomenclature the spider asked its what it is if they use gas we wont have twenty minutes they wont how do twentyfive minutes and battle babes better be in the original box the spider hung up theo clicked his phone closed i said no helicopters theo molly said even if we get out you know theyll hurt steve you need to call him and tell him no helicopters theo felt he was close to losing it he clenched his fists and tried very hard not to scream in her face his voice went to a whisper molly even with a warrant out for burton he will kill us if you want your dragon to live then youve got to get him out of here before they get here he wont leave he wont listen to me look at him he doesnt care about anything anymore sheridan sergeant rich sheridan was sixthree twothirty with dark hair a mustache and a long hooked nose that had been broken several times like the other men on the hill he was wearing body armor and a radio headset as well as a weapons belt he was the only one not holding his m instead he was talking on a cell phone he had been a cop for ten years and working for burton on the side for eight if this had been an official activation of special weapons and tactics he would have been second in command but as the real commander wasnt in burtons pocket sheridan was in charge he let the binoculars dangle around his neck and waited while his men got firing angles on all of the yellow cadillacs passengers before he approached sheriff burton was screaming at him on the cell phone im pinned down up here sheridan handle this and get your ass up here now yes sir what do you want me to do with them find out who they are then cuff them and leave them there and hurry sheridan hung up get out of the car keep your hands where i can see them the two men and a woman did as they were told and submitted to patdowns from sheridans men when they were handcuffed sheridan spun the younger man around who are you gabe fenton im a biologist gabe smiled weakly nice headsets you guys could all be standing by to take my subscription order for corruption weekly sheridan didnt react what are you doing here endangered species protection theres a very rare creature in that cave up there val winced were you supposed to tell him that she whispered how did you know to come here sheridan asked this is the habitat of the california redlegged frog very endangered i saw your swat vehicle go by and the driver had that i want to kill some rare frogs look in his eye gabe looked at one of the other swat guys a stocky hispanic man who was glaring at him over the sights of his m see theres that look right there we didnt bring the swat vehicle sheridan said flatly actually val jumped in im a clinical psychologist i have experience in hostage negotiation i heard the swat team being dispatched on my scanner at home and since youre so far north i thought you might need some help dr fenton agreed to ride along with me we werent dispatched over the radio sheridan said dismissing val as if she were an insect he looked at howard and you howard phillips im merely here to observe a hid eous ancient creature that has arisen from the darkest stygian depths to wreak havoc on civilization and feast on human flesh howard smiled the smile of an undertaker at the news of a big bus crash but a smile nonetheless sheridan stared blankly at hp saying nothing hes the caterer gabe said quickly we brought him along to get your order ill bet none of you guys remembered to pack a lunch did you who did you tell you were coming here gabe looked at val and howard for some clue as to the right answer no one he said sheridan nodded we are going to put you in the back of that truck over there for your own safety he said then to the others he said lock them in the k unit weve got to go thirty theo listen theo said cocking his ear toward the cave mouth vehicles the swat team is here molly glanced to the back of the cave from the light of the colors steve was flashing she could see that the pilgrims had surrounded the sea beast and were stroking his scales she turned back to theo youve got to stop the helicopters call them and stop it molly its not the news helicopters that will hurt him or us its those guys who just pulled up theo peeked out the mouth of the cave and saw two fourwheeldrives parking down on the marine terrace about a hundred yards from the cave mouth of course he thought they still think they need cover molly brandished her broadsword holding it only inches from theos stomach if hes hurt ill never forgive you theo crowe ill track you down to the ends of the earth and kill you like the radioactive scum that you are that kendra or molly talking i mean it she screamed almost hysterical now steve roared from the back of the cave dont go nuts on me molly im doing my best but the only thing your pal seems likely to do is eat me he doesnt seemed real motivated by anything else molly slumped to her knees and hung her head as if someone had sucked the energy out of her through a valve in her boot theo fought the urge to comfort her afraid that if he even touched her shoulder the sea beast might attack him then it hit him he flipped open his cell phone and dialed the head of the slug mavis mavis sand had spent a lifetime making mistakes and learning from them and that perspective made her feel as if she knew what was good for people better than they knew themselves consequently mavis was a meddler most of the time she was content to use information as her tool of choice and rumor as her means of delivery what someone knewand when they knew itcontrolled what they did the spider pulling digital strings from his basement web had exactly the same philosophy today shed had a heap of problems dumped on her none of them directly hers and she had been pondering them all morning without much luck in coming up with a way to manipulate the information to solve them then the call came from theo and it all clicked theo was right they could use the monsters instincts to get them out of the cave but if she played the mix right she could solve a couple of other problems as well she put down the phone and catfish said who that it was theo that ol dragon aint et him yet boy must be livin a charmed life mavis leaned over the bar close to catfish took his hand in hers and began squeezing sweetie put on your friendly persuasion hat i need you to run down to the pharmacy and pick up something for me yes maam catfish said wincing as the bones in his fingers compressed under her grip when the bluesman was gone mavis made a quick phone call then went to the back room and dug through boxes and filling cabinets until she came up with what she was looking for a small black box attached to a long cord with a cigarette lighter plug on the end dont worry theo she said to herself i put my life in the hands of machinery a long time ago and im doing just fine she giggled and it came out sounding like the starter cranking on a fuel dry ford catfish a bluesman hates to be told what to do authority rankles him inspires his rebellion and plays to his need to selfdestruct a bluesman doesnt take to having a boss unless hes on a chain gang for the chain gang boss ranks below only a mean old woman and a sweet young thing in the hierarchy of the blues muse followed closely by bad liquor a dead dog and the man catfish had a boss who was a mean old woman a distinct and disconcerting turn of the blues screw that might have driven a lesser bluesman to shoot hisself get shot get hold of some bad liquor or bust up his guitar and take a job down to the mill but catfish hadnt taken nigh unto eighty trips around that cruel cruel sun without gaining some perspective so he would go to the pharmacy as he was told he would talk to the fishfucking white boy with the combedover hair that waved in the air like the sprung lid on a bean can and when he was done he would pick up his pay from the mean old woman who was holding it hostage and he would get his wrinkly black ass out of this town and go nurse his heartbreak on the moving trap that was is and always shall be the road so catfish strolled a rolling delta moonwalk of a stroll redolent of sassafras and jive into pine cove drug and gift and the four bluehaired chicken women behind the counter nearly tumbled over each other trying to get to the back room imagine it a person of the dark persuasion in their midst what if he should ask for a vial of afrosheen or some other ethnically oriented product with which they were totally unfamiliar why the smoke alarms would melt screaming like dying witches when their collective minds steamed to a stop do we look like thrillseekers wasnt it enough that we had to put up that sign reading no habla espanol and acknowledge the existence of thirty percent of the population even in the negative no we shall err on the side of safety thank you and in lieu of sand in which to bury our heads we shall head into the back room winston krauss who was counting fake zolofts behind his glass wall looked up and saw catfish coming down the aisle toward the counter and immediately regretted that he hadnt installed bulletproof glass still winston was a man of the world and you dont indulge the fantasy of molesting dolphins without becoming familiar with the ways of people of color for that is who dolphins prefer to hang out with when they arent hanging out with the cousteaus or so it appeared on the discovery channel he stepped out of his booth and met catfish as he reached the counter good day me brothermon ye winston said in his best island dialect what can i be gettin for ye and there was that welcoming smile only a dreadlock and a white sand beach short of a travel poster catfish squinted removed his fedora ran a hand over his shining scalp stepped back turned his head to the side and studied the pharmacist for a moment then said i will slap the shit out of you you know that sorry winston said coughing somewhat as if trying to dislodge the errant jamaican from his throat what can i do for you sir mavis down to the slug sent me up to ax you somethin im familiar with her medical records winston said you can have her call me if she has a question yeah she dont want to call you she want you to come down to see her winston adjusted his bolo tie im sorry but youll have to have her call me i cant leave the store catfish nodded that what she thought youd say she say to ax you if she can have a big jar of them sugar pills you selling instead medicine winston glanced at the back room where his staff was huddled like anne frank and family peering out through the crack in the door tell her ill be right over winston said she said to wait and come with you winston was visibly sweating now oily beads rose on his scalp let me tell the staff where ill be hurry up flipper i aint got all day catfish said winston krauss shuddered hitched up his double knits and waddled around the counter ladies ill be back in few minutes he called over his shoulder catfish leaned over the counter to where he could see the row of eyes peering out of the crack and said i be back in a few minutes my own self ladies i needs some medicine what can help me with this huge black dick i have to carry around the weight of it like to break my back there was a collective intake of breath so abrupt that the drop in pressure sprung the barometer on the wall and made catfishs ears pop winston krauss turned and scowled at catfish was that really necessary mans got to look after his reputation catfish said the sheriff burton had them cover him while he moved down through the rocks and across the marine terrace to the blazers he found sheridan crouched behind the fender his m trained on the cave entrance rough morning sheriff sheridan said showing a hint of a smile at burtons disheveled suit burton looked around at the other team members who were all staring through rifle scopes at the cave entrance so we only have five morales is coaching peewee football today the others are on regular duty we couldnt pull them off burton scowled as far as i know they only have the one weapon but its a fully automatic ak i want two men on either side of the cave mouth one down in that crevice where i was pinned down can deliver the gas followed by concussion grenades ill stay here with a sniper rifle to take out anyone who gets past the entry crew shoot anything that moves lets go five minutes on my mark no gas sheridan said what no gas and no concussion you wanted us here without checking in that stuff is kept in the locker at county justice we just have the body armor and our own personal weapons burton looked around at the other men again you guys all have your own personal ms but no grenades yes sir so i have a standoff i had a standoff before sheridan a standoff doesnt do me any good come with me he pushed a fresh clip into his mm and turned to the others cover us burton led the swat commander to a spot in the rocks just below the cave mouth crowe burton called youve had enough time to consider my offer offer sheridan asked burton shushed him i havent decided yet theo shouted weve got thirty people in here to discuss it with and theyre not being cooperative sheridan looked at burton thirty people we cant shoot thirty people im not shooting any thirty people five minutes crowe burton said then you have no more options whats the offer sheridan whispered to the sheriff dont worry about it im just trying to get the subject separated from the hostages so we can take him out then wed better have a description of the suspect dont you think hes the one in handcuffs burton said well arent you the fucking hero sheridan shot back skinner skinner watched from the front seat of the mercedes as the food guy was loaded into the back of the suburban with the cage in it the bad guys hadnt even left the windows cracked how would the food guy breathe he wouldnt be able to sit in the front seat and put his head out the window either skinner was sad for the food guy he crawled in the backseat of the mercedes and lay down to nap away his anxiety the head of the slug the first thing catfish saw when he came through the doors of the head of the slug was estelle standing at the bar and he could feel the crust peeling off his heart like old paint her hair was down brushed out it hung to her waist she was wearing a pair of pink overalls that had been splattered with paint over a mans white tshirthis tshirt he realized she looked to him like what he always thought home was supposed to look like but as a bluesman he was bound by tradition to be cool hey girl what you doin here i called her mavis said this is your driver what i need a driver for ill tell you estelle took his hand and led him to a booth in the corner winston krauss came through the door a second later and mavis waved him over to the bar son im about to make you the happiest man in the whole world you are why because i like to see people get what they want and i have what you want you do mavis stepped up to the bar and in low conspiratorial tones began telling winston krauss the most titillating outrageously erotic tale that she had ever told trying the whole time to remember that the man she was talking to wanted to have sex with marine animals over in the corner booth catfishs modicum of cool had melted estelle was smiling even as tears welled up in her eyes i wouldnt ask you to do it if i thought it would put you in danger really i know that catfish said a gentleness in his voice that he usually reserved for kittens and traffic cops it just that i been runnin from this my whole life i dont think so estelle said i think youve been running to this catfish grinned you gonna take them old blues off me for good aint you you know it then lets go catfish stood up and turned to where mavis and winston stood we ready yall ready he noticed that the front of winstons trousers had become overly tight yeah you ready you sick but you ready mavis nodded a slight mechanical ratcheting noise coming from her neck take the second turn out not the first mavis said to estelle from there it hugs the coast so theres no hills i have to go get my mask and fins wailed winston thirtyone molly has it been five minutes yet molly was sitting crosslegged her sword held across her knees theo jumped as if hed been poked with an ice pick then checked his watch he crouched by the cave mouth listening for the sound of either salvation or death about a minute left where the hell are they molly maybe you should find some cover what cover she looked around the cave it was an open chamber the only cover would be the darkness in the back of the chamber get behind steve no molly said i wont do that she heard a voice come from the back of her mind get to cover you daffy broad what do you have a death wish i have abandonment issues im not going to turn around and abandon someone else molly said what theo said i wasnt talking to you fine die what do i care said the narrator bastard molly said what said theo not you molly how did you get those guys to come out and drag me into the cave before i just told them to well take their clothes back to them and tell them to get dressed why just do it and tell them to hang on to steves sides and not let go no matter what he does now whos nuts molly please im trying to save him the sheriff burton checked his watch thats it get into position were going in sergeant sheridan wasnt so sure they have thirty hostages and we dont have any recon of their positions and we dont have a full team you want to take this guy out with thirty witnesses goddamn it sheridan get your men in position we go on my signal sheriff burton theos voice from the cave what ill take your offer theo said give me five more minutes and ill come out we can all leave together the others will come out after youre gone you just want him anyway right sheridan said hes the only one that can hurt the operation burton turned it over in his mind hed been determined to take out the constable and the woman but now he had to rethink things if he could get crowe away from the others he could dispose of him with no witnesses burtons cell phone rang he flipped it open burton he said you shouldnt have made disparaging comments about my weight sheriff the spider said nailsworth you piece of sh the line went dead suddenly the sound of a wailing blues guitar came screaming over the marine terrace burton and the swat team turned to see an old white station wagon driving along the edge of the terrace next to where it dropped to the beach an inhuman roar rose up out of the cave and when burton looked back to the cave all he saw was a huge reptilian face coming at him winston krauss winston sat in the back of the station wagon steadying the marshall amplifier that was screaming out the notes from catfishs stratocaster the amp was plugged into maviss black box and a cord ran over the seats into the cigarette lighter next to where catfish was playing after the first few notes winstons hearing had shut down due to temporary deafness but he didnt care he could hardly believe his luck mavis had promised him the biggest sexual thrill of his life and he had doubted her but now he saw it it was the most gorgeous creature hed ever seen steve the feelings of selfpity jealousy and heartbreak were new to him but the response that welled up in him when he heard the sound of his enemy was more deeply imprinted on his lizard brain and it displaced all the newer feelings with rage and the imperative to attack he stormed out of the cave with pilgrims hanging on his back by the ridge of armored plates that ran down his spine two layers of protective covering slid over his eyes shortening his vision but it was the sound that guided him anyway the sound that carried the strongest association with the enemy he flashed bright crimson and yellow as he charged over the rocks kicking aside the vehicles and shedding pilgrims as he made his way to his enemy at the shore theo molly stood in the cave entrance screaming for steve to stop theo grabbed her around the waist and pulled her away just as the sea beast dangling pilgrims charged past them she elbowed theo in the forehead stunning him for a second and she made for the cave entrance theo caught her outside on the rocks and held her no theo wrapped his arms around her pinning her arms to her side and lifted her off the ground then held her kicking as he braced for gunfire but none came burton was climbing to his feet just below them focused on the sea beast as it passed shoot that thing shoot it shoot it the swat commander had rolled out of the way and come up with his weapon ready but with people hanging all over the beast he didnt know where to shoot so instead let his weapon fall to his side as he stared in amazement burton drew a pistol and began running after the sea beast below two of the swat team had already broken into a run from behind the blazers just as the sea beast bowled them over the other two were pinned underneath one of the crushed vehicles as they fell each pil grim jumped to his feet and ran after the sea beast who was making a beeline across the grassy terrace toward the white station wagon theo watched as the car stopped blues slide notes still screaming out of the back and estelle boyet crawled out of the drivers seat and ran around to the back the guitar playing stopped for a second as the passenger side opened and out stepped catfish jefferson holding a fender stratocaster let me go molly screamed ive got to save him ive got to save him theo yanked her back toward the cave when he was able to look again someone he didnt immediately recognize had crawled out of the station wagon and catfish handed him the guitar sheriff burton was running after the sea beast waving his weapon around trying to get an angle to shoot without hitting one of the pilgrims he stopped dropped to one knee steadied his aim and fired the sea beast roared and whipped around throwing the last of the pilgrims into a tumble in the grass molly whipped her head back into theos chin at the same time she drove a heel into his knee theo let go of her and she rushed over the rocks and down toward the monster catfish estelle had brought the car right to the edge of the dropoff to the rocky beach catfish looked at the surf beating on the rocks below then at his guitar cords coiled in the front seat then at the rocks again they just might be long enough but the dragon was going to get to them before he could find out hurry estelle shouted catfish stood mesmerized by the charging monster not a hundred yards away go he said weakly get yourself out of here no said winston krauss you promised there was a gunshot and the sea beast whipped around in his tracks bringing catfish to his senses lets go he said to winston then he looked at estelle over the top of the car and winked you go on this aint your time catfish played a few notes on the stratocaster and then ambled after winston to the surf the pharmacist ran into the water up to his knees then turned around catfish was having trouble climbing over the rocks to the water while keeping the guitar cord from catching thats far enough catfish said he walked into the surf and stood next to winston keeping the guitar high to keep any spray off of it give it winston demanded you aint got a lick a sense do you give it winston repeated catfish played four bars of green onions on the strat the notes still blaring out of the amp in the station wagon then draped the strap around winstons neck and handed him a guitar pick have fun catfish said oh i will winston said a lascivious grin crossing his face you know i will play catfish said as he turned and ran up the beach he saw estelle already making her way away down the shore away from the commotion behind him the sour rattling notes began to emanate from the amp in the station wagon as gunshots filled the air molly the sheriff fired three more times as he backed away from the sea beast missing not only the monster but the entire north american continent molly threw herself sideways from a full run into the back of burtons knees and cut his legs out from under him she came up in a crouch putting herself between burton and the sea beast the sheriff thought he heard the song green onions and shook his head to clear a hallucination the sea beast roared again and the sheriff vaulted into a crouch ready to fire but instead of a sea monster in front of him he saw a woman in a leather bikini he looked over his shoulder and watched the sea beast snap up the white station wagon in its jaws and toss it aside the guitar sounds stopped and the sea beast slid over the bluff to the beach seeing that the danger was gone he trained his sights on the woman people were streaming by him on either side after the monster wailing like a crowd of banshees molly looked over her shoulder and saw steve going into the water then turned back to burton go ahead you prick i dont care you got it burton said winston krauss he was just beating on the guitar strings now but it didnt matter the amplifier wasnt working anymore and this beautiful creature was coming to him winston was so turned on he thought hed explode she was coming to him his dream lover and he yanked the guitar from around his neck ready to receive her oh come on baby come to papa he said the sea beast charged into the water throwing spray fifty feet in the air then snapped his jaws over winston severing the pharmacists body into two sleazy pieces the sea beast swallowed winstons legs and roared then snapped up the remaining piece and dove under the sea the sheriff i dont think so sheriff sheridan said burton looked over his shoulder without taking the gun off molly sheridan had his m trained on the sheriffs back dont fuck with me sheridan youre in this with me im not in this lower your weapon sir burton lowered the pistol and turned toward sheridan molly started to leap forward and the swat commander pointed the m at her right there he said she stopped the pilgrims were all standing at the shore now wailing as they looked out molly gestured in that direction and sheridan nodded she ran toward the shoreline what now burton asked i dont know said sheridan but no one has been shot here and i have a feeling that theres going to be a lot of attention around this event so no one is going to get shot you wimp whatever sheridan said hey burton theo crowe was running down the hill toward them you hear that when they looked up theo ducked behind one of the wrecked blazers and pointed toward the southern sky film at eleven burton could hear them now helicopters he looked to the south and saw the two dots coming over the horizon two of the swat team members were topping the next hill they had started running when the monster first came out of the cave the other two were still pinned under one of the overturned blazers he turned back to sheridan the big cop was watching the approaching helicopters game over sheridan said guess its time to start thinking about my deal with the da burton shot him in the face then broke for the far side of the rocks to his eldorado before the others had time to figure out what had happened theo theo came up behind molly and touched her lightly on the shoulder when she turned he could see tears streaming down her cheeks then she returned to staring out to sea with the others she said all i ever wanted is to feel special to feel like something set me apart theo put his arm around her everyone wants that but i had it theo more by having steve in my life than when i was making movies these people felt it but not like me the two helicopters were coming in close now and theo had to speak right into her ear to be heard over the thumping blades no ones like you there was a stirring in the water just past the surf line and something was rising in the kelp bed theo could see the purple gill trees standing out on the sea beasts neck he was heading toward shore theo tried to pull molly closer but she broke loose from him jumped off the bluff and ran into the surf scooping up two baseballsized rocks as she went theo went after her and was halfway across the beach when she turned and looked at him with eyes filled with such pleading and desperation that it stopped him in his tracks the helicopters were hovering only a hundred feet over the beach now the wash from the blades kicked up sand in the faces of the onlookers as the sea beast approached shore only his eyes and gills above the water molly threw one of the stones no go away go the second stone hit the sea beasts eye and he stopped dont come back molly screamed slowly the sea beast sank below the surface the sheriff the speedometer on the eldorado was approaching sixty when burton topped the last hill before the cattle guard he had to get to the airport and use the open ticket in his briefcase to join his money in the caymans before anyone could figure out where he had gone hed planned for this all along knowing he might have to make a run for it at some point but what he hadnt planned was that there would be two suburbans and a mercedes parked just over the top of the hill before he could stop himself he hit the brakes and wrenched the wheel to the left the tires dug into the pasture and sent the eldorado up on two wheels then over there was none of the slowing of time or compression of events that often happens in accidents he saw light and dark felt his body being beaten around the caddy and then the crash of smashing metal and breaking glass then there was a pause he lay on the ceiling of the overturned eldorado peppered with pieces of safety glass trying to feel if any of his limbs were broken he seemed okay he could feel his feet and it didnt hurt when he breathed but he smelled gas it was enough to remind him to move he grabbed the briefcase with his escape kit and slithered out the broken back window to find the eldorado halfperched halfsmashed over the front of a white suburban he climbed to his feet and ran to the truck it was locked sheridan you prick you would lock your truck he thought he didnt notice the people handcuffed inside the k cage in the back the mercedes was his last chance he ran around it and yanked opened the drivers side door the keys were in the ignition he climbed in and took a deep breath he had to calm down now no more mistakes he told himself he started the mercedes and was turning to back it down the hill when the dog hit him thirtytwo catfish and estelle that was a good guitar catfish said he had his arms around estelle who had pressed her face to his chest when the monster attacked winston krauss i didnt realize estelle said i didnt think it would do that catfish stroked her hair that was a good car too that car never broke estelle pushed catfish away and looked in his eyes you knew didnt you what i knew is that boy wanted to get up close to a sea monster and thats what he got case you didnt notice he was happy when it happened what now i think we ought to get you home girl you got some paintings gonna come out of this home are you coming with me i aint got no car to go anywhere i guess i am youre going to stay youre not afraid of losing the blues and getting content catfish grinned and there was that gold tooth with the eighth note cut in it glistening in the morning sunshine dragon done ate my car my guitar my ampgirl i got me enough blues to last a good long time im thinkin ill write me some new songs while you makin your paintings id like that estelle said id like to paint the blues long as you dont go cuttin your ear off like old vincent a man finds a oneeared woman stone unattractive estelle pulled him tight ill do my best course there was a woman i knowed down memphis way name of sally had only one leg called her one leg sally i dont want to hear it what you wanna hear i want to hear the door closing behind us the fire crackling in the stove and the teakettle just coming to a whistle while my lovin man picks out walkin mans blues on a national steel guitar you easy catfish said i thought you liked that she said and she took his spidery hand in hers and led him up over the bluff to find a ride home theo and molly theo had never felt quite so overwhelmed in his entire life he sensed that the excitement and the danger of it all was over but he still felt as if a beast every bit as intimidating as the one that had just sunk into the sea was looming over him he didnt know if he had a job or for that matter a home since his cabin had been part of his pay he didnt even have his bong collection and victory garden to crawl into he was confused and horrified by what had just happened but not relieved that it was over he stood there not ten feet from where molly michon was standing in the surf and he had no idea what the rest of his life had to offer him hey he called you okay he watched her nod without turning around the waves were breaking in front of her and foam and seaweed was splashing up over her thighs yet she stood there solid staring out to sea you going to be okay without turning she said i havent been okay for years ask anybody matter of opinion i think youre okay now she looked over her shoulder at him her hair in a tangle from the wind tear tracks down her face really im a huge fan you had never heard of my movies until you came to my trailer had you nope im a huge fan though she turned and walked out of the surf toward him and a smile was breaking there on her face a smile with too much history to it but a smile nonetheless the narrator says you did good she said the narrator theo found himself smiling too as close to crying as he had come since his father had died but smiling nonetheless yeah its this voice i hear when i dont take my meds for a while hes kind of a prick but hes got a better sense of judgment than i do she was right there in front of him nowlooking up at him a hand on her hip a challenge in that moviestar smilelooking more like kendra the warrior babe than she ever had in the posters the fiveinchlong scar standing glorious over her left breast seawater and grime streaking her body a look in her eyes that comes from watching your future get nukedrepeatedly she took his breath away do you think the three of us could go out to dinner sometime im on the rebound you know his heart sank i understand she walked around him and started up the bluff he followed her understanding for the first time how the pilgrims had felt following the sea beast to the cave i didnt say no molly said i just thought you ought to know the narrator is warning me not to talk about my ex over dinner his heart soared i think a lot of people are going to be talking about your ex youre not intimidated of course but not by him the narrator says its a bad idea says the two of us put together might make one good loser wow he is a prick ill get some meds from dr val and hell go away youre sure thats good idea yeah she said turning back to him again before climbing up to where the pilgrims waited id like to be alone with you skinner what the man in the drivers seat didnt seem to understand was that as far as this mercedes was concerned skinner was the alpha male the man smelled of fear and anger and aggression as well as gunpowder and sweat and skinner didnt like him from the moment he got into the car skinners new mobile territory so skinner had to show him and he did so in the traditional way by clamping his jaws over the challengers throat and waiting for him to take a submissive posture the man had struggled and even hit skinner but hadnt said baddog baddog so skinner just growled and tightened his jaws until he tasted blood and the man was still skinner was still waiting for the challenger to submit when the tall guy opened the car door good dog skinner good dog theo said get this fucking animal off me the challenger said skinner wagged his tail and tightened his jaws until the challenger made a gurgling sound the tall guy scratched his ears and put some metal on the challengers paws let go now skinner the tall guy said ive got him skinner let go and licked theos face before the constable dragged the sheriff out onto the ground and stood on the back of his neck with one foot the tall guy tasted like lizard spit that was strange skinner considered it a moment then his doggie attention span ran out and he bounded out of the car to go see what the food guy was doing in the back of the truck the tall guys female was breaking out the back window of the truck with a metal stick skinner barked at her trying to tell her not to hurt the food guy good guys is the creature still there gabe asked molly as he climbed out of the back of the suburban skinner was frisking and jumping on him and with the handcuffs he couldnt ward off the damp affection down boy down no hes gone molly said as she helped val and howard out of the suburban she nodded to val hi doc i think ive had an episode or something youll have to debrief me in session or something valerie riordan nodded ill check my calendar theo came around the back of the mercedes you guys okay you have your key gabe asked turning his back to theo to show the handcuffs we heard shots val said did one of the swat team is dead burton shot him a few of your patients are scraped and bruised but theyll be okay winston krauss was eaten eaten the color ran out of vals face long story val theo said mavis set it all up after you guys left catfish and estelle came in and drew the monster out winston was sort of the bait oh my god val said she said something about my not being in trouble theo held his finger to his lips to shush her then nodded to where sheriff burton lay on the ground it never happened val none of it i dont know a thing he spun her around and unlocked her handcuffs then did the same for gabe and howard the gaunt restaurateur seemed more morose than usual i had really hoped to lay eyes on the creature me too said gabe putting his arm around valerie sorry theo said to val he said the reporters from those helicopters are going to be here in a few minutes if i were you id get out of here he handed her the keys to the mercedes the district attorney is sending a deputy to pick up burton so im going to stay here will you give molly a ride back into town of course val said what are you going to tell the reporters i dont know theo said deny everything i guess it depends on what they ask and what they got on tape having lived most my life in denial i may be perfectly suited for dealing with them im sorry i wasim sorry i doubted your abilities theo so did i val ill call you guys and let you know whats going on gabe called skinner and they loaded into the mercedes leaving theo and molly facing each other theo looked at his shoes i guess ill be seeing you she stretched up and kissed him on the cheek then without a word she crawled into the back of the mercedes with howard and skinner and closed the door theo watched them back away then turn and head across the pasture and out of the cattle gate youre going down with me crowe burton screamed from the ground theo spotted something shiny lying in the grass near the back of the suburban and went over to it it was mollys broadsword he felt a smile breaking out as he picked it up and went over to where burton was lying you have the right to remain silent theo said i suggest you exercise that right immediately theo plunged the sword into the ground half an inch from burtons face and watched the sheriffs eyes go wide thirtythree winter winter in pine cove is a pause a timeout an extended coffee break a slowness comes over the town and people stop their cars in the street to talk with a passing neighbor without worrying about a tourist honking his horn so he can get on with his relaxing vacation damn it waiters and hotel clerks go to parttime shifts and money slows to a creep couples spend their nights at home in front of the fireplace as the smell of rainwashed wood smoke fills the air and single people resolve to move somewhere where life is a fulltime sport winter near the shore is cold the wind kicks up a salty mist and elephant seals come to shore to trumpet and rut and birth their pups retired people put sweaters on their lap dogs and drag them down the street on retractable leashes in a nightly parade of doggie humiliation surfers don their wetsuits against the chill of storm waves and white sharks adjust their diets to include shrinkwrapped dudesnacks on fiberglass crackers but the chill is crisp and forgiving and settles in a way so that the towns collective metabolism can slow into semihibernation without a shock at least thats the way it is most winters after the coming of the sea beast winter was a juggernaut a party an irritation and a windfall news footage from the helicopters was beamed out over satellites and pine cove displaced roswell new mexico as the number one crackpot travel destination there wasnt much on the tapes just a crowd of people gathered on the shore and the fuzzy image of something large in the water but with the footprints and the eyewitness accounts it was enough shops filled with cheesy serpent souvenirs and hps cafe added to the menu a sandwich called the theosaurus which was the official scientific name of the sea beast coined by biologist gabriel fenton the hotels filled the streets congested and mavis sand actually had to hire a second bartender to help serve the imported wackos estelle boyet opened her own gallery on cypress street where she sold her new series of paintings enigmatically entitled steve as well as the new catfish jefferson cd entitled the what do i do now that im happy blues as the story of the sea beast spread and was sensationalized interest rose in an obscure bmovie actress named molly michon discs and videocassettes of the warrior babe series were remastered and rereleased to an enthusiastic audience and the screen actors guild came down on the producers like an avenging accountant angel to capture a piece of the profits for molly valerie riordans practice stabilized as she struck a balance between therapy and medication and she was able to schedule a sabbatical to join her fiancé gabe fenton on an oceanographic expedition aboard a scripps vessel to look for evidence of the theosaurus in the deep trenches off california after he testified against john burton putting him away for life winter settled on theophilus crowe like a warm blessing in the second month of his recovery he realized that his addiction to marijuana had been nothing more than a response to boredom like the child who whines away a summer day because theres nothing to do but makes no effort to actually do anything theo had simply lacked the ambition to entertain himself sharing his life with molly solved the problem and theo found that although he was often exhausted by the demands of his job and his lover he was never bored mollys trailer was moved to the edge of the ranch by his cabin every morning they shared a hearty breakfast pizza at her place in the evening they ate dinner on his cable spool table she answered his calls while he was at work and he ran interference with the geeky fans who were rabid enough to seek her out at the ranch not a day passed that he did not tell molly how special she was to him and as time passed the narrator in her head fell silent and never spoke again there was no winter in the deep submarine trench off california two miles down everything was as it had been a dark pressurized sameness where the sea beast lay by his black smoker grieving for love lost he stopped grazing on deep water worms that grew on the rocks and his great body began to waste away under the weight of the water and the years he had resolved never to move againto lie there until his great heart stopped and with it the throb of heartbreakwhen sensor cells along his flanks picked up a signal something he had not felt for half a century the signature of a creature he thought he would never feel again he flipped his tail and shook off the crust of loneliness that had settled over him and that organ buried deep beneath his reptile brain
