john lescroart the motive the ninth book in the dismas hardy series to lisa sawyer again and again and again out of the crooked tree of humanity no straight thing can ever be made immanuel kant part one by location alone a block from fillmore street as it passes through the upwardly challenged hayes valley alamo square would not be among the sexier neighborhoods in san francisco but one of the most popular and recognizable posters of the city by the bay captures a row of beautifully restored and vibrantly painted threeand fourstory victorians that face the park on steiner streetthe socalled painted ladies the poster created a certain cachet for the area such that the cheapest of these houses now go for threeplus million the blaze at paul hanovers in the middle of this block began around pm on may although the first alarm wasnt called in until nearly fires love old victorians even though hanovers house had been stripped to the bare bones twenty years earlier retrofitted for earthquakes and freshly insulated with fireresistant materialit is the nature of victorian design to have funky interior spaces oddly shaped rooms crannies and closets and unusual passages within the walls since heat wants to travel up fires employ the vertical stud lines as flues almost as chimneys to transport themselves effortlessly and quickly up and up into the roof spaces where billowing smoke is most often noticed first even in a neighborhood of great sensitivity to the threat of fireof old very valuable wooden houses in walltowall proximityno one noticed anything amiss at hanovers until the fire had progressed to the unfinished attic the latearriving fog camouflaged the first appearance of the smoke and the wind blew it away by the time one of the local residents realized that what he was actually seeing was not fog but thick clouds of smoke pouring out from under the eaves of his neighbors roof the fire was well advanced as soon as the first alarms fire trucks arrivedthree engines two trucks two battalion chiefs an assistant chief and a rescue squadthe twoman aerial ladder team from the first engine began climbing to hanovers roof intending to ventilate it by cutting a hole into it with axes and chainsaws meanwhile four men in nomex turnout pants and coats and wearing scott airpaksthe initial attack squadgot to the front door found it unlocked and opened it right up although they were armed with akron fog nozzles that could spray water over a wide angle and get them closer to the flames in this case they were greeted by a roiling cloud of hot thick black smoke impossible to see through they could make no progress al daly officer of the initial attack squad spoke matteroffactly into the headpiece of his walkietalkie front door is breached norm we got a working fire here daly was speaking to his battalion chief norm shaklee out front in the street the words conveyed great urgency a working fire meant they would need at least one more alarmfour more engines another truck two more chiefs in a house this size with so much exposure to the homes on either side this working fire could go to five alarms san franciscos maximum all four stories of hanovers home might already be probably wereinvolved shaklee in his white helmet placed the next alarm call and looked up as the sound of chainsaws stopped over the roof he saw a churning pillar of black smoke erupt into the sky and spoke into his walkietalkie theyre through on the roof al back out a minute he was telling daly that ventilation was about to start working potentially a very dangerous moment if the smoke inside the house was hot enoughand no one knew if it wasthe addition of oxygen to it might at this time cause a tremendous and often lethal backdraft explosion so the initial attack squad waited in a kind of suspension down the front steps out in the street until a minute and forty seconds later the smoke column spewing from the roof suddenly exploded into a fireball that lit the night for blocks around and rose to heights of a hundred feet and more by now the first hoses had been attached to the hydrant at the corner and eight firefighters on each of a couple of them were blasting six hundred gallons of water per minute into the open space for all the apparent good the firefighters were doing they might as well have been standing around spitting on the flames but appearances in this case were deceiving the hydrant water was lowering the temperature sufficiently so that daly and his squad could advance again into the building because of the ventilation the smoke that filled the foyer had now begun to dissipate upward as did the thick cloud of steam generated by the water from the hoses within a few seconds after the hose teams stopped soaking the entryway daly and his squad were back at the front door with his night helmets beam on and glowing he had relatively clear sight lines through the foyer to the house beyond to the flames still licking at the walls on all sides wielding his akron spraying in a wide arc he advanced into the darkness following the beam on his helmet all around was noise and chaosthe rush of air behind him as the conflagration sucked it in the roar of the actual fire the creaking and splintering of wood the hail of ax blows disembodied voices yelling both within and outside the building daly sprayed and advanced sprayed and advanced one foot or so at a time the foyer was circular highceilinged and quite large perhaps fourteen feet in diameter he could make out the shapes of burning furniture along the wallswhat appeared to have been a coatrack a sideboard maybe an umbrella stand or wastebasket drapes over a pair of windows curved to the shape of the house were all but incinerated one opening to dalys right led into another open room and directly ahead of him another doorway fed into a hall everywhere he looked there was flametotal involvement of the ground floor despite the hoses soaking the fire was growing again heating up it was excruciatingly hot dangerously hot daly felt a sloshing like water in his ear but knew that it wasnt water it was his earwax melting he had to get out of here right now he wasnt going to be able to check for potential rescue victims until the fire died somewhat and by thenby now he knewanything living in the structure would have died as well still he pushed forward forcing himself for another step or two spraying as he went it was full night his only light his helmet beam looking down at the entrance to the hallway he suddenly became aware of two shapes that stopped him where he stood leaning in for a closer look not that he needed it he forced himself to speak in his most neutral tone theres two bodies in here norm in the foyer out in the street the secondalarm units had begun to arrive and shaklee was issuing orders to nine people at once back by the rehab station which itself was already nearly overwhelmed supplying drinks fresh air bottles and first aid he asked daly to repeat what hed just said and he did adding no ambulance needed which meant they were obviously dead shaklee took only another second to process the information then turned and spoke to his operatoraide who functioned as gopher in the field find becker he said and put in a call to homicide arnie becker the fortythreeyearold lead arson investigator attached to the bureau of fire investigation arrived with the secondalarm unit in situations like this beckers task was to determine the origin of the blaze to do that hed have to enter the building and investigate all the indicatorsv patterns on walls decalcification of sheetrock alligatoring of studs condition of electrical components and so onand by doing so hope to locate the spot where the fire began and if possible determine what might have caused it becker was a twentyyear veteran of the fire department in san francisco his whole working life he was particularly familiar with victorians and he knew that this house with all the places in which a fire could hide would in all likelihood burn through the night and perhaps well into the next morning he wasnt going to have an answer anytime soon but that didnt mean he didnt have a lot to do a huge crowd of onlookers had coalesced on the block and more were streaming out of houses both up and down the street and across the open space of alamo square behind them this was his potential witness poolpeople he and his team would need to talk to some percentage of them might live on the block might have seen something suspicious he needed all the information he could find from a nearinfinite universe of possibilities the most tantalizing one being that if this fire was arson if someone had started it then that person was probably among the crowd enjoying his handiwork possibly even sitting in one of the cypress trees in alamo square getting sexual satisfaction from it becker had seen it before in san francisco police officers from the hitandrun detail are assigned to fire investigation so becker had a staff of helpers and he sent them out to talk to everybody they could they would not conduct formal interviewsnot now anywaybut he wanted names and phone numbers of everybody if people didnt want to provide that that could be instructive if still others wouldnt shut up that might tell him something as well becker didnt know anything including what he didnt know so this was his chance to start gathering information from whatever source presented itself and he took it very seriously indeed his men fanned out to either end of the crowd and were working it to the inside and from behind becker himself was on his way to talk to the neighbor whod called in the fire and who had waited around to help guide the trucks when theyd arrived not that they had needed it by then but suddenly beckers partner in the arson unit j p doddtwentyeight years old armytrained competent yet relaxed appeared at his elbow the night around them was a kaleidoscope of lights in the darknessthe yellow flickering fire the red bubbles on the trucks the white glare from the firemens helmets now the kleigs of the tv camera crews dodds earnest face looked particularly grave theyve found two bodies arn shaklee needs you to come on up the fire still raged in the back of the house and on the upper stories the two manned fire hoses at the front door snaked across the floor of the foyer and disappeared out the righthand doorway somewhere back into the inferno becker now suited up in his turnout coat and night helmet his scotts down over his face also held a widebeam flashlight that he trained on the bodies he squatted like a baseball catcher having learned that to put a knee on the floor was an invitation to pain and suffering the clothing had been burned off where they had been exposed but even though both figures were lying on their backs he couldnt tell what sex either had been one was larger and one smaller so they were possibly a man and a woman but he wouldnt be sure until the coroner was finished with them the hair and any distinguishing characteristics on the faces likewise were burned away something in the resting attitudes struck him though he had seen many dead people before the victims of fire as well as victims of murder andor suicide who were at fire scenes but dead before they burned in his experience the bodies of people who died from fire or smoke inhalation as the blaze grew around them tended to curl protectively into a fetal position victims of murder or suicide most often lay as they fell and these two bodies fit that profile there was still the characteristic drawing up of the extremities as the flesh cooked but it did not strongly resemble the curledup bodies hed seen of victims whod died by fire and fire alone suspicious by nature and now by circumstance becker reached for a flashlightlike device he wore on his belt the multigasdetecting aim turning it on he waved it down the sides of the smaller victimthe one nearest to the front doorand wasnt exactly stunned to see that it registered the presence of gasoline so becker thought this was probably arson and from the attitudes of the bodies it was quite possibly a murder or a murdersuicide as well becker tucked in his gas detector then trained his flashlight again on the smaller body in front of him directly over his head a deafening crash shook the building and rained charcoal down over him but he barely heard or noted it the small and perfectly round hole high in the back of the head above and behind where the ear should have been locatedit had burned awaycommanded all of his attention stepping over the smaller torso becker moved over the stillsquishy rug squatted and shone his light on the other victim tucked under the side of the torso a glint of metal shone up when his beam hit it becker wasnt going to touch anything at this point but he lowered his lights trajectory and saw enough to realize that he was looking at the barrel of a gun at a little after eleven pm inspector sergeant dan cuneo of san franciscos homicide detail parked his unmarked car on the opposite side of alamo square and began to make his way through the large awestruck worried crowd his immediate sense was that this fire was nowhere near to being controlled three houses on the block now appeared to be burning and in the crowd he overheard snatches of panicked conversations some from what must have been residents people staring mesmerized some crying some talking in hushed tones as he came closer he noticed a cordonedoff command area on the steps up the street that led into the park cuneo knew where he needed to go and he made a beeline toward the white helmet that seemed to hover above the crowd the white helmet belonged to the incident commander every fire scene had an ic and his power within that setting was absolute the president of the united states could show up at a fire wanting to get a better look and the ic could order him to chill for a while and that would be the end of the discussion cuneo got close enough to make out some of the faces that had gathered around this icthe name tag over his left pocket said shaklee he was taller than cuneos own six feet cuneo pushed his way through the crowd excused himself and presented his badge shaklee nodded distractedly said something into his walkietalkie came back to cuneo you need to see becker he pointed toward the steps the guy talking to the woman in the leather jacket cuneo nodded his thanks and started walking over he was an edgy man in his early forties unable to keep still or quiethe could not eat or listen to a witness or a colleague without hummingand this trait had kept him from retaining a regular partner in homicide for the past year or more hed been working strictly solo his fellow inspectors considered him a character but not quite a weirdo it was a critical distinction handsome in an unusual way cuneos face had an oddly misshapen character as well almost as though it had once been broken down to its integral pieces and then imperfectly reassembled his nose initially protruded to a ridge then hooked left and went flat as though someone had pushed it in like a thumbtack at times he appeared crosseyed hed obviously survived a serious bout with teenage acne but instead of scarring the skin over his cheeks had taken on a stretched almost shiny lookmaybe too many skin peels an inventory of the individual parts wouldnt indicate it but somehow the mishmash came together in a way that pleased his girlfriends now he was at the steps even here across the street and back into the shelter of the park the fire was making it uncomfortably warm cuneo grabbed a styrofoam cup of water from a table someone had set up and got himself close enough to listen to becker and the woman in the leather coat she wasnt a kidmaybe cuneo figured about his agebut she was still very attractive cuneos antennae for women were always uphe couldnt help himself and saw no reason to change close up he noticed that the womans jacket hung open partially revealing an allgrownup but tightlooking body in a blue silk blouse and below a thin waist tucked into designer jeans the womans stylish mediumlength hair picked up highlights from the flames one of the ageless babes he thought as he automatically checked for a wedding ringnot that it always mattered she wore one he moved a step closer started flicking the side of his cup with his fingers as soon as i saw it on the television the woman was saying i was just over here with paul this afternoon so i knew exactly becker held up a finger stopping her directed a flat gaze to cuneo can i help you cuneo quickly brought his cup to his mouth and flicked free the last of the ice flashing his badge he mumbled around the small cubes sorry dan cuneo homicide becker stuck a hand out becker arson and thats what this is the woman turned to face cuneo youre with homicide is somebody dead in there then back to becker you know that god its got to be paul cuneo paul who paul hanover its his house she turned all the way around and stared back at what was left of the place by this time the fire had collapsed much of the structure the front doorway still stood and most of the second floor but the third and fourth stories were all but gone hes in there youve got to get him out before becker cut her off theres no reason to get him out maam he was dead a half hour ago if you knew him im sorry pointing toward the house becker said to cuneo theyre directing the master streamsthats those major hosesto try and preserve as much of your crime scene as they can but theres no telling cuneo nodded the call said there were two of them yep oh my god the woman said again thats got to be missy too cuneo turned from the house to the woman introduced himself again flashed his badge and who are you please catherine hanover im pauls daughterinlaw paul hanover he liveslived here excuse me cuneo said are you talking about the paul hanover if you mean the lawyer yes she looked back to the house i cant believe hes in there somebodys in there becker said but we dont know its mr hanover or missy whos missy cuneo asked michelle damiens pauls girlfriend fiancee everybody called her missy they were getting married in the fall suddenly a bolt of panic shot through her cant you do anything you cant just let them stay in there there wont be anything left of them beckers mouth was set as he shared a look with cuneo both knew the awful truth that the bodies were already unrecognizable charred beyond any hope of recognition identification and forensic evidence if any would mostly come from a lab now neither they nor anyone else could do anything to change that mrs hanover becker said maybe you want to find a place to sit or go on home whatever happens here is going to take a long while we can get your address and phone number and contact you in the morning but cuneo wasnt quite ready to dismiss her did i hear you say that you were over here at this house earlier today yes why was that i wanted to talk to paul about something just some family stuff did you see him she nodded yes we had some coffee her eyes were drawn back to the inferno bringing her hand up she rubbed her forehead he cant be in there right now thats just not possible and missy was missy there when you talked to paul today cuneo asked no i dont know i didnt see her anyway so what was the family stuff the question stopped her and she frowned why what difference would that make cuneo looked to becker who shrugged he came back to catherine hanover i dont know if the mans dead everything he did in his last hours is going to come under scrutiny if this was arson and inspector becker here says it is somebody might have started the fire to kill somebody in the house im going to want to know everything about his last day becker butted in could you please excuse us for a minute maam without waiting for her reply he stepped in front of her and hooked an arm into cuneos to turn him when theyd moved off half a dozen steps he said before you go too far with her maybe you should know that there was a gun under the larger torso probably the man maybe this hanover also what looks like a bullet hole in one of the heads hers maybe in his too but i didnt want to touch and turn him to find out so murdersuicide again becker shrugged maybe thats one thing that fits anyway the gun was under his body he did himself and fell on the gun maybe could be that works if the whole place goes up ive got a roll of pictures i took you can look at tomorrow then decide otherwise if they can save the foyer we might pull a break and be able to get in again by sunrise he glanced at the fire not much before i wouldnt think cuneo nodded found his eyes drawn back across the street where most of the firefighting activity had now come to be centered on the houses to either side of hanovers becker could be right it looked to cuneo as though part of the crime scene might be salvaged after all so whered this woman come from she said she was home watching tv and saw it on the news and recognized the place wheres the rest of her family i dont know i didnt ask maybe there isnt any rest of it i had just started talking to her when you got here all right cuneo cast a glance over to mrs hanover who was also staring at the blaze hypnotized by it he came back to becker but its definitely arson there was definitely gasoline residue under the smaller body anything else thats not enough no i didnt mean that they had moved out in front of mrs hanover and now both men looked back to where she stood her coloring was high unwitting excitement on her face in the look in her eyes with the heat from the fire shed removed her jacket and held it by a finger over her shoulder a posture that emphasized her already generous bosom thats a damn finelooking woman cuneo said you going to let her go home becker asked cuneo kept his eyes on her couple more minutes he said fiftyfiveyearold abraham glitsky had worked his way up through the ranks of the san francisco police department and was now its deputy chief of inspectors in his days as a homicide inspector and then later as lieutenant in charge of the homicide detail he was a slacksandflight jacket kind of cop but since assuming his latest rankthe only step up was chiefhe wore his blues every day and though he wasnt aware ofit he cut quite a figure in them a former tight end at san jose state glitsky stood six feet two and went about none of it padding jewish on his fathers side and black on his mothers his blue eyes were set off against light mocha skin but a deep scar that ran between both his lips kept him from ever considering himself even remotely goodlooking if he thought about it at all and he didnt hed admit that he probably looked a little scary especially when he wasnt smiling which was most of the time and he wasnt all wrong at twelve minutes after seven on this fogbound may morning when glitsky pulled his cityissued car to the curb at alamo square he couldnt have dredged up a smile on a bet hed routinely called his office from home for messages soon after he woke up and had learned about the double homicide and the fivealarm arson the scene wasnt much of a detour from his duplex above lake on his route to work at the hall of justice and he felt he needed to see it with his own eyes getting out of his car he stood for a moment surveying the stillsmoking disaster that had occurred here last night before most of the citys firefighters had finally stopped the spread of flames at around am all but two of the painted ladies had been affected to some degree or another the one in the center was destroyed except for its steps and a circular area on the first floor behind the front door on either side of that structure the adjacent homes would have to be completely rebuilt the one on glitskys left as he faced the wreckage which must have been slightly windward last night was nothing but a burnedout skeleton the former gingerbread house on the right was a gutted shell of brokenout windows and charred peeling timbers on either side of those houses the adjacent homes yawned vacant and bereftmore broken windows open front doors obvious water and fire damage cleanup crews were spraying and sweeping all over the area teams of axwielding firemen jabbed and poked through the various wreckages locating hidden hot spots for the hose crews glitsky finally moved away from his car muted activity hummed all around him as he crossed down to the ics car hoses still snaked to fire hydrants two engines remained parked back to back in front of the middle home three trucks lined the near curb the coroners van was doubleparked by the engines near the middle of the street most of the onlookers had dispersed on the bumper of a car a man in a white helmet sat holding a steaming cup in both hands glitsky introducing himself thought the man looked like hed just come from a battlefieldand in a sense he supposed he had slack with fatigue the ics face was blackened everywhere with soot his eyes shot with red after they shook hands shaklee said my arson guys are still in there with strout john strout was the citys medical examiner and your guy cuneo he added dan cuneo yeah glitsky lifted his chin toward the houses all i got word of was fatality fire you dont know who lived here no you know paul hanover no kidding glitsky looked at the house was he inside somebody was two people actually from the sizes a man and a woman but we wont know for sure who they were for a while shaklee sipped at his drink theyre not identifiable he paused you havent heard heard what they were dead when the fire started shot glitskys eyes went back to the house the guns still in there shaklee said under the bigger torso paul hanover probably and his girlfriend thats the rumor you can go in glitsky blew a vapor trail hesitating finally he shook his head thats all right ive seen enough bodies to last me better if i didnt step on cuneos toes its his case shaklee shrugged your call yeah another pause a last look toward the house if anyone else from homicide besides cuneo had drawn the case glitsky would have gone inside ill catch him and strout downtown after they know a little more what theyve got after a last glance at the destruction he met shaklees eye and shook his head at the waste and loss crunching over broken glass and charred debris he started walking back to his car the only time abe and treya glitsky had ever seriously disagreed was before they got married the issue was whether they would have children together both of them had survived the deaths of their first spouses and had raised their respective children as single parents treya had a teenage girl raney and abe already had two sons isaac and jacob out of the house and orel at the time he met treya with only a couple of years to go abe fiftytwo then figured he had already done the family thing and done it well he didnt suppose and really wasnt too keen about finding out whether hed have the energy or interest necessary to be an active and involved father again to treya in her midthirties this was a deal breaker and the two broke up over it the split had endured for eleven days before abe changed his mind their baby rachel was now nearly two and a half years old this morningthursdaytreya seventeen days late had taken the home pregnancy test and it had been positive her husband invariably left their duplex by am so hed already gone in to work when she found out she worked in the same hall of justice as he did as personal secretary to san franciscos district attorney clarence jackman but though shed now been at her job for the better part of three hours she hadnt worked up the courage to call abe and tell him theyd avoided pretty much all discussion of whether theyd have more children after rachel but treya didnt feel as though shed been sneaky with this latest development they both knew they were doing nothing to prevent it surely that was a sign of abes tacit approval but she wasnt completely sure while watering the plants in jackmans outer office which doubled as a nofrills reception area for the das appointments she caught sight of herself in the wall mirror and realized that shed been biting her lips and had scraped her lipstick off top and bottom stepping closer to the mirror she saw traces of it on her teeth nerves she had to call abe and let him know right now she had just finished scratching the lipstick off and was returning around the front of her desk to do just that when dismas hardy jackmans eleven oclock and abes great friend knocked at the side of the open hallway door and the phone rang if thats for me im in training for a marathon and cant be disturbed hardy said treya shot him an amused and tolerant look and reached over the desk to pick up the phone das office she came around the desk and sat in her chair frowning no she said what about her treya listened for another moment then shook her head i havent heard a thing and nobodys called clarence about anything like that yes im sure do you want me to ask diz hes here hardy looked over in some surprise treya held up a finger listened then spoke across to him kathy westthe mayor on her job now for about five monthswants to see abe he wonders if you might have heard about anything going on at city hall just the rumor that she was firing him but i dont believe it treya spoke into the phone he hasnt heard anything either she listened okay well whatever it is i wouldnt worry no i know good luck she hung up and realizing that she hadnt told her husband her own news their own news she bit at her lip again are you all right hardy asked im fine just a little distracted well hardy copped billy crystals old saturday night live accent its not how you feel but how you look and dahling you look mahvelous when treya didnt react hardy went sober is abe really worried are you i dont think so hed just rather be prepared whenever its possible youre kidding abe then i do wonder what kathy wants though whatever it is its got to be important dont you think she wanted him asap she said and in person kathy west had been a city supervisor for six terms and during the last couple of years before her election to mayor had been a regular at clarence jackmans informal kitchen cabinet meetings held most tuesdays at lou the greeks bar and restaurant located just across the street from the hall of justice glitskyand treya and hardy for that matterwere also members so there was a history of goodwill and mutual respect between the deputy chief and the mayor nevertheless glitsky did not feel free to sit down and relax in her office but stood at ease in the center of her rug nor did kathy west come out from behind her large and ornate desk through the open double windows behind her downtown san francisco shimmered mostly white as the fog burned away smallboned and delicate wests fragile packaging all but disguised a ferocious will and laser intellect completely at home in polite society raised to an old standard of bornto privilege mixed with a heightened sense of civic responsibility she was in her bones a pragmatic skillful politician now somewhere in her late fifties playing somewhat against type she talked the good talk about believing in getting her hands dirty if thats what it would take whatever it was and that had gotten her elected this morning glitsky was discovering firsthand that it wasnt all talk i just cant accept any part of it abe the paul hanover i knewand ive known him for thirtyfive yearsdid not shoot his fiancee and then himself and then burn down his house that is just not what happened i cant accept it she stabbed the open flat of her desk blotter with a bony index finger i dont care what the medical examiner rules glitsky wasnt going to fight her at least not yet before he knew anything he assumed she just needed her hand held i dont think john strout is anywhere near making a ruling he said its just the usual media madness filling that awful silence they hate so much wests mouth went up in a tic of appreciation that vanished quickly i think its more than that they were and i quote police sources i heard that too saying they couldnt rule out murdersuicide which in all fairness they cant it might have been glitsky reserved judgment as he always did but if strout eventually came to this conclusion it wouldnt be a shock at this stage it certainly looked like it could have been a murdersuicide but he wasnt going to press that argument with the mayor i dont blame you for being angry at the stupid reporting but its not like we dont see it every day if you want ill see to it youre informed with every development then you can call the press conferences yourself and maybe even have some fun but fun wasnt on the mayors agenda impatient she was shaking her short bob of gray hair a quick birdlike movement no she said i want more than that thats why i called you here abe i want somebody i trust working on this this cannot be what it seems i will not have paul hanovers name slandered over something that he didnt do she asked abruptly do you know dan cuneo sure what do you know about him glitsky knew he did not like him he guessed that the feeling was mutual cuneo had never worked in homicide under glitsky and worse a couple ofyears before hed actually accused glitsky of collusion with dismas hardy for trying to deflect a murder rap from one of hardys clients but west didnt need the history lesson about him and cuneo marcel lanier says hes okay he makes his numbers my what a ringing endorsement wests bright eyes stayed on glitsky waiting his mouth went up a fraction of an incha pass at a smileand he shrugged i dont know him personally if i can ask what about him the latest version of the news ive seen named him as the police source hes the inspecting officer on this case i think hes a hog for press and hes already jumping to conclusions i think hes the wrong man after a minute glitsky nodded would you like me to talk to lanier maybe he can assign cuneo a partner although i hear he likes to work alone ive heard he cant keep a partner kathy west scratched at her blotter actually abe she said quietly before i asked you to come up here i called frank batiste this was the chief of police glitskys boss the man whod promoted him wests mention of his name in this contextlowkey to be suremarked a change in the dynamic of things i asked frank who in his opinion was the single best homicide inspector in the city and he said it was you i dont know about that glitsky said though of course im flattered but im not in homicide anymore as you know they have good people down there west stared at him for a long moment abe i dont want to beat around the bush id consider it a personal favor if you would agree to help investigate this case chief batiste has agreed to assign someone else temporarily to your administrative duties press conferences public appearances and so on during the interim youve made no secret about how little you like that stuff youll enjoy the break and what about cuneo thats a police matter abe im confident that between you frank and lieutenant lanier youll be able to come to some resolution there glitsky looked out over the mayors shoulder to the city beyond though it wasnt particularly warm in the room he had broken a light sweat and wiped a sleeve across his forehead ms mayor he began abe please she held up a hand it was always kathy at lou the greeks she said its still kathy he had the permission but that didnt tempt him to use it nodding noncommittal he drew a breath i was going to say that its impossible to predict where an investigation is going to lead im concerned that i wont find what youre looking for but im not looking for anything she said forgive me he said but it very much sounds like you dont want me to find that hanover killed anybody or himself no if thats what he did then thats what youll find and ill live with it but what i want is somebody wholl really look somebody who wont go to the press on day one and say it looks like a murdersuicide that it looks like hanover killed his girlfriend glitsky chewed at one side of his cheek all right then i need to ask you something else of course anything what was your relationship with him hanover the mayors eyes closed down he was a friend and a donor to my campaign nothing more she straightened her back what are you implying im implying nothing im asking call it the start of my investigation all right i will and ill give you the same answer he was a friend and contributor nothing more all right west cocked her head to one side you dont believe me if you say it i believe you but youve got lots of friends and lots of contributors your interest in how one of them is remembered after his death seems a little unusual west scratched again at her blotter thats not it how people remember him she said or rather not all of it maybe its a corollary she took a minute what im getting at she said is if he didnt do it somebody else didkilled him i mean dont you think that would probably have been the girlfriend missy im assuming from what ive heard that she was the other body if she was then all right at least well know for sure at least someone would have really investigated and paul deserves that she lowered her voice narrowed her eyes i want to be satisfied that whoever killed him is either dead or caught call it simple revenge but i liked the man and i dont buy that he killed himself or anybody else and okay maybe it was this missy but if it wasnt glitsky jumped is there any reason you think it might not have been like what i dont know business problems family issues something youd got wind of no but id be more comfortable if the various possibilities got eliminated she turned a palm up so how about it abe you want to help give a tired old lady some peace of mind it wasnt really a request west seemed about as tired as a hummingbird as old as a schoolgirl glitsky had no choice he gave her a salute it would be my pleasure he said as a deputy chief glitsky had a city car and a driver sergeant tom paganucciassigned to him for his personal use paganucci humorless taciturn and loyal suited glitsky well he did not make suggestions or offer opinions and only asked questions related to his work though he would answer them on other topics if glitsky asked him directly he started no conversations at all but waited for orders that once given he obeyed with what seemed to be a complete commitment of his body and soul he was fortythree years old heavily built cleanshaven prematurely gray because hed asked on their first day together glitsky knew that his driver was married and childless but that was the extent of his knowledge of paganuccis personal life except he was reasonably certain that he didnt do standup comedy on his nights off paganucci had kept the car running where hed left his boss off a half hour before out in the street in front of city hall and now glitsky slid into the backseat he closed the door after him and leaned back for an instant into the comfortable black leather he looked at his watch do you think the chiefs in tom paganucci reached for his intercom ill call no wait what am i going to say to him anyway glitsky didnt want an answer from paganucci and wasnt going to get one in any event he let out an audible breath all right he said lets go yes sir where to alamo square paganucci put the car in gear and they started to roll he was here til they bagged the bodies sir becker said then i guess he went home to get some sleep they were standing outside on the concrete steps where becker had come out in response to glitskys hail what about you glitsky asked what about me and sleep the firefighter chortled not a priority not til im satisfied here anyway and youre not ive got a pretty good basic idea but id be more comfortable if i had more answers like what becker shrugged like multiple flash sights the place went up so quick and thorough it looks like somebody knew exactly what they were doing he motioned behind him at the charred remains of the house but weve only got the one spot you want to go in take a look without waiting for an answer he led the way through the stillstanding front doorway some of the ceiling above the lobby was intact but with the fog burned off the day was bright with sunshine and there was sufficient natural light to see clearly glitsky squatted over an area of rug that appeared less scorched than its surroundings there was another similar spot about eight feet farther into the lobby at the entrance to what might once have been a hallway this is where you found them yeah plus its where the fire started get down and you can still smell the gasoline glitsky leaned over and inhaled but couldnt smell anything except fire youve probably gone through all this with cuneo but id be grateful if you ran it by me one more time the mayors personally interested she was friends with mr hanover id like to sound reasonably intelligent when i brief her im assuming it was hanover thats the assumption although strout makes the formal call but whoever it wascall him hanoverhe fell on his wallet so it didnt burn completely it had hanovers drivers license in it so it looks good for him what about the other body no way to tell your man cuneo seemed to think it was probably his girlfriend you dont agree i dont know there was nothing to identify her it could have been becker spoke with little inflection he was assembling the facts and would share what he knew with any other investigating officials without any particular emphasis i can say it was probably a womanwe found what might be a bra strap under herbut thats all id be comfortable with for the time being again stroutll tell us soon enough so what does it look like we have here the news said murdersuicide becker nodded might have been so youve seen this kind of thing before where somebody kills a partner then himself but before he does himself he lights the place up sure its not uncommon he seemed to consider whether to say more for a moment then shrugged as though apologizing the relationship goes bad somebody wants to destroy every sign of it any sign that this relationship was going bad beckers eyes scanned the floor area you mean besides this maybe cuneo talked to hanovers daughterinlaw when did he do that she saw the fire on the news and came by here last night seems this missy had just finished redecorating this place to the tune of maybe a million dollars of hanovers money maybe he wanted to leave a message that it all meant nothing to him but i will tell you one thing whats that it wasnt her what do you mean what wasnt her she didnt do the killing i told cuneo too this might not be any kind of a proof that you could use in court but if its a relationship gone bad theres two things here first if she does it it goes down in the bedroom maybe even in the bed whys that because thats the center of the womans life he held up a hand i know i know its not pc and people will tell you its bullshit but you ask anybody whos spent time at this kind of scene theyll tell you if its a crime of passion and its not done in the bedroom its not the woman okay glitsky said whats the second thing im afraid its another nonpc moment i can handle it glitsky said what women dont shoot themselves very often to begin with and if they do its not in the head they wont disfigure themselves it just doesnt happen suddenly glitsky thought back to the suicide of loretta wager the former senator from california who had been his lover and the mother of his daughter elaine she had shot herself in the heart becker was right he thought these were both indefensible sexist generalizations that no doubt would collapse under rigorous debate that did not stop them however from being potentiallyeven probablytrue so you think it was hanover i dont know cuneo seemed to take it as a working theory the gun was kind of under him what do you mean kind of well here you can see becker reached into his inside pocket and withdrew a stack of photographs my partner brought these over to the photo lab as soon as they opened they made two copies and i gave cuneo the other but ive still got the negatives if you want a set shuffling through them he got the one he wanted here you go glitsky studied the grainy pictureshadows in darkness it was a closeup of something he couldnt recognize at first glance becker helped him out reaching over thats the body there along the top and the end of the armthe hand became disattached but you can see there up against the body thats the gun so not exactly under him no just like you see there kind of against the side and tucked in a little and he was the one in the back here by the hall beyond where the woman was yeah becker said what are you thinking im just wondering if they had hoses going in here for a while okay im just thinking maybe the gun was on the rug and the force of the hose hitting it pushed it back against him tucked under as you say becker didnt seem offended by the suggestion no i dont suppose we can rule that out but its not the most obvious explanation for how the gun got there glitsky scratched at his cheek becker had been up front with him about his and cuneos investigation although it hadnt been his original plan he saw no reason now to try and conceal his motive well as i said hanover was a friend of the mayor she doesnt like the idea that he killed himself to say nothing of his girlfriend she asked me to take a look bemused becker stood still a moment shaking his head finally if thats what youve got to do i wouldnt want to have your job nodding glitsky said sometimes im not too sure i want it either dismas hardy managing partner of the law firm of freeman farrell hardy roake had his feet up on his desk his suit coat hung over the back of his chair his shoes were off his tie was undone the collar of his shirt unbuttoned he was taking an afterlunch break from a notverystrenuous day and reading randomly from a book hed recently purchased called schotts original miscellany being a fact freak hardy considered it one of the most fascinating books hed come across in recent years containing as it did all sorts of nonessential but critical information such as the seven wonders of the ancient world the great pyramid of giza the hanging gardens of babylon the statue of zeus at olympia the temple of artemis at ephesus the mausoleum at halicarnassus the colossus of rhodes and the lighthouse of alexandria the tenpoint mohs scale of mineral hardness from talc to diamond the names of the apostles and pages of other very cool stuff he was somewhat disappointed to see that for some obscure reason it didnt include st dismas as the patron saint of thieves and murderers but otherwise the diminutive tome was a pure delight and certainly worthy of his nonbillable time he was poring over the degrees of freemasonry when the phone buzzed at his elbow he marked his place sighed and lifted the receiver knowing from the blinking line button that it was his receptionistsecretary phyllis the superefficient loyal hardworking and absolutely trying human being who viewed her role as gatekeeper to his office as a vocation decreed by god shed filled the same position for hardys predecessor david freeman and was no more replaceable as a fixture in the sutter street law offices than the phones themselves phyllis he said did i ask you to hold my calls he loved that he could make her pause mostly he did this by answering with a nonlawyerly yo but sometimes for varietys sake hed come at her from another angle yahoo living large sir im not accusing you im just asking i dont think so okay then whats up deputy chief glitsky is here to see you in person yes sir make a note phyllis i need a back door to sneak out of here yes sir that was a pleasantry phyllis a bit of a joke you can send him in he mouthed yes sir as she said it then hung up smiling sometimes it worried him that phyllis was among the top sources of humor in his life it seemed to say something truly pathetic about the person hed become but he couldnt deny it leaving his stockinged feet on the desk where they would appall his friend abe almost as much as the sight would scandalize phyllis he waited for the turn of the knob and glitskys appearance one step into hardys office glitsky stopped his expression grew pained at the socks on the desk hardy left his feet where they were and started right in im glad you came by weve really got to join the masons he said you know that glitsky closed the door behind him youre going to wait until i ask you why arent you no hardy closed the book no if you dont want to know thats okay with me although i know you pretty well and its definitely something youd be totally into but i dont push my brilliant ideas it was just a thought glitsky hesitated another second or two then sighed audibly what are the masons anyway a secret organization george washington was in it i think but if it was that secret how would anybody know i was just thinking the same thing see great minds glitsky moved over to the wetbar area and felt the side of the waterheating pot that hardy kept there he grabbed his usual mug picked up a tea bag from an open bowl of them and poured hot water over it turning blowing over the drink he took in the spacious office i should go into some kind of private business here you are the middle of the afternoon feet up reading no work in sight your life is far better than mine thats because im a better person than you are but i might point out that you are here too in the very same place as me working about as hard and drinking my good tea for free on top of it all qualitatively there isnt much between our relative experiences at this particular moment and one could argue that your life is in some respects as good as mine if one lived to argue glitsky got to the armchair in front of hardys desk and settled in i still want a better office he blew on the tea again okay he said why do we need to be masons ha hardys feet flew off the desk as he came forward i knew youd ask glitsky gave him the dead eye if i didnt ask wed never leave it so why hardy opened the book to the place hed marked because if we stayed at it long enough you could get to be the sovereign grand inspector general and i could be either prince of the tabernacle or chevalier of the brazen serpent he paused a moment frowned either way though youd outrank me so that couldnt be right how long would all this take glitsky asked hardy nodded ambiguously youre right he said and closed the book with a flourish so what brings your sunny personality here today what did the mayor want glitsky brought him uptodate keeping the punch line for last the original inspecting officerthe one im supposed to work with or replaceis dan cuneo hardys expression hardened his head canted to one side so replace him thats not a good idea hed see something personal in it hed be right my point exactly cant replace him hardy drew in a breath then let it out these past couple of years i kept hoping to hear hed been busted out of homicide not happening if youre a certain type of cop homicides a terminal appointment not for you it wasnt no but unlike cuneo im born for greatness the banter fell flat though and glitskys face reassumed its natural scowl i dont like him anywhere near either of us hardy said after a short silence do tell me im thrilled getting up crossing to the sutter street window hardy pulled the shades apart and looked down through them and youve got to work with him i dont see how i can avoid it hardy kept staring out down at the street you cant say a word abe not one word oh really a hint of anger or frustration breaking through hey hardy catching the tone spun around you work with a guy every day you know he suspects you of somethingi dont care what it isyou might get so you want to get along try to make him understand sure thats what ill do ill say uh dan about the gerson thing lieutenant barry gerson had been cuneos boss and hed been killed at a shootout in the course of trying to arrest one of hardys clients in the aftermath cuneo pushed for an investigation into the role that hardy and glitsky had played in gersons death im just saying i know that ill be tempted to reason with him tell him gerson was dirty and it was pure selfdefense we had no choice he shook his head at the absurdity of the idea you have my word i wont go there hardy came back and boosted himself onto his desk even if you dont though youre back on his radar he might remember what he forgot to keep up on forget nothing there wasnt any evidence thank god and he got ordered off i remember but he needs to stay off for both our sakes and working with you is going to bring up old memories thats all im saying i was aware of that even before i came in here believe it or not if you have any ideas im listening but otherwise the mayors ordered me to work with the guy what do you want me to do quit hardy brightened its a thought great let me just borrow your phone and ill call treya and let her know he stood up and went to pull some darts from the board turning back with them he shrugged ive kept a close eye on him as you might guess the plain factand good news for usis that hes careless and sloppy this mornings an example hes at hanovers fifteen minutes and tells the press its murdersuicide so its not i dont know ive got a couple of questions i dont see hanover burning down his house for one big one he just shoots the woman stands there a minute then does himself okay that flies but becker the arson inspector out there he says it looks like he did her then in no particular order after that poured gasoline on her wadded up a bunch of newspapers and opened the lowerfloor windows and at least one in the back on the top floor for ventilation after all that he goes back to where shes lying in the lobby starts the fire then shoots himself that does sound complicated hardy said glitsky nodded at least did you know him hanover slightly to look at i met him a couple of times but never faced him in court i cant say he made a huge impression kathy west wouldnt agree hardy broke a small grin he gave kathy west a lot of money abe if he gave me a lot of money id remember him better too pushing himself off his desk he took the darts from glitsky threw one of them you know heres a real idea and you wont have to quit use the opportunity to mend fences with cuneo he tells the media it looks like a murdersuicide you back him up say he did a fine job everybody wins everybody but kathy but thats what i will do if thats what it turns out to be in the meantime cuneos going to resent me being involved at all i guarantee it thats my real problem its going to look like im checking up on his work thats what you are doing glitsky sat back down elbows on his knees hung his head and shook it from side to side finally he looked back up ive got to talk to him he said glitsky got cuneos extension at work and calling from his car phone left a message that they needed to talk he was going to make every effort to be both conciliatory and cooperative they would be in this investigation together and would share information both with each other and with the arson inspectorsa mini task force but cuneo wasnt scheduled to be back on duty until six oclock and glitsky who preferred murder investigations to all other forms of police work thought he might spend some useful time long before that with the citys medical examiner john strout worked on the ground floor behind the hall of justice in the morgue and its accompanying rooms when glitsky got there somebody in the outer office buzzed him inside and he crossed through the clerical desks and knocked at strouts door getting no answer he turned the knob stuck his head in behind him one of the clerks said hes probably in the cold room glitsky nodded his acknowledgment and kept going closing the door behind him the office was goodsized by city bureaucratic standards perhaps twenty by thirty feet with a large wide window facing the freeway on the end behind strouts desk during his dozen years as head of the homicide detail glitsky would have occasion to come down here several times a monthcertainly at least once a week but now struck by an unfamiliar clutter he stopped in the middle of the office and suddenly realized that it had probably been close to five years since hed set foot down here or since hed had any substantive discussion with the good doctor in the interim he noticed strout had continued to indulge his proclivity for the bizarre if not to say macabre hed always kept a couple of shelves of unusual murder weaponsa bayonet two different fire pokers a baseball bat an impact shotgun intended for sharksand medieval torture implements out on display but now hed acquired what looked to glitsky like a small museum the centerpiece was an ancient garroting chaircomplete with its red silk scarf for ease of strangulation or maximum pain hanging from the beam in the backthat hed given pride of place directly in front of his desk a large glassenclosed case featured an impressive collection of knives and other cutting and slashing implements brass knuckles and spiked gloves one whole side of his desk was covered with hand grenades and other apparent incendiary and explosive devices of different design and vintage strout had the obligatory skeleton of course but instead of its old place standing next to the morgue cold room entrance the bones now sat in an easy chair legs crossed comfortably apparently enjoying a volume of the compendium of drug therapy suddenly the door to the cold room opened strout long and lean still in his white lab coat albeit smudged with black and reddish brown broke a genuine smile doctuh glitsky he spoke with a familiar baritone drawl bending from the waist in a courtly bow its been a hounds age glitsky extended a hand how are you john old and in the way if you must know but if theyre fool enough to let me keep on doing what i do down here im fool enough to let em strout was a few years on the other side of retirement age but showed little sign of slowing he looked glitsky up and down but god man yall are looking fit anybody tell you youre supposed to start showing your age sometime its like to give the rest of us a bad name ive got a new young wife john if i get to looking old shell leave me and then id have to go and kill her well wouldnt want that so what can i do for you im assuming this isnt strictly a social visit im doing some work on the fire last night paul hanover it is him then strout took a second then nodded odds are wallet says he was i cant tell from the body itself and nobody else could neither but ive already called his dentist and well know for sure by the end of the day he went over to his desk brushed some grenades out of the way and leaned against it glitsky sat on the garrote you want strout said you can move chester he pointed to the skeleton hes got the comfortable seat this is fine glitsky said what about the woman strout folded his arms lifted his shoulders first it definitely was a woman i couldnt be sure til i got her on the table crisped up terrible thats what i heard gasoline something hot if they think its gas i believe em from the damage my guess is she was on fire a good ten fifteen minutes longer than hanover and any id on her strout shook his head nothin on the body nothin under the body some witness said it might be hanovers girlfriend he turned and started to sort through a wire basket full of paper on the desk next to him glitsky beat him to the name missy damiens yeah thats it lived with him right thats what i hear evidently they were having problems though she was remodeling the place spending too much money remodeling well that explains it strout let out a brief chuckle closest my wife and me ever came to splittin up we redid a couple of rooms in the house back maybe ten years ago sposed to take two months went on over a year finally i just moved down here slept in chesters spot there til it was finally over if id stayed around i mighta killed her too after i killed the contractor of course son of a bitch so thats your take john hanover killed her no no no i got no take on that abe all i can tell you is they both died of gunshot wounds to the head any indication of who shot who if it was either one of them at all id say the man whys that the entry wound on the woman was high occipital catching himself he continued in laymans english high up on the very back she didnt shoot herself back up there what about the man just over the right ear good a spot as any glitsky sat still for a moment elbows on his knees the mayor wasnt going to like this news could it have been somebody else sure but no way for me to tell they would have had to have got out in a hurry but nothin on the bodies rules that out glitsky nodded and im assuming youre getting dentals on the woman too well we got the teeth problem is we dont know who her dentist was its funny you should ask that catherine hanover said that he hadnt awakened her with the phone call but he wasnt sure he believed her when hed identified himself and asked her permission to record the call as soon as she picked up her voice sounded hoarse slightly groggy now she cleared her throat again before continuing we both had the same dentist dr yamashiru his first name is toshio she spelled both names out on webster between union and green she had some problems with her teeth and didnt know anyone locally so she asked me who i went to so you two were close no not really i was the body standing nearest to her when the question came up so where did she come from before here that was always a little vague she had a french accent but she spoke english very well but where she came from didnt matter she had him wrapped im sorry what did you say your name was glitsky deputy chief glitsky im working this case with dan cuneo whom i believe you met last night yes i remember him glitsky found the response slightly offkey did you have a problem with inspector cuneo no not really i told him i thought it was missy and paul in there and about the renovation yes the stress in the voice was clear now something about cuneos interview with her had been troubling that too she said that they were having some troubles yes about the money she spent another small silence then im sorry inspector but did you say youd talked to inspector cuneo too no not yet ive got a call in to him but the arson inspector gave me your name and i had some questions i wanted to go over inspector cuneo will be back on tonight if youd be more comfortable talking with him no glitsky imagined her jumping in alarm at the suggestion she covered her reaction with a brush of nervous laughter i mean no i dont care who i talk to if ive got any information you might need ask away all right you told inspector cuneo that mr hanover and missy had been fighting over the amount shed spent on renovations to his house is that right yes it was obscene really something like a million dollars but that was missy although she fooled us at first well tried to fooled you in what way in the way that attractive younger women fool older men youre saying that she was after your fatherinlaws money not just after it she got a lot of it inspector you should have seen the engagement ring the hundredthousanddollar trophy rock we called it i mean it was just way over the top and that didnt include the clothes and the car and but obviously mr hanover gave her all this willingly oh yes according to him she was always wonderful to him sweet loving understanding although you should have seen her when marymy sisterinlaw mentioned that maybe she was going a little overboard on the house catherine hanover paused oh listen to me you know i really dont want to speak ill of the dead but it was so obvious that she was a gold diggervery subtle and very patientalthough paul wouldnt even hear of that of course we couldnt even bring up that he might at least consider that possibility get a prenup something but he wouldnt go there he loved her she was the love of his life and he was just so blessed that hed found her pardon me but puke so you didnt believe her none of us did and whos that all of you the family pauls daughters mary and beth my husband will the kids taking the opportunity to get some details on the extended family glitsky wrote down names addresses and telephone numbers but none of them came to the fire last night none of them knew about it until today or way late when i got back maybe one oclock i called mary and beth but got their machines my husband has been on a fishing trip off the coast of mexico for the past three daysi still havent gotten to him though hes due back in tomorrow hes going to be devastated about his father although maybe a bit relieved at the same time glitsky speaking on his office telephone shifted his weight to get more comfortable catherine hanover was turning out to be the often sought but rarely encountered mother lode of witnesses effortlessly providing him with facts people rumor and innuendo context why would he be relieved he asked well i dont mean really relieved that might be too strong but its no secret that we were all of us a little concerned about what would happen after missy and paul actually got married i mean will is an architect and we do all right but none of us have had pauls incredible financial success you were counting on an inheritance that sounds so coldblooded i dont know if saying we were counting on it is really accuratewe all loved paul and wanted him to live foreverbut lets face it he was worth a fortune that money had been sitting there as a possibility for us for so long lets just say that it was a bit of an adjustment after he started talking about marrying missy thinking it wouldnt be there anymore and now suddenly here it is again this sounds so terrible doesnt it i never even thought about the money until this morning really but then once i realized she stopped sighed into the receiver its terrible to talk like this she said im sorry glitsky said its natural enough but catherine couldnt drop the topic its just that there really was such a dramatic change after he started seeing her i mean until missy came along paul used to help with all the kids tuitions and wed all go to maui for christmas every year all of us the whole extended family for a week at napili kai stuff like that to say nothing of college coming up for all eight of the grandkids i really shouldnt say its a relief but again she trailed off glitsky wanted to keep her talking so missy lived with your fatherinlaw fulltime mostly i think yes for about the last two years and do you know any of her friends from before she met him no after she met paul there werent any other friends he was her fulltime job glitsky made a note that hed need to follow up on the friends of missy damiens if the investigation widened although for the moment it appeared that if anything it had narrowed down to the obvious original theory certainly catherine hanovers breezy admission of what might under other circumstances be considered a reasonable motive for murdera large inheritanceargued against her own involvement in any foul play he would of course verify the whereabouts of her husband and his two sisters last night but for the moment it looked like kathy west would remain disappointed in her benefactor and political ally but that moment abruptly came to an end during the next exchange can i ask you something inspector sure the arson inspector thought they both might have been shot have you found out if thats true yes it is so they were murdered yes maam or maybe one of them killed the other and then himself or herself maybe glitsky said although he found them compelling and consistent with his own experience he wasnt going to get into a discussion of inspector beckers theories on why in a scenario like this one it probably wasnt the woman but you think it was paul i dont know he was silent for a minute then realized that the details would undoubtedly be in the paper tomorrow possibly on the television in a couple of hours he wouldnt be giving anything away the location of the womans wound indicated that she didnt kill herself it was up behind her head probably not selfinflicted and what about pauls glitsky let out a breath about where youd expect in a suicide just over the right ear another short silence then catherine hanover said wait a minute the right ear yes youre sure the medical examiner was and he usually gets it right i think maybe you ought to go back and doublecheck why becausei thought everybody knew this butpaul had polio back in the early fifties his right arm was paralyzed it was dead he couldnt use it at all glitsky caught up to kathy west as she pursued a photo op out of the newly refurbished utilitarian yet lovely again ferry building at the bay the eastern end of market street the sun duskbound had just slipped under the blanket of coastal fog that came to cover the city at its western edge at this time of day at this time of year in late spring and early summer san francisco bore a marked climatic resemblance to newfoundland it was still nowhere near the evening proper although what had only moments before been a shining sparkling even inspiringly welcoming downtown suddenly lost its direct sunlight and turned quite cold now gusts of the chill earlyevening breeze flung open the jackets of businessmen rearranged the hairstyles of women newspapers and food wrappers swirled in the eddies of alleyways and skyscapers the mayors office told glitsky that hed find her somewhere along market if he missed her at the ferry building but he should try there first he had paganucci drop him out front and walked head down hands deep in his pockets until he got himself out of the wind and inside her honor and the press entourage surrounding her were just coming out of book passage where shed spontaneously picked up a couple of novels three cookbooks a handful of musical cds don novellos latest humor and a travel guide to italyall of it written and or performed by san franciscans glitsky was standing to the side listening with some skepticism while west talked to the assembled reporters extolling the virtues of the city its ongoing importance as a mecca of creativity and art as these many eclectic works so amply illustrated a bearded man in a wheelchair removed himself from the immediate group of a dozen or so reporters and photographers and rolled over next to him glitsky knew jeff elliot well a fellow alumnus along with west and himself of the das kitchen cabinet elliot wrote the chronicles citytalk column he suffered from multiple sclerosis and glitksy knew that he had recently had to abandon his sometime use of crutches for a fulltime wheelchair what are you doing here elliot said some business with the mayor want to talk about it see your name in the paper its what i live for glitsky almost smiled maybe later if it turns out to be anything dont let me keep you from getting a quote about how artistfriendly the city is youre not going to hear too many of them or none well the mayor just said it so it must be true if it is its a major scoop elliot looked up at him you know any struggling artists that actually live here i hear a couple of homeless guys are tagging every inch of the fourth street freeway ramp i dont think shes talking about them shes talking about the city supporting artists the only way it does that is if theyre homeless first and artists second elliot made no response listened to the mayor for another minute it must just be me he said what finding that this city is a bit of a challenge lately to survive in much less thrive and i shouldnt talk ive got a good job what if youre trying to do art can you imagine no but the mayor says were all open arms and brutus is an honorable man glitsky looked down at him if you say so jeff that was shakespeare antonys speech after they killed caesar i thought so glitsky said i was just going to say that he brought his attention back to the mayor so why are you here whats this about it cant be the poor struggling artists no actually its an interesting idea this is the first of kathys scheduled walking press conferences you havent read about them nope ive written about them twice now the neighborhood strolls still nope youre letting me down here abe ill give myself twenty lashes when i get home if i ever do so what are they about these strolls well its going to be in several different neighborhoods in the next weeks but today shes walking market from here to van ness thats a good walk lots of wildlife about twenty blocks worth glitsky lowered his voice is she nuts here to van ness thats derelict central yes it is i believe she knows that so she wants to see people peeing and worse in public fountains or selling dope on the street and shes doing this because because she wants people to know that she shares the same concerns for public safety cleanliness and general civility as does the majority of the public glitsky shook his head shes barking up the wrong tree jeff the voters dont care about that they care that were compassionate and diverse and sensitive but i dont see much sign of caring about public cleanliness well there you go but kathys idea is that by her witness to the decay in these areas shesand i believe im quoting hereserving notice that fixing this historically blighted corridor through the heart of the city is going to become a priority for my administration and a boon to the city in general and how is this going to happen again by her walking down it thats the theory we report on the problems she encounters awareness goes up people see how bad some places are and stop tolerating them this time glitsky snorted quietly no no youve got it backwards we need to tolerate them more because we dont understand them the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves shakespeare again thank you i guessed ah she sees you handing her shopping bag to one of her aidesshe hadnt known glitsky was going to be there but she instinctively rose to a political moment when she saw oneshe turned to the reporters quite a decent crowd considering that there was no real story to cover excuse me she said i need to talk to the deputy chief in an instant she was at their side greeting them both asking elliot if he could give them a moment glitsky lifted a hand in an ambiguous salutehe was either greeting kathy or saying goodbye to elliot or maybe both i didnt mean to crash your party your honor if youre in the middle of something abe i told you this morning its kathy and no this is fine we can talk as we walk the two left the ferry building with the reporter contingent including jeff elliot hanging back a respectable distance the first several blocks along market while congested with foot and automobile traffic nevertheless were relatively clean and populated with people who worked downtown it had very little of the urban blight that kathy west was hoping to expose so it left her free to talk with glitsky as they walked hooking her hand in his arm she set a brisk pace im surprised to see you so soon im assuming this is about paul hanover do you have something pretty much what you wanted glitsky said ive talked to john strout and hanovers daughterinlaw and between them got convinced that theres very little chance he killed anybody including himself in a few words he outlined what hed discoveredthe entry wound over the right ear the other one in the back of the womans head so really thats about it he could only have shot himself by some awkward contortion that makes no sense and she had the same problem so it probably didnt happen that way when the chief said you were good abe he wasnt kidding was he ill take lucky over smart every time i ran into the right people they had gotten down as far as seventh street and now the mayors eyes were flicking back and forth rapidly scanning for the signs of urban decay that glitsky knew would begin appearing any minute but her mind hadnt left their topic so what happens now she asked what do you mean with the investigation well it continues of course back with inspector cuneo which is where it belongs a few more quick steps and then she stopped abruptly this would be the same inspector cuneo who told the press this morning that this was a murdersuicide glitskys lips went tight for a beat before he answered thats what it looked like to me too when i first got there yes but you didnt tell anybody about it until you had more facts did you he showed her what he hoped would pass for a smile ive gotten a little more used to dealing with the media than your average inspector be that as it may abe the fact remains that youve made real progress in half a day and inspector cuneo hasnt been any part of it thats not strictly accurate he talked to hanovers daughterinlaw first last night but managed not to learn that paul had a withered arm he didnt know where the entry wound was so he wouldnt have known why that mattered precisely when he could have shown some initiative and gone to the morgue with the body isnt that the case glitsky could only shrug maybe he should have done that you would have this was true but glitsky shrugged it off again well either way he said weve got a good idea that mr hanover didnt do anything wrong thats what you wanted this morning she fixed him with that avian intensity but unfortunately thats no longer the point glitsky waited the point abe is that we now know that paul was murdered dont we and you dont think it was the girlfriend missy which means they were both murdered by someone else and that being the case do you think i have any confidence at all that inspector cuneo will be more successful catching the person who killed one of my close friends and benefactors than he was identifying the cause or manner of death in the first place you dont have to struggle with it the answer is no the gaggle of reporters following them had stopped when they did and now out of the corner of his eye glitsky thought he picked up an increasing awareness among some of them including jeff elliot that something significant might be transpiring here right in front of them between the deputy chief of inspectors and the mayor he considered that the time might be propitious to try to get some mileage out of wests insistence that the two of them were really basically friends he stepped closer to her strove for a casual tone he couldnt keep his job in homicide if he wasnt effective kathy lanier would have lateralled him out abe west wasnt having it help me out here i understand a little bit about politics and i see your concerns if it makes it easier for you you can let inspector cuneo remain on the case in some capacity but id count it as a personal favor if you stayed on with it too whoever killed paul hanover isnt going to get away with it on my watch if i can help it and youre the best man to see that he doesnt she reached out and put a hand on his arm looked up into his face abe please for me glitsky glanced at the reporters a couple of whom had already snapped some photos this was turning into too visible a moment laden with intrigue and import it had to end or it would grow and become a real event and he wanted to avoid that at all costs at last coming back to her he patted wests hand in a fraternal gesture and nodded all right kathy he said let me see what i can do cuneo lived alone on what had formerly been the grounds of the alameda naval air station across the bay from san francisco the ninehundredsquarefoot standalone building which back in the fifties had housed a marine engine repair shop sat perched on a concrete slab that jutted out ten feet into the channel all day every day flotillas of mostly small saltwater craft glided by his bedroom window sometimes close enough to touch the ferry to san francisco passed every hour or so too as well as the occasional coast guard or naval vessel after six hours of fitful sleep cuneodreaming of firestarted awake at twenty minutes after four in the afternoon tangled up in his blankets he was breathing hard and sweating throwing and kicking the covers off he shot up to sitting and looked from side to side getting his bearings the smoke smell was real enough allpervasive in the small house he let his breathing slow down the tendrils of his nightmare still clutching at his psyche for another minute or so he sat as he almost never did in absolute stillness he wore only his jockeys but the stench of last nights smoke still clung to his skin at last unconsciously he lifted the heel of his right foot let it fall lifted it again in seconds still unaware he was tapping a steady rhythm on the concrete floor next to the bedroom on the water in the back a tiny lowceilinged workroom huddled to one side of the house going forward the kitchen and bathroom divided the central segment of the building twothirds to one and after putting some water on to boil cuneo stopped in at the bathroom for a shower mostly to get the smell off him when he was done wearing his towel he made some nescafetwo spoons of crystals no sugar or cream and went back to put on his clothes up in the front of the house a relatively spacious living room provided two front and two side windows that gave the space an open feel and plenty of light a leather love seat sat against one wall a small teak bookshelf and television stand on the other by far the most immediately noticeable furnishing though was a full set of ludwig drums in the middle of the room cuneo didnt have any idea where his nearest neighbors home might be but it was at least out of earshot he could play all day as loud as he wanted and nobody ever complained three years ago after his fellow inspector lincoln russell finally couldnt take partnering with him anymore lieutenant lanier had recommended that maybe he might want to see a psychologisthis insurance through the city would pay for the first three visitsand try to get some handle on why he couldnt ever sit still or shut up he would sing to himself driving to crime scenes hum during interrogations often break into unconscious song while he wrote up his reports in homicide maybe he had tourettes syndrome or saint vitus dance or something lanier had suggested and if he did it would be better to at least know what he was dealing with as it turned out he only saw the shrinkadrienne schwartzprofessionally the three times that his insurance covered it though they dated for six weeks or so after that until she started hinting that she was looking for some kind of commitment the best thing shed done for him was recommend that he buy the drums and take some lessons and now hed almost always start his day with a twentyminute workout getting it all moving by playing along with some cds of the classic big band guysbuddy rich gene krupa louis bellson today though he didnt do his full twenty ten minutes into it in the middle of sing sing sing he suddenly stopped stood up grabbed his jacket the hanover woman from last night was a real babe and hed picked up the definite sense that she and her husband werent doing too well shed told him he was down in mexico fishing for a week and it didnt seem to bother her too much he didnt think hed have too much to do with the murdersuicidethat appeared to be straightforward enoughbut hed want to be thorough find out what he could you never knew the arson inspectors and their police counterparts would have a hundred or more names theyd picked up at the scene and hed want to find if any of those potential witnesses had seen anything that might be telling might call the basic facts into question but first the hanover woman again see how she was handling the tragedy if she was lonely or horny one of the benefits of working nights was commuting against the traffic cuneo checked in at the hall of justice within twenty minutes of walking out his front door up in the homicide detail lanier wasnt in his office and the other four inspectors still at work said hello from their desks and then cordially ignored him the usual assortment of housekeeping and other messages cluttered his voice maila snitch needing some cash to hold him over until he testified in court another witness sounding very afraid about her upcoming testimony against her husband who was in jail for murdering their mutual lover a friendly notice from payroll that his overtime last pay period had exceeded the approved hours another call that he was behind on his credit union payments the arson guy becker wondering how he wanted to arrange his pickup of last nights witness list a woman hed stopped seeing recently barely audible to the other inspectors he was humming the opening riff to satisfaction over and over and over as he listened to the messages writing notes and phone numbers on the pad he carried in his back pocket glitskys was the last message and hearing it cuneo went silent he played the message again aware that a flush of anger was rising to his face but otherwise trying to keep his expression neutral he threw a quick glance around the room wondering if any of his colleagues might have heard something if they were watching for his reaction but no one was paying him any mind the recording told him that hed finished with his last message to press one if hed like to hear it again two if hed like to save it three to delete it it told him the same thing all the way through again when it started to tell him for a third time he finally heard it and slowly replaced the receiver what the hell did this mean the deputy chief of inspectors didnt just call and say oh by the way ill be working with you on your latest case cuneo had never heard of anything like it hed been without a partner for almost three years now and didnt think much about whether he was popular or not he was under the impression hed been doing a good job making triable cases on five killers in the past eight months had gotten the collars it was much better than the average for the detail certainly it was the best stretch hed ever enjoyed professionally but what else could this be about except that somebody was checking up on him and his work and on this of all cases which on the face of it appeared very close to a slam dunk it had to mean that they were going to begin some kind of bullshit documentation for moving him out of homicide maybe out of the pd altogether and why would lanier or anybody else want to do that sitting back in his chair he began tattooing the arms of it with a steady rapid beat it couldnt be about his work product he thought if it was lanier was straightshooter enough to have told him even if it was true that he and glitsky went way back sometimes even saw each other socially cuneo wondered if his lieutenant even knew about the message glitsky had leftif he did he certainly would have given cuneo some warning or at least an explanation this kind of thing just wasnt done it wasnt right more it was an insult and then he stopped his drumming took in a lungful of air and let it out slowly suddenly with a crystal clarity he realized what this was really about what it had to be about and it wasnt his work over the months and years since hed started in homicide cuneo hadnt made much of a secret of his feelings for glitsky when hed been a newcomer to the detail still partnered with russell one of his first cases had concerned the shooting of an old man named sam silverman who ran a pawnshop a couple of blocks off union square at that time the head of homicide was barry gerson and glitskynominally a lieutenantworked in a sergeants position as supervisor of payroll in the course of cuneos investigation into silvermans death this nobody glitsky somehow insinuated himself into the details businessbutting in offering his advice getting in the way hed once run homicide and the unwelcome interference struck cuneo russell and gerson as a power play to get his old job back eventually his investigation made it clear to cuneo that glitskys other motive for his involvement in that case was to help out a defense attorney friend of his named dismas hardy whose client john holiday was the chief suspect in the killing when gerson finally went out to pier to arrest holidaycuneo believed the event had to have been arranged by hardy in some waysomething went terribly wrong holiday gerson and three patrol specials that the lieutenant had brought with him as backup all wound up shot to death the perpetrators never identified or of course apprehended promoted to homicide lieutenant to fill gersons spot lanier had conducted the investigation into the incident he had a talk with his longtime friend and colleague glitsky and no surprise found nothing hardy had never left his office that day eitherten witnesses there said so there was no case against either of the men although cuneo in his heart of hearts continued to believe that somehow theyd both been involved when he learned that glitskys alibi for the time in question was hardys law partner gina roake his belief became near certainty but though he took his questions to lanier and then on his own and top secret to jerry ranzetti with the office of management and control which investigated internal affairs he couldnt get to anything approaching proof of wrongdoing ranzetti even told him that hed run across issuesnot exactly hewing strictly to the departments best interestswith both glitsky and hardy working together in at least one other previous case but not only were both men extremely well connectedtight with the da some supervisors the chief of police even the mayorbut knowing the system intimately as they both did they played it like maestros and made no mistakes his interest piqued by cuneos theory though ranzetti did nose around for a while on the gerson killingafter all this was a cop shooting and so of the highest prioritybut he hadnt been able to put either glitsky or hardy anywhere near the scene when the shootings had occurred then the next thing cuneo knew frank batiste became chief and glitsky the payroll clerk got himself promoted over half the rest of the qualified lieutenants to deputy chief he considered the appointment a travesty and wasnt particularly discreet about sharing his opinion with some of his fellow cops without a doubt through lanier or one of the other homicide people whod heard him spouting off glitsky had heard of cuneos disapprovalto say nothing of his allegations of criminal complicity and coverup cuneo sat dead still the thinker his elbow resting on his chairs arm his chin in his hand thats what glitskys phone message was really abouthe was serving notice cuneo had trashtalked and then tried to backstab him and glitsky had found out now it was payback time catherine hanover lived in a small moorishstyle twostory stucco home in the marina district on beach street a block east of the palace of fine arts as was his wont when time didnt press cuneo parked within sight of the address she had given him last night and sat in his car watching and getting a feel for the place while he drummed on the steering wheel what he saw was a low stucco fence that bounded a wellkept property at the sidewalk the houses on either side were both noticeably larger outsized for their lots the hanovers front yard wasnt deep by any stretch and a brace of mature trees canopied nearly all of it he noted the black mercedesbenz cclass sedan parked in the driveway and the lights upstairs behind what looked like a functional woodenrailed deck this area of the city tended to get more sunshine than points farther west and the low evening rays painted the entire neighborhood in a mellow gold cuneo popped a breath mint checked his hair in the mirror and opened the car door a good breeze made him reach back in for his jacket the genes were good in the family he thought the teenage girl who answered the door might have been a face model hi she said can i help you well brought up too he had his badge out his polite smile on im inspector cuneo san francisco homicide i was hoping to talk to your mother he turned the wattage up on his smile im assuming catherine hanover is your mother you got it every day im polly she half turned mom theres a policeman out here to see you over the young womans shoulder catherine appeared from around a corner she carried a dish towel and was wiping her hands with it well invite him in then as she came closer he noticed a white streak of something high on her cheek her daughter saw it too and she took the towel and wiped off the offending stuff whatever it was and gave the towel back a friendly look passed between mother and daughter then polly went back to wherever shed been and catherine as lovely as hed remembered was standing in front of him hello again she said with some formality she touched her cheek flour she said im making pasta it gets everywhere im afraid please come in thank you he was already inside closing the door did you say you were making pasta thats right not the sauce the actual noodles she favored him with a smile the actual noodles do you like homemade noodles i dont believe ive ever had them you should try theyre a lot of work but worth it i think in the light of day catherines face was nearly as perfect as her daughters rescued from mere cuteness by deeply set green eyes and a strong nose a striking mature face my children are so spoiled they wont even eat storebought anymore its got to be my own maybe i should be flattered she twisted the towel took in and let out a quick breath cuneo was standing next to her and reached out his hand he touched her arm as though commiserating somehow she backed away a step anyway youre not here for that no he stayed close to her we like to come by and see how everybodys holding up the day after is often worse for next of kin also frankly maybe things occur to you that might have gone right by in the emotion of the moment like last night like what i dont know anything something your fatherinlaw might have been going through or missy said why he might have had a reason to kill her her eyes narrowed and she cocked her head to one side what do you mean about what well you were just talking about why paul might have wanted to kill missy i thought you had decided that that couldnt have happened you the police i mean thats what the other inspector told me anyway the other inspector glitsky thats it glitsky you talked to him already yes he called a few hours ago we talked for about fifteen minutes i would have thought you two would have communicated together havent you talked to him cuneo showed nothing smiling shrugging he made it clear that this was normal enough he patted her arm again hes on days sometimes we cross each other its all right but how did you get to hanover not shooting anybody thats what you said isnt it right she had backed away another step and bumped her leg against one of the rooms chairs suddenly she put a hand to her forehead what am i thinking keeping you standing out here like this without waiting for an answer she turned and led the way pulled out a chair for him around an oval wellused wooden table that overlooked the backyard then she was moving back across the kitchen can i get you some water coffee anything im good thanks he sat half turned kept his eyes on her obviously appraising obviously approving he thought he was keeping it lowkey even subtle so he said as his fingers started tapping on the table glitsky she finally tucked the dish towel into the refrigerators handle and now with her hands free didnt seem to know what to do with them leaning up against the kitchen counter she crossed them over her breasts well i told him about pauls right arm being useless since the polio so he sure didnt shoot himself over the right ear not with his right hand anyway no cuneo said id guess not and then since missys wound was up in the back of her headyou knew that he nodded though it was news to him so she probably didnt shoot herself there either so someone else was there thats what inspector glitsky seemed to think its the only thing that fit the sound of steps on stairs and then a tall wellbuilt hazelhaired teenage boy entered the kitchen wearing the uniform of cargo pants and a gray cal sweatshirt he stopped in his tracks when he saw cuneo looked at his mother back to the inspector hey he said cuneo nodded hey my son saul she said saul this is inspector cuneo hes investigating who might have killed your grandfather at the mention of it the boys shoulders sagged and his face rearranged itself to accommodate the grief that threatened to show cuneo stood up and the boy came over to shake his hand nice to meet you he said i hope you catch him whoever it was you got along well with your grandfather he nodded he was great he rocked he really did looking out the windows over cuneos shoulder he shook his head i cant believe somebody killed him maybe they really wanted to kill his girlfriend and he was just there yeah saul said maybe that awkward he stood another moment then turned to his mother i was just getting some food all right but save room for dinner she pointed toward the refrigerator and he walked over lifted a carton of milk and went to drink from it saul oh yeah he grabbed a glass from the cupboard filled it with milk found a handful of cookies and started to leave but then stopped at the doorway i hope you catch him he said again really were trying when sauls steps had retreated back upstairs cuneo got up from his chair and crossed over to where catherine was standing youve got nice kids he said is that all of them theres one more upstairs heather the youngest its homework time so im surprised you got to see any of them this time of day they just disappear and theyre just working like that on their own you must be one heck of a good mother whats your secret are you kidding its daytoday survival just so they keep talking to you and dont ever get a chance to forget that you love them more than anything do you have children he hung his head for an instant regrettably im single an apologetic smile just never found the right woman i guess figuring the segue was seamless cuneo asked by the way have you had any luck contacting your husband yet no she snapped it out suddenly edgy then covering hes a little late getting in is all probably means he caught a lot of fish the sides of her mouth rose although it was a sad sort of a smile and she sighed well be eating albacore til christmas im sure hell call when he gets in cuneo took another step toward her looked around the warm room again laid a brief touch on her forearm if i had this to come home to i know i would he said yes well she crossed to the refrigerator grabbed the dish towel turned to face him now twisting the towel some more well she said again that pasta isnt going to make itself if theres nothing else i think that about covers it ill check in with glitsky and get ourselves coordinated im sorry about doubleteaming you thats never our intention people get nervous around too many cops he smiled right at her youre not nervous are you no well maybe a little bit dont be not with me anyway im harmless really and much sweeter than i look cuneo flashed a grin then got his wallet and pulled out his business card grabbed his pen from his shirt pocket here he said writing on the board where she was making her pasta this is my home number work is printed on the front if you think of anything you think might be relevant anytime day or night or even if you just want to talk if your husband goes fishing again he let it hang half a joke but serious enough if she wanted to take him up on it she was nervous though he was thinking as he drove up to beckers fire station nervous the whole time something definitely was going wrong with her husband but no thoughts not even those about his possible future conquest of catherine hanover could stand up to the immediacy of his problem with glitsky now not only had the man usurped his case hed stood it on its ear this morning when hed gone off duty cuneo was all but convinced that this seemed to be a more or less straightforward murdersuicide with hanover and damiens the only two principals involved unfortunately thats what hed told some reporters now here it was barely twelve hours later and glitsky had gotten in behind him to his witnesses to know the details about the locations of the head wounds he must have also gone to the medical examiner so he was working this case soup to nuts and already had a big jump in spite of the fact that cuneo was out of the gate first cuneo figured that his only chance to save his job was to catch up but the good news was that this case now looked like a righteous a firstdegree double murder this was what cuneo did and did well and it had the added bonus that paul hanover was an important and wellknown citizen and missy damiens as his fiancee was going to have an interesting story as well it wasnt generally appreciated how few murders had bona fide motives in his experience most times people got killed for inane reasons some husband wouldnt let his wife change the channel some guys dog shit on another guys step they wouldnt turn down the goddamned music stupid but with someone like hanover or maybe even missy there would probably be a righteous motivemoney betrayal extortion jealousy whoever killed these people would have done it for a specific reason find the reason and the job was essentially done of course proving the motive was a whole different kettle of fish than simply identifying the person who had it you needed physical evidence but at least with a solid motive youd know where to look he could get this case back from glitsky yet hed make another appointment with catherine with the rest of the family check out paul hanovers relations with past clients and partners exwives if any people to or from whom he donated or accepted money he dan cuneo would find who benefited from these deaths and bring that person in hed make the arrest and solve this case before glitsky knew what had hit him arnie becker was still going his younger partner j p dodd in a filthy charcoalstained tshirt and black pants was crashed on the cot in their little side room at the arson unit headquarters on evans street but beckershowered and looking freshly dressedsat at a card table sorting through what looked to be a few hundred scraps of paper placing them into discrete piles in front of him as though he were dealing poker cuneo knocked on the open door how you doin becker stopped looked up smiled politely it might not have been damiens he said he scanned the piles in front of him and put his hand on one a thin one two pieces of paper who the woman in the fire becker nodded handed the paper across those two peopletheyre marriedsaw her walking from the house just before the alarm got called in saw missy theyre sure a couple of them reasonably enough others not so sure but if it was missy then who was in the house i dont know his face suddenly looked much younger invigorated by the question youve got to love a good mystery though now and again dont you whos missing besides her and if its not herdamiensdead in the house then where might she be huh really cuneo looked at the names and addresses you got copies of these already made em those are yours a pause you talk to glitsky this morning a little after you left so he knows about this becker didnt even look up obviouslyand why would he nothe assumed the two cops were working together and cuneo saw no reason to raise a flag the arson inspector continued sorting methodically i figured youd be around sooner than he was and you could tell him these people arent going anywhere they live right there on steiner finally he sat back id like to know who it was though in the house if it wasnt missy cuneo said then whoever she was looks pretty good for the murders he nodded if it was her that people saw leaving maxine willis lived in one of the surviving painted ladies three houses down from paul hanovers in her early fifties she was a very large handsome welldressed black woman with a deep and booming voice her living room walls were stylishly adorned with tribal african artdarkwood masks spears several framed works depicting working people or animals completely rendered in butterfly wings the sofa was zebra skin the chairs brown leather out the jutting front window enough natural light remained that they could still see the park but it was fading fast no see i knew it was her and it was a little earlier than this she said she turned and they both glanced at the clock on the mantel i saw her clearly missy damiens she nodded although i hadnt ever met her to talk to i didnt know her name until i read it in the paper this morning but it was mr hanovers girlfriend all right id seen her here on the block a hundred times would you mind telling me exactly where you were and what you saw cuneos foot tapped a time or two but he caught it and willed it to stop though immediately he began to tap his notebook well joseph and i were having a party with some friends cyril and jennifer just some supper and then we were going to go up to slims where a friend of ours was playing but then of course the fire put an end to all that and joseph is my husband i expect him now any minute he saw her too from where right here in this room uh huh the light is so good come evening we like to have our cocktails out here with the park out there across the way she closed her eyes for a minute then moved to the windows that looked out over the street i was about right here cuneo came over and stood next to her the park was deserted except for a man walking a dog on the crest of the hill nearer the street in front of them yawned empty although cars lined both sides of it no pedestrians on the sidewalks either the area was still a mess due to the fire okay and where did ms damiens pass maxine willis lifted the lace curtain to one side and pointed just out there she was parked by that near light post just up the street so she was going to her car she nodded and do you know what kind of car it was could you tell from here i didnt have to see it from last night i knew it from other times too she drove a black mercedes one of the smaller ones i think the ctypes cuneo looked out then back at his witness if this was going to be a positive identification he wanted to eliminate any possible ambiguities and one had occurred to him were you facing the way you are now toward the car yes and she was on the other side of the street right so you wouldnt have seen her until she was past you then walking away isnt that right well sideways maybe joseph saw her first he was standing about where you are cuneo again stared across into the street after a minute let me ask you this he said why would he notice her face clouded for a moment im not sure what you mean well i mean theres four of youfour rightfour of you standing around having some drinks and joseph sees some woman walk by outside so what why would he comment on it werent people walking by all the time striking a thoughtful pose she crossed her arms over her chest i dont recall saying anybody commented about it man know better than act like that she looked at him almost challenging maybe waiting for him to show a sign of understanding when none appeared she sighed hes standing here by the window and suddenly his eyes go wide poor fool dont even know hes doing it so i look to see what he likes so much and its her all right so i give him the look you know and he knows hes caught mans always been a sucker for a pretty girl and she was pretty enough so the other two your other guests what happened with them cyril and jennifer they look to see what josephs making eyes about thats all it wasnt a big thing at the time nobody even mentioned it out loud until the fire happened then later out in the street we heard people saying it was missy in the house with him this was after we told the inspector wed seen her so what did you do then i mean after you heard that she shrugged nothing what was i supposed to do i figured i must have gotten it wrong until you told me just now that it might not have been her in the house after all which had to mean it was her walking by all along but let me get this straight from last night all the way until when i told you ten minutes ago that maybe it wasnt missy in the house maybe it was someone else you could not have sworn that the woman you saw walking by out there was her maxine frowned no i didnt think about that i just figured she went back in later maybe went out somewhere and came back that could explain it am i right i thought it was her glitsky sat at his desk reviewing utilization and arrest numbers lost in the tedium until the telephone rang and he realized that it had grown dark outside surprised anew that cuneo had apparently decided not to check in with him at all he got the phone in the middle of the second ring glitsky abe his wife a sigh ofrelief good youre there is everything all right he looked at his watch i guess not if the time got away from me so badly is it really eight thirty close enough what have you been doing last i heard you had been summoned by the mayor and were running out to see her and i did too twice in fact what did she want its a bit of a story it could even be construed as good news of a sort you sound like dismas construed as good news of a sort you think you qualified that enough i said it was a story its good that shes got confidence in me i suppose i could tell you in person in twenty minutes thatd be nice i have something that might be construed as good news of a sort myself you got a raise no its not money that would be unalloyed good news unalloyed talk about a hardy word so your news isnt unalloyedly good unalloyedly is that even a word this is getting too complicated for me ill tell you when you get home glitsky lived in a smallish threebedroom upper duplex just north of lake street in a culdesac that bounded the leafy southern border to the presidio hed raised isaac jacob and orel there with his first wife flo after the cancer claimed her he moved a mexican nannyhousekeeper named rita schultz into the living room where shed slept behind a screen and helped with the boys for six years now glitsky had a new life treyas daughter and all of his sons away living theirs rita no longer stayed with them fulltime sleeping behind the screen but she still came every day to care for rachel if hed come home when his shift technically ended at five glitsky could have had paganucci drop him at his front step but since his promotion he almost never left the hall until at least seven and often much later the job didnt really have anything like regular hours and to pretend it did was to fail in it and failure was not on his agenda so there were always endless meetingswith chiefs lieutenants civic and businesspeople department headsto attend tedious yet necessary administrative duties to perform fences to mend people to simply visit flesh to press and parties to attend and press conferences to hold and all of these things happened on their own timetable not his so to get to and from work he usually checked out a car from the city lot next to the hall and invariably had to park it at best a few blocks from his home now glitsky was on the last leg of a sixblock hike from the nearest parking place that he could find coming up on the opposite side of the street with the lateafternoon wind just beginning to ebb now he stopped and looked up into the lighted front windows of the rentcontrolled place where hed long since decided he would probably die a shadow moved across the shades and he recognized the cameo of his wife pacing in the living room the vision stopped him against all of his own expectations and preconceptions he had somehow with treya been able to find happiness again sometimes as now the feeling all but overwhelmed him senor abe hed neither seen her in the dark nor heard her on the quiet street and he reacted startled at the sound recovering he put his hand on his heart and rolled his eyes with what was for him wild theatricality rita he said what are you still doing here just talking to senora treya what about the housekeeper reached out took his wrist and tapped on his watch looking up she gave him a look of benevolent understanding women things when he got to his front door twelve steps up from the street treya was there holding it open for him twoandahalfyearold rachel awake way past her bedtime and finally seeing her father broke from around treyas legs and threw herself headlong at him daddy daddy daddy daddy catching her up he gathered her in smothering her with kisses while she squealed with delight with a last kiss he pulled her close then caught something in his wifes eye rita tells me you and she were talking about womens things does that have to do with your maybe good news treya kissed him hello quickly on his cheek then turned away and stepped back to let the two of them in have you been crying she kept herself turned away shook her head no but too fast and she started walking toward the kitchen still carrying rachel glitsky followed trey im just emotional she said about this possibly good news which i so hope it is she squared her shoulders took a deep breath and turned to face him it looks like were going to have another baby she waited breathless for a minute then unloosed a torrent are you okay with that please say you are i know we never talked about it specifically i mean whether we were actually trying and i just found out this morning ive been wanting to tell you all day but didnt just want to leave a message and then when you didnt call me even once during the day or come home i thought the mayor must have done something awful and i didnt want to bother you by calling at work if you had some crisis but then it got so late glitsky closed the distance between them and put his free arm around her sandwich hug rachel in heaven between them sandwich hug treya repeated to her daughter kissing her then she looked up at her husband through a film of tears okay its okay isnt it more than okay he said unalloyed the next morning friday dismas hardy made it downstairs at a few minutes past seven breakfast noises emanated from the dining room but he walked directly across the kitchen first to the coffeepot where he poured himself a cup turning right into the family room toward the back of the house he tapped the glass of his tropical fish tank and poured some food into it all his dozen little fishies seemed to be in good health as they rocketed to the surface the tank was algaefree the pump gurgled with a quiet efficiency you love those guys dont you his wife frannie stood in the doorway love might be a little strong being reserved only for my mate he crossed over and kissed her good morning that would be you the mate loves wife more than goldfish she said and people say the romance goes never with us except theyre not goldfish not at forty to sixty bucks a pop sixty dollars and they weigh what one ounce that would be one of the big ones frannie stared into the tank for a minute ill never complain about the price of salmon again speaking of which are you eating breakfast this morning because if you are youd better get in there the lox is almost gone in ten seconds he was standing glaring down at the dining room table both of his children were engrossed in their morning newspapervincent on the comics rebecca with the rest of the datebook section a toasted half bagel rested in front of his regular chair at the head of the table but there was no sign of any lox although two small empty plates held traces of cream cheese and crumbs vincent frannie didnt wait to analyze didnt i ask you to save some lox for your father the boy looked up in total affront hands to his chest all outraged innocence hey its not me i did he pointed across the table talk to her the beck was a step ahead of her mother i didnt hear you say that she turned to her father i would have dadyou know i would but hardy didnt get a chance to answer her this evidently hadnt been the first moment of friction between the women in the house this morning and frannies frustration now boiled over a bit you were sitting right where you are now when i said it she said how could you not have heard me i thought you were talking to vincent so you turned your hearing aid off was that it you know i was talking to both of you okay but i just didnt hear you i didnt think you were talking to me okay no not okay join the rest of us in the world here would you uh guys hardy waded in delicately he never knew what would happen when he got between his wife and his daughter its okay i got my coffee im happy im happy for you frannie said but thats not the point and its not okay shes been doing this kind of thing all the time lately and nobody else seems to notice or care uh oh hardy thought all the time now rebeccas tone went up a big notch all the time i dont even know what youre talking about i havent done anything except eat some stupid lox which was right out here on the table in front of me okay if i ate it im sorry but what do you want me to do mom barf it back up she put her finger into her mouth following the action vincent suddenly threw his comics page down and jumped up away from the table easy beck come on hardy intervened at the same instant dont barf it up ill just go throw a couple of my tropicals on this bagel dont make a joke out of it frannie said its not funny im not going to really barf it up rebecca rolled her eyes in what hardy believed was an expression of the platonic ideal of teenage pique all right then frannie obviously didnt think it was even slightly all right but the fight had gone out of her and she turned and disappeared back into the kitchen hardy debated whether to follow her or not and decided theyd both be happier in the long run if he didnt if he went to her theyd just keep talking about the beck and how they were losing control over her how she didnt respect them any longer how he didnt take an active enough role anymore it would all escalate and somehow become all about him and frannie didnt he see the way she was getting didnt he care what was happening to his daughter he did care he simply didnt spend as much time with her as his wife did didnt identify with her in a more or less absolute way and didnt really think he needed to his daughter was growing up becoming independent which he believed was her fundamental job and doing fine at it better than fine even with her incredible grade point average president of a couple of clubs working a night a week this semester tutoring math hardy honestly believed that she hadnt heard frannie issue her warning about the lox she would never have eaten it if shed thought it was meant for her father but frannie would have said that was the problemshe didnt think about anybody but herself to which his answer was of course not shes a teenager but this wasnt a popular response he sat down and took a bite of his bagel pointed to the rest of the newspaper down by his sons elbow vin could you please hand me a section he asked then sotto voce to the beck i dont think you ate my lox on purpose but you might want to go tell your mother youre sorry you yelled at her except you know dad she whispered she yelled at me but shaking her head she got up anyway and disappeared back into the kitchen vincent back in his chair shook his own head rolled his eyes girls hardy nodded in understanding in this he and his son were allies then he pointed again said the paper please if i cant eat lox at least i can read my morning paper vin reached over and grabbed the front pagedoubletimeand went to pass it up the table glancing at the front page as he did hey he said uncle abe and the papers progress halted vin hardy his voice suddenly sharp snapped a finger now please the tone brooked no argument in a second vincent up and over his shoulder the two males were reading the caption under the fourcolumn frontpage picture of glitsky smartly saluting the mayor deputy chief of police abraham glitsky gets his marching orders from kathy west yesterday afternoon at the ferry building at the beginning of the mayors first neighborhood stroll the new administration plans to bolster police presence as well as civic awareness in troubled areas of the city and glitskys appearance according to the mayor underscored the spirit of cooperation between her office and the police department that both sides hope to build upon uncle abes getting famous vincent said just what hes always wanted i always thought he hated that stuff he does hes going to hate this picture maybe i should call him and tell him how cute and official he looks saluting and all subservient even hed probably come over and shoot you dad yeah youre right maybe ill give him a day to get used to it before he checked in at his office glitsky stopped in at the homicide detail where lieutenant marcel lanier sat behind a desk that filled most of his office and knocked at the open door permission to enter lanier snorted said denied then waved his superior inside early call abe cuneo howd you guess incredible psychic powers hes not happy with things and i cant say i blame him its the mayor thats what i hear too the point glitsky said is that if were both going to be working the case and we are we ought to be communicating as it is i dont know what he knows and vice versa i dont think hes even talked to strout yet so he might not even know that missy couldnt have shot herself or that hanover couldnt have done himself either for that matter and taken together that eliminates murdersuicide and leaves a righteous double so what do you want me to do talk to him tell him im not poaching laniers face went through a subtle change of expression glitsky felt a heat rise into his face he spoke with an exaggerated calm do you think i am marcel no if you say the mayor put you on it what could you do lanier came forward elbows on the desk but look abe its no secret that you and her honor are friends thats not lanier held up a hand please strictly true or not thats the perception theres no denying it he paused especially after this mornings paper okay call a spade a spade at the very least no ones going to deny youre allies right so one of her benefactors gets murdered and cuneo randomly pulls the case and next thing you know youre on it too as a special assignment tell me if you worked here if you were him that wouldnt fry your ass lanier leaned back in his chair again linked his fingers over his stomach look abe its no secret hes not one of your fans and i dont get the impression youre one of his he all but accused me of accessory to murder marcel thats pretty much kept the warm and fuzzies at bay around him okay sure i see that but youve got to admit that this thing with you and the mayor might smack him as something in the line of a personal vendetta glitsky took a beat youve already talked to him about this no but he left a message for me this morning relatively lengthy he seems to think you see an opportunity here to squeeze him out wanted me to know about it over one case last i checked inspectors had a union i couldnt fire him if i wanted to not without cause maybe youd find some glitsky shook his head do you believe that marcel no honestly no i dont he shifted his position but you might want to ask yourself why kathy west is so personally involved here okay so one of her people got killed on the face of that you call in the deputy chief of inspectors to honcho the investigation why unless hes your friend and you want him on it for another reason entirely which would be what i dont know but just letting it air abe she could be wanting to cover something up now glitskys voice rasped and you think id help her no never on purpose but listen to me if youre reporting to her and not to anybody in homicide but thats what im saying im trying to get with cuneo still its mostly you and her not you and him if you get close to something that she needs to be concerned about wait a minute you cant think kathy west is involved in the murders lanier looked at the air between them for a moment then shrugged not in the sense you mean no not really though you and i both know she could be but the real question is could there be some other connection between mr hanover and her honor maybe whoever killed him meant it as some kind of a warning to her maybe theres an issue of say contribution money at glitskys look lanier backed off opened his hands palms out im just throwing out ideas here but the fact remains that she might want you on this for an entirely different reason than what shes telling you and i dont think youre naive enoughhell youre not naive at allto havent considered that lanier was sitting back again with his arms crossed unblinking daring his superior to deny it i dont know if id gotten that far glitsky said after a pause yesterday when it looked like a suicide she wanted me to clear hanovers good name now that it looks like somebodys killed him he stopped let out a breath im just saying from a certain perspective it looks a little squirrelly okay grant that glitsky said but shes the mayor and the police chief as you may know serves at her discretion batiste is already on board with this with me on the case i mean you dont tell her no without some serious risk to your career opportunities after a short silence glitsky went on just tell cuneo i need to talk with him thats all share information between the two of us well take it from there you mind doing that no thats fine id be happy to abe theres nothing personal here between me and you im just the messenger and the message has got some merit i hear you i even agree with you glitsky came off the wall rolled his shoulders took a breath he reached for the doorknob turned it started to walk out lanier stopped him abe glitsky turned a question on his face he pulled the door back to the homicide lieutenant took another few seconds staring at the ceiling while he decided whether or not he was going to say it finally he said one thing you might want to know cuneos call this morning he didnt want it to get out maybe especially not to you but youve got to know he let out a sigh waited some more you want to give me three guesses the scathing tone made lanier talk maybe it wasnt the damiens woman in the house some witnesses may have seen her leaving a little before the fire cuneos thinking that if thats true maybe she was the shooter so who was the woman in the house no clue and wheres damiens nobody knows i know where she is shes in my locker not fifty feet from where were resting our tired old bones abe strout said thats where she is for a damn pure medical certainty and as for her doin the shooting well that would have been highly unusual if not impossible her bein dead an all at the time the medical examiner had his feet up on his desk behind him through the window the barely visible morning freeway traffic was stopped in both directions the fog gave every indication that it was going to be around for lunch strout was opening and closing a switchblade as they talked whos the perpetrator of this outrageous folderol that it wasnt damiens before i tell you that john tell me why its folderol because i called your dr toshio yamashiruwho by the way turns out to be one of the premier forensic odontologists in the state was called in to help identify the victims in new yorkanyway i called him within about two minutes of getting his name from you yesterday and he was good enough to come down here last night with her dental records and compare them to her damiens well they werent marilyn monroes he closed the switchblade same person well wait okay the knife flicked open and closed four times behind strout on the freeway a car inched forward from one pane of his window to the next what are you thinking have you talked to dan cuneo about this case sure he was at the scene glitsky shook his head no since then well strout drawled the word pronouncing it as two syllableswayall then would have been only yesterday morning abe but the answers no i havent seen him since then why a pause nothing just curious strout let a chuckle percolate for a few seconds idle curiosity huh something youre so well known for but he held up a hand still enjoying the moment but seriously you dont have to tell me why it matters if ive seen him maybe its none of my business its not that i havent talked to him either but marcel tells me hes got witnesses who saw her leave the place and go to her car just before the fire damiens maybe she came back obviously she did good point shot him then went to her car and got the gasoline which tends to be obvious if its sitting out in the foyer but glitsky was shaking his head no thats if she killed herself which i think we agree she couldnt have strout chewed on that for a moment so somebody who looks like her maybe he came forward in the folding chair as usual glitsky was in full uniform and leaning over held his hat in his hands between his legs how certain was yamashiru that it was damiens a hundred percent we went over everything for almost an hour anyway he was certain enoughand so am ithat im putting her name to the autopsy glitsky had known strout for thirty years and knew that this was a point of professional pride and honor strout didnt call it as a matter of law unless he was completely convinced he knew he might have to testify under oath on the witness stand and so far as anyone in the city knew he had never made a mistake on an autopsyeither an identification or a cause of death he would not hesitate to decline to state when he wasnt sure but hed never been flat wrong and glitsky didnt think he was now which meant that with a slight detour he was back where hed been before hed talked to marcel lanier this morning or even when hed had his discussion with the mayor yesterday afternoon somebody had shot hanover and damiens and then set their bodies on fire this then was a straightforward murder investigation cuneo was the inspecting officer andorders from the mayor or notglitsky would defer to him as long as it was practicable hardys advice echoedthis might be a good opportunity to mend fences with the man get to some kind of mutual understanding perhaps the beginnings of respect finally making it nearly to his own office glitsky stood frowning at the door which sported a cutout of this mornings chronicle photo it shouldnt have amazed him though it always did how the news agenciesprint audio or filmall so consistently managed to convey misleading information even in a picture of course hed seen the stupid picture first thing in the morning it was impossible to miss he found it odd that he had no memory of the actual moment at all even though he appeared to be standing at formal attention and the salute was so crisp he might have been posing aware that someone had come into the conference room that separated the reception area and his office he turned around melissa wasnt really his private secretarytechnically she was merely the gatekeeper for him and the other deputy chief within the suite jake longoriabut as the highest ranking of the six clerks in the reception bay she took a proprietary even maternal interest in the men whose access she protected now she was smiling broadly at him clearly pleased with the reflected glory that the picture brought to her as well as with glitskys obvious and growing prominence among the citys leaders it wouldnt be unknown for a deputy chief to take his gatekeeper with him should the promotion to chief ever come along either you like it thats a great picture isnt it behind her glitsky saw a couple of the other clerks in the doorway wanting to share in what would be his nodoubt positive reaction feeling that it would be churlish at best and negative for staff morale to follow his impulse and rip the offending thing down he arranged his face into a bland expression and nodded its nice he said feeling a little more might be called for he offered a small stiff bow from the waist my thanks to you all inside the blessed sanctity of his office a lowlevel rage humming in his ears he hung his hat on the rack by the door then went to his desk and pushed the constantly blinking button that indicated he had messages in his voice mail thirteen of them amidst the usual bureaucratic white noise no fewer than six of the calls concerned the picture jeff elliot wanted to know about the story hed clearly missed while theyd been talking yesterday and could they do an interview sometime soon maybe today for a citytalk column his friend and mentor frank batiste left a message tinged with the faint but unmistakable reek of jealousy batiste did not say it overtly but unstated was that if there was going to be a picture typifying the mutual cooperation between the mayors office and the pd maybe the chief ought to have been the one on the front page saluting treya whod slept in later than glitskys own six fortyfive departure and saw the photo after hed already left for work agreed with melissa that it was flattering and kind of cool dismas hardy on the other hand congratulating him with heavy sarcasm on the photo op wondered ifhed noticed that the name badge on his shirt had a typo that read gliktsy looking down immediately cricking his neck in the process he checkedit didnt and oh yeah hardy added if glitsky needed a campaign manager for whatever office he was running for and though somewhat upset that his best friend hadnt included him in his original plans hardy was his man still no callback from cuneo he noticed glitsky resolved to call him at home wake him up if need be after hed gone through his voice mail the last message though much to his surprise was from catherine hanover who had seen the picture and recognized his name from their conversation yesterday having thought about it most of the morning she finally had worked up the nerve to call and wondered if he might get back to her sooner rather than later shed had a visit last night from inspector cuneo and had something a little delicate as she put it that she wanted to discuss he looked at his watch she had placed the call less than fifteen minutes ago he started punching numbers mrs hanover this is deputy chief glitsky an audible sigh then a rush thank you for calling back so soon i didnt know if i could just leave a message for you personally but i she ran out of breath and after a slight hesitation started again in a lower key i didnt know who else to talk to didnt you say youd spoken to inspector cuneo last night yes another pause i just wondered she said if i could arrange to talk to you maybe instead of inspector cuneo i mean if you need if the police need to talk to me anymore about paul or the fire or anything you dont want to talk to inspector cuneo i think id prefer not this was tricky indeed especially in light of glitskys new information that the homicide detailie cuneo was in fact investigating not a murdersuicide but a double homicide this made catherine hanover not just a witness but among the universe of possible suspects to the murders she might not think of herself in those terms but glitsky had already been forced to consider them because of what shed told him yesterdayher powerful financial incentive to see missy damiens out of paul hanovers will or failing that his life many people had been killed for far less money and now mrs hanover didnt want to talk to the investigating officer on the face of it glitsky couldnt even begin and wasnt remotely inclined to consider her request if cuneos questions had rattled or upset her or made her uncomfortable in any one of a number of ways all the bettermaybe hed come upon something relevant to the murders she was trying to hide she was not going to be able to avoid cuneo it was out of the question and he told her as much im sorry he said in conclusion but witnesses dont get to choose who interrogates them all right she said her voice thick with regret i tried then almost as an afterthought added i might have known that youd stick together that who would stick together you the police well in this case yes we do its a general rule for obvious reasons that suspects are rarely anxious to talk to inspecting officers he heard an intake of breath she whispered suspects did you say suspects yes maam so now im a suspect i thought i was a witness her voice went up in pitch and volume i volunteered everything i told inspector cuneo both at the fire and then here at my house how can i how can you think i had anything to do with this i dont think that but you just said i was a suspect his hand tight on the receiver glitsky threw a glance at the ceiling this had gone far beyond where it should have already and now he felt he needed to explain himself and his position always a situation hed rather avoid no he said i said that suspects often didnt want to talk to their inspecting officer but the inference was there that i was one of them glitsky spoke with an exaggerated precision mrs hanover since we have no suspects at all that im aware of everyone is technically a potential suspect that includes you though it doesnt move you to the head of the pack you asked if you could somehow avoid talking again to inspector cuneo and i was telling you why that wasnt allowed some steel now in her tone she pressed him all right then what if i were to make a complaint about him who would i go to for that what would happen then what kind of complaint she hesitated for a minute inappropriateness in what sense what kind of inappropriateness another breath another pause sexual i would say now it was glitskys turn to go quiet the silence hung with import finally treading carefully he said there is an office of management and control in the department that investigates these kind of allegations i could put you through to them right now but this time she jumped in quickly i dont want to go there not yet anyway why not if inspector cuneo assaulted you he didnt assault me its just i mean it was clear he was coming on to me and id just prefer if i didnt have to see him again he makes me uncomfortable im not trying to get anybody in trouble here im willing to talk to anybody else you send out but inspector cuneo makes me nervous thats all im saying did he touch you several times then he squeezed my arm before he left said i could call him at home anytime gave me his number it was definitely inappropriate he was hitting on me but you dont want to lodge a complaint that just seems a little strong for what it was i dont want to overreact i dont really want to get him into trouble he may already be no i really dont want that but look she said intensity now bleeding through the line really i just didnt want to see him thats all you could come out if you need to talk to me or anybody else im not trying to avoid anything with the police and he didnt do anything so blatant that i feel like i need to file a complaint all right but if you dont file a complaint then officially nothing happened glitsky said thatll be the story but nothing really did happen he didnt touch you yes i already said that well thats something its grounds for a complaint he wanted to add that if she wanted to know what hed do if he were in a similar position he would file immediately but he couldnt say that it was completely her decision and couldnt be any of his well maybe but even so ill think about it hardy and glitsky were at the counter of the swan oyster depot on polk street way in the back eating fried oysters and iceberg lettuce salad with louie dressing hardy nursed a beer while glitsky incognito without his hat on and with his old flight jacket covering the uniform stuck with his standard iced tea and of course hardy was saying if you get the message through to him in any official way at all hell either accuse her of lying or you of making it up he sipped his beer it just gets better and better doesnt it ive got to tell him i cant not tell him i thought that was why you needed to see me so urgently so i could advise you how not to do just that but ive got to okay then now maybe we can enjoy this fine lunch if shehanover i meandoesnt file a complaint it didnt happen i thought we were done with the discussion so its really not a department matter if you say so onduty cop hits on pretty witness im assuming shes pretty i havent seen her but it doesnt matter of course not i jest but pretty or not witness gets hit on possible suspect gets hit on that too but whatever she gets hit on maybe even assaulted depending on your definition of the term by an onduty officer youre saying that its not a department matter glitsky chewed ice from his tea im hoping youve already written a memo to file at least reading glitskys face he went on okay and this is your legal adviser talking do that first as soon as you get back to your office then at least youre covered if it gets bigger or god forbid cuneo rapes her or kills her or something he wiped some dressing around the plate with a crust of sourdough its got to get official in some way dont tell cuneo directly take it to batiste man to man hell support you maybe not hes none too pleased with me at this exact momentthe chronicle picture besides which he wont want to be bothered its my problem no your problem is that you think its your problem weve already determined by the process of rigorous debate that this is a police department matter and franks the chief of police so its his problem more than yours hell probably fire cuneo in fact not without a complaint he wont call hanover back convince her to file one good idea except what if shes the killer that would be bad luck i admit more than that and how likely is that anyway that shes the killer i dont have any idea im completely out of the loop on cuneos suspects or anything else for that matter she sang me a long song about money that gives her plenty of motive but it sounded like everybody else in the family knew the same tune and you know a guy like paul hanover always had some deals going on you see the profile on him channel four did last night he had his hands in a dozen pots and not just here in the city or missy nobody knows squat about her either except that she spent a lot of money on the house well there you go what whod she spend the money with i dont know the contractor id guess he put down his tea wrote a note to himself on his memo pad but thats not your worst idea thank you but back to cuneo always back to cuneo well yeah you blame me glitsky considered the question for a long minute no he said at last he chewed more ice i could just finesse it how could you do that i just block his access to her hes on nights right i make it a point to take her statements during the days he doesnt have a reason to see her again maybe he doesnt need one but glitsky shook his head no he wont take it further if he doesnt see her on duty you know this for a fact ive heard rumors its a pattern so hes done this kind of thing before a shrug then a nod and they dont all resent it either the magic of the uniform even if he doesnt wear one marcel told me he had a thing with his shrink after she stopped seeing him professionally youre shitting me would that i were apparently he thinks theres no harm in asking or letting a witness know you think shes hot any of these documented you mean as assault or harassment nope they said yes so hes just a dick pardon the pun at least that the two men took a break to eat glitsky finished first and was chewing ice again when he said im going right to him cop to cop tell him what she said say he might want to be a little discreet be his friend exactly keep him close hardy swallowed his last oyster tipped his beer up ive heard worse plans he said but do yourself a favor first whats that memo to file two oclock and cuneo was blasting away with the beach boys not that dennis wilson was a rock drummer in the league of say charlie watts of the stones or any of the big band guys but he beat the living hell out of his skins and sometimes cuneo just wanted to play loud and hard not good he was letting the cymbals ring at the end of help me rhonda when he heard the knock on his front door hold on barefoot drenched with sweat he was wearing a tank top over a pair of lime green swim trunks because of his location he didnt get a lot of action at his front door so the knock was a little unusual in itself and hed been a cop long enoughthirteen yearsthat he carried the standard load of paranoia around with him wherever he went his gun and shoulder holster hung from the back of one of the chairs in his kitchen and he skipped the three steps over to it and had the weapon in his hand within about two seconds just a sec he said coming but first he parted the gauzy white living room drapes and looked out on the concrete apron that comprised his front yard was a cityissue car with a uniformed driver behind the wheel pulling the curtains further apart he put his eye against the window and saw glitsky standing at ease on his stoop so he set the gun on top of his television set went to the door and opened it glitsky began in an amiable way with a grotesque but perhaps sincere attempt at a smile sorry to bother you inspector but i didnt know if my messages were getting through and we need to get on the same page with this hanover thing its heating up pretty fast you mind no sure good idea cuneo thrown offbalance half turned back to his room i was just doing my workout i havent got to my messages yet i think we must have just missed each other last night i stopped by your office thats all right i was in and out glitsky cast a quick glance over cuneos shoulder im not interrupting anything am i you got company no just me cuneo backed up a bit and said you want to come in we can sit thanks a step into the room glitsky stopped cool place great location he pointed at the drums how long have you been playing a couple of years now it blows off energy i hear you glitsky said i havent had that since i gave up football if you dont include a baby they can wear you out pretty good he scanned the room apparently relaxed one of my boys jacob is a musician a singer actually opera believe it or not cuneo had no reaction to all the chatter but glitsky went on anyway we didnt exactly play a lot of opera around the house when he was growing up so i dont know how he got the taste for it but hes pretty good the downside is he lives in italy and i never get to see him glitsky sat himself on the edge of the love seat he let a silence build then broke it so im guessing youre pissed im involved in this i know i would be cuneo sat down at the drum kit hit the kick drum sure a little but what am i gonna do nobody asked me but its my case nobodys saying it isnt well pardon me sir but thats just bullshit glitsky frowned at the profanity the insubordination although hed invited it to some degree by coming to cuneos home unannounced actually its not as i thought i explained in my message the mayor had a personal connection to hanover she wanted to be in on it and lanier couldnt get it from me then let her know glitsky shrugged she knows me better lucky for you maybe some people might think thats debatable but the point is as far as im concerned youre still the investigating officer and youre what my supervisor i was thinking for this case partner cuneo started a light but quick tattooing on the snare drum caught himself and stopped started again ive had most of my luck working alone he said so have i thinking this was about as far as this topic could take them glitsky decided to break the stalemate and move along to the facts of the case i talked to becker and he told me some of your witnesses thought they saw missy leave the house before the fire the drumming stopped glitsky continued so im assuming first thing this afternoon you were going to put out a net on her obvious right she was the shooter so so have you gotten with strout yet he raised a hand cutting off the reply thats not a criticism in case you havent its a question i was planning on seeing him right after i saw you this afternoon well maybe i can save you a trip i went by the morgue this morning he ran dental records last night it was missy the news finally sparked a show of interest cuneos whole body came forward forearms on his knees his eyes sharp now focused how sure was he glitskys mouth turned up a half inch it was strout meaning that if he said it at all he meant it completely nodding in understanding cuneo asked so she went back inside thats one theory she did him went out to get the gasoline spent a few minutes pouring it around then lit it and did herself except she didnt cuneo cocked his head to one side then remembered thats right she was shot pretty far around in the back of the head wasnt she right physically possible maybe but not likely more likely somebody else did both of them he spread his palms thats where we are cuneo tapped his hands on his thighs so who did my witnesses see that they thought was missy maybe it was her who were your witnesses neighbors so your take is maybe she went someplace and happened to come back in at the wrong time i dont really have a take do you think it was about hanover i dont know the mayor thinks it though she give you any other information nope so she might be someone to talk to nodding glitsky said maybe i intend to ask and then youll tell me what she says thats the plan were working together and that being the case i wanted to pass something along i got a call from catherine hanover this morning the daughterinlaw sure i talked to her twice already she called you she did it seems weve been doubling up on her i talked to her yesterday and then evidently you came by to visit her after wed talked she and i he answered warily right she told me youd called her well glitsky said you wont like this but she said you came on to her cuneos face hardened down in an instant she said what how did i do that you touched her i touched her where did she say arm and shoulder arm and shoulder as if id remember arm and shoulder and that was coming on to her then a different tone is she filing a complaint no she says i came on to her but shes not filing a complaint whats that about that doesnt matter glitsky said did you touch her cuneo paused for a second i really dont remember it would be better if you did one way or the other okay then no i didnt youre sure positive if i did maybe passing by her it was so innocent i didnt even notice so if you did that maybe by mistake youre saying she must have overreacted either that or just flat lied its been known to happen and why would she do that thats what im asking myself especially if shes not filing a complaint his fingers tapped a steady beat on the snare drum ta da dum ta da dum ta da dum maybe i was getting close to something she didnt want to talk about glitsky leaned forward do you remember what that might have been cuneo drummed some more thinking about it nothing specific what did you go to see her about she was a witness who might have remembered something you know how that is okay the fingers stopped the silence this time thicker okay what glitsky hesitated if you werent asking her about anything specific and didnt call on her for a specific reasonsomething she said the night before that bothered you something like thatpeople might wonder why you went to see her in the first place he held up a hand again just an observation if the topic comes up again cuneo threw him a long flat stare so what did you call her about then i called her because i was hoping somebody in the extended family might know who worked on missys teeth and she was the only contact i had i lucked out glitsky kept his voice calm against cuneos clear rage listen im not accusing you of anything if you say you didnt touch her you didnt touch her if you felt you had to talk to her a second time without a specific reason thats good enough for me good cops have good instincts the kick drum went thud glitsky continued after she gave me the dentists name she talked about her family and money things are going to be better for them all after pauls death how much better a lot glitsky offered his opinion that catherines ingenuous and offhand cataloguing of the benefits of pauls death mitigated considering her a suspect so cuneo would probably be well advised to stay away from her if any further direct interrogation of her were necessary glitsky ought to do it cuneo didnt buy the argument but he wasnt going to argue with the deputy chief whose visit here had to be intimidation pure and simple instead he said if its my case how about if i work it and keep you informed we could do that but it might be awkward for me with the mayor she asked me to stay involved im asking you how i can do that and still let you do your job i just told you how about if i work it and let you know what i get glitsky put his notepad down ill ask you one more time either you tell me how you want to do this or ill tell you how we will do it is that about clear enough after a minute cuneo nodded all right he got out his own notepad flipped a few pages you said the mayor might know something shes not telling you ask her what she really knows about hanover all right then you might see if you run across anything about missy while youre at it you think she might have been the primary target shes just as dead as hanover and catherine said the two of them had been fighting about the remodel catherine said cuneo interrupted catherine catherine catherine yeah i know i didnt touch her i never said you did a stretch of silence then glitsky pulled a page of newspaper from inside his notebook unfolded it and handed it across to cuneo thats paul and missy three months ago at a party its the only picture of her i could find which i thought was a little weird since pauls picture was in the paper every couple of weeks the chrons even got a head shot of him on file but nothing on her except this she didnt like to have her picture taken apparently not why not no idea cuneo finally looked at the photograph somebody looks like her youd think shed love to get photographed he stared another second emitted a low whistle definite trophy material still he kept his eyes on the picture you see something glitsky asked almost as though startled out of a reverie he said no nothing just a hell of a waste cuneo left his house about a half hour after glitsky had gone and this put him in the city at around long before his shift was scheduled to begin but he figured he wasnt going to be on the clock for a while anyway not if he wanted to break this case before glitsky could claim any credit for it the arson unit had for years worked out of one of the station houses close to downtown but that station didnt have toilets and changing areas for female firefighters so to make room for these improvements the arson unit had been transferred to its present location in a barricaded storage warehouse on evans street in the lessthancentrallylocated ganginfested bayview district far far south of market inside the cavernous main room downstairs they kept the arson van as well as spare engines and trucks and miles of hoses and other equipment there was also the odd historical goody such as an engine that had been used in the earthquake and fire with an eighthundredpound fivestory ladder it had taken twenty men to lift becker sat upstairs at a small conference table in a common room outside of his small office when cuneo entered he was turning the oversize pages of some computer printout looking up and without preamble he said valero gasoline what about it thats the accelerant he tapped the pages in front of him we had a goodenough sample from the rug under her we ran a mass spectrometer on it valero cuneo drew up a chair theyre different i thought all gas was the same not exactly he put a finger on the paper this was valeros formulation so what does that tell us unfortunately not a whole hell of a lot valeros the biggest gas producer in the country howeverthe good newsits nowhere near the market leader here in the city and theres a valero station not three blocks from alamo square not that our man necessarily bought the gas there but somebody bought almost exactly two gallons on wednesday morning the sales get automatically recorded and we checked did anybody notice who bought it nobodys asked yet cuneo clucked ill go by ive got a picture of missy maybe itll spark something he pulled out his notepad unfolded the picture and passed it across can you say babe becker stared at it for a long moment this is missy she looks a little familiar you know i thought that too you heard it was her by the way didnt you yeah i called strout keeping up cuneo drummed on his chair for a few seconds staring into the air between them suddenly he snapped his fingers thats it i knew there was something else you just said something about our man when you were telling me about the gas you got anything that narrows it down to a guy no becker said ive just always assumed it was a guy i told this to glitsky and what did he say nothing really he just took it in why is something pointing you toward a woman maybe cuneo said ill let you know glitsky figured that if he didnt want to ask the mayor directly and he didnt then his best source of information on her perhapshidden connection to paul hanover was likely to be found in the basement of the chronicle building at fifth and mission despite the receptionist calling jeff elliot to tell him glitsky was upstairs wanting to see him when glitsky got buzzed down and got to jeffs small glassenclosed cubicle the reportercolumnist was in his wheelchair at his desk typing up a storm at his computer terminal apparently lost to the world until he suddenly stopped typing and looked over this is my pulitzer he said you mind waiting for two more graphs he motioned to a chair just inside the cubicle glitsky nodded and took the seat the office was small and cluttered it sported an old metal desk that held elliots computer and a telephone a waisthigh oak bookshelf crammed to overflowing and another metal shelf contraption stacked with about a years worth of newspapers and against which leaned a set of crutches a bunch of new yorker and other cartoons were taped on the glass wall by glitskys head next to the phone on the desk was a picture of his wife with their daughters elliot stopped typing and stared at his screen then raised his right hand over the keyboard and brought it down with a triumphant flourish the screen cleared he turned his head toward glitsky sorry about that but its brilliant youll see tomorrow so to what do i owe the personal appearance you said you wanted to talk to me remember about the picture of me and the mayor the scoop i was hiding from you i was giving you grief i think now youre telling me there was one if there was i thought maybe between us we might find it elliot pushed his wheelchair back from the desk and around to face him youre losing me i dont mean to what do you know about paul hanover other than the fact that hes dead this is going to have to do with the mayor it might and were off the record okay itll be worth it in the long run elliot nodded with some reluctance all right what do you have i dont know if its anything but you remember yesterday at the ferry building when i told you i had business with kathy the business was that she had asked me to get involved personally with hanover why would she want you to do that thats unclear maybe she thinks weve got a relationship so youll control what gets out i dont want to think she thinks that but you suspect it maybe thats putting it too strongly i know nothing about hanover other than the fact that he gave her campaign money i thought you might have heard a little more elliot took his hands off the armrests of his wheelchair and linked them on his lap his eyes went to the cartoons on the partition by glitskys head but he wasnt looking at them finally he drew a breath and let it out first he said he didnt just give her some money he threw the fundraising dinner that kicked off her campaign last summer where they raised i think it was about six hundred grand you might have read about that since the story appeared in the general newspaper and not my column he grinned at his little joke but hanover i guess youd say was catholic in his political contributions kathy of course is a dem but he was also the republican goto guy when did we start allowing republicans in san francisco youd be surprised last time the president came out here to raise some money guess who hosted the party so what were his politics hanovers he didnt have politics so much per se he had clients but wait a minute jeff went back to his terminal hit a few keys then sat back in satisfaction there you go when memory fails glitsky came forward in his chair whatd you get donnell white a midthirties black man with an upbeat demeanor managed the valero station on oak and webster he wasnt the owner but he worked afternoons six days a week he took one look at cuneos picture of missy damiens and nodded yeah she in here all the time every week or two she must live nearby not anymore cuneo told him the news then went on but the question is whether you saw her come in on wednesday and fill up a portable gas container not if she come in the morning he looked down again at the picture scratched his short stubble but hold on a sec they were standing out in front by the gas islands and now he turned and yelled back into the garage area where some rap music emanated jeffie come on out here will you when there was no response white disappeared back into the station after a few seconds the music stopped and white and jeffie emerged back into the lateafternoon sun jeffie was young as sullen as white was effusive apparently bored to death his eyes rolled upward as he slouched with his hands in his pockets listening to why the cop was here finally they got to the picture and he nodded yeah he said could have been her something about the phrase struck cuneo what do you mean could have been it either was or it wasnt he shrugged hey some woman get some gas he looked to his coworker who you said you lookin for cuneo jumped in it might not have been this woman he shrugged im eating lunch inside she fills the thing and not her car put it in the trunk she put the portable container in her trunk he fixed cuneo with a flat stare whatd i just say man yeah she put the container in her trunk what kind of car was it again the eye roll maybe a mercedes i dont know coulda been something like that cuneo held the photograph out again and would you say it was this woman or not jeffie looked more carefully this time took it in his hands and brought it closer to his face i seen her this woman before i think he kept looking mighta been her but if it was she had her hair different but i dont really know cept she was white and finelookin big jugs no fat nice butt you remember what she was wearing the young mechanic cast his eyes to the sky again then closed them maybe a blue shirt kind of shiny oh yeah and sunglasses she never took the shades off he pointed at the picture again it could have been her now i look at it its hard to say but maybe not this time cocktail hour friday night maxine and joseph willis were both home at their place a few houses down from where paul hanovers used to be they were drinking manhattans in stem glasses and going out to meet some friends for dinner in a while but cuneo didnt pick up any sense that they resented his visit they invited him in offered him a drink which he declined and then maxine explained to joseph again about what shed told cuneo the night before as she talked the three of them drifted back over to the space by the front window im here about the same thing again im afraid cuneo took out the picture and handed it across to her we want to be sure that missy damiens was who you saw i wondered if youd mind looking at this maxine put her drink on a side table then took the newspaper cutout looking out the window for a secondrevisiting the momentshe came back to the picture and nodded her head one time briskly yep she said thats her all right joseph maybe fortyfive years old was physically much smaller than his wife short and very thin he probably didnt weigh pounds his shoulders barely seemed sufficient to hold up his head what hair he had and it wasnt much he wore in a buzz he was wearing rimless eyeglasses a red bow tie over a starched white shirt red paisleyprint suspenders and brown tweed pants but in a quiet way he managed to project a sense of confidence and inner strength he placed his drink carefully next to his wifes then peered at the picture over maxines arm and shook his head speaking with absolute certainty thats missy damiens certainly but i cant swear she was the woman we saw the other night maxine frowned deeply looking over and down at him what are you saying joseph that sure was who she was joseph put a hand lightly on her arm could i please see the picture myself he was the soul of mildness holding out his other hand when she gave it to him he crossed over to the window and stood where the light was better studying it for the better part of a minute finally he raised his eyes looked directly at cuneo and shook his head im not sure cuneo emitted a long low singlenote deep in his throat maxine crossed over to joseph and pulled the picture from his hand holding it up close to her face while she was looking cuneo asked joseph where was her car again exactly pointing out the window he indicated the same place that maxine had shown cuneo the night before just across the street over there five or six cars down by the light post and what kind of car was it do you remember im not sure dark certainly black it was a black mercedes maxine said ctype joseph turned to her placed his hand on her arm again and said it might have been that after all i didnt pay too much attention you werent looking at the car were you he gave his wife a tolerant smile perhaps that too back to cuneo in any event she went to the car and we all went back to our drinks speaking of which he picked up both drinks and gave his wife hers did you see her do anything at the car cuneo asked joseph silently consulted with his wife then shook his head no she just went to the door not the trunk not that i saw maxine no she just got in and drove off cuneos low hum had developed a melody but the song remained unidentifiable lets get back for a minute if you dont mind to whether or not it was missy damiens mrs willis you say it was i thought it was but do you remember last night when we talked you said you thought you might have been mistaken do you remember that she didnt like the question and straightened up to her full height that was when i heard that shed died in the house right so you reasoned that she must not have left so maybe it was someone else out on the street here or she left and came back later sure which is what she must have done if she was in the house when it burned but your husband now says hes not sure it was her at all the husband spoke up it might have been but there was something he moved back a couple of steps so he was standing in the jutting alcove of the front bay window i saw her as she came out of hanovers place and i remember first thinking oh theres missy but then something about her walk her shake more like maxine said he shrugged i dont know what it was exactly but something made me form the impression that it wasnt missy you knew her then missy cuneo asked wed spoken on the street a few times were neighbors after all i cant say we had a real relationship of any kind but i knew who she was okay so youre standing here and she comes out of hanovers joseph sipped at his cocktail broke a small smile i must have kept looking a bit too long out of the corner of my eye only the corner joseph well he touched her arm gently and continued in any event my dear bride must have seen me looking at something because she turned to see what it was but cuneo wanted it crystal clear by this time the woman from hanovers had come down as far as this window isnt that when you told me you first saw her maxine a nod she was right there okay do either of you remember what she was wearing blue joseph said black maxine turned on her husband a jacket leather now come on joseph i know what i saw and i saw that joseph explained the apparent contradiction from the side you saw only the jacket when she first came out the jacket was open and she was wearing a bright blue blouse shiny it caught the sun skirt or pants they looked at each other pants they agreed so pants a blue shirt a leather jacket driving a black mercedes that sounds about right joseph said it sounded about right to cuneo too but he wasnt thinking it sounded like missy damiens glitsky in shirtsleeves came out of dismas hardys back door and stopped on the top step that led down to the backyard he had just left treya and frannie and his baby in the kitchen he looked up at cerulean blue the sun hadnt yet set behind him and the shade the house threw carried all the way across hardys deep narrow back lawn and halfway up the fence to about the height where frannie had trimmed the riot of blooming roseswhite red yellow purple flame hardys home stood on the top of a small rise and from his vantage glitsky could look over the sunsplashed roofs of the richmond district all the way to downtown four miles east the top of the transamerica pyramid peeked somewhat ludicrously above the rust red dome of the synagogue on arguello slightly to his right he could just make out the shining whiteness of st ignatius church on the usf campus here and there a window would reflect the sinking suns light and cast it back little diamonds sprinkled across the panorama there was no sign of fog only the barest of breezes and the evening was completely without chill just up against the house below him hardy the purist was arranging charcoal over newspaper in a chimneyfluelighting device glitsky watched him counting out some nodoubt mystical exact number of briquettes when hardy held a match to the paper underneath the smoke started to rise up toward where glitsky sat youre safe hardy said smoke follows beauty with a grunt glitsky took that as his cue to move you know he said coming down the stairs you can buy a propane barbecue for about a hundred bucks turn on the gas press a button you get heat it got invented a few years ago you might not have heard hardy drank from his beer bottle the starters always break they dont work and that chimney thing does you wait thats my point what if i dont want to wait or get smoked out then you dont elect to barbecue which my friend presupposes a lack of hurry and you might have noticed some likelihood of smoke when things cook especially over a fire they often smoke you could look it up besides i dont like the idea of a bomb in my backyard a bomb those propane tanks one of em blows up it can level a building and this happens a lot in your experience hardy sipped his beer and shrugged only takes once im not going to change your mind am i on propane or anything else but you so enjoy trying and i think you did once on something change my mind i mean i know it wasnt getting me to try spam i would never do that i know i got you to wear better shoes when we walked the beat see there you go even if that was twenty years ago it was thirty years ago thirty hardy said dont say thirty it couldnt have been thirty that would mean im old now you are way old glitsky walked over to the grill put his hand flat over the chimney starter and this isnt hot yet youre not supposed to monitor it by the second it gets hot eventually so does pavement on a sunny day but people generally dont try to cook on it heres another one another what time i got you to change your mind i got you to apply back to the das office after god knows how many years of wandering in the desert only about a decade and it wasnt the desert it was the shamrock this was the bar that hardy owned a quarter of jews like yourself wander in the desert good irish stock like me achieve spiritual peace in a wetter environment guinness comes to mind the occasional black and tan if you recall i probably remember better than you do but the fact remains the reason youre back practicing law and getting rich is because i changed your mind lo these many years ago hardy raised his beer bottle for which i salute you glitsky pulled a chair around to sit at the patio table hardy tinkered with the chimney thing lifting it up blowing into the bottom of it putting it back on its grill now he too sat down thank god for a warm night he said glitsky didnt respond right away when he did he said do you ever wish you could just stop stop what everything change new and exciting experiences whatever comes next then youre dead hardy said glitsky shook his head im not talking forever but if youre stopped theres no time so it is forever lets pretend it isnt okay but you know those books i love patrick obrian master and commander the movie those books what about them they make a toast all the time in them may nothing new happen thats how im feeling that it would be nice to just stop for a while when things are good hardy threw his friend a sideways glance over the table this wasnt a typical glitsky conversation they are good he said knock on wood may they stay that way he rapped his knuckles on the table lowered his voice you thinking about cuneo glitsky was tracing the grain in the patio tables surface a little a little bit but all the time glitsky nodded pretty much me too waiting for the other shoe to drop that too but maybe it wont hardy looked over at his friend you all right right now this minute yeah but things are going to change because they always do with cuneo you mean him yeah but other stuff too he indicated the house the pregnancy i thought everything was good with that it is glitsky let out a heavy breath i keep telling myself he said that you can acknowledge a happy moment once in a while and it doesnt necessarily curse you for eternity when things are good the only way they can go from there is bad maybe the other option is maybe they could get better not too often well of course your evercheerful self would say that but it could happen sometimes it does he twirled his beer bottle on the table i wasnt particularly gungho when frannie and i were deciding whether we were going to try to get pregnant with vincent i figured wed already hit the jackpot with the beck we got a healthy little girl we win we should count our blessings and just stop there but then we got vinnie and hes been icing on the cake maybe its that glitsky said the second kid thing maybe it wont be all right the baby why wouldnt it be rachels fine your other kids have been fine you and treya have good genes whats the problem nothing except that as you say my kids have always been fine so youre pushing your luck a nod theres that element and a miserable guy like you doesnt deserve a happy life some of that too why not i dont know guilt i suppose over what glitsky paused maybe what we did hardy took a beat then whispered we had no choice we never had a choice they would have killed us i know thats the truth abe i know he repeated i know so whats to be guilty about nothing youre right maybe its just general guilt original sin maybe we dont get to be happy i mean the human condition isnt one of happiness except when it is which is why glitsky said right now tonight everything could just stay the way it is and it would be fine with me you realize youre dangerously close to admitting that youre happy right now marginally i suppose i am comparatively whoa rein it in abe hardy said all that enthusiasm might give you a hernia what i cant believe glitsky was saying to his dinner mates at the table an hour later is that hanover was such a player and so few people knew probably what made him good at it hardy said i mean who follows the ins and outs of the citys contract for its towing business fascinating though im sure it must be frannie put down her fork you dont really think somebody might have killed him over that do you the citys towing business abe said is worth fifty million dollars ten mil a year for five years i might kill diz here for half that hardy nodded acknowledging the compliment but then whos the suspect he asked the men were at the opposite ends of the table the women on the sides theyd finished their halibut steaks and green beans and nobody seemed inclined to start cleaning up at the mention of the concept of a possible murder suspect glitsky couldnt help himselfhe came forward with a real show of excitement thats where it gets interesting towholds had the contract now for twenty years anybody want to guess how many complaints its gotten in the past two years alone and im not talking complaints like people upset that they got towed im talking criminal complaints stealing money and cds and radios and stuff out of the vehicles selling parts losing the car itself how many how many cars does it tow hardy asked about eighty thousand a year this made frannie come alive no that cant be right in the city alone glitsky nodded thats per year its a big number wait a minute hardy said he drummed the table eyes closed for a minute thats fifteen hundred or so a week i guess its doable two hundred a day a little more glitsky loved the details okay so back to how many criminal complaints has the city received one a day treya said more a hundred and six frannie asked ifyoure going to be silly glitsky spread his palms try three and a half average every single day and these are the people hardy said that the city in its wisdom has awarded its towing contract to for how long a mere twenty years glitsky said at remember ten mil a year not including what they steal i presume treya said right not including that treya stiffened her back turned to her husband does clarence know those figures glitsky shook his head the da generally doesnt get involved maybe with some individual complaints but not the whole picture why not frannie asked i mean somebody official must know about this stuff you found it out in one day abe thats only because i happened to be looking for anything on hanover and he turned up in this article which said what hardy asked well ironically enough it wasnt even about him not mostly it was about towhold the chronicle did an investigation last year although the story was kind of buried in the back of the metro section the way they wrote it it came out like towhold had hired a few bad eggs that was all they were all fired long ago it wasnt anything systemic in the way they did business it certainly wasnt the leadership of the company no treya said with heavy irony it couldnt have been that so what happened frannie asked i mean where is hanover involved glitsky paused and sipped some water relishing the moment it seems that towhold has ties to our recently departed exmayor mr washington why did i see this coming hardy asked because youre an astute judge of how this city works it turns out that washington started to feel some heat around these complaints so when the last contract expired he didnt automatically extend it as he had the last time it had come due without putting it up for bid hardy asked right its sole source we do lots of them here towhold hasnt bid on the job for fifteen years through four administrations imagine that frannie said they must have just been doing a terrific job only modestly terrific as weve seen glitsky said but not so terrific that washington didnt put them on notice so what did he do treya asked went monthtomonth which really straightened em out as evidenced by the complaints those numbers we were talking about they were after they cleaned up their act hardy put his wineglass down so why didnt washington just fire them glitsky actually smiled ahh now were getting to it he didnt fire them because his campaign manager we all know nils granat do we notwell mr granats day job is hes a lobbyist and towhold just happened to be one of his biggest clients how big treya asked a quarter million a year retainer ever since they went monthtomonth hardy whistled i need more clients like that so granat treya said basically made excuses for towhold to the mayor glitsky nodded that would be the kindest interpretation the cynical among us think granat just funneled some of his fees through to washington somehow there are rumors of actual briefcases of cash youre shocking me hardy said graft out of city hall but frannie said to glitsky did i miss where hanover came in glitsky reached out and touched her hand gently your patience shall be rewarded my dear here he comes hanovers day job it turns out was pretty much like granats though maybe on a bigger scale nationally he wasnt kathy wests campaign manager but between money and contacts he helped her campaign in a big way he represents another tow company hardy said excellent diz glitsky sat back and spread his arms out ladies and gentlemen may i present bayshore autotow which until last wednesday was a client of paul hanovers a small silence ensued which frannie broke by asking and you really think this had something to do with his murder glitsky shook his head i dont know if i actually think it yet but its definitely the kind of connection id more or less expected and hoped to find so now that hanovers gone hardy asked what happens with bayshore thats the question glitsky said parking and trafficthe citys department that controlled the towing contracthas already recommended them to replace towhold but first its got to be approvedthe meetings in ten daysby something called the municipal transportation agency which has seven members four of whom are reportedly in the pocket of guess who glitsky turned to his wife in expectation she didnt let him down kathy west frannie said so kathy controls the appointment of the contract glitsky nodded all around and it goes to bayshore except of course if the murder of bayshores lobbyist makes her decide to rethink her priorities it would explain her personal interest hardy said and going outside of channels wouldnt it that thought glitsky said did occur to me paul hanovers first wife theresa was a dominating and still very handsome woman of seventyfour years good cheekbones and a facelift kept the lines from her face and her confident carriage and stylish clothes made her appear more like a sister than the mother of her three adult children in the room she had taken pride of place in the large and comfortable reading chair with ottoman by the picture window as she looked around her family gathered in her sons nowcrowded living room will finally back from his fishing trip sat noticeably apart from catherine over by the fireplace while his wife kept flitting in and out of the kitchen as she did to avoid motherinlaw interaction theresa always felt supplying drinks coffee and dessert carlos and mary rodman sat together holding hands on the couch beth and aaron jacobs took the folding chairs that catherine had set up next to one another just to theresas right and she could hear them discussing their eldest daughter sophies schoolwork as usual theresa thought they should have called this family meeting at her daughter marys home which was much larger at least there they could have all eaten at the same table instead of catchascatchcan wherever there was a flat surfacekitchen counter breakfast nook dining room tableanywhere big enough to accommodate a chair and a dinner plate theresa almost wound up in the living room with a tv tray and would have if beth hadnt noticed and given up her own place in the dining room still the catered though selfserve dinner in the smallish house had been agreeable enough considering that catherine had organized it it was better than most of her other efforts with the family now the older kids had vanished on their friday night out while the younger ones had been banished upstairs with a video catherine brought out a piece of cherry pie and gave it to carlos then sat in the chair shed pulled around to the kitchen entrance apart from all of them as always gradually the hum of conversation died away and theresa cleared her throat a signal that she was going to take the floor i didnt think it would be like this she said i never wanted anything like this to happen next to her beth reached out and took her hand we know you didnt mom nobody thinks anything like that still i think its important that i say it its no secret i had some bitter words with your father about she exhaled heavily about his responsibilities to all of his grandchildren you all know how he felt will had come forward in his chair elbows on his knees he didnt think he owed them anything mom or us either hed made it on his own and we should all do the same thats just who he was and how he thought okay mary rodman said the youngest of paul and theresas three children she had been crying off and on since shed learned of her fathers death her eyes were red and swollen but giving it all to her we dont know for sure that he was going to do that will said yes we do catherine snapped at him he told me explicitly when i went there hold it hold it hold it aaron an attorney in jacket and tie put his hands out in front of him that whole question is moot now shes dead the question is what he did with his will catherine when you talked to him wednesday did he tell you hed already changed it no but hed made the decision he was coy about whether hed already done it theresa asked but he didnt say he hadnt done it either did he he said he had scheduled a meeting with his partnerwhats his name bob townshend her husband said right bob they had an appointment for next week to talk over some of the issues he said he just kept saying that the main thing was that he was going to marry her he loved her she loved him a chorus of muttered negative reaction stopped her when it died down she went on whether or not we believed any of it of what they had together he told me we werent going to talk him out of it or into some kind of prenup either and when he married her she would become his heir shed had a very hard life and he was going to make it up to her we buzzards could stop circling thats really all he said this brought more tears to marys eyes did he really say that she looked around at her family but he was our dad you guys it wasnt all about his money theresa wasnt having that your children my grandchildren deserve that money more than missy did mary even if you didnt care about it she threw her imperious gaze around the room daring anyone to contradict her all of your children my grandchildren she repeated absolutely deserve the benefit of his wealth for college or medical care if any of them get really sick or housing if they need a down payment on their first home whos going to be able to help them into the small silence beth said so we still dont know not until we see the will we dont will said in the meantime theresa said i think for my grandchildrens sake that its critical absolutely critical that we consider possible scenarios and come to unanimous agreement about our response to each of them well aaron the lawyer spoke up its pretty straightforward theresa really if paul didnt change his will yet in favor of missy then the last we heard the estate goes in equal thirds to the three kids anybody have an estimate of what ballpark were talking about catherine hanover spoke up fourteen million dollars beth snorted is that before or after the renovation thats as of wednesday so after carlos sat forward on the couch looked across to catherine it sounds like you two had a pretty substantive talk catherine gave him a flat look i was motivated she said then turned quickly to her other brotherinlaw you were outlining options aaron first was thirds to the three kids if nothing had changed but what if hed already rewritten it in favor of missy well then we dont know for sure until we see it but id say the most likely scenario is that hed just move her up in front of the kids his kids not the grandkids in which case the secondary beneficiaries would be will beth and mary anyway and everything would go back to being the same as it was before he met missy thats assuming they died at the same time paul and missy but what if he died first mary asked aaron shook his head that wont be an issue even if the coroner concludes that one of them killed the other which i gather theyve ruled out but mary wasnt convinced how can you know it wont be a problem aaron what if just hypothetically she lived after he did even for a minute then wouldnt her heirs inherit no because paul never would have left his will vague on that point any good estate lawyerand fourteen mil buys good help trust mecovers it usually its ninety days what is his wife asked aaron sighed the amount of time a beneficiary missyneeds to survive after paul before her heirs get the inheritance who are they anyway will asked her heirs everybody looked at each other and then aaron said i dont think anybody knows but i promise it wont be an issue if theres a ruling that she died after him theresa put in well find out who they are soon enough believe me cousins and uncles and siblings she didnt even know she had well maybe aaron said but the greater possible concern for us i think and what we should be prepared to litigate if necessary is if he changed the will in favor of missy theresa turned on him angrily must you keep using her nickname aaron he shrugged its nothing personal theresa it makes it clearer for everyone but if he changed the will in her favor then its likely he changed the rest of it too maybe in favor of some charity or to the kids and i mean our kids your grandkids theresa thats what we ought to be prepared for that would be fine with me theresa said thats who im in this for were all in it for them too mom will said with some asperity well he didnt mention any of those other possibilities to me aaron catherine sat rigidly in her chair he told me it was going to missy thats what he wanted it really wasnt any of the familys business thats so ridiculous and just so like him theresa said easy mom okay will said well she shot back you tell me how could it be any more the familys business we were certainly all well enough aware that it was before well before this week okay will said but its still dad im sure it was mostly her beth said not him she had him so fooled i cant believe he intended to cut us out completely you can believe anything you want beth catherine said but the fact of the matter is that once the marriage happened the whole financial picture was going to be different and we all know what that was going to mean in practice even if they hadnt died but they didnt just die mary said somebody killed them well theresa said of course im sorry about your father but all i can say about missy is good riddance mom mary exploded god what theresa said if youre honest i know youre all saying the same thing inside yourselves thank heaven that woman is out of the picture the matriarch threw her gaze around the room daring anyone to disagree with her ive heard all of us say one time or another that we wished she would either go away or just die catherine spoke up if we did of course we were joking theresa what do you think no obviously i was just making the point that we knew what a danger that woman was to all of us well shes not now aaron said and at that truth the family went silent will was fortyfive years old with an athletic frame and a conventionally handsome face that had not yet gone to slack or jowl still wearing his dockers and shortsleeved tommy bahama shirt he was sitting on the bed as his wife came into the room carrying a load of folded laundry hey he said hey she answered with an uninflected mechanical precision how are you doing im doing fine will how are you doing good she stood still for a moment looking at him then she exhaled and went over to the dresser put the pile of laundry on the chair next to it and opened the top drawer she wasnt facing him so she said no fish none no keepers anyway isnt that weird were out two hundred miles feels like halfway to the galapagos and there are no fish ive never been completely skunked before on one of these trips how many of you were there on the boat just three of us plus the captain and crew nice guys okay i guess he said the usual good ol boys tim and tom easy to remember what does that mean nothing never mind she closed the top drawer opened the next one down i wish youd have called though not being able to reach you was terrifically frustrating im sorry about that next time ill remember he pushed himself back against the headboard what was that motivation you talked about tonight when when aaron asked why youd gone to see dad that day she stopped moving let out a long breath still facing away from him slowly she turned full around holding one of his folded tshirts finally she shook her head slightly from side to side i guess i just got tired of not knowing where we were going to stand saul starts college in a little over a year and hes the first of the grandkids id talked to beth and mary and both had asked if id heard anything from your dad what with sophie and pablo right behind saul so i just thought id go get it from the horses mouth she was wringing the tshirt between her hands then as you heard we got on to other things missy among others did you have words some nothing worse than usual we just talked maybe argued a little but it was all his decision and there was really nothing to fight about besides your father as opposed to your mother likes me or should i say liked will shrugged he liked attractive women so does his son he patted the bed next to him speaking of which youre looking good tonight especially to a man whos just spent five days at sea are you planning on coming to bed eventually she said i usually do ive missed you he said biting her lip nodding to herself she turned back to the dresser dropped the crumpled tshirt into the open drawer clearing her throat she said let me go check on the kids then left the room the assistant district attorney who handled arson cases was chris rosen hed been a prosecutor for nine years now after first serving a year fresh out of law school as a clerk for superior court judge leo chomorro so hed lived his entire legal life in the hall of justice at seventh and bryant rosen thrived in the environment an oldfashioned hardoncrime professional prosecutor he didnt believe that hed ever seen an innocent person in custody you dont get all the way to arrestedand believe me that is a long long way unless you did it he liked to say thats the truth it always has been and always will be nothing but the truth so help me god unmarried and slightly unkempt with an easygoing personal style he often grew a day or twos stubble when he wasnt due in court his dark hair licked at the top of his collar the conscious image he projected was borderline blue collar a guy with no special passion for prosecuting his fellow citizens he was just a regular working dog going about his business doing his job nobody to worry about attorneys who hadnt already faced him in court found out the truth soon enough and often found themselves on the defensive from the getgo blindsided by his cold passion no law says you cant come across out of court as sympathetic you know a little sensitive he was saying over midnight drinks to dan cuneo as they sat at the bar at lou the greeks then you get em in court suddenly im the iceman and whop em upside the head they dont know what hit em rosens experience had taught him that he needed every advantage he could get in san francisco where juries tended to see their main role as finding some reason almost any reasonstress hardship bad luck unfortunate upbringingto let defendants off there always lurked some mitigating factor some reason for juries to forgive hey but enough about me rosen sipped at his single malt it wasnt anywhere near his working hours on a friday night he was out here now with his oban on the rocks as a favor to his mainman arson inspector arnie becker and also because the recent doublehomicide fire was going to be the biggest case hed tried to date becker says you got a lead on hanover cuneo on duty drank cherry coke no ice you know the basics not much beyond hanover and his girlfriend all right cuneo tapped his fingers on the bar there was this couple maxine and joseph willis drinking more cherry coke fidgeting in his chair continuing his percussion on the bar top cuneo laid out for rosen the originally conflicting stories of the willises how maxine had seen missy damiens leave the hanover house within minutes of when the fire must have started how joseph had been uncertainit might have been somebody else then there was jeffie at the valero station who volunteered that someone who looked something like her but had different hair had bought gasoline in a container and put it into her trunk im still listening rosen said so youve got a woman who resembled this missy well wait more than that ive got a true fox middleaged which one rosen asked a fox or middleaged both at rosens skeptical look cuneo said it happens youd seen her youd believe it anyway shes in jeans and a shiny blue shirt black leather jacket driving a mercedes buying a container of gasoline and then coming out of hanovers house a few minutes before it goes up if its all the same woman right of course it was which means which means what if she had a motive cuneo waited but rosen didnt bite which she did so youre telling me youve got a suspect not quite yet im close light on physical evidence but loaded with probable cause you want a warrant rosen said yep yep yep cuneo bobbed his head tattooed the bar with a final paradiddle becker says youre tight with some judges rosen shrugged the question is can we make the case i dont want to bring anybody in front of a grand jury and have nothing to talk about he cast his eyes around i need a narrative if i buy it i can sell it to whoevers signing warrants cuneo willed himself still met rosens eye grand jurys tuesday right every week youre thinking that soon i can do the search tomorrow if we can get a warrant now well know by sunday is that enough time for you rosen swirled the last of his scotch and drank it off plenty he said glitsky used police magic to find the address he wanted now just before ten oclock on saturday morning he was walking up russian hill in bright sunshine to the door of an enormous threestory brown box of a building on the corner of green and larkin he stood in the covered entryway for a minute trying to imagine what a place this big in this neighborhood would cost decided it didnt bear reflection from his perspective it was all the money in the world he rang the doorbell and listened as chimes sounded behind the double doorsetched glass in carved dark wood after a long silent moment a short female figure appeared behind the glass and opened the door in a black uniform with a white apron she smiled formally and seeing that glitsky was a man of color in casual clothes said deliveries are in the back producing his wallet glitsky displayed his badge im deputy chief of inspectors abe glitsky i wonder if i might have a word with mr granat do you have an appointment no maam i was hoping to catch him in is this then official police business id just like to talk to him if he can spare a minute certainly she said ill see if hes available she turned had a thought and turned again would you care to wait inside glitsky crossed the threshold into the house and watched the maid walk down the long hallway and then somewhere off to her left shed left him standing on a burgundy oriental carpet that was larger than glitskys living room yet still did not quite reach the walls around the grand foyer even with the sunshine outside and the windows behind him even with the sixfoot chandelier and its fifty bulbs lit above him the space was dim no sound came from the rest of the house and only gradually did glitsky become aware of the ticking of a clock although he couldnt locate its source his eyes went to the artdark oils in large burnished gilt frameshung in the spaces between doorways they were franklyhe thought purposefullydisturbing all blacks and reds flesh and blooded browns erotic overtones sexually ambiguoushints of nakedness amid industrial waste a pack of dogs gathered over something not quite identifiable in a graffitied doorway you like my paintings surprisedwhere had the man come fromglitsky whirled and found out a door on the left wall stood open blessedly light and even inviting i cant really say they speak to me yes i do suppose its an acquired taste the tension of whether something terrible has just happened or whether its about to glitsky shook his head i get enough of that in my job yes of course i suppose you do he extended his hand revealing a mouthful of perfect teeth under a crisp gray mustache he was about glitskys size a bit thinner his hair was thick silver even here in his home on the weekend he was well turned outblack merino sweater tan slacks expensivelooking loafers a handsome confident man nils granat he said gripping glitskys hand hard meeting his eyes weve met before havent we yes sir a couple of times at city hall i wasnt sure youd remember granat turned his mouth up slightly touched his forehead i remember people its almost what i do best so what can i do for you chief is chief all right fine you want to sit in the library he jerked a finger behind him right here without waiting for glitsky to respond he was already through the door and into the large airy pleasant adjoining room that foyer is a little gloomy isnt it he said over his shoulder i should probably leave the side doors open brighten it up but then i wasnt expecting anybody especially this early on a weekend morning he turned confident that glitsky would be there and when he was motioned him to the red leather couch granat himself pulled an empire chair around and sat on it crossing one leg over the other so how can i help you he asked if he had any sense that this nowarning earlymorning visit by a highranking policeman meant that he was in trouble he showed no sign of it glitsky came forward to the front edge of the couch and came right to the point im investigating the murder of paul hanover god wasnt that a tragedy yes sir but it was more than that somebody killed him granat nodded thats what theyre saying you dont believe it oh no not that of course i believe it i mean he was shot wasnt he before the fire i just meant i hadnt heard that anyone had determined hed been the primary target you mean the woman yes didnt she have some well maybe i shouldnt say no say anything you want at this point im interested in anything you might know well i cant say that i know anything its just that missy wasnt it you know that she just sort of appeared one day and after that she was with paula fait accompli if you will not that she wasnt beautiful but she didnt seem to be quite one of us in some way i may not be saying anything very coherent so you think somebody in her past might have granat shook his head i cant say ive gotten so far as to actually think anything maybe it was just that she was foreign french i think in any event when i heard about the killings i wondered about her background first her enemies not pauls i mean paul was extremely well liked very respected by everyone and not just here but in washington everywhere he put people together did immense good work on many many fronts i knew him pretty well as you may know and i cant imagine anyone wanting to hurt him much less kill him it just doesnt make any sense so your initial feeling was that it had something to do with missy more than with paul yes glitsky sat back thats interesting do you know anything about her not that its any of my business not too much glitsky admitted well granat lifted his hands palms up but you came to see me about paul it must be about the towing then glitsky halfway apologized it was someplace to start sure i understand it would be granat sat back his arm outstretched along the row of books behind him well id be the first to admit that for the most part the towing industry is a bit of a tough crowd although thats still a long way from saying that violence is a common negotiating tool but not necessarily unheard of granat shook his head as a matter of fact im not aware of any time recently that towhold has resorted to anything like strongarm tactics its one of the reasons they retain me to get things done a different way but now with mayor washington gone the lobbyist smiled we still have a mayor and the city still needs an experienced company to handle its towing and in spite of what you might have heard no final decision has been reached no i realize that in fact its kind of my point now with hanover out of the picture it leaves bayshore rudderless granats dry chortle cut him off i wouldnt say rudderless these people are not rudderless theyre a very sophisticated bunch of venture capitalists who are trying to buy their way into a business they believe to be profitable but dont completely understand as towhold does another nod i believe the mayor might come to see it that way yes or one of the members of the municipal transportation agency or one of them thats true three i believe are already inclined to retain towhold ive heard that too so from my perspective the decision is still very much a matter of the merits three of the mta people obviously think that wetowholdshould stay on because were doing a pretty good job in spite of some of the problems weve had granat leaned forward in his chair youve got to understand chief that whoever gets the contract theyre going to have the same problems fact is theyre going to have to hire the very same folks that we use to run the lots and patrol the streets thats the reality and theyre not going to pay those people any more than we dothey cant and make a profit so theyve got the same labor pool doing the same work for the same price the only change is the employers name and a few guys at the top of the food chain at least towhold has identified a lot of the bad eggs and knows to keep them off the payroll under bayshore itll be the same thing weve got now only worse because of the learning curve on top of everything else ill be telling that to the folks at mta next week and i wouldnt be at all surprised if i convince at least one of them with the simple logic of it especially now that hanover wont be rebutting you for an instant glitsky thought he saw a spark in granats eyes but if he had it disappeared immediately i liked paul a lot chief i really did as you can see im pretty comfortable here financially so are the top guys at towhold if we lose the contract of course well be disappointed but nobodys going under i promise we do twelve other cities in the ninecounty area nobody took paul out to keep him from influencing kathy west which seems to be what youre implying glitsky shook his head i havent implied anything i was just wondering what youd have to say about all this have you talked to the mayor since wednesday a tepid smile i called and had a small talk with her right after i heard about paul and since then well im afraid her honor doesnt return many of my calls so youve tried then of course but its all about access and i dont have it not yet anyway he sat back seemed to gather himself look im not going to bullshit you and pretend we dont want to keep the contract its a huge deal but its business yes but if bayshore can stop you in san francisco theyre in a better position to poach in your other territories that too im afraid is just business but yes of course wed like to stop them here and i think weve still got a very good chance well actually jeff elliot said they dont glitsky was in his cityissue taurus talking on his cell phone with the reporter wests taken a potful of bayshores money to get elected and shes not likely to forget that towholds people came in large for washington itspayback time shes not going to fold and neither are her mta members why not because if one of them votes to retain towhold shell just fire him replace him with a new warm body keep the contract on monthly extension go back again in thirty days and get bayshore approved so one of her mta people going sideways its not going to happen except if she takes hanover as a warning you see any sign of that she called to get me involved in this within a very short time of talking to granat in any case im going to ask her directly what though exactly if granats call made her feel physically threatened if this tow thing is playing on her mind at all why she really wants me on this case ive got that one she trusts you she doesnt know much about cuneo and what she does know she has no confidence in i think its legitimate that she wants to get whoever killed hanover whoever it was he was politically important to her plus she just plain liked him from everything i hear she just wants to make sure it doesnt get screwed up okay you dont believe that no it makes sense its a little odd thats all well youll find out i know glitsky said im just not completely sure that i want to why not glitsky hesitated cuneo he said if i wind up taking the lead here hes not going to like it id rather he gets on to something and i come along afterward and say yeah looks good nice job so whats he looking at i dont know he wont answer my page at that moment cuneo stood in the driveway of the hanovers stucco home on beach street sniffing into the trunk space of their black mercedes hed arrived at a little after eight along with his former homicide partner lincoln russell whom hed asked along to help with the search as well as to serve as a witness that he was not sexually harassing catherine hanover theyd sat waiting outside cuneo driving russell nuts with his drumming on the steering wheel until catherine hanover came outside in her bathrobe to pick up the newspaper on her drivewaya bit of luck since cuneo hadnt really known for sure how he would get a picture of her which he badly wanted and got a few minutes later catherine her husband and all three kids had been shocked and startled by the appearance of the two policemen with a search warrant at their front door whats this about you mean im some kind of a suspect or something of what do we have to let you in to do this but then perhaps because of the inspectors assurances that it wouldnt take too long they had all become reasonably cooperative or at least acquiescent waiting around the kitchen table while cuneo and russell went upstairs in search of the clothes that cuneo remembered catherine had been wearing on the night of the fire in no time at all theyd found the blue silken blouse black leather jacket faded blue jeans all were in her closet the jeans still faintly smelling of smoke they wrapped them all up told catherine that they would return them after the lab was through with them whats the lab going to do with them test for blood spatter traces of gasoline this is ridiculous go ahead and look for that we intend to maam we intend to the two daughters started crying when they had finished inside and announced their intention to inspect the car the family broke up the kids chattering nervously upset about the weirdness of having their house searched everyone then went their various waysthe husband and wife uncommunicative formally distant with one another cuneo noticed will drank coffee and read the morning paper at the kitchen table and catherine announced that she would like to go outside with the inspectors she couldnt imagine what they might be looking for now cuneo was straightening up and he turned to her smells like youve got a gas leak did you know about that she came closer careful to keep her distance leaned over the trunk and sniffed i do smell it i ought to take it in for service have you noticed that smell before he asked not really she said i dont use the trunk very often but russell was feeling the rug on the trunks floor this isnt a leak dan gas got spilled in here no thats not then catherine stopped herself oh she said her hand went to her mouth what cuneo was standing straight up in front of her inside her comfort zone and knowing it squinting in the sun oh what he repeated that was a couple of weeks ago she said what was cuneos features were somehow expectant on both hands his fingers opened and closed russell stood next to his expartner paying attention to this development catherine hanover perhaps seeking some kind of support directed her words over cuneos shoulder to him it was a few weeks ago she said beginning again a few or a couple cuneo asked what first time you said a couple then you said a few which is it i dont know i could probably remember take your time russell said he was a black man with a pleasant face and he had put on a patient expression weve got all day if you want catherine looked from one of them to the other i should probably call a lawyer shouldnt i if you think you need one cuneo said thats your absolute right russell agreed are you two thinking about arresting me for pauls murder i didnt have anything to do with that i dont know anything about it at all except that i saw him that day thats all were just executing a search warrant maam russell said if you were under arrest wed be reading you your rights so im not no maam but cuneo put in you were starting to tell us about the gas smell in your car two or maybe more weeks ago let me think catherine said im sure i can remember okay it was todays saturday it was the week before last monday i think so more like ten days russell being helpful wanted to nail down the day something like that i was going to pick up polly for something after school i dont remember exactly what it was nowher orthodontist appointment maybe and i passed a car parked off the roadit was in the presidio anyway there was a young woman a girl really standing beside it kind of looking like she hoped someone would help her but maybe not wanting to actually flag somebody over so i stopped and asked if she was all right and she said she was out of gas catherine looked into russells face then cuneos sighing she went on she had one of those containers in her trunk you know so we got in my car and i took her to a gas station where we filled it up and put it in my trunk and then i took her back to her car but when we got there the container had fallen over and leaked out a little a little cuneo said it seemed like a little he leaned over and ran his hand along the rug as russell had he smelled his hand russell meanwhile moved up a step what kind of car was it he asked whose oh hers white russell said thats the color maam not the kind what kind of car was it catherine closed her eyes crinkled up her face came back to him i think some kind of suv im pretty sure any memory of the license plate no i dont know if i ever looked at it did you get the young womans name first name even no we just her expression had grown helpless she shook her head no russell nodded youre going to go with that story its not a story she said thats what happened cuneo had removed a swiss army knife from his pocket and was back inside the trunk cutting fibers from the rug that he then placed in a small ziploc bag well okay then he said turning to russell i think were through here for now the law firm of arron hanover pells had a recorded message that provided a number clients could call if they had a weekend emergency when glitsky called that number he reached one of the associates who agreed to call paul hanovers secretary and ask her to call him back glitsky pulled up to a minimart just off columbus in north beach doubleparked and got a cup of hot water with a tea bag then went back to his car to wait the tea hadnt yet cooled enough for him to sip it when his cell phone rang glitsky hello is this the police yes it is this is deputy chief glitsky who am i speaking with lori cho paul hanovers secretary thanks for getting back to me so fast thats all right i wasnt doing anything anyway except staring at his files i cant get used to the idea that hes not coming back in so youre at your office now would you mind if i came by for a few minutes if youd like were in the bank of america building twentieth floor theres a guard downstairs whos got to let you up ill tell him im expecting you could you give me your name again lori cho met him at the elevators she appeared to be in her midthirties smallboned fragilelooking close to anorexic with a haunted weary look about her eyes or perhaps it was simply fatigue and sorrow over the loss of her boss here at the office on saturday she was dressed for work in a nononsense black skirt with matching sweater tennis shoes and white socks her hair softened the general gaunt impression somehowshoulderlength thick and shining black it might still have been damp glitsky followed her in silence down a carpeted hallway through a set of wide double doors then across an ornate lobby and into a large corner office hanovers panoramic view was mostly to the east down over the rooftops of lesser highrises to the bay across the bridge to yerba buena and treasure island with berkeley and richmond off in the distance you can just sit anywhere cho said she seated herself behind the highly polished darkwood desk swallowed up by the black leather swivel chair that must have been hanovers flattened sheets of cardboard which glitsky realized were unassembled boxes were stacked by the file cabinets against one of the internal walls the other wall featured framed photographs of hanover with a couple of dozen politicians and celebrities among them several san francisco mayors including kathy west and three of californias governors one of them arnold at a quick glance here was paul hanover shaking hands with both bill clinton and george bush on a boat somewhere with larry ellison in a giants uniform with willie mays evidently hed been to the wedding of michael douglas and catherine zetajones a showcase office nothing in the way of law books glitsky came back to cho who hadnt moved since she sat down she was so still she might have been in a trance her eyes were open but she wasnt looking at anything how long had you worked for him glitsky asked her surface attention came to him fourteen years im sorry she nodded absently i wanted to ask you if there was anything in his work that you were aware of that might have played some kind of a role in his death was he upset about something was some deal going wrong anything like that her eyes went to her faraway place again then returned to him nothing i can think of there was no crisis he was doing what he always did which was what again it took her a second or two to formulate her response he put people together he was very good with people she gestured at the photo gallery as you can see he genuinely liked people did he like nils granat the question surprised her i think so they had lunch together every month or so why did mr granat say there was a problem no he said they were friends i think they were even with this conflict over the citys towing she nodded yes it wasnt a conflict between the two of them mr granat had his clients and mr hanover had his he had dozens of similar relationships but he never mentioned to you that he was worried about mr granats clients the company towhold worried in what way physically afraid she shook her head no he wasnt physically afraid of anybody did you know him i never did no she seemed to take this news with some disappointment he was a good man yes maam everybody seems to think so glitsky sat back crossed a leg did you know ms damiens very well chos jaw went up a half inch her eyes came into sharp focus not too well no i shouldnt say anything bad about her she seemed to make mr hanover happy and she was always nice to me but you didnt believe her cho hesitated you know how some people can just seem too nice it was almost like some trick shed learned how to do maybe she was just trying too hard because she wanted mr hanovers friends to like her and his family too but they werent going to like her no matter how she acted they thought she was in it for his money did you think that she bit at her cheek as i said i didnt really know her mr hanover didnt think it and he was nobodys fool he might have been right but you disagreed with him a little bit with no real basis in fact though just a feeling feelings generally are based on something she sighed she just seemed calculating it made me feel she was not very genuine i suppose you want an example glitsky didnt push if youve got one well she paused okay when paul first met her one of her big things was she volunteered once a week at glide memorial the soup kitchens okay the message of course being that she had this big heart and cared about the homeless and all that but once she and paul once they got together that pretty much stopped so you think it was a ploy to make her seem somehow more attractive i dont know i hate to say that maybe she was sincere and just got busier with paul you know but it struck me wrong and then you know she really did come from nowhere and then suddenly was going to marry him so quickly it seemed so mr hanover never talked to you about her background not too much evidently she had had a husband who died of cancer about five years ago do you know where no im sorry i never even asked but she wanted to start over and shed always dreamed of living in america in san francisco so she came here she let out a breath it really wasnt mysterious she had a few connections here with people shed met overseas and then met paul and then well you know if he wasnt rich no one would have thought anything about it but of course he was though the admission seemed to cost her she shrugged and said they just got along she made him happy he seemed to make her happy so they werent fighting why do you ask that the rumor is there was some tension between them the expense of the remodel maybe i heard shed spent something like a million dollars cho allowed a small sad smile thats about what he told me but he thought it was funny funny amusing i mean after all he was going to be living there he had the money and if she spent it to make a nicer house for him what was he going to complain about cho stared for a second into the space in front of her if there was any tension at all it was about the appointment the appointment she nodded this wasnt public yet but the administration had gotten in touch with him and told him hed been shortlisted for assistant secretary of the interior a reward for all the fundraising hed done for the president but missy wasnt happy about it she didnt want to move to washington uproot her life again especially after all the work shed done on the house chos face clouded over but even so so what didnt i read that it wasnt murder and suicide even if they were fighting somebody killed them so would it even matter if theyd been fighting about something no youre right it wouldnt glitsky said im sorry to have taken so much of your time im just trying to get a handle on this whole thing who mightve wanted to kill them well i hate to say this go ahead well just have you talked to his family they were really unhappy about him and her and he was unhappy about them his kids you mean she nodded all the time on him missy wanted his money he should be careful make sure she signed a prenup some worse things about her he said he might change his will before the wedding if they kept it up did he tell them that i dont know i think so told them i meanmaybe not actually done it before glitsky left cho just being thorough and believing that at this early stage in the investigation he needed facts even if they later proved to be irrelevant he found out that before hed handed the build phase of the remodel over to missy hanover had paid the first few contractor bills himself during the design phase the company james leymar construction was in the phone book and so was mr leymar himself glitsky called and the man being home made his hat trick for the day a half hour later he pulled up in front of a goodsize twostory stucco house on quintara street out in the residential avenues of the sunset district a shirtless man was working with lengths of pvc pipe in the earth up close against the house the sweat on his broad back glinting in the sun at the sound of glitskys car door closing he looked around and stood up slapping his hands together then wiping them on his wellworn blue jeans glitsky yes sir leymar was a big handsome balding man with a welldeveloped torso big arms and a shoulder tattoo of a heart and the word maggie squinting against the brightness he took a few steps over the tornup landscape of his front yard and stuck out his dirty hand jim leymar how you doin good youre putting in a sprinkler system i know ridiculous isnt it he turned back to survey the trenches hed dug like the foggiest damn real estate in america needs more water but the wife decided for god knows what reason so thats the end of that discussion he swiped at his forehead leaving a streak of dirt but you said you had some questions about the hanover job if you dont mind no i dont mind but ive got to say it breaks my heart to think about the work we put in on that house only to have it all go up in smoke it was a beautiful job and the people too of course a tragedy you knew them pretty well well they were clients you know id done some work for him before rebuilt his kitchen maybe three years ago and it went okay so we got together again but this time was mostly her more than mostly she wrote the checks so she was the client glitsky filed that bit of information and how was she to work with he asked uncompromising but without a personal edge to it she wanted things a certain way and if you didnt give her what she wanted shed have us do it again down to the floorboards if need be but she was just firm that was all give me that anytime over somebody who changes her mind seventeen times something about leymars phrase stopped glitsky so youre saying she did not make lots of changes as you went along no he thought about it for another minute if you want to see ive got all the change orders thats all right id just heard somewhere that she kept adding to the job no more than anybody else less than some folks no what happened was we got a good design and went ahead and built it so the initial bid was for a million dollars leymar laughed out loud a million dollars you think i make a million dollars a job and im laying my own sprinkler system he shook his head still chuckling a million dollars jesus christ a million is nearly the gross on my best year ever the gross hanover was a good jobhell a great job ill give you thatbut it went out for five hundred maybe a little less and thats what we brought it in for too give or take where did you ever hear a million several sources he said well id go back to them and tell em theyve got their heads up their asses you want ill show you my books on it i wont need to do that glitsky wiped his own brow the sun was directly overhead now the temperature nearing eighty about as hot as it ever got in san francisco okay lets leave the money id like to eliminate the possibility that she was the target instead of him so im hoping to find somebody who might have known her a little bit see if she had enemies who wanted to kill her maybe he shook his head thatd be a stretch id say he thought another minute except maybe if there was some other guy before hanover did you get a feeling that there had been no its just that she washe glanced over his shoulderi dont want maggie to hear me but she was an unbelievably attractive hunk of woman my crews would trade off with each other so they could work on her place and get a glimpse of her if shed dumped some guy for hanover i could see him maybe taking it out on both of them did she or hanover ever say anything to make you think that no we didnt talk personal they were clients that was all we didnt hang with the same social crowd he gestured around him as you probably figured anyway huh dismas hardy came down the stairs from a rare saturday afternoon nap to find abe glitsky in his kitchen helping vincent cut up vegetables on a cutting board on the counter the two of them working silently next to a rapidly diminishing pile of tomatoes onions peppers okra when he stopped in the doorway glitsky glanced his way and just loud enough to be heard said here he is now vin ill tell you later hardy crossed to his boy and put a hand on his shoulder have i ever told you your uncle abes indian name vin his indian name you know dances with wolves like that a phrase that captures a persons essence abes is people not laughing why because every time you see him hes surrounded by people who are not laughing but i do think that actually crying real tears is taking it a little far its the onions vincent said thats what they all say hardy threw a chunk of tomato into his mouth what are you guys making gumbo vin said i need it for school on monday and wanted to make a test batch hardy squeezed his sons shoulder i love this boy make it hot he said im thinking of calling treya inviting her over too glitsky said that would be swell and i love your wife even more than i like you but werent you guys just here it seems like only yesterday it was yesterday maybe we should all just move in since were spending so much time here anyway wed save a bundle on rent and vin you could get in time with that critical smallchild experience youre going to need when you have your own kids im not having kids sure you are no im not im going to be a rich bachelor theres a noble calling hardy said how are you going to do the rich part im thinking the lottery he got that from you hardy shot at glitsky the adults in this house dont play the lottery and you know why because were good at numbers and the lottery is the tax for the mathchallenged i believe ive even mentioned this to you before dont listen to your father vin somebody wins the lottery every few weeks and youve got as good a chance as anybody else withering glitsky with a glance he said pathetic and looked at his son you got a backup plan i mean to get rich i guess if things got tight i could always be a movie star for a while there you go glitsky said proudly plan b ready to go although traditionally hardy said doesnt the movie star come from within the ranks of the supremely attractive vin looked at glitsky sniffed theatrically he cuts me deep i heard it it happens all the time my selfesteems in the toilet hardy stopped in the middle of a bite of red pepper youll live i promise i didnt even know the word selfesteem when i was a kid isnt it two words glitsky asked its hyphenated vinnie said and dad didnt hear of it as a kid cause it wasnt invented until after the renaissance hardy deadpanned his son for a minute said too bad abes indian name is already taken he turned his attention to glitsky but callously leaving for a moment the discussion of my sons future plans for wealth and world domination what really brings you here glitsky laid his knife down this morning i talked to nils granat about the towing business as i was in the neighborhood anyway i thought id stop by since you seemed interested last night he says nobody he knows would ever consider using strongarm tactics to accomplish their business goals those may have been his exact words well what did you expect hes not going to tell you theyve got a team of hit men out whacking people who get in their way i still think its a pretty good theory well im going to have a few conversations with towhold management see if any of them get nervous meanwhile though i also talked to hanovers secretary who seems to think its probably somebody in the family who stood to lose the inheritance you already had that one what was her name again the daughterinlaw catherine hanover but i dont think so i cant believe she would have spelled her motive out so clearly if shed had any part in it still the family connections on the table but you know the most interesting thing the uncertainty principle what the most interesting thing the uncertainty principle actually quantum mechanics in general in fact all of it damned interesting although im not sure i get most of it glitsky picked up his knife again went back to the cutting board shaking his head why do i talk to your father vinnie it feels so good when you stop that must be it okay okay hardy said im sorry if i hurt all the dainty feelings in this kitchen i give up abe whats the most interesting thing he put his knife down again missy damiens didnt spend a million dollars fixing up her house hardy leaned back against the counter crossed his arms few of us do abe why is that interesting because everybody i talked to up til now said she had hanovers secretary the daughterinlaw cuneo that was the number and this means if its true it means half a million dollars cash has gone missing with who whered it go thats the question the beck was in the honor society at her high school and one of the requirements of that organization was doing some nonschool community service in this case cleaning up selected city parks and other public amenities in a graffiti abatement program which had begun in a bit of controversy hardy and frannie both thought it was a nice only in san francisco touch that the programcreated to clean up the worst of the obscene tagging that desecrated nearly every square inch of wall space in certain neighborhoodshad been hotly debated and nearly disallowed by the school district on the grounds that the cleanup represented an authoritarian stifling of artistic expression among the citys troubled youth a number of adult san francisco residents and parents and nearly half of the school board held to the belief that spraying fuck and other such creative epithets in dayglo on billboards and benches at bus stops and anywhere else the spirit moved one was apparently therapeutic and good for a childs selfesteem that word again with a growing sense of outrage frannie had eventually joined the debate and for the past few weekends in support of the kids efforts she had been going out with her daughter and her friends all of them armed with buckets and detergent to help with the cleanup and now they were home the guys were still making the gumbohardy with a justopened bottle of anchor steam next to him peeling shrimp over the sink glitsky cutting up the andouille vincent seeding and chopping the jalapenos whats cooking rebecca yelled from the front door it smells great footsteps broke into a run in the hallway and in a second she burst into the kitchen hugs all around uncle abe two days in a row hey dad what are you guys making she was at the stove wooden spoon in hand what is this stuff vin flew across the room no no no no no no tastes no bites thats dinner frannie showed up a few steps behind her daughter her windblown red hair which shed been growing long for some months now fell below her shoulders and her color was high after all day in the sun she was wearing khaki shorts and a pink tank top and her green eyes were sparkling hardy found himself struck by a sudden contentment so acute that it felt for a moment like a hot blade through his heart the sun was low enough in the late afternoon that it made it through the picture window in the front of the house spraying the hardwood in the dining room with an amber glow that reflected all the way up and into the kitchen behind him over the sink the window was open and a still unseasonably warm breeze tickled the back of his neck the smell of the gumbo was intoxicating both of the women in his family were smiling and almost too lovely to believe and his son and best friend were working with him to make something everybody would love to eat everything dear to him was close safe and protected in this room on a perfect day he closed his eyes for an instant against the rush of emotion are you okay babe frannie was in front of him her hand on his arm a worried look on her face blinking a couple of times hardy leaned down and planted a quick kiss on her forehead the moment passed unnoticed by everyone elsestill bickering over the gumbobut frannie gave him a last concerned glance before he said too good really thats all too good he pulled her to him for a second and squeezed as the words of abes toast came back to him may nothing ever change on the counter by vincents cutting board the telephone rang let it go hardy said i dont want to talk to anybody but vincent had already grabbed it on the first ring said hello and was listening just a second he said can i tell him whos calling he passed the phone over to his father catherine hanover glitsky gave him a startled look hardy looked back at him shrugged took the phone and said hello dismas hardy was moving with the phone on the steps toward his bedroom upstairs his face took on a quizzical expression at this unknown womans use of his first name but he had no doubt that she was a potential client and didnt even stop to consider the unusual familiarity still there was a question in his voice this is dismas hardy yes dismas she said again its catherine rusk halfway up the stairs he stopped still catherine hanover now hardy found that he couldnt frame a response the two or three seconds before he could speak felt like a very long time catherine he said how are you then still struggling for something to say how have you been he heard a throaty chuckle that vibrated in some distant region of his psyche you mean this last thirtyseven years ive been okay although right at this moment im not too good im afraid i hate to contact you for the first time under these conditions but i didnt know who else to call ive thought about it a lot over the years you know calling you but always thought that maybe wed just run into each other again somewhere its not that big a city no it isnt youve lived here all along mostly after college and then a couple of years back in boston i know youve been living here ive seen you in the papers he heard her sigh anyway i called you because i think i need a lawyer apparently im some kind of a suspect in a murder case yes i know that you know already i mean id heard about catherine hanover the name but i didnt know she was you the next words slipped out before he could stop them i thought you werent ever going to change your name i wasnt but it seemed important to will so i guess when push came to shove i abandoned my high principles and sold out my old feminist beliefs and how about you i thought you werent ever going to work nine to five touche he said im sorry its all right you sounded just like your old self well im still sorry i have no idea where that came from or why it came out its okay really again he heard the oddly mnemonic throaty chuckle youre probably still feeling guilty about how you dumped me maybe he admitted and again before he could think added that could be it he wasnt quite sure what he was saying since he hadnt consciously thought of her in years frannie appeared below him at the flight of the stairs looking up with some concern mouthed is everything all right nodding hardy gave his wife a smile then turned and started up the steps again but now youre in trouble i think i must be the police came by this morning with a search warrant and looked through my house and my car hardy sat down in the reading chair in his bedroom this was a new development that hadnt yet made the news if theyd already served a search warrant on her the case had progressed far beyond a casual suspicion based on a possible motive somebody in the investigation was already into evidence and causality and it was not abe who surely would have mentioned this to him either last night or downstairs just a few minutes ago that left only cuneo and the realization made hardys stomach go tight so youve talked to the police several times without a lawyer i didnt think i needed one i didnt know i was a suspect the first time was down at the fire you were at the fire yes why because it was my fatherinlaws house and i saw it on the news and ran down to see what was happening and if i could help and you talked to cops down there yes somebody cuneo and an arson inspector too and since then a deputy chief glitsky but they just wanted to know about paul my fatherinlaw paul hanover i know that too how can you know all this its a big case catherine everybody in town knows about it in the phone her voice grew smaller thats right of course but are you saying i shouldnt have talked to the police i was trying to cooperate hardy one hand rubbing his forehead said no cooperations okay im just being a lawyer sometimes its bad luck to say anything to the police but i didnt think i was a suspect no i know thats their favorite so im in bigger trouble than i thought he didnt want her to panic and spouted out a white lie maybe not i dont know what were they looking for at your house the clothes i was wearing when i was at the fire they were in my closet and i think the hamper so you hadnt washed them yet i guess not then on a higher note the worry clear in her voice is that a problem too i dont know about too i dont know what the problems are yet catherine what did they do with the clothes they took them away they said theyd bring them back they were going to analyze them for i dont know what something did they take anything else a silence catherine now he heard a definite strain in the pitch of her voice some cuttings of the fabric from the trunk of my car it had some gasoline on it see a couple of weeks ago i helped this woman whod run out of gas catherine a sob broke over the line hardy stopped to lift the lid and stir the gumbo then went and stood in the entrance to the dining room glitsky was sitting at the table apparently content to wait for hardys descent after his business call and pass the time with frannie who had poured herself a glass of chardonnay the kids were nowhere to be found hardy stood in the door to the dining area hands in his pockets leaning against the jamb so abe he said you searched her house this morning and just didnt get around to telling me because glitskys face clouded what are you talking about im talking about a search warrant for catherine hanovers clothes and her car they found gasoline in her trunk who did i didnt he stopped cuneo why didnt he hardy knew the answer he didnt want your input in the first place and now hes proving he didnt need it he wants the collar himself but glitsky was reduced to sputtering we havent obviously hes not interested hes got his suspect and hes in a hurry glitskys mouth was tight his scar in high relief through his lips his blue eyes flat and hard she under arrest not yet apparently though she might be anytime did she say that no but shes got herself worked into a pretty good panic right about now i dont know what shes going to do she wants you to represent her then glitsky asked thats what she called for and you wisely suggested she get somebody else right not exactly hardy took a deep breath frannie said why would he do that abe glitsky looked across the table because your husband doesnt want to have anything to do with catherine hanover back over to hardy im correct here am i not before hardy could reply frannie asked why not because of dan cuneo thats why not hes already got diz and me together in his brain now if diz gets involved in this case suddenly he turned his head whats not exactly mean diz this really wouldnt be a good idea no i know that but there are other issues such as such as i know her his eyes went to frannie catherine hanover is catherine rusk he said and catherine rusk is glitsky asked his first girlfriend frannie assayed a brave smile that didnt quite work well im happy for her glitsky said but shes not his girlfriend now you are again he looked at hardy tell her diz hardy broke his own tired smile im pretty sure she knows but for the recordhe walked up behind where frannie sat and placed a kiss on the top of her head youre still my girlfriend she patted his hand where it rested on her shoulder im so glad okay glitsky said thats settled now youve got to let catherine go thats my intention good you had me worried there for a minute well i dont mean to worry you some more either of youhe squeezed frannies shoulderbut i think im going to have to see her tonight she needs some help and she needs it now he sat down next to frannie shes a wreck hon crying on the phone she didnt know who else to call ive got to go see her this one time she was desperate you dont have to go see her glitsky said send one of your minions did you ever try to find a minion on saturday night abe besides she called me maybe i can calm her down i know her you knew her glitsky snapped you dont know her anymore he turned to frannie you tell him this is dumb he makes his own decisions abe you may have noticed hardy kissed her cheek and stood up sorry i know its saturday night but shes really in a bad way fran i wont be too long she patted his hand ill deal with it we were just vegging with a video anyway glitsky was getting up too dont let her hire you thats not my plan ill get her calmed down and give her some tips to get her through the weekend like dont talk to any more cops then well see where we are hardy couldnt help but notice that catherine hadnt conceded much to the passage of the years his first reaction on seeing her was that it was nearly unfair shed kept her body in terrific shape and her face always her best feature was if anything more interesting and attractive than it had been when she was eighteen a couple of lines around the eyes gave her a sense of experience humor and maybe even a hint of wisdom smooth skin a strong chin welldefined cheekbones and an assertive nose would make her face at home on a magazine cover she looked frannies age although he knew she had twelve years on his wife she opened the door and he consciously had to stop himself from commenting on her attractiveness a compliment that for all its truth would not have been appropriate and she wasnt alone this is my husband will our boy saul polly and heather this is mr hardy she explained to the children hes going to be my lawyer for a while until all this with the police gets sorted out i hope not too long not even inside the door and hardy felt blindsided confronted with two of the character traits that he suddenly remembered had led to them breaking up so long ago the first manifested itself by the presence of her family on the phone hardy had gotten an impression so strong that it was a conviction that catherine was alone at home in a panic she had no one else to turn to certainly not a husband a nuclear family gathered around now here she was in their bosom and hardy felt a bit abused that hed been coerced into leaving his own family on a saturday night thinking it was an emergency when it was really just catherine being overly histrionic and being not entirely truthful because of omissionthe cowards lie and then the comment in her first breath about him being her lawyer he remembered all too wellshe used to make assumptions and jump to conclusions based on the belief that whatever it might be people wanted to do it for her and shed been so desirable that usually it wasnt an issue doing what she wanted instead of what you wanted was a small enough price to pay because when you were with her in her presence you felt that life was good we werent going to the game dismas i said i wanted to go to the movies remember i just assumed and herehe hadnt told her he was going to be her lawyer although obviously she now assumed he was why wouldnt he be when in fact hed rather consciously avoided making any kind of overture or commitment in that direction but polly chirping up brushed away the thoughts were you really my moms boyfriend she asked hardy downplayed it a long time ago in high school we were good friends he glanced at her to verify that this was her version of events as well and got an infinitesimal nod of acknowledgment next her husband will stepped up and shook hands thanks for coming by after this search this morning we didnt know what to do obviously things are further along than we thought but how they could think catherine shaking his head he abruptly stopped will was a step or two above conventionally handsome tanned and trim he had a boyish face his handshake was not strong and the smile left a strange impression of distance if not outright discomfort but you know more about all this than we do he concluded hardy took the opportunity to clarify things i really dont know too much beyond what ive read in the papers after you catch me up well have to see how bad things are you may not need a lawyer at all but catherine didnt let him off no i need a lawyer dismas im sure of that after this morning the search was just so so weird in a way this inspector cuneo he must be thinking will shook his head his voice with an edge to it lets not go there yet we dont know what hes thinking hes not going to find anything on catherines clothes but if he does catherine turned on him theres nothing to find will hes harassing me pure and simple hardy drawn in had to ask who is cuneo she nodded who else but here you are standing in the open door please come in dismas im not thinking this has got us all so upset i dont blame you its upsetting he looked at the assembled children how are you guys doing holding up saul said my mom didnt kill grandpa no hardy replied im sure she didnt its bullshit saul but catherines rebuke had no teeth mr hardys here because he knows i couldnt have done anything like that thats why i called him and its why we need to talk will spoke up moms right kids its adult time well be right out front here if you need us saul didnt particularly like it but the girls went without hesitation and in a moment so did he hardy took the moment to look around the room then at catherine at least they didnt tear the place up down here did they he said to her no it was all upstairs will said catherines tone brooked no objection i think he asked me will if you dont mind no hardy said thats all right a hard look passed between husband and wife shes right will said its her problem really you two work it out and with that he was gone hardy and catherine remained in the living room sitting facing one another at the far end by the fireplace their eyes met and held for an instant catherine drew a breath made an attempt at a smile another one i dont know where to begin she said at last except to tell you that wait hardy said catherine please just one second now that he had her alone he was going to set the record straight i came over here to talk to you because you sounded like you were in trouble and you needed some emergency legal advice im prepared to give that to you free and for nothing because i do feel like i know who you are and of course theres our history she seemed to be suppressing some amusement you do sound like a lawyer thats because i am a lawyer catherine and i dont know if theres even a case here much less if im prepared to take it on if they discover some evidence and you become a legitimate suspect she shook her head stopping him its not about the evidence dismas its about inspector cuneo hows that i made him mad and now hes out to show me i wasnt going to get away with it with what an hour later hardy had the whole story from catherines point of view as well as she could piece it together she believed that her accusation of cuneos sexual advances was at the base of everything that had happened up to now and took the position that the search wasnt so much about evidence as an example of pure police hassle she had no idea why her clothes might be important readily admitting her concerns about the familys future finances especially if paul and missy were to marry she also told him about her conversations with glitsky finally theyd exhausted everything shed brought up and decided to take a break without any conscious decision hardy had spent the hour asking questions giving answers and generally acting as though he was already de facto taking the case in the kitchen she brewed up a pot of decaf and they crossed over to the table in the breakfast nook hardy slid in on the bench and sipped at his coffee as she lowered herself onto one of the chairs this is just so strange she said quietly how many times do you think we sat like this either at your place or mine and drank coffee and did homework together while it was dark outside a lot but im not sure i remember much about the homework no we always did homework before hardy felt the before hanging in the air between them then she said that was the rule dont you remember we were such serious students we were listen to you mister never got a b hardy shrugged i got some bs especially in college but grades werent what i put my energy into anyway i know i remember where you put your energy hardys mouth twitched and his eyes flicked across at her then away they were good times he brought his cup to his mouth and sipped do you realize that my daughters as old now as you were then is that possible whats her name rebecca i love that name does she have a boyfriend going on two years darren nice kid are they serious probably theyd say they were anyway first true love and all that you sound cynical im not they just dont really have a clue yet like we did no we didnt either i thought we did she scratched at the table with a fingernail i thought we had it all maybe you did i didnt i think you did even then you were always so good with who you were so together he snorted together theres a word you dont hear a lot of anymore if i was so together how did i fall so completely apart how about your parents being in a plane crash you think that could have been a lifechanging event i guess it was you guess hardy shrugged well he said quietly whatever it was in any case im sorry i was a shit to you you werent really you just dumped me thats all but it was the only way hardy had been able to do it he had had the excuse of his parents death so that he could keep at bay his own guilt over wanting to end it with catherine he was sorting out his life and had no time for a relationship especially such a demanding one as theirs the truth was that he had simply grown tired of the dramatics the narcissism the omissions i never said i wouldnt see anybody else when you went to college but he also knew that if he allowed himself to get back into her presence the physical connect might make him weaken so without a word hed just dropped out of her life in retrospect he knew that she was what hed had to abandon to get to where hed come now to where he needed to go but now a salve to his conscience he said after three years a decent person maybe shouldnt just disappear without some explanation sometimes maybe the decent person needs to maybe he needs something else still she reached across the table and briefly touched his hand okay her voice was gentle you were a shit but youre here now because i called and said i needed you so lets call it even hardy nodded even it is he put his mug down and reached into his briefcase for a yellow legal pad and a couple of pens now at the risk of ruining our new and hardwon equilibrium ive got to ask you a few more questions she backed her chair away from the table and crossed her legs holding her mug in her lap she wore shorts that flattered her legs and a salmoncolored sleeveless pullover does this mean youre my lawyer not yet he said maybe not ever if they never charge you but either way im going to clear it with my wife first its one of our rules murder cases can be hell on family time catherine sat back and crossed her arms youve really changed havent you most of us do catherine i dont know how much i have ill bet more than you think youve got a family and after kids the whole world is different with the kids yes hardy noted the omission of will and wondered exactly what it meant in this context but this wasnt going to be the time to pursue it but assuming that your wife frannie okay assuming frannie agrees and if i become a suspect hardy shook his head too many ifs catherine lets get specific why did you go and visit your fatherinlaw that day i told you i was worried about the college money for the kids im sure you were but why that particular day had something changed did paul and missy move up their wedding day or anything like that she twirled the mug before looking up at him maybe it had just been building up and suddenly i needed to know for sure and and youre trying out how that answer sounds on me the toneunexpectedly sharpstopped her she shot a glance at him and took in a quick breath no no im not doing that so there was no reason nothing different that day from any other like what hardy lowered his voice well for example your husband was out of town he was fishing down south thats what you said on the phone earlier so maybe you had a little more time to yourself to think about all these money issues right and you suddenly needed to know pauls plans right she thrust out her chin you dont believe me im just asking you questions and listening to how you answer them catherine how are you and your husband doing fine the defensiveness unmistakable now were fine no problems a pause then everybody has problems dismas nobodys perfect i didnt say anybody was i asked about you and will her eyes went to the doorway then looked hardy full in the face were not great he leaned in toward her his voice barely audible catherine nobodys indicted you yet maybe they never will and maybe youre completely factually innocent i am i didnt do any he raised a palm but if they do arrest you if you wind up going on trial for these murders you wont have any secrets everything comes out and getting surprised in the courtroom is the worst bad luck you can imagine he drank coffee when he spoke again his tone was more conversational but as i say theres no indictment yet were just covering some possible contingencies here tonight so well leave you and will for the moment lets talk about paul hanover did you know he owned a gun sure we all knew that and where he kept it in the headboard of his bed loaded yes he mentioned it more than a few times over the years he got a kick out of riling up his daughters who think weapons are dangerous theyre right hardy said but you did know where paul kept his gun and people knew it and would testify to it it wasnt a family secret so family members yes and you think theyd testify against you if it came to that this obviously brought her up short she took in the familiar kitchen surroundings as if suddenly seeing them in a different light for the first time well no i mean mary wouldnt were fairly close i cant imagine beth or even theresa beth and theresa wills older sister and my motherinlaw not my favorite people and probably vice versa but i mean theres nothing inherently negative about knowing where paul kept his gun is there they knew where it was too hardy looked up from his note taking yes but they werent at his house a few hours before he was shot were they no no they werent i mean i dont know that for sure but he waved it away dont worry about that if they dont have alibis the police will know soon enough but was there somebody else who i dont know you said mary wouldnt testify against you i got the feeling you were going to say beth or theresa might i didnt say that no i know you didnt i wasnt going to say it all right he waited while she worked through her emotions this is not about the family she said at last its about cuneo well no hardy said its about everything he came forward and spoke quietly but with some urgency you might not want to talk about it now but everybody else in your family has the same motive that you do and if someone among them doesnt like you and you get charged they might find themselves in an unusually good position to do you damage and at the same time protect themselves if this is about pauls money which seems likely then its about their money too okay okay im sorry you dont need to be sorry youre allowed to feel defensive about your family if you didnt in facthe broke a small smilei might think something was fishy about that the jab of lightness broke some of her tension so i cant win no matter what essentially right but all im after now is basic general information he sat back i believe we were on theresa something went out of catherines shoulders hardy stole a glance at his watchquarter to tenand realized he should wrap this up pretty soon if the investigation truly came to settle on her and if he took it on theyd have all the time in the world but her relationship with her motherinlaw was already on the table and he wanted to hear what else she had to say about it she doesnt approve of me and never has why not i wish i knew god knows ive tried to be a good wife and mother and even daughterinlaw but shes well shes a very difficult woman shes got this one rocksolid vision of how all women should be and im not it and whats that vision well first they should work she works beth and mary both work catherine stopped and shook her head but thats not really it because when will and i were first together i did work and if anything she was more negative about me then than she is now which is kind of hard to imagine she sighed again i just wasnt good enough for her baby that would be will she nodded the golden boy he should have married someone with more i dont know what ambition who maybe would have pushed him harder to get to his true potential i just weighed him down with a family and stayed at home instead of bringing in an income so he constantly had to struggle just to make ends meet which is why hes never hes never been as successful as his father and thats your fault absolutely how could it not be how can you even ask it couldnt be will so that left me right catherine suddenly looked over at the kitchen door got up and swung it shut then sat back down the color had come up again in her cheeks but the real fun didnt start until we had the children i of course was a terrible mother i spoiled them then i was too hard on them i let them get away with murder then wouldnt let them have any fun i fed them the wrong food and made them wear awful clothes i was ruining the girls because i didnt give them the example of a strong working woman and ruining saul because i was too soft on him except when i was too hard on him and squished his sensitive soul she brushed her hair back from her forehead drew a breath well were getting into it now arent we its all right i know i know she paused anyway finally it got bad enoughsaul was about five at the timethat i told theresa she couldnt come by anymore she was relentless poisoning the kids against me i got will to agree so you know what she did then what filed a petition for grandparents visitation rights against us by this time she and paul were divorced and she had nothing else in her life except her job and her grandkids she just went off the deep end lord what a time so what happened so finally paul got involved and made us all sit around and talk it out theresa really didnt want to break the family up did she and we didnt want the kids not to know their only grandma bottom line she could come and visit whenever she wanted within reason as long as she agreed not to criticize me anymore especially in front of the kids and how did that work out surprisingly pretty well although i still think she considers all eight grandchildren ultimately her responsibility because none of the families have done as well as paul did shes always doublechecking us on how much weve saved for their colleges and the down payments on their starter homes down payments i love that a last sigh and she offered an apologetic shrug anyway thats theresa sounds charming hardy again consulted his watch came back to her do you feel like stopping weve covered a lot how are you holding up a sudden warm expression transformed her face you know she said im really okay she paused do you find it a little bit surreal that were sitting here doing this he smiled at her to be honest yes okay so its not just me maybe you really havent changed all that much after all except in every fiber of my being well that of course the life thing the life thing he repeated and a short silence settled between them she reached over and squeezed his hand im so glad i called you he nodded blew out some air tapped his pen against the legal pad so lets talk about after you left pauls that night all right catherine said what about it everything hardy said beginning with what time it was she sat back an elbow on the table a little after four id say four thirty and what did you do then after you left she met his eyes then looked quickly away and swallowed she paused another moment i drove home dismas here straight here hardy suddenly flashed on a time that shed gone out with another guy shed looked him right in the eye and even swallowed the same as she did now as she denied itand then she broke down in an admission begging his forgiveness he almost expected her to have the same reaction now as he waited for her to retract the obvious lie but she kept her composure this time meeting his gaze he made a mental note to return to this pointwhere had she gone after leaving hanoversand pressed on were your kids here when you got home he gave her a somewhat sheepish smile im really hoping youre going to say yes right about now i wish i could but they werent hardy hated that answer and must have shown it because she hastened to explain i could show you in my calendar its really nothing sinister wednesdays theyve all got something at school until five or six sauls got band pollys in the school play and heather has yearbook shes the editor and since we all knew will would be gone that night i told them i could use a night off from cooking and to catch up on my bills so i said why didnt they all rendezvous at school and go out for a pizza which they did right i assume so i didnt ask hardy took in a breath so you were home alone paying bills and watching television until you saw the fire on tv thats right she came forward i wasnt there dismas at pauls i really was right here all night before i went out okay then he said although it would be a plus if we had any way to prove it did you call anybody go out to borrow some sugar she brightened for a beat i called mary my sisterinlaw i wanted to tell her what paul had said thats good and when was that as soon as i got home i had to tell somebody okay what about later like when five six seven she shook her head i was just here puttering around having something to eat one of the neighbors might have seen me pull in or the car in the driveway that would be helpful hardy said but lets not hold our breath he thought for a beat so you dont really have an alibi i was watching television ive got the dish maybe theres some way they can verify that i was using it hardy made a note decided to leave the topic for one that was potentially even more explosive okay catherine this one youre really not going to like did you come on in any way to inspector cuneo her jaw clamped down tight no i did not because hes going to say you did yes i suppose he will and you did nothing that he might have construed as some kind of sexual advance dismas please he held up his hands ive got to ask it wouldnt be very much fun if he had something that he dropped at trial lets not say trial yet all right she shook her head but no there was nothing because from what im hearing tonight he cant have much of a case unless he finds something like gasoline or gunshot residue on your clothes which isnt going to happen is it no okay then so whats probably happening is exactly what you said that he heard about your accusation of sexual harassment but i didnt file anything i didnt do anything with it yes you did you told his boss cuneo looks like a horses ass and maybe worse so now he serves the search warrant on you as a pure hassle telling you that in spite of you going over his head he hasnt been pulled from the case hes still got his mojo working and youd better not say anything else against him she considered that for a long moment well in a way its almost good news i suppose she said it means they dont really think i killed paul theyre just mad at me that may be true hardy said but dont underestimate how unpleasant cops can make your life if theyre mad at you well im not going to talk about the harassment anymore hell see he made his point and just leave me alone lets hope hardy said lets hope at a little after nine the next morning the extended glitsky family was sitting in bright sunshine at one of the six outdoor tables on the sidewalk in front of leos beans leaves a thirtyyearold familyrun tea and coffee shopdelicatessen at the highest point of fillmore street just before it fell precipitously down to the marina abe and treya were splitting a smoked salmon quiche drinking tea while rachel was happily consumed with negotiating a toasted bagel and some slices of lox from the knee of her grandfather nat who was trying to lecture his son abraham listen to what you say yourself and you have your answer you are the deputy chief of inspectors this cuneo putz is an inspector which puts him under you am i right technically nat was closing in on eighty years old but his mind was sharp enough that already this morning he had com pleted the sunday new york times crossword puzzle he gave treya a conspiratorial glance so technically he gives me then to abe whats to be technical about take him off the case how am i supposed to do that dad what this is a mystery youve got rank and the mayor on your side you just do it and why because i dont like him a shrug theres worse reasons i can tell you if all else fails treya jumped in to her husbands defense but abe cant do it without cause nat she said hed have to bring charges of obstruction or even of insubordination against him or the sex stuff how about that that too she said if he had any proof although since our witnessor should i now say suspectdeclined to file a complaint glitsky put in proof is not forthcoming he took a bite of quiche and washed it down anyway even saying that i do show cause and try to get him busted off the case hell just grieve it with the p oathe policemens unionand probably win seeing that it was his case to begin with and im the interloper thats how the unions going to see it i guarantee heres a good cop minding his own business doing his job according to the book and suddenly the brass shows up no doubt going political he shrugged you see where this is going but it makes no sense nat said okay treya said and your point is that was my point its all backwards dad youve got to catch up with the times making sense is a lowpriority item the citys got way more important things to worry about than making sense nat came back at his son so youre saying youve got to work with him cuneo no not really ive tried that he seems to have rejected it so whats that leave you quit the case cant do that either so so i play his game which is ignore the other guy i go about my business i gather evidence pursue leads i investigate maybe find something he missed i wouldnt be surprised treya said if hes missing the boat entirely glitsky drank tea and nodded that would be sweet and wouldnt shock me either but he obviously got a warrant pulled so he got enough to convince a judge in any event hes in a hurry to cut me out moving fast and maybe loose and the evidence might not back him up as far as i know hes not even aware of towhold or hanovers other business or even the other family members theres just a lot out there and cuneos only looking at one part of it and one that just more or less fell into his hands on top of that usually it doesnt work that way it was glitskys first time in the mayors private residence an east coaststyle fourstory brownstone a few blocks down from the crest of nob hill in the neighborhood of grace cathedral the fairmont and mark hopkins hotels hed called kathy west and asked if he could drop by for a few minutes so she was expecting him and answered the door herself she wore a light yellow nononsense blouse and a skirt of stylish brown tweed and low heels and glitsky had the impression that she was planning to go out shortly to another of the endless appearances that seemed to make up her life after greeting him cordially she led him through the house and outside to a nicesized garden and patio of red brick with a circular table and umbrella a small fountain bubbling up out of a welltended flower bed a hot tub and a large builtin barbecue surrounding homes the same height as the mayors lent to the place a refined feeling of privacy while a corridor through the adjacent backyards let the sunshine in the mayor took a chair at the table and motioned for glitsky to do the same which hed barely accomplished before she flashed a professional smile and began i must say abe i was surprised and impressed to get your call on a sunday morning youre not taking a day of rest well some things have come up he started in with cuneo with catherine hanovers allegation of his sexual harassment the search warrant when he finished west came forward in her crisp manner her legs crossed her hands tightly clasped in her lap why wouldnt this woman file a complaint do you think he did harass her i have no way of knowing hes been known to hit on witnesses in other cases but thats not necessarily proof of anything in this one she cocked her head to one side it isnt unfortunately technically legally no thats funny a history like that seems somewhat persuasive to me glitsky allowed a ghost of a smile well the hanover woman isnt pursuing it so its a nonissue my concern and what i wanted to talk to you about is that i dont step on his investigation if he is in fact on to something and how would you do that a dozen ways really closing in on a suspect is kind of a carefully orchestrated ballet and i dont want to spook his witnesses if hes already got them talking so basically what youre saying is hes cutting you out he nodded of course i could make a stink pull rank all that nonsense but all that would do is stop the investigation now glitsky shrugged its entirely possible hes got her and she did it which is what you wanted my question is how hard do you want me to push to stay in west frowned scratched at the fabric of her skirt id just like to be sure she said glitsky moved his chair slightly into the shade of the umbrella then sat back in a casual attitude which was nothing like how he felt it was time to call the mayors bluff do you want to tell me why again the real reason her chin came up she blinked rapidly three or four times what do you mean he held her gaze i think you know what i mean he used her name on purpose kathy she looked away staring into some empty space over his shoulder no i dont really i dont okay maybe i can help you glitsky spoke quietly his face locked down youre afraid that paul hanover might have been a warning to you and if he was you dont want to misconstrue it she sat stock still for a long moment then some tension went out of her she almost seemed to smile frank batiste was right she said you are good she drew in a breath it started just after i got elected with harlan she didnt have to explain to glitsky whom she meant harlan fisk was her nephew an overweight often jovial supremely political animal whod worked for a time as an inspector under glitsky in homicide and who now was one of the citys eleven supervisors harlans connected to this no not directly anyway but when towhold saw how the wind was blowing with me they offered him a job security director glitsky almost laughed but he didnt think this was funny because hed been a cop partly mostly i think because were related and they thought he could influence me what does the security director of towhold do exactly glitsky asked this brought a prim smile to the mayors mouth in theory he coordinates the offduty regular city officers and the rentacop staff that guard the lots in practice not much in spite of which it pays pretty well the smile was gone in case you were wondering a hundred and forty thousand dollars it was a bribe plain and simple west went on harlan turned them down flat said he didnt want any part of it so then they went to hanover west nodded heim talking about paul now paul told me hed had threats but that he didnt put any stock in them they came with the territory he said happened all the time nothing to worry about then when she wound down and stopped i didnt know how to handle it abe im sorry i didnt mean to be underhanded or duplicitous with you but i didnt know what to do i still dont im afraid if you must know the truth and you know a mayorparticularly a woman mayorcant appear to be afraid venal petty selfish arrogant anything else but not that glitsky clipped off his words you could have just asked me directly i didnt know how to do that youre rather famously nonpolitical and i didnt want to contaminate you she held a hand up im not flattering you you wouldnt have even started if youd thought this was all just about politics if its any consolation i didnt know myself exactly what i expected you to do he hesitated then said you should know that ive already talked to nils granat even in the warm morning she suppressed a shiver its all so nebulous she said on the one hand i cant imagine its real that someone would kill a wonderful man like paul hanover over a business deal on the other if they could do that glitsky had spent a lot of time and energy on this already all of it under false pretenses and realizing that put him in a cold fury his patiencealways thin under the best conditionswas gone he wasnt in the mood for her conjectures he cut off her excuse me he said but what do you want me to do now thats the question leave it to cuneo wests eyes went up she drew a quick breath thats the other thing what is inspector cuneo you know that hundredandfortythousanddollar job i told you about with towhold hardly able to credit what he was hearing glitsky squinted into the sun cuneos up for it he said his voice rang hollow in his ears wests shoulders sagged its a lot more than cops make even inspectors as you know she said when harlan turned it down word got out that the position was there and several policemen applied ive seen the list and cuneos one of them of course therell be no job for anyone if bayshore gets the contract but but cuneos not going to investigate them for these murders no matter what thats your point thats right so you want me to keep looking i think its the only way we may get to the truth dont you think unless it comes out at the trial what trial catherine hanovers west sighed again i dont believe it will come to that abe and certainly not if shes innocent certainly not why not wests expression of surprise was he thought like the mastercard commercialpriceless well theyll find out before they get that far im sure there was no point in arguing glitsky stood up in the event they dont though west stood too moved a step toward him put a hand on his arm whatever you can do abe she said with great if unintentional ambiguity id really appreciate it if you stayed involved he bit back his first three responses all inappropriate this was after all the political leader of san francisco he mustered a salute unintentionally if anything is truly unintentional his words came out as ambiguous as hers had been ill see what i can do he said the picture of catherine hanover that cuneo had snapped when shed gone out to get her newspaper on saturday morning turned out to be a good likeness hed used his mm canon with an excellent closeup lens and good color film and had snapped seven shots in rapid succession then printed them out in eightbyten format in the one he liked the most she was looking directly at him so much so that he wondered if shed in fact seen him but her reaction of absolute shock when hed knocked at her door fifteen minutes later with the warrant had been he was sure completely genuine shed had no clue what he liked about the picture wasnt merely how good she lookedno surprise since catherine hanover seemed to get more attractive with every sightingbut that the angle was so very close to the one in the newspaper picture of missy damiens that hed been showing around not only that missys hair had been up in an elegant coif and catherine obviously and recently postshower had hers wrapped in a towel so nothing blocked the contours of either face the biggest difference was that missy was smiling at a party and catherines expression was inward she was nearly frowning when he had first put the two pictures together they confirmed what hed noticed from the first time hed seen the missy photo the two women werent close enough in looks to be identical twins of course but the similarity between them was marked they could easily have been sisters both had high broad foreheads strong chins and noses welldefined cheekbones both had a nearidentical widows peak at the hairline maxine and joseph willis sat with cuneo at around noon at the back of their house this time under the strong light in the kitchen they were looking at both of the pictures now side by side in silence after a half minute or so maxine raised her head and said to cuneo youre bouncing the table inspector if youre impatient maybe youd like to walk around while we look the identification issue and the couples disagreements over it sat at the table with them all like an unwelcome guest cuneo was inclined to let them take whatever time they needed but it was difficult for him not to move while he waited after maxine spoke to him he asked if he could get a glass of water and so he was over by the sink when joseph turned in his chair and said if i had to swear id say it was missy this was not what cuneo had been hoping to hear but now maxinewhod at first been so certain that the woman shed seen had been missywas shaking her head from side to side you dont agree mrs willis cuneo asked he was back at the table with his glass of water pulling up his chair again she reached out and put her index finger on the color picture of catherine i know ive seen this girl before she said you look again joseph the small man drew the photo back directly in front of him and stared down at it joseph clearly didnt want to discuss this with his wife any longer now she was saying wasnt shethat it had not been missy damiens on last wednesday and more that the person theyd both seen had been the woman in this other picture joseph in his heart wasnt completely certain that it had been either of them if the truth be known joseph hadnt been looking too carefully at the womans face at all hed assumed it was his attractive neighbor whose walk hed often admired but this time hed been more drawn to the womans generous bosom that and not her face at all was the reason hed entertained his doubts over whether the woman had been missy damiens shed just seemed well bigger as for the face he couldnt swear that hed even glanced at it now he looked up at cuneo im going to let my bride here make the call on this one inspector she knows very well who she saw if she says its this woman in the color picture that we saw last wednesday then thats who it was as advertised jeffie from the valero station was working on sunday manning the cash register cuneo had learned from his earlier experience with the willises and this time only brought the picture of catherine hanover in with him jeffie didnt have to look for very long yep he said she the one coming out to the living room from the back half of the duplex treya glitsky sagged against the doorway to the kitchen okay shes down finally getting around to reading the sunday chronicle glitsky sat sideways in the leather love seat by their front windows which hed opened to let in the fresh air it was early afternoon and sunlight spilled over him the tone in his wifes voice sparked concern and he put his section down started to rise are you all right she nodded wearily then barely lifted a hand motioning for him to stay seated thank god she still takes her nap i hear you but you dont look too good i dont feel too good she closed her eyes for a moment i know its unusual but would you mind terribly if i just took a minute and lay down for a while i dont mean to be boring but its like somebody suddenly just pulled the plug i dont know what it is i can guess you think the pregnancy he shrugged its pretty normal isnt it she let out a deep breath fatigue all over her not for me i never got any kind of morning sickness or anything with raney or rachel neither of them so this ones different he pointed go sleep she dropped her head and sighed but didnt move wake me up when she does no promises do you want me to carry you in no really i just need a couple of minutes okay go then he got up and walked across to her she was standing with her eyes closed all but asleep on her feet peeling her off the doorpost he put his arm around her im sorry she mumbled im just so tired five minutes later she was covered up in their darkened bedroom glitsky closed the door to the hallway and returned to the living room there he took a few steps toward his paper but stopped as though some physical force had restrained his movement he stood in the center of the room hands at his sides closing his eyes he let out a stream of air and realized that hed been holding his breath he wasnt aware of any noise even from the street through the open windows he drew another deep breath another closed his eyes again perhaps a minute passed in the house all was sundayafternoon stillness when he opened his eyes the rectangle of sunlight had grown and it now covered the whole love seat and a few inches of floor he realized that incredibly for san francisco it was almost uncomfortably warm in the room he walked to the front door and opened it for some crossventilation then went to the refrigerator took out a bottle of iced tea and drank half of it down in a gulp what had been his sons rooms when theyd lived with him were down a hall behind the kitchen on the opposite side of the duplex from his own bedroom now his youngest boy orels old room was rachels and at her door glitsky turned the knob gently and went to stand over her bedstill a crib really with the bars up she was sleeping soundly sprawled on her back her breathing regular and deep and he couldnt resist putting his palm down flat over her chest she didnt stir he felt a vibration at his belt someone paging him the number wasnt immediately familiar and his initial reaction was to ignore it go finish reading the sunday paper maybe let himself doze off like the rest of the world instead in the kitchen he picked up the wall phones receiver and punched in the number hello this is abe glitsky you just paged me who is this dan cuneo we need to talk about catherine hanover assistant da chris rosen didnt mind being bothered about work at home on a sunday night least of all by a homicide inspector with a big case he lived in a small standalone bungalow in the flats of emeryville across the bay from san francisco not more than six miles from cuneos place in alameda the inspectors long day in the city had come to an end and the two men decided theyd meet up at the bar of spengers fish grotto just off the freeway in berkeley they arrived almost simultaneously by the time they got their drinksthe place was packed and it took a while cuneo had brought him pretty much uptodate three witnesses had definitively identified catherine hanover from her picture as the woman whod purchased the valero gasoline in a portable container and left the hanover house about a half hour before the fire cuneo had taken the rug sample from the back of catherine hanovers car directly to arnie becker since the regular police lab probably wouldnt be able to get to it within a week becker had ready access to the fire departments own mass spectrometer and yes in fact the gasoline in her trunk was valero the same brand that had started the fire hed luminoled the pants from her closet himself and though hed found no evidence of blood spatter hed dropped the clothes at the police lab and was hoping theyd find something useful throughout this recital rosen sipped his scotch and said nothing after cuneo stopped he signaled the waitress for another round for both of them and said dont get me wrong dan theres nothing id like more than to be able to move on this but youve got to admit that you dont have much in the way of evidence cuneo was ready for this i didnt expect much the fire burned it all up but she denies being near hanovers house when one of my witnesses put her there same day she got the gas around the corner she did it chris i swear to god im not saying i dont believe you he centered his empty glass on his napkin last time you mentioned a motive but we didnt get to it cuneo spent a little time spinning it out aside from his work on the warrant and this mornings identifications in the past two days hed spoken to all the other members of paul hanovers nuclear family except catherines husband and no one denied that his coming marriage to missy damiens and the possible change to the inheritance was a very big concern to all of them what set catherine apart from her other relatives was the fact that shed gone to pauls that day to have it out with him her own words from the first night i talked to her at the firehave it out one sister and the motherinlaw both had heard her say it and now we know she was at the house not just in the afternoon when she admitted it but later just before the fire anybody see her walk in there with the gas not yet no or walk out with it she left it in the house arnie beckers got the container with the other stuff from the house down at the station one of an arson inspectors most tedious yet most important jobs after a fire was to go through the ash and debris in a three or fourfoot radius around a body and sort everythingthe burned and destroyed remains of furniture floors walls clothing appliances knickknacks jewelryuntil they had identified every item down to the size of a match head to see if any of it might be relevant to their investigation no prints if thats what you were thinking hoping rosen frowned anything else yeah the day after the fire after wed had this talk at the scene wait a minute she was at the fire itself im not sure i realized that thats when i first talked to her okay go on so she tells methis is at the fire nowthat shed heard that paul and missy had been fighting setting it up for the murdersuicide story then next day i go to talk to her at her house and by now she realizes that weve ruled that out not only that the other stuff she told me shes implicated herself and she knows i know it so what does she do tell me calls glitskyyou know glitsky deputy chief anyway she calls him and says i sexually harassed her he held up a hand the answer is no not a chance but she told glitsky she didnt want to talk to me anymore so after glitsky stopped laughing what did he tell her well wait this is getting to the good part their drinks arrived and both men lifted their glasses glitsky comes and tells me that from now on hes on the case with me what you mean personally personally the mayor asked him now cuneo had rosens complete attention what why a nod it gives one pause doesnt it so he says from now on hell be questioning catherine hanover hes trying to protect me from the sex charge so she filed funny thing she decided not to cuneo drank again wait it gets better weve got glitsky and kathy west somehow connected to catherine right so now im starting to wonder theyre pulling me off when she looks good to me i come to you on friday get the warrant this weekend do some digging finally couple of hours ago i call glitsky to keep him in the loop as hes requested i tell him what i got the fucking gasoline the motive two positive ids catherines lying about where she was and when shes it i say we ought to bring it to you and get her in the grand jury before she blows town and what was his response bad idea he says too soon we really dont have anything on her he says theres still a lot of questions we dont want to rush to judgment plus and we should know this this is really my favorite what she hired herself a lawyer you know dismas hardy the name yeah well guess what hes glitskys pal they used to be cops together he finished his drink and leaned back in satisfaction tapping his toes to beat the band what weve got here chris isnt just a sweet little double murder theres some major conspiracy going on with these guys going all the way up to the mayor this city is lousy with politics and these guys are smackdab in the middle of it and you want my opinion just between us it doesnt start here with hanover im betting it started back before barry gerson got killed you mean lieutenant gerson my old boss yeah and a great guy i thought wasnt he killed at some shootout i thought it was some russian gang thing maybe thats what they want you to believe but the whole mess wasnt ever really investigated not carefully enough anyway and heres a factoid for youone of the guys killed in the shootout with gerson was a guy named john holiday wanted for murder at the time and guess who his attorney was got to be hardy cuneo made a gun with his fingers pointed it at rosen and pulled the trigger he and glitsky both were all over that holiday case its ugly as shit chris so how does catherine hanover fit in or paul i dont know yet but ill tell you one thing she did him he tipped up his glass and drank off the whole thing eyes shining he came forward in his chair this is the biggest case youre ever going to be part of and weve got to get this damned woman locked up before the whole thing blows away in the dust because believe me these people can make it happen as soon as hardys children were out the door to school on monday morning he and frannie unplugged the main telephone jack turned off their own cell phones and repaired upstairs to their bedroom an hour later hardy climbed the stairs again this time bearing two fresh cups of coffee it occurs to me he said that carrying hot coffee in a state of undress might not be wise no risk no reward frannie said besides its a good fantasy moment being waited on by a naked slave and all he bowed from the waist your servant madam handing her a mug he slid in beside her pulled a sheet over himself your fantasy slave looks like me who else would he look like i dont know brad pitt maybe whos that new guy rebecca loves orlando bloom yeah him hes not that new but why would i want either of them well were talking fantasy right your average fiftysomething lawyer isnt exactly fantasy material whos talking average she lifted the sheet away looked him up and down yep works for me just did in fact plus the coffees perfect thank you brad and orlando those other guys theyd probably burn it or something she took another sip so speaking of fantasies what she gave him a dontkidme look have you decided what youre going to do with catherine well first catherine is not my fantasy youre my fantasy all right but you have to say that i dont have to say anything like that but i just did so if you didnt youd be in trouble that doesnt mean i dont mean it seriously you dont think this is a fantasy monday morning nobody home but us up here alone taking time out on a workday to make love do you know what wed have done for this moment even a couple of years ago probably killed small cute furry animals at least but you still havent told me about catherine thats because truly i havent decided the main thing is i dont think its likely theyre going to charge her cuneos just rattling her cage but if they do charge her he turned to her i wouldnt take it if it would make you uncomfortable its not just me theres this whole cuneo thing i know abes definitely worried but abe worries for a hobby okay but hes got a reason this time cuneo could make a big mess for both of you if anything about that day ever comes out actually hardy said thats one of the reasons the nasty side of me is almost hoping they go ahead and charge her and try to make a case with this lousy evidence what reason is that cuneo unless he strikes goldor hanovers blood on catherines stuffhes got a weak case hes rushing in on abe says hes a sloppy investigator thats just who he is so depending on how fast and loose he decides to play give me a chance to get him on a witness stand and ill bet i can do some serious damage to his basic credibility as a cop at least enough so nobody would be inclined to go on a wild goose chase after me and abe on his sayso id almost look forward to the chance frannie sipped at her coffee ifyou turned her down how much would it cost the firm hardy considered for a minute highprofile murder trial three to five hundred thousand maybe more plus maybe referrals so do you want to do it were not there yet maybe we wont get there but really as i said if youve got a problem with it then im an insecure bitch not at all its completely legitimate that youd be uncomfortable me and catherine went together for three years thats a significant chunk of time obviously as ive already told you theres still a connection therell always be some connection and shes still attractive not a question he nodded shes very goodlooking but you know weve already done the fantasy thing with you and me this morning im yours youre mine like that yes but heres a case where you can help someone you care about who you think is probably innocent and make half a million or more dollars in the bargain and at the same time youd get to professionally destroy someone whos out to get you and abe how can i ask you not to take it hardy put his coffee cup down reached over and pulled his wife close against him you say diz id just prefer you let someone else take this one im not going to do that well that is your decision flaversham hardy quoting a longtime household favorite line from disneys the great mouse detective and i havent made my own decision yet either you cant turn her down if she needs you somebody else could defend her but who as well as you well but between us frannie added cutting him off it is a little scary just off the main lobby in hardys sutter street offices the solarium conference room contained a pronision of greeneryrubber trees ferns dieffenbachia one of the associates had even brought a redwood tree in a twohundredgallon pot thriving its trunk was a foot thick and its boughs scraped the glass ceiling now after he and frannie had continued their morning date with an early lunch cell phones off at petit robert hardy sat in one of the sixteen chairs that surrounded the immense mahogany table in the center of the room waiting for him on his arrival at the office were three urgent calls from catherine hanoverthe first when the police had come early in the morning to serve a subpoena for her to appear tomorrow to testify in front of the grand jury the second when cuneo had arrived personally to deliver another search warrant at her house and the third in a barely controlled i need help right now hysteria similar in tone to the first call hed gotten from her on saturday night he called her right back and told her to get down to the office as soon as she could she was barely coherent her voice had been choked and hoarseim sorry i cant seem to stop crying hanging up he put in a call to abes pager he wondered what if anything had happened on sunday or maybe saturday with the results of the first search warrant had the lab in fact uncovered significant evidence clear on what he next wanted to do hardy forced himself to take a moment before he did it every action he took now as catherines de facto lawyer moved him closer to the decision he hadnt yet consciously made but at each small incremental step he didnt seem to be able to stop himself of course he would call catherine back after her three urgent calls what else could he do of course he would page glitsky and try to discover what the police had come up with on some level he felt he didnt really have a choice but up until now his moves had been small and personal what he contemplated next was larger and more public he wanted more certainty about his commitment before he moved whether it was more hangover from the guilt hed felt at the way hed had to drop her so long ago or a testament to the bond theyd once forged together he couldnt deny that between him and catherine there remained a strong personal connection theyd come of age in the same cultureit had been immediately clear to hardy on saturday night at her house when theyd easily fallen into a comfortable familiarity even with the hard questions the plain fact was that shed been his first love and the person hed become could not bring himself to abandon her when she needed him so badly even as he recognized that she mighthe told himself it was an infinitesimally small chanceeven now be playing him because she knew she could but that he told himself was her fate her karma hardy himself had no choice but to be true to his own character and to trust that she would not betray him finally telling phyllis to interrupt him if glitsky called he rang up the district attorneys office where he talked to the relatively new chief assistant district attorney craig bellarios about the grand jury subpoena there was really only one question hardy needed to have answered and that was whether his clienthis clientwas considered a target of the investigation ie a suspect as opposed to a witness bellarios who didnt know hardy very well wasnt the most forthcoming man on the planet he told hardy that he couldnt predict what the grand jury would do and that it was always wise to be prepared for any eventuality thanking him for nothing hardy asked and did learn the name of the presenting prosecutorchris rosenand called him next but he was out he sensed a stonewall and it tightened his stomach if things had gotten to this juncture already he had no choice but to tell catherine to plead the fifth amendment before the grand jury and to refuse to talk anymore to the police and in the terrible catch of the legal game once she adopted that strategy though technically shed still be a witness in the eyes of the prosecution she would have moved a long way toward becoming the target of the investigation now with his legal pad and another cup of coffee on the table in front of him hardy was cramming with a singleminded attention reviewing all the notes hed taken at catherines on saturday night feeling her presence as soon as she entered the lobby he looked up stood and walked over to the solarium door catherine if shed been crying there was no sign of it anymore other than maybe an added luminosity to her eyes she wore a welltailored khakicolored pantsuit hardy was thinking that he was glad shed chosen demure even as she turned toward him to reveal a light tangerine garment with a lace top a sweep of decolletage underneath the jacket an elegant chain of malachite beads encircled her neck and rested in the deep hollow of her chest he realized that shed had her breasts enlarged but hed hardly digested these impressions when she stepped into his arms vaguely aware of the stares of phyllis and norma the office manager and a pair of paralegals who had stopped at the reception area for something hardy held her against him for the briefest of seconds then turned to the gathered multitudes and introduced her all business as an old friend and new client a new client back in the solarium they got seated and hardy asked if he could see the subpoena you got this this morning seven oclock i was hardly out of bed theyre still hassling you i thought so too and theyre doing another search is that unusual he didnt answer that one instead he asked when did they do this the search at seven too no nine or so they were separate cuneo was with the second bunch i called you again i had business this morning hardy said i called back as soon as i got in was glitsky with the search team this time i dont think so ive never met him but im sure that wasnt the other name i would have remembered so what were they looking for this time i dont know everything i think they went upstairs and just started in hiding his exasperation hardy smiled helpfully they list specifics on the warrant did they show that to you no what about your husband wasnt he there did he ask to see the warrant by any chance she looked down scratched at the fabric of her pants wills taken a she stopped hes not home right now hardy waited after a minute she wiped an eye with her finger then the other one reaching down she opened her purse and removed a small package of kleenex brought one of the tissues up to her face this is anger not sadness she dabbed at her eyes some more sniffed once clenched the kleenex in her fist he started having another affair she said without looking at him the son of a bitch hardy said the first thing that came to his mind so he wasnt fishing last wednesday she kept her eyes straight in front of her he was in southern california though thats where they met up on the same goddamn boat as the last one finally she cast a sidelong glance at him im sorry about the language and i didnt mean to lie to you about will and me the other night again a labored breath anyway after you left on saturday it blew up he made some smartass remark about you and me you and me all the time we spent talking just making it sound sleazy i was there as your lawyer catherine hardy didnt like being cast as the wedge between wife and husband but he immediately regretted referring to himself as her lawyer it seemed to be another irrevocable step of course you were what else could you be but you have to know will as though he needed a real reason to pick a fight anyway he was slandering you too and i just thought how dare he and lost it i threw him out he thought you didnt know about the affair he must have thought i was an idiot he even wanted to to have sex with me when he got home maybe so i wouldnt suspect hed been rutting around for four days the bastard a bitter little sound escaped i thought if i could avoid bringing it up it might stay hidden from the kids i used to hope i could hold out until heather went to college then i could file for divorce the kids wouldnt really be in our lives as much so it would be easier this last time though last week i realized i couldnt do that anymore i couldnt go on that way but i still hadnt really decided you know decided what exactly when id call him on it move out or have him do it bring it to a head i didnt want it to just happen the way it did i wanted to control the timing at least now im just feeling so ashamed of myself for what she turned in her chair and faced him dont you see for ruining our home life bringing it out into the open she shrugged but something just snapped maybe its all this being a suspect if your husband was having an affair how was it that you ruined your home life i know its stupid but its how i feel if i were a stronger person i could have kept pretendingshe motioned around the room ambiguouslyexcept for all this and seeing you in some way remembering how good you were how sweet a relationship could be it all broke me down im sorry if i had a role in it i wouldnt have come over if no no it was going to happen sometime hardy let a moment pass then said so thats why you went to your fatherinlaws to talk about this wills affair she couldnt hide her startled expression why do you assume that because thats what changed catherine youre going about your normal life and your husband goes off with another woman youre going to do something im glad you didnt decide to follow him down and kill him the thought crossed my mind lets keep that between us okay she found half a smile i wouldnt have killed him dismas or his father either hardys antennae were all the way up without a conscious thought he noted her use of the subjunctive and wondered if shed done it on purpose she wouldnt have killed paul except for and then something happened and shed had to it was only a small feat of mental legerdemain a child hardy thought could do it and they often did at the same time part of him hated himself for realizing the fundamental truth that while what shed just said sounded like an absolute denial of her guilt in fact it was not as a good jesuittrained former catholic hardy was often able to argue himself into a state of tolerable comfort in the outer reaches of moral ambiguity and he knew that catherines education with the mercy nuns had trained her in the same way hell shed been the acknowledged masterit was the thing he could never beat her at and so now he also knew enough not to ask her for clarification it would only complicate things down the line all this in the blink of an eye he asked her so what did you want to ask him paul i mean the same thing i said last time dismas i wanted to know what was going to happen to the money she threw him a glance that he couldnt read he was going to marry missy in the fall and change his will to make her his beneficiary maybe hed leave a few thousand dollars to each of his grandchildren that was it they werent doing a prenup why not did he say because missy wasnt out for his money and paul resented the hell out of his family for implying that she was in fact before the family had started the campaign as he called it hed been inclined to set up trusts for the kids and all that but then will and beth and theresa especially wouldnt let it go and the blind greed of it he said made him sick his kids and their families were getting along just fine and missy had had a tremendously difficult life we had no idea now it was her turn for comfort and security and he was going to give it to her and too bad if we didnt like it that sounds harsh she lifted her shoulders it didnt when he said it though he was a straight shooter hed worked hard to get his kids set on their way now they should do the same with theirs so where did that leave you did you tell him about will i didnt need to she looked away he seemed to know yes to have known you mean about wills other affairs she nodded anyway he gave me what id come to find out and what did that mean to you she worried her lower lip i wanted to know where i stood i know it sounds mercenary but id already endured more than a few rather difficult years with will if it looked like he was going to inherit several million dollars she stopped unwilling to enunciate it you might try to endure a few more she scratched at her pants again i admit it sounds awful she raised her eyes to his but if there wasnt ever going to be a windfall if he signed it all over to her you might as well leave him now she bowed her head in tacit agreement i needed to know my options dismas then i hate him outside the solariums glass walls a tiny parklike area a hundred or so square feet of open space tucked between the buildings held a concrete bench that the associates had chipped in for in memory of david freeman hardy spent a minute watching a few sparrows pecking around in the decomposed granite finally he came back to her had he changed his will he was going to oh my god her hand went to her mouth the will what thats today bob townshends office was on the same twentieth floor as paul hanovers in the bank of america building its great windows afforded a stunning view of the city spread out below with the sunlight glinting on the bay far off the golden gate bridge standing sentinel over the entrance to the harbor and closer in the spires of the churches in north beach none of the hanover relatives seated in front of townshends ultramodern chromeandglass desk paid it the slightest attention theresa hanover sat in the third chair from the right in the row of seven that townshend had set up for the reading of the will will hanover sat in the center chair next to his mother the chair next to him was empty and beyond that to his left sat mary and carlos on the other side of theresa were beth and her attorney husband aaron townshend had finally put down his coffee cup and saucer at the service table against the inside wall and had come around to claim his seat behind the desk florid and overweight townshendunlike his partner paul hanoverhad never been comfortable interacting with actual living people he enjoyed numbers and games and legal puzzles he was also an excellent legal writer and a whiz at business strategy which made him an invaluable partner to hanover but dealing with humans in the flesh was for him always a bit of a strain and never more than at a moment like this one when things werent going according to protocol hed scheduled the reading of paul hanovers will for one oclock and now it was nearly two and still no signnot even a phone callfrom catherine hanover neither had she returned any of the several calls hed made to her home or to her cell phone there was nothing absolutely critical about her attendance of course her husband was here representing the family and that was enough but even with his limited sensitivity to human emotions townshend sensed a tension in the groupespecially between will and his motherthat in turn made him nervous now he checked his watch for the twentieth time ran a finger under his very tight shirt collar cleared his throat over an hour ago hed gone to his safe and removed the sealed last will testament of paul hanover and placed it exactly in the center of his desk now he pulled the package toward him well then if were all in agreement lord bob weve waited long enough theresa said for some reason that i cant fathom or imagine catherine has decided she isnt coming but her presence one way or the other doesnt make any difference anyway so lets get this show on the road mary holding her silent carloss hand spoke up in her timid voice isnt anybody else worried about her will shot a glance across his mother at his younger sister im sure its something with school and the kids he said easily its always school and the kids you know that more important than anything else but youd think this aaron began will cut him off she knows its going to be what its going to be her being here isnt going to change anything bob theresa at the end ofpatience used her most dismissive tone either you open that damned folder or im going to take it from you and read it myself mom beth said you dont have to be so difficult theresa whirled on her elder daughter her tone sharp and angry dont you talk to me about difficult young lady im the one who knows how difficult it can be going it alone in this world and im the one who wants to be sure that my grandchildren dont have to find out what thats like thats why im here and thats the only reason im here i doubt if your father left me a dime she came back front to townshend bob now please with a last look at catherines empty chair he sighed and carefully unsealed the envelope she called from here hardy said and theyd just read it and he stops glitsky grumbled half to himself youre going to make me guess he stood by one of the windows in hardys office studying the traffic patternsunmovingon sutter street below it was five thirty still light out still sunny of course not ill tell you hardy had his feet up on his desk if you just ask me politely ill tell you all right glitsky took his hand off the window shade half turned to face his friend im asking come on abe just say tell me about the will glitsky threw his eyes to the ceiling summoning all of his endurance he sighed heavily okay he said tell me about the will hardy shot back say please i dont think so shaking his head in disgust glitsky started walking over to the cherry cabinet where hardy kept his darts glitsky hadnt stolen hardys darts in nearly six months now and when hed come in hed been thinking that it was getting to be about that time again if his friend happened to leave the room if you just say please hardy was grinning broadlyi promise ill tell you glitsky got to the cabinet and opened up the side doors to reveal the black yellow red and green professional dartboard within hardys three custom tungsten darts were hanging in their little holders blue flights attached glitsky pulled them and without a glance at hardy walked to the darkwood line in the light hardwood floor that had been inset seven feet nine and onequarter inches from the face of the board turning he fired the first dart and hit a double bullseye smack in the center of the board he turned around again and put the two other darts on hardys desk all right hardy said bullseye counts as a please he eyed the darts looked up at glitsky hanover hadnt changed the will missy wasnt mentioned all the money went to the family how much well hardy pulled his feet offthe desk and grabbed the darts its complicated with the property and investments and various other liquidatable assets liquidatable good word abe said thank you hardy was now around the desk and standing at the throw line but the best ballpark estimate looks like its going to come out at something like seventeen eighteen million he threw the dart then the next one in rapid succession two twenties he leaned back against his desk which of course isnt the best news in the world for catherine or any of them glitsky said if they didnt all have alibis which cuneo says they do except the exwife theresa maybe its nobody in the family are you getting anything on towhold glitsky shook his head i talked to a lot of people harlan fisk granat again went down to the corporate office in san bruno swell group of folks nothing now he pushed himself against the back cushion and ran both hands over his buzz cut i know im a cop and ought to be glad weve got a suspect but i dont want to think cuneo has got this one right catherine doesnt feel right hasnt from the beginning i love when you say that hardy said in truth though he was far from sanguine he flatly didnt believe despite her lowkey and selfeffacing protestations to the contraryi am so scattered lately i think all this stress must be eating my brain cellsthat catherine had simply forgotten that the reading of the will was going to be today she could have told him she didnt want to be in the same room as her husband and okay he could have possibly accepted that but even with the distractions of a spouses affair a subpoena to testify before the grand jury and a police search of her house in progress hardy had to believe that your average person would probably remember that this was the day you found out if you were a millionaire or not sitting on his desk the darts stuck in the board and forgotten hardy laid all of this out she didnt forget that today was the reading of the will i promise you glitsky whod settled on the first couple of inches of the couch listened without interruption and when hardy had finished said i admit its improbable so why would she pretend the drama of it she didnt really need to be at the reading did she her attendance wouldnt change anything but she could make me feel her urgency hook me into it so call her on it and let her go i know i know im tempted except what if she really did forget you just made a pretty good case that that wasnt likely no not likely but not impossible either absently he pulled the darts from the board again this is the kind of thing she always did to me it used to drive me crazy but at least it was never dull dull gets a bad rap give me dull anytime hardy broke a smile thats why you went into police work right for the slow times glitsky shrugged i was younger so was i i loved the mystery i thought it drove you crazy that too it was complicated in fact it was too complicated it was fucking exhausting which was why i gave it up you miss it not at all but here you are taking her on yeah a small silence settled at last hardy said shes not stupid abe theres no reason she would have given you her own motive except if she knew that thats exactly what id think the old doublereverse huh a shrug it happens and in the same general vein why wouldnt she file a complaint against cuneo if shed have filed the first time i talked to her i know but glitsky went ahead if shed done that end of story he was off the investigation against her but now it looks like she was trying to run him off with a bluff and why had she wanted to run him off because he was getting close and because she was guilty but hardy said i dont know why she didnt file a million reasons fear mostly then maybe embarrassment finally just hoping it would go away you know as well as i do glitsky had come forward to the front of the couch again elbows on his knees and hands clasped he let out a heavy breath you want my advice no youll just tell me i dont want to do this right so how do you propose i get out of it give her to somebody else its possible hardy shook his head not in real life it isnt i believe i can help her i know her i want to help her glitsky narrowed his eyes you believe her i think so im not sure which one right hardy shrugged i know on the basic questionis she a killerim with her other than that he let the sentence hang heres some good news though at least now i know shes got the money to pay me youre billing her then double homicide special circumstances im billing her trust me this seemed to give glitsky a little relief just making sure he said part two hardy awoke with a start sweat pouring off him not that it was warm in fact if anything it was unusually cold not only inside his bedroom but out in the terrible night it was the third week of january and the second full day of the arctic storm that was pounding at the bedroom windows shaking them with a low rumble he threw the covers off and sat up trying at once to remember and to banish the dream that had shaken him from his sleep reflexively he checked the clock on his nightstand the trial would start in under seven hours he had to get back to sleep he couldnt show up on the first day wiped out with fatigue there would be the gauntlet of reporters first of all not only the local channels but stringers for every station and cable outlet in the country had been parked in the back lot of the hall of justice for each of the motion hearingsto quash the warrant to exclude catherines statements to the cops admissibility for dismissaltheyd been there for all of them and theyd be there this morning too the judge had forbidden any communication with them but they could be relentless and he had to be sharp get back to sleep now the dream had been sexual that much he remembered he dreamed almost every night now and they were all sexual all mouths and legs switched identities all frustration and guilt and deceptionhis subconscious working overtime to process the conflicts and unacknowledged tensions to which he would give no assent in his daily life he wasnt in love with catherine hanover but there was no point in trying to deny the attraction he also ached at her plight at where her life had gotten to the physical chemistry between them had always been palpable as teenagers to their mutual pride confusion horror and shame theyd gone from untried virgins to lovers without any commitment or discussion on their third date the care they both took to avoid even the most innocuous and casual physical contact over the past months had been such a constant companion that it felt like a living thing in the visiting room with them shed been in jail for nearly eight months for a crime that with all his heart he wanted to believe shed not committed in that time the weak circumstantial case against herwhich nonetheless had been strong enough to persuade the grand jury to indict her for special circumstances double murderhad only grown stronger it hadnt helped either that with all the fanfare chris rosen had succumbed to his ambition and was now a widely rumored though unannounced candidate for district attorney in the next citywide election catherines own motherinlaw theresa had become the witness from hell dan cuneo had interviewed her for the better part of a week in the first flush of the indictment last may and shed done all she could to braid the rope that would hang her daughterinlaw according to theresa catherine had threatened to kill paul hanover and missy damiens not just once or twice it had been a running theme the threats were often given in front of her children and other members of the extended family catherines position was that this was just the way she talked when the family was gathered togethershe tended to be histrionic to exaggerate for effect and this hardy certainly knew to be true from his own experience from the beginning she knew she was unwelcome in the hanover family catherine felt that the only path to even modest acceptance within the family was to be entertaining a personality without a pedigree a past a bloodline it was all she had so yes shed often joked that they all really needed to get together and kill missy before the wedding though of course shed never meant it theyd all laughed they couldnt have believed she ever meant it beth thought the repetition ominous enough though all the kids considered it unimportant a joke her husband piled on as well in his statements to the police will denied that hed ever had an affair with anyone he had time cards from his secretary karyn harris the other woman catherine had suspected for the days when hed been fishing and the records showed that shed been at the office every one of those four days moreover the captain of the kingfisher morgan bayley swore that hed been out on the ocean the whole time with will but that their radio had been on the blink he had the radio repair records to prove it theyd also been out of the cellphone reception zone and hadnt been able to call anyone on shore will told hardy that his wife had always been jealous in the past couple of years shed become dangerously unstable in a number of waysaccusing him of adultery being just one of them shed also he said conceived either an affection for his father or a mania for his money there was a strong and in some ways almost uncanny resemblance between catherine and missy damiens remarked on by anyone who knew them bothand catherine seemed to believe that if missy could snag her very wealthy and charismatic fatherinlaw she could and should have done it herself she imagined that paul had propositioned her when shed first been married she should have gone with his father when she had the chance at the end will said that paul had told him that shed even come on to him and hed had to rebuff her finally she constantly berated will for his business failures his inability to adequately provide for his childrens education for his general lack of acumen and drivethis when he made what he called strong six figures per year hardy subpoenaed his tax recordshis top grossing year was when he had earned last year hed earned catherines response to all of these claims a curt dismissal a refusal to even discuss it hes delusional for the record the kids more or less sided with her but she was in jail and their dad was home fulltime paying her legal bills out of his fourmilliondollar inheritance peddling the line that he was on catherines side he wanted to help her he felt sorry for her she was sick but a good woman he would still love her and take her back if she ever got better he never not once came to visit her in jail then there was hanovers partner bob townshend who got a call from paul on the afternoon of the very day that he was killed catherine had just come to visit him and hed felt threatened she was near hysteria over the imagined infidelity of her husband she freaked when paul had told her that he was going to change his will in missys favor sooner rather than later townshend told hardy that paul had made an appointment for the following week to do just that hardy had fought the good fight to keep much of this testimony out of the trial but judge marian braun had taken it under submission and hardy couldnt shake the suspicion that she would let some if not most of it in braun herself was one of the worst possible choices of trial judge from hardys perspective only leo chomorro would have been worse as soon as shed been assigned he considered using his peremptory challengefor which no reason need be given and which cant be deniedto get braun off the case but then he stood the risk of drawing chomorro in fact he wouldnt put it past the master calendar to arrange to assign chomorro to punish him for his arrogance in the end hed kept her on there was more catherines alibi for the night of the murders had been blown by none other than her own youngest daughter heather who kept a diary that cuneo had discovered during his interview with her supposedly out having fast food for dinner with her brother and sister in fact shed had a ton of homework and shed had saul drop her off at the house and scrounged something to eat since neither her mom nor dad were home which was like getting to be the norm lately called on this catherine admitted to hardy that shed lied to him about that a low point to say the least catherine was sorry shed been trying to save face with him she didnt want him to know that she could be the kind of insecure snooping bitch who would actually go by the house of wills illicit paramour karyn harris to make sure she was still not home every day for four days and ms harris hadnt once been there hardy had subpoenaed the flight manifests of every airline that flew from any bay area airport to any southern california airport on the days in question no karyn harris the plain truth was that whether or not her husband had been having this alleged affair catherines alibi crashed further glitsky looking under rocks for other scenarios both because of his own agenda visavis cuneo and because of his work at the mayors request had come up empty the other dude play the argument that some mysterious other person had committed the crime was ever popular among defense attorneys indeed hardy had used it to good effect during other trials but if there was another dude in this case glitsky with the full weight of his position hadnt been able to unearth him the towhold people had lost their contract with the city in june and nobody else had died or had even caught a cold as far as hardy could tell the mayor abandoned personal interest in the investigation with new evidence against catherine appearing regularly even glitsky grudgingly came to consider the possibility that cuneo had been right for his own reasons glitsky still seemed ready to jump up at the slightest scent of another lead but they had been scarce to begin with and dwindled to none and that left only one alternativethat paul hanovers death and missys had come at the hands of hardys client there were days hardy considered the possibility himself now with his breathing under control he got up and went into the bathroom where he drank a few handfuls of water and threw some more in his face then toweled himself dry back in bed he lay on his back uncovered silent up to now apparently sleeping frannie reached out and put a hand over his hand in the night are you all right just nerves he said the trial i guessed no flies on you can i do anything its okay ill get back to sleep in a minute he squeezed her hand i couldnt find the car he said as though the words made any sense the car in my dream missys car the one he and catherine were going to go and make out in in the dream as soon as they could find it but he left that part out what about it i dont know where it is i mean i still dont know where it is you know everything thats possible to know about this case dismas youve lived and breathed it for most of the past year how many binders do you have these were his black threering binders for testimony evidence motions police reports everything that comprised his records on the case twentysix is that a new record close anyway but i know theres nothing about the car how could i have forgotten that i dont know is it important no i mean i dont know why it would be its just a question i cant answer we start in a few hours fran i cant have questions i dont know the answers to not now frannie turned onto her side moved over against him if its important youll have it when you need it but right now what you need is sleep he let out a long breath im a mess youre fine i cant believe marian didnt recuse herself thats good news remember grounds for appeal you told me yourself or venue how could she leave the damn trial here the jurys tainted i can feel it ive got a question for you what are you going to play this whole thing over in your mind before morning no i hope not then youre right ive got to stop okay so stop then go easy on yourself he put his arm around her did i just say you were right yep you are i know she kissed the side of his face lets say we go to sleep okay okay then as sleep approached i love you you know i know she said me too and kissed his cheek again within two minutes hardys breathing was deep and even frannie it took longer hardy was dressed in a dark blue suit with a white shirt and redandblue rep tie it was by the clock on his stove he had poured his coffee first thing as always taken a drink then realized that if treya hadnt gone into labor during the night glitsky would be awake and at home he answered on the second ring with a cheerful this better be important hardy didnt waste time with chitchat either wheres missys car i dont know bolivia why do you say that are we a little wound up this morning oh thats right the trial hardy cut him off do you know that is the car really in bolivia do i have any idea id be surprised bolivia just seemed like a good answer at the time whats this about last night i had a dream and realized i didnt know anything about her car so what so i dont know what that means why did i dream about it if it doesnt mean anything i give up glitsky said because dreams are random not as often as youd think i realized its something ive never looked at i wondered if you had no you know anything about it she owned her own car right right glitskys ongoing frustration with finding another suspect and his futile investigation to this point made him hardys goto guy for all facts related to the hanover case she drove a black mercedes he said like catherine hanovers okay so where is it real guess this time its parked in a garage somewhere where are you going here hardy took in another slug of coffee she comes home from wherever shes been wheres she been she doesnt work is this twenty questions she was shopping or hanging out with a friend of hers anywayhardy running with itthat doesnt matter what matters is she gets home and parks maybe she took a cab or even the muni i doubt it but either way her car had to be somewhere around alamo square the willises both talked about her car okay so she had a car parked around alamo square then shes killed in the house pauls car is in the garage theres no second car so where did it go if it was on the street its towed or stolen glitsky said mystery solved nice talking to you glitskys voice changed softened ive got a pretty little thing pulling on my leg that needs her breakfast dont you baby you dont think its anything hardy asked yeah i do i think its firstdayoftrial jitters youd have the jitters too if your client was innocent and you knew it a lengthy pause well diz he said thats why they have trials you can prove it there i dont have to prove anything thats the thing theyve got to prove she did it the burden of proof is always on the prosecution glitskys voice was surprisingly gentle oh thats right i forgot for a minute there jacked up for the day and realizing hed overstepped hardy started to apologize sorry abe its just hey still lowkey shut up ill find the car for you now say thanks abe and hang up thanks abe dont mention it treya had been off work for the week since her due date in theory she could sleep in every day but that didnt seem to be in her nature hardys phone call this morning hadnt helped either glitsky was sharing ketchup with some scrambled eggs as opposed to scrambled eggs with a little ketchup with rachelone big spoonful for daddy one biggest spoonful for rachelwhen his wife appeared in the door to the kitchen who was that this early diz hes having a breakdown catherine hanover a nod he says shes innocent so do you yes but only in the privacy of my own home i actually think it might be tougher on diz why is that its got to be easier if he thinks his clients guilty wouldnt you think that way they get convicted on some level youve got to know they deserve it so how bad can you feel they dont convict you win so you feel good about that but if you think theyre really not guilty i think its eating him up just like with you well maybe not eating me up exactly but somebodys walking around free who shouldnt be you really want him dont you or her whoever yeah i want em glitskys face wore a sober expression and with some reason after cuneo and chris rosen had ramrodded the grand jury into returning an indictment against catherine hanover late last spring the two of them got wind of the onetime personal connection between hardy and his client to the homicide inspector and the assistant da this relationship was anything but innocentnot that they cared about sexual involvement which in the tabloid environment of the san francisco political scene they both assumed without discussion working together on the case cuneo and rosen both immediately took hardy and catherines involvement as another level in their conspiracy theory now it wasnt just glitsky and hardy and kathy west all of those three were now neatly connected to the defendant in a sensational and highly political doublemurder trial they had to be colluding in some kind of coverup meanwhile glitsky had been continuing on his own semiparallel investigations into towhold and paul hanovers other business and political endeavors when early one evening in his office he got an unannounced visit from an fbi field agent named bill schuyler field officers with the fbi didnt drop in at the office of the deputy chief of inspectors every day or even every month so clearly schuyler had come with a specific purpose the fact that hed come after normal business hours was interesting too though theyd always had an easy and collegial acquaintance neither man wasted any time with pleasantries before getting to it i thought youd want to know schuyler began that i got a call from chris rosenone of your das herea couple of days ago he was asking questions about you glitsky at his desk in the amber twilight sat deeply back in his chair fingers templed at his lips hed been in a tense state of waiting for the appearance of this discussion for the better part of two years and now that it was here it was almost a relief but he feigned complete ignorance what did he want to know he was following up on a report filed by lieutenant lanier who interviewed you on the day that barry gerson got shot schuyler said you remember that pretty well what did you have to do with that nothing directly but you mentioned me to lanier said youd called me earlier in the day thats because i did bill i know i remember you wanted me to round up some of my troops and help you with an arrest your friend hardys client if memory serves but there wasnt enough time thats right thats what happened so whats the problem glitsky asked im not sure abe schuyler was a broadshouldered always welldressed athlete with a bullet head covered with a blond fuzz now he leaned forward in his chair rosen wouldnt say of course but he asked me if id followed up with you with what youd done that day if i knew whether youd gone ahead anyway without my guys that would have been stupid and indefensible schuyler nodded thats what i told him but the real answer was no i hadnt followed up afterward with you i didnt know what youd done in the darkening room glitsky blew on his templed hands schuyler continued your alibi was that glitsky sat bolt upright whoa alibi he said the word alibi your alibi is that you spent the day with gina roake hardys law partner at her apartment thats because i did her fiancee had just died were friends bill gina and i she needed the company i was with her this was strictly true although he hadnt been with roake at her apartment but out on pier where both of them had taken part in the gunfight that had killed gerson and five others so what he was telling schuyler was the truth but it was also a lie what do you want me to say bill schuyler held his palms out in front of him nothing abe youve got nothing to prove to me but i thought youd want to know theyre asking around they whos they besides rosen he mentioned this homicide cop i dont know him cuneo this case youre on now evidently hardys in it and youve been working with him again and the mayor too to undercut himcuneo i meansince their suspect is hardys girlfriend so were somehow in this grand conspiracy he seemed to be thinking that way yeah glitsky kept his voice low under tight control and what exactly are we or were we conspiring to do did he say schuyler shrugged all im saying is hes building a case i dont know what its about but the smart bet is somebody wants to tie you to gerson i had nothing to do with gerson although i heard he was dirty cuneo didnt think he was yeah and he thinks hes got the right suspect here too you dont think he does thats why im still looking schuyler digested that for a minute well you want some free advice always not that i always take it but ill listen bail on this case the one youre still working on cuneos got a suspect in custody rosens got an indictment so what the hell are you still looking for what message are you sending out about these two clowns theyre jerkoffsthats what you dont believe they made their case i dont think they did schuyler shook his head with impatience doesnt matter abe if their suspect didnt do it odds are shell walk right your man hardys pretty good hes not my man bill hes a friend of mine thats all whatever doesnt change the fact the girls not guilty shes off if not he shrugged again if not glitsky was wrong looking for another suspect in the first place and hed be well advised to be rid of the case sooner rather than later the point is you take the heat off yourself right now if cuneo wants this collar so bad maybe he fucked up the investigation not your problem abe the trial goes south maybe you get involved again later lowkey point out where they fucked it up but this guys got a hardon for you both of them do they dont think youre looking for an alternate suspect they think the real story is that you and hardy and kathy west are covering something up maybe going all the way back to gerson thats what i read glitsky simmered for a long moment by now the room was frankly dark let them look he said theres nothing to find dont kid yourself schuyler lowered his voice theres always something to find abe maybe not what they started looking for but if you let them get a foothold start talking to the whole world get the accountants involved theyll find a time card you filled in wrong or a company car you went to the beach in or some secretary says you felt her up something and ifit gets to the politicos sniping at west once they got the climate established and youre all in some conspiracy together then the pro liars will just use what rosens got and make up other shit unless you got a righteous somebody else for the murders no nobody not a hint then drop it but he hadnt dropped it he couldnt do that not while he was a cop and not while he believed that cuneo had arrested the wrong suspect which meant that the real killer was still on the streets and nowif not for glitskywith no one in pursuit on top of that glitsky wasnt about to be chased off by the fear that cuneo would expose him in some way once he let that happen he might as well resign he would be useless no the most effective way to neutralize cuneo would be to discover what hed missedto be more thorough more organized a better cop he realized that in fact it would not hurt at all if cuneo and rosen believed that he was dropping out of the case he could use the power of his office as a cover to pursue his own leads under their nosesif he played it right and he would he might actually be aided in his interrogations by his witnesses perception that the police already had a suspect in custody so glitsky couldnt possibly be focusing on them he did not want this to become a political liability for kathy west however there was no point in that so he went to her and convinced her that he had to drop the case he had nothing going anyway no real leads then he told her a little about schuylers theories cuneo and rosen which shed considered ridiculous and infuriating but in the end didnt want to pursue obviously the men lived in an alternate universe but a witch hunt with her as the central figure in an undefined conspiracy theory was something shed prefer to avoid finally glitsky went to lanier and gave him the news too that he was off the case it was all cuneos from here on out the homicide inspector had done a good job of identifying the defendant and catherine hanovers arrest took glitsky out of the loop so whatever conspiracy hed been involved in around this case became moot to both cuneo and rosen and he hadnt heard another word about it since it was still there though now holding treyas hand he scratched at the kitchen table maybe i should just call back and tell diz no i dont think so hon this thing has been sticking in your rather welldeveloped craw for months if you want to help diz just acknowledge what youre doing so youre ready when the shit hits the fan which it will i promise she smiled in her teasing way for the record i apologize for the use of profanity in front of our daughter too she looked down at rachel and said we dont say shit in this house little girl rachel returned her gaze with a questioning open expression what shit she asked glitsky hung his head and shook it from side to side wonderful but treya suddenly sat up straighter oh her hand went to her stomach and she blew out a long breath glitsky squeezed her hand trey she held up her index finger telling him to be patient a minute breathing deeply and slowly she looked up and found the clock on the wall were there she said where we rachel asked were in labor sweetie treya answered gently you know the little brother weve been waiting for all this time hes telling me hes on his way hardy parked under his office in the managing partners spot next to the elevator his mind elsewhere he got in the elevator and rode upward not realizing that out of force of some longburied habit hed pushed before hed become managing partner this was where hed worked now his partner wes farrell worked out of his old office the elevator door opened and hardy stepped out into the hall and stood for a minute wondering where he was brilliant he said to himself knocking on farrells door and getting no answer as he passed he descended the steps to the main lobby phylliss station the solarium davids old office hermetically preservednext to his own and then norma the office managers off to his right ran a long hallway at the end of which was the lair of the firms third name partner gina roake behind the doors and their secre taries cubicles the eight current associates now toiled hardy assumed most if not all of them were working already although it was still a few minutes shy of eight oclock you didnt bill hours a year if you didnt put in a very full day every day phyllis wasnt at her station yetshe came on at eight thirtyso hardy crossed directly to his own ornate door and was surprised to see wes farrell coat and tieless throwing darts i know what youre going to say farrell began you do i do youre going to say youre busy and you dont have time for any childish games your trial starts today hardy brought a hand to his forehead thats today yikes he crossed around to behind his desk lugged his triplethick briefcase up and onto the blotter actually i knew it was today he snapped open the clasps started removing folders he broke a brittle smilenot very convincing he liked wes a lot but he didnt always work the way hardy did and sometimes his presence was more distraction than help so whats up in ten words or less todays shirt hed thrown the last dart of the round as hardy had entered and had turned to follow his progress now his grin on wes held open his unbuttoned dress shirt actually this was an almostdaily ritual and hardy found himself breaking into a genuine smile wes prided himself on having one of the worlds most complete evergrowing collections of epigrammatic tshirts which he wore under his lawyers disguise todays shirt read grow your own dopeplant a man sam gave it to me he said and that goes a long way toward explaining why i love that woman he was buttoning up anyway i thought you might need a little humor running around in your system before you hit the hall i might at that hardy conceded did you drive by there on your way in no you hardy nodded thirtyseven mobile units if you can believe it you cant even get onto bryant theyre diverting traffic around before you get within three blocks hardy glanced at his watch and we dont even start for an hour and a half its going to be a circus farrell sat on the couch doing up his tie you probably shouldnt have dated her i mean if you wanted to keep all these scurrilous lies out of the paper where were you when i was seventeen i didnt date until i was much older than that so i couldnt have advised you very well funny frannie says the same thing a quick glance serious she okay with it great peachy he settled into his chair although i cant say shes been totally thrilled with the romeo lawyer angle everybody in the news seems to like so much but the news jocks dont like it as much as my kids vincents even taken to calling me romeo in private which of course just cracks me up and then if the beck hears him she goes ballistic its a great time or how about last week our passion pit in the jail did you see that i thought it was pretty cool an old guy like you yeah those enquirer guys are talented i wondered where that was exactly the passion pit to tell you the truth but i was afraid youd had so many intimate moments there that you didnt want to talk about it too private so many so many actually its the visiting room downstairs at the jail hardy said referring to the antiseptic brightly lit glassblockenclosed bullpen off the admitting area where lawyers got to meet with their incarcerated clients thats where weve consummated our love but to get to feeling really passionate in there youve got to use some serious imagination believe me more than the enquirer guys even wes had his tie on now and stood up grabbing his coat and now it begins in earnest huh can i do anything to help at home maybe sam hardy shook his head no i told you were fine in fact its added a whole new dimension to our marriage where she pretends it doesnt bother her and i pretend that i appreciate her understanding its special but what am i supposed to do its a little late now you could pray for a short trial prayer is always a solace hardy said i might go for that twenty minutes later he left his office to a gaggle of wellwishers in the lobby this was a major case for the firm and everyone was aware of its importance it was still bitter cold outside but hardy was damned if he was going to hassle first with the impossible parking around the hall of justice which for twentysome bucks a day would not get him appreciably closer to the courtroom than he was in his office and then with the gauntlet of the tv cameras and minicams no wrapped in his long heavy coat and wearing gloves he would walk the twelve blocks carrying his twentypound briefcase and sneak in past at least most of the jackals through the back door by the jail first though there was the jail itself and the pretrial meeting with his client over the months hed grown accustomed to seeing catherine in the familiar orange jumpsuit that was her garb in the lockup so this morning when she entered the passion pit in low heels a stylish green skirt and complementary blouse earrings eye shadow and lipstick he boosted himself off the table where hed been sitting he met her eyes and nodded in appreciation okay then he said that works the female guard whod escorted catherine from the changing room closed the door behind her now the client took a step or two into the room toward him and stopped there was something in her stillness that struck him as a falsely brave front but she summoned what passed for a smile you ever get tired of being a lawyer she said i think youve got a career in womens fashion hardy had pulled a bit of a break with the judge when shed allowed catherine the dignity of changing into normal clothes upstairs instead of in a holding cell next to the courtroom hardy had contacted the good husband will and hed sent over three boxes of clothes and underwear none of which fit her anymore because shed lost so much weight in jail so hardy had her take her measurements and write down her sizes then had spent the better part of a day a few weeks before buying a wardrobe for her at neiman marcus as it turned out this straightforward and practical move had backfired in a number of ways first off hardy really didnt know all that much about womens fashion but his exwife jane fowler happened to still work in the fieldshed been a buyer at i magnin for years the two werent exactly close anymore but they had lunch together a couple of times a year just to keep up when he asked if she would do him a favor and accompany him on the shopping expedition shed agreed what happened next he might have guessed if hed thought about it but he really wasnt sufficiently paranoid yet and maybe never would be to fully appreciate what appeared to be happening around this case several tabloid reporters shadowed him on this shopping trip not only did someone snap a picture of him holding up a sexy bra but the article followed up with the news that hardy had bought the clothes with the firms credit card implying that he was paying for it although of course hed just be listing the clothes in his regular bill to will hanover for his hours and expenses the article made the purchase look suspect and the icing on the cake was that jane appeared behind him in the bra picture the romeo not just fooling around with his client but now caught with his exwife frannie liked that part almost as much as the picture of herwearing formless jogging clothes with her hair in disarray and a somehow distracted and worried look on her face as she carried a couple of bags of groceries the caption under that one brave but clueless hardy shook his head to clear the memory in front of him catherine did a little selfconscious pirouette i really look okay better than okay she sighed then threw a second sigh at the ceiling when she came back to him she was blinking im not going to cry and ruin these eyes today no dont do that that would be wrong nixons famous line from the watergate era brought a smile enough to stem the immediate threat of tears its just she sighed i thought id never wear anything like this again youll do that all the time catherine you wait do you really think so with more conviction than he felt hardy nodded you didnt do this the jury wont convict you youll see the system really does work i want to believe that but if thats the case i keep wondering how it got me to here now hardy feigned his own brave smile one little teeny tiny design flaw a bad cop this is the version where he gets edited out you ready im ready all right ive got to remind you that the next time i see you were in front of the jury some of them are going to think you and i have something going on courtesy of our evervigilant media so its important that you and i appear to have a professional distance frannies going to be out there so is will no dont look like that hes got to be there its critical that the jury sees that your husband is supporting you through all this that in spite of everything he must believe that youre innocent in spite of everything hes said about me and what hes done hardy nodded in spite of all that hes our witness hes got nothing to say about the crime itself hes your husband they cant make him testify against you i hate him i believe youve mentioned that but it doesnt matter hes out there and its good for the jury to see him and see that youre with him but im not right but that doesnt matter she closed her eyes and for a breath her structure seemed to crumble then she straightened up opened her eyes lifted her jaw and flashed a highoctane smile im innocent she said ive got nothing to be afraid of correct lets go get em ill see you out there theyd been standing a foot apart and now catherine stepped forward dismas i just want to say that i know how hard this has been for you i mean personally i never meant its not you he said its all right she moved closer and leaned her head against his chest the weight of it against him carefully delicately he put his arms around her and held her lightly it was the first time theyd embraced catherine brought her arms around his back and tightened her hold on him again her composure broke he patted her back gradually easing her away kissing her chastely on the cheek without another word he picked up his briefcase went to the door and knocked for the guard and was gone the courtroom was department on the third floor of the hall of justice hardy had been in it on many occasions by now but never failed to be disappointed by its lack of grandeur more than twenty years ago the city had installed extra security for the trial of dan white whod shot mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk in their offices at city hall now heavy doors and bulletproof glass separated the gallery from the well of the courtroom in department except for these amenities the room might have been a typical classroom in a marginally funded school district in front of the bar hardy sat at a plain blond library desk on the lefthand side of the nondescript windowless fluorescentlit room his counterpart with the prosecutionrosen with case inspector dan cuneo next to himsat at an identical table about ten feet to his right beyond them was the varnished plywood jury box theyd finished jury selection yesterday and now the box was filled with four men and eight women with three african americans two asians two hispanics five caucasians one dentist one high school teacher three housewives a city employee a computer repairperson two salesmen three between jobs hardy had been living with the endless calculations of the crapshoot of the makeup of the eventual panel for nine working days now here they were and hed done all he could he even felt pretty good about some of the people but he still wished he could start again but it was always like this something you just couldnt know or predict hed entered the courtroom through the back door coming up the hallway by the judges chambers to avoid the reporters and the general madness and now at his table he ventured a halfturn to catch his wifes eye frannie was in the first row the first seat by the center aisle next to their friend the citytalk columnist jeff elliot frannie didnt often come to court with hardy but for his big trials she tried to be there for his opening and closing statements he caught her eye and put his hand over his heart and patted it twice the secret signal she did the same behind her and elliot it was bedlam every one of the twelve rows eight wooden theaterstyle seats to a side was completely filled mostly with media people hardy also recognized not just a few people from his office who had come down to cheer him on but several other attorneys from the building as well as what appeared to be quite a sizable sampling of regular folks and trial junkies and now before the entrance of the judge everyone was talking all at once on hardys side will hanover sat with the other adult members of his extended family who would not be called as witnesses for the prosecutioncatherines two sistersinlaw and their husbands unbelievably hardy thought given the testimony theyd supplied to cuneo beth and aaron like will still considered themselves to be on catherines side despite their comments in police reports to the contrary none of them actually seemed to believe that catherine was guilty yes shed known where paul kept his gun yes shed been worried about the inheritance yes shed repeated many times that somebody would have to kill paul and missy either they didnt believe in causality or they didnt understand the gravity of their statements but nonetheless by their very presence on catherines side of the gallery they would be living and breathing testimony to the fact that they still cared about herand in the great nebulous unknown that was the collective mind of the jury this might not be a bad thing cuneo of course was turned around at the prosecutors table and sat jittering nonstop talking to a couple of assistant das from upstairs in the front row down for the show but then suddenly the bailiff was standing up to the left of the judges utilitarian desk all rise department twentyone of the superior court of the state of california is now in session her honor judge marian braun presiding please turn off all cell phones and pagers be seated and come to order without any fanfare braun was seated almost before the bailiff had concluded his introduction she scowled out at the gallery as though surprised at its size then faced the clerk and nodded the clerk nodded back then looked over to the second bailiff who was standing by the back door to the courtroom on hardys right theyd already called the case number and read the indictment for special circumstances double murder when theyd begun jury selection so long ago so now today there was little of that earlier formalitythe defendant merely needed to be in the courtroom so that she could face her accusers the back door opened and catherine hanover appeared to a slight electric buzz from the gallery the loss of the fifteen pounds hadnt hurt her looks neither had the light makeup the subtle lipstick the tailored clothing in the brassy fluorescence of the courtroom she seemed to shine and hardy was not at all sure that this was a positive good looks could backfire he glanced at the jury for reactions and suddenly wished there were at least eight men on it and four women instead of the other way around or even twelve men all of them older and selfmade during jury selection hed convinced himself that the women hed accepted were of a traditional bent and hence would be deeply suspicious of missy damiens and her unknown and thus arguably colorful and potentially dangerous past on the other hand he suddenly realizedand catherines appearance today underscored thisthat these same women might have a great deal of trouble identifying with this attractive woman whose husbands sixfigure income wasnt enough to support her lifestyle in the end hed gone along with impaneling all the women because women at least the sort he hoped he had left on the jury tended to believe that sexual harassment happened but he shuddered inwardly now suddenly afraid that he might have outright miscalculated he tore his eyes away from the jury and brought them back to his client he stood and pulled out the chair next to him for her glad to see that she had apparently found her husband and inlaws in the gallery and acknowledged them then she was seated hardy whispered to her how are you doing fine the judge tapped her gavel to still the continuing buzz then turned to the prosecution table mr rosen ready for the people rosen got out of his chair yes your honor mr hardy yes your honor all right mr rosen you may begin chris rosen was a professional trial attorney with nine years of experience and a specialization in arson cases hed prosecuted three homicides and a dozen arsons in that time winning four of them outright and getting lesser convictions with substantial prison time on the others so he could say with absolute truth that hed never lost a case which in this most liberal city was an enviable almost unheard of record maybe rosen hadnt always gotten a clear win either but hardy knew the truth of the defense bias in san franciscoindeed it was one of the factors involved in this case for which he was most gratefulbut this was cold comfort as he watched his young goodlooking opposite number rise with a quiet confidence and a friendly demeanor to match it ladies and gentlemen he began good morning were here today and for the next few days or weeks lets hope it wont be too many weeksto hear evidence about the murders of two people paul hanover a lawyer here in san francisco and his fiancee missy damiens hardy noticed that rosen came as advertisedhe was playing it smooth he didnt refer to the dead impersonally as the deceased or even the victims rather they had been real live people until they had been murdered he continued to the jury in his serious amiable voice on wednesday may the twelfth of last year someone set a fire at the home that mr hanover shared with missy damiens firemen coming to fight the blaze found the bodies of a man and woman burned beyond recognition in the foyer of the house wedged under one of the bodies was a gun both victims had been shot in the head the evidence will show beyond a reasonable doubt that neither wound was selfinflicted neither victim killed the other and then him or herself these people were murdered in their home and the murderer lit a fire in the hope of destroying the evidence that would connect him or her to the crime rosen paused to collect himself as these grisly and dramatic events would obviously upset the psyche of any reasonably sensitive person clearing his throat excusing himself to the jurors for just a moment he took a few steps over to his desk where cuneo pushed his glass of water to the front edge of the desk rosen took a sip cleared his throat again and turned back to the jurors we will prove to you ladies and gentlemen and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person who fired those shots into the heads of each of these victims was the defendant in this case mr hanovers daughterinlaw catherine hanover she did it for a common and mundane reasonmr hanover was going to change his will and name missy damiens his beneficiary when he did that his inheritance of nearly fifteen million dollars would go to missy and the defendant would get no share of it on the very day that he died according to the defendants own statement to police mr hanover told her that he was thinking of changing his will in favor of missy before the wedding date possibly as early as the following week spurred by this confession of his plans the defendant resolved to kill mr hanover before he could change his will here rosen turned and faced catherine his body language as well as his tone suggesting that it pained him to make these accusations against a fellow human being but she had brought it on herself he so wished that she hadnt he raised an almost reluctant hand until his arm was fully outstretched his index finger wavering in controlled indignation and shoot him she did at pointblank range in the head and shot missy damiens too because shed had the bad fortune to come home and be in the house recounting the tale was imposing a great burden on rosen and he needed another sip of water hardy thought this was overdoing the sensitivity a bit and he was glad to see something about which he could privately at leastbe critical he knew that juries had a way of sniffing out a phony tactical interruption and they might resent it otherwise rosen was presenting a textbook opening statementrecounting the facts the prosecution had and would prove without any editorializing he had even avoided the potential minefield of missys presence in the houseclearly the killer had intended the scene to look like a murdersuicide which would have ended the investigation before it began but rosen didnt accuse catherine of that he steered clear altogether hardy with a grudging admiration had to let him continue unchallenged the relevant events of this tragic day are relatively straightforward and really began around noon we will prove to you that the defendant catherine hanover stopped at a valero gas station on the corner of oak and webster about three blocks from paul hanovers home on alamo square a worker at that gas station will testify that he saw the defendant get out of her car a black mercedesbenz c and fill a portable container with gasoline and put it into her trunk according to the defendants own statement she went to visit her fatherinlaw later that same afternoon to discuss the finances of her immediate and extended family we will show you that the defendant came back to mr hanovers home later in the day you will hear two witnesses testify that she left mr hanovers home a few moments before the fire broke out you will discover that the defendant lied to the police about her actions at this time she said that she was at home alone during these critical hours but her own daughters diary disproves her story hardy covered his mouth with his hand hiding from the jury his displeasure heathers diary was perhaps the biggest issue hed lost in pretrial although hardy had argued bitterly against its inclusion there was no question ofthe importance and relevance ofthe diary entry so one way or another it was going in and in the normal course of events that evidence couldnt have been admittedit wouldnt have had a foundationif heather as a prosecution witness against her own mother didnt testify in court that shed written it understandably this was a scenario that catherine in a genuine display of motherly protectiveness wanted to avoid at all costs the psychological damage to her daughter could be incalculable but rosen needed the evidence which meant he needed heather and no one could stop him from forcing her to testify the only solution had been for hardy to cut a deal to allow the diary entry without the foundation but even without heathers testimony it was a bitter pill and potentially devastating for his client meanwhile rosen was gliding easily over the last of the evidence finally you will learn that the same type of gasoline used as an accelerant to start the fire in mr hanovers home exactly matches that found in fibers of rug from the trunk of the defendants black mercedesbenz c he paused for one last sip of water as i said at the outset this is a straightforward story and im nearly through with it on may the twelfth of last year paul hanover himself told the defendant that within days she and her entire family would be written out of her fatherinlaws will that they would lose millions of dollars she decided to kill him to keep that from happening and to use his own gun that she knew he kept loaded in the headboard of his bed she bought gasoline to set paul hanovers house on fire to cover her tracks she had the means by her own admission shed been at the house during the afternoon and you will hear witnesses place her there again just before the fire broke out opportunity rosen let out a little air we will show you and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that catherine hanover killed her fatherinlaw paul hanover and missy damiens for money by shooting them both in the head this is firstdegree murder with special circumstances under the law of the state of california and that is the verdict i will ask for thank you very much in a california murder trial the defense attorney has an option he can either deliver his opening statement directly after that of the prosecuting attorney as a sort of instant rebuttal or he can deliver his statement at the conclusion of the states case in full hardy was a big fan of the former believing as he did that the jury made up a great deal of its collective mindimpressions of the players general believability of the states narrative strength or likely strength of the evidence to be presentedin the very opening stages of a trial hardys experience was that by the time the jury members had heard and seen all the states evidence even if the veracity and provenance of every bit of it had been questioned denied and demeaned by a vigilant defense lawyer the weight of all of it often just got to be too much to lift so despite being the defense attorney hardy didnt want to fall into a defensive posture the last thing he wanted was to be passive parrying the thrusts of his opponent without striking any blows of his own no a trial was a war and the goal was to win not simply to defend and if you wanted to win you had to attack hardy knew the book on rosen was that he never objected during open believing as did most lawyers that it ticked off the jury so he had a hunch he could mix a little argument into a straight recitation of his factsin fact his plan was to find out exactly how much argument his counterpart could tolerate so after his own lowkey and affably gracious greeting to the jurors hardy wasted no time bringing out his own guns well weve all now heard mr rosens account of the murders of paul hanover and missy damiens and i couldnt help but be struck by his use of the phrase we will show and prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt just hearing him use those words creates a powerful impression doesnt it hes telling you hes got evidence to support his theory of paul and missys deaths that is so persuasive that it will leave you in a state of virtual certainty beyond a reasonable doubt that catherine hanover killed them both but let me tell you something he doesnt have any such thing he has in fact no physical evidence at all that places catherine at paul hanovers house at or near the time of the murders he stopped as though struck nearly mute for a second by the enormity of what hed just said can that be right you must be thinking how can the state of california have arrested and charged catherine hanover with this heinous double murder of her fatherinlaw and his fiancee if there is simply no physical evidence tying her to the crime a flummoxed look on his face he turned first to the prosecution table as though he expected an answer to this very reasonable question when none was forthcoming he came back to the panel that ladies and gentlemen of the jury is a very good question because the pure fact is that mr rosen does not have so much as a single fingerprint of catherine hanover on any part of the murder weapon he does not have anything tying catherine hanover to the gasoline container that mr hanovers killer used to start the fire at his house he has let me repeat this one more time no physical evidence remarkable hardy took a casual stroll of his own now across to the defense table where catherine sat borrowing from rosens bag of tricks he too raised his arm and pointed a finger at his client this woman is innocent completely innocent of these crimes she is guilty of nothing at all in fact except for drawing the attention and incurring the wrath of the lead investigating officer on this case sergeant dan cuneo by resisting his inappropriate sexual advances and reporting them to his superior out in the gallery a low roar erupted this was what all the reporters had come for sex and scandal salacious accusations and powderkeg secrets hardy took a beats quiet pleasure in the sight of cuneos startled fury of chris rosens jaw visibly drooping startled and disconcerted though he must have known that the issue would arise he simply didnt seem prepared for the accusation so early in open court welcome to the big leagues hardy thought he had drawn first blood it got better cuneo whispered something to rosen who belatedly rose to his feet objection your honor argument the objection is overruled hes not arguing mr rosen hes telling his version of events as you did thats what opening statements are for go on mr hardy hardy nodded respectfully this was wholly unexpected not only had braun ruled for him but shed thrown rosen a backhanded rebuke in front of the jury hardy had to like it but couldnt dare show any of it thank you your honor he said he moved to the center of the courtroom again he turned and looked back over at the defense table i said a minute ago that there was no physical evidence tying catherine to this crime but more than that there is no convincing evidence of any kind physical or otherwise that she is guilty the adrenaline was definitely running now and he was aware of a keen pleasurealmost a thrillknowing that he was going to let it take him as far as it would the critical prosecution witnesses are inconsistent and contradict one another my clients statements have been twisted and taken out of context the socalled motive has been exaggerated and distorted and the whole foulsmelling mass has been coaxed into the feeble semblance of a case by an overhasty and careless investigation two people are dead here and the evidence will show they were shot to death the prosecution evidence beyond this is simply not clear enough clean enough convincing enough to convict catherine of murder he paused for a beat confident now that hed be able to slip in a last bit of argument at the beginning of your service he said to the jury you swore an oath as catherine sits there now under your gaze he said you must presume that what i have told you is the truth you must presume that she is innocent that is where this trial begins mr rosen would have you believe that she is not innocent that she plotted and executed this double murder for financial gain that she is guilty as charged but no amount of political ambition no desire to close a highprofile case can make her so the law of this country presumes the innocence of the accused it is on that presumption and upon your oath that we will rely he met the eyes of several jurors every one rapt up to now at least he had them with him the only witness before the lunch break was john strout an ageless and usually uncontroversial figure at every murder trial that hardy had ever attended in san francisco prosaic as it might seem usually one of the first orders of business for the prosecution was to establish that a murder had in fact taken place or in this case two murders hardy had studied the forensics and the autopsy until hed gone crosseyed trying to find some wedge to cast doubt on the causes of death or more specifically to reintroduce the idea of murdersuicide it certainly didnt look good knowing all the facts as he did in fact the possibility was so remote as to be an impossibility still he didnt see how it could hurt to give the jury a nugget of doubt about that point so when rosen finished his nonetoorigorous direct on what had been the obvious causes of death of the two victims hardy stood and walked up to where dr strout sat with consummate ease in the witness box as some people grow to look like their dogs strout the coroner had over time come to resemble a cadaver nearly six and a half feet tall gaunt and sallow strouts manylined cheeks were covered with a crepepaper skin that sank into the hollows of his face a prominent adams apple bobbed with every frequent swallow but for all that he somehow managed to retain something of a youthful aira shock of unruly white hair pale blue eyes that had seen it all and laughed at a lot of it when he spoke a southern drawl cast much of what he said in a sardonic light although here of courseon the witness stand under oathhe would strive to be nothing but professional hardy had known the man for thirty years and greeted him cordially then got down to the business at hand youve testified that both mr hanover and missy damiens died from gunshot wounds to the head is that correct yes it is strout was sitting back in his seat arms resting on the arms of his chair his long legs crossed in the cramped witness box an ankle on its opposite knee in the kindergarten simplicity of the courtroom rosen had presented a drawing mounted on a portable tripod of the two victims heads showing the entry and exit wounds of the bullets and their trajectories hardy went first to the location of the wound on missys headverifying that it was in the upper back let me ask you then doctor could this wound have been selfinflicted strouts initial reaction covered quickly was a twinkle in those pale eyes he knew hardy well and the question was so stupid on its face that he almost didnt know how to respond except with sarcasm but it stirred him from his complacent lethargy he uncrossed his legs and pulled himself up straight in my opinionin ma pinionit would have been well nigh impossible to inflict this wound on herself impossible you say thats right all right and turning now to mr hanovers wound same question could he have shot himself there over his right ear right hardy said well no i dont rightly think so but unlike the case with missy damiens it might not have been impossible well no if hed used his left hand but even so the trajectory he stopped shook his head with some decision id have to say no no no doctor and why is that because he had polio when hed been younger and his right arm was useless hardy nodded at this fascinating discovery brought in the jury with his eyes so he couldnt have lifted the gun with his right hand to where it needed to be to have fired the shot that killed him is that your testimony strouts eyes were narrowed down now to slits he famously did not like his medical opinions challenged either in or out of court thats my understanding correct your understanding doctor i take it then that you did not have a chance to examine mr hanover while he was alive did you no of course not no well then in your examination of the body after his death did you find the muscles in mr hanovers right arm to be atrophied or useless no i did not no why not because there was essentially nothing left of the right arm it had cooked away this macabre recital brought a hum to the gallery that made braun lift her gavel but it died away before she could bring it down so doctor hardy continued there is nothing about your examination that precludes the possibility that mr hanover shot ms damiens and then himself is that correct a glint of humor showed again in strouts eyes so this was where the apparently stupid questions were leading he nodded thats right in other words according to your personal examination of mr hanover after his death you found nothing that would rule out the possibility of a selfinflicted wound correct and of course mr hanover before he took his own life could have shot ms damiens isnt that true yes strout replied thank you doctor hardy said no further questions as soon as braun called the lunch recess hardy gave his client a small pat on the hand before she was led away to her holding cell just behind the courtroom for her own jailtime meal most days hardy would probably be back there with her going over issues with sandwiches or sometimes with food phoned in by phyllis from any one of a number of terrific local eateries but todayand hardy had told catherine beforehandhe had a point to make so he gathered his notes and binders into a neat pile in front of his place then got up and pushed his way through the swinging gate to the gallery frannie stood waiting for him and he slung an arm around her shoulders drew her to him kissed the top of her headthe picture of a happily married man casually meeting up with his spouse he then leaned over to say hi to jeff elliot whod wheeled himself up next to frannie before the proceedings began i love this woman he said and you can quote me then sotto voce he added in fact i wish you would its not exactly news elliot said man loves wife you know what i mean he knew what hardy was talking about however and said but ill see what i can do the three of them stood chatting in the press of people as the courtroom slowly emptied the jury first hardy noticed cuneo whod nearly bolted from the prosecution table drumming the back of a chair in front of him his face was a black mask as he tried to keep his cool or rather not to show his selfevident fury as the other people in his row four rows away from hardy patiently awaited their turn to file out there was only the one center aisle in department so exiting this courtroom was always a bit like leaving an airplaneslow slow slowwhile the people in front of you struggled to get their luggage out of the overhead bins or helped their children or older parents or just talked and talked and talked unaware that they needed to keep the goddamn line moving and then at last cuneo was on his way up the aisle his back to them after a few furtive and angry glances when elliot hardy and frannie at last got out into the hallway there was cuneo again in a heated discussion with rosen and again as he saw hardy a flash of pure hatred whos that even through the milling crowd breaking up in various permutations as people went to lunch frannie noticed the directed glare hardy still had his arm over her shoulder and turned her away cuneo that would be inspector cuneo to you elliot was wheeling himself along next to them he seems a little perturbed frannie turned for another look back id say scary hes just a cop hardy said dismissively and not a particularly good one they were waiting with several other citizens for the elevator on the second floor to open and speaking of cops did either of you see abe around this morning before my brilliant opening you had a flash of brilliance when was that elliot asked darn i must have missed it come on jeff frannie said he was she looked up at him amusement in her eyes or at least as david used to say he was fairly competent youre both too kind really hardy said but abe frannie shook her head no so did jeffelliot havent seen him john strout shambled over while the three of them were eating their lunch at lou the greeks the medical examiner hovered over the table like a smiling ghost yall havin the special an unnecessary question since lous only served one meal every daythe specialalways some more or less bizarre commingling of asian and greek foodstuffs today the special came under less bizarre although still passing strangea lamburger with a bright red sweetandsour pineapple sauce over rice strout peered down at the plates through his bifocals as a medical man id recommend caution you mind jeff he slid into the booth next to elliot shot an appreciative glance at frannie then held out his hand i dont believe ive had the pleasure in the middle of a bite hardy swallowed im sorry john my wife frannie frannie john strout who gave such a fine performance this morning thank you he said but the smile faded though i must tell you diz that little primrose path you led me down in there dont lead nowhere hardy put down his fork never said it did john but now mr rosen is going to have to talk about it might put him off his feed thats all my husband has a cruel streak frannie said its well documented ive seen it in action myself strout was all amiability you going after my forensic colleagues too and who would they be hardy asked you know the teeth people whoevers up next john im equal opportunity at skewering prosecution witnesses but im saving the big show for later whos that hardy smiled youll have to wait around and find out maybe i can get you a special pass to let you back in the courtroom put me on your witness list that might do it hardys fork had stopped in midair he chewed thoughtfully for a second or two hes thinking cruel thoughts again frannie said i can tell dr mcinerny hardy began his crossexamination of hanovers dentist for how long was paul hanover your patient twentyseven years give or take and in that time how many xrays of his mouth did you take i dont know exactly usually we do one a year but if a tooth cracks or well really any number of other reasons well do another so its not a complicated process no not at all would you describe the xray process for the court please rosen spoke from behind him objection three fiftytwo your honor this was a common objection raised when the relevance of the testimony and its probative value was substantially outweighed by the time consumption prejudicial effect or by the likelihood of confusing the jury we all know how xrays work braun nodded any particular reason to do this mr hardy yes your honor but im trying to draw a distinction between how xrays get taken in a dentists office and how he took the xrays of the male victims mouth at the morgue to what end what im getting at your honor is that if the picture is taken from a different angle in the morgue or with a different technique it will look different than a typical office xray and the identification of the victim might then not be as certain mcinerny apparently in his late fifties or early sixties carried twenty or so extra pounds on a midsize body pattern baldness was well advanced and what remained of his hair was snow white but his face looked like it spent a lot of time outdoorsopen intelligent expressive now he spoke up helpful but out of turn really though thats not a concern braun surprised at his intrusion swung her head to look at him doctor she said mildly just a moment please she looked out at the stillstanding rosen then came back to hardy ill overrule the objection at this time go ahead mr hardy thank you your honor so doctor those xrays is there a difference in the way you take standard diagnostic xrays at your office and the way you took them to help identify the victim in this case at the morgue in his element now enjoying this chance to explain the intricacies of his work mcinerny first walked through the familiar procedure that took place in his officethe film in the mouth the big machine the leadlined sheet but of course in a forensic laboratory setting such as a morgue we typically dont take a picture at all why is that well because we can simply look at whats there and compare it to our known sample lets say for example you look in a victims mouth and have seven fillings a crown and a root canal or extraction site and theyre just where they are in your sample well then youve got a match hardy sensing an opportunity jumped at it so you can get a match with only say a few matching teeth less than a whole mouthful sometimes of course sometimes you dont have a whole mouthful but you work with everything you have in the case of mr hanover i compared all of the teeth there was a one hundred percent correlation and so you positively identified the victim as mr hanover but mcinerny was shaking his head not precisely he said no could you explain sure i simply verify the match my dental records match the victims and in this case they did hardy having wasted twenty minutes of the courts time on this dry well of a crossexamination realized that he let himself succumb to the luxury of fishing hed gotten an unexpected and gratuitous entirely minor victory of sorts from strout during the morning session and hed let it go to his head he was going to alienate the jury if he kept barking up this kind of tree to no effect acknowledging defeat he tipped his head to dr mcinerny thanked him for his time and excused him the afternoon passed in a haze of redundancy toshio yamashiru was as rosen took pains to point out not only the dentist of missy damiens but one of the top forensic odontologists in the country as strout had told glitsky so long ago he had assisted in the identification of the victims he had twentyplus years of experience not only in general dentistry but in advanced forensics no doubt prompted by hardys aggressive crossexamination of dr mcinerny rosen went to great lengths not only to establish yamashirus credentials but also the techniques that hed used in the morgue and then in his own lab to exactly correlate the various fissures faults and striations of each tooth in the skull he examined with the dental records of missy damiens after an hour and fortyone minutes of this excruciatingly boring detail he finally asked doctor yamashiru what was the correlation between the teeth you examined at the morgue and that of the woman whose records are in court missy damiens one hundred percent youre certain completely thank you doctor rosen turned to hardy your witness hardy blinked himself to a marginally higher state of awareness and stood up your honor i have no questions for this witness with illconcealed relief braun turned to yamashiru thank you doctor you may step down she then looked up bringing in the jury and raised her voice i think weve had enough for today well adjourn until tomorrow morning at nine thirty in the holding cell just behind the back door of the courtoom catherine caged paced like a leopard hardy whod endured complaintsmany justified hed admitabout the family since catherine had gone to jail felt compelled to try and tolerate another round even if he were wrung out and ready to go homeor really back to the office for a minimum of a couple of hours where he would check his mail and email answer urgent calls from other clients and deal with any other outstanding firm business that needed his inputhe had to let her get some of her frustration out because if she didnt blow off steam back here out of sight she might do it in front of the jurors and that would be disastrous so he let her go on unaware that with the tensions of the day his own string was near breaking i was just so conscious of them all day long sitting there in the gallery watching my back my every breath i think and all of them believing i could have done anything like this how could they even think that i dont think they do ha you dont know no i dont thats true she got to one end ofher twelvefoot journey grasped the bars for a moment then pushed off in the other direction shit shit shit what just shit thats what she opened her mouth and let out something between a scream and a growl hey come on catherine calm down i cant calm down i dont want to calm down im locked up for christs sake i might be locked up forever dont you see that she reached the other end turned again catherine stop walking please just for a second he patted the concrete bench next to him come on sit youll feel better she didnt stop walking ive been sitting all day he sighed let the words out under his breath christ you can be a difficult woman she stopped and looked at him youre not mad at me are you no catherine how could i be mad at you i make a simple request for you to sit down so youll feel better and because ive been working all day every day for eight months already on your behalf of course you completely ignore what i want and continue to pace this makes me happy not mad and why because i need the abuse i thrive on abuse if you havent noticed im not abusing you hardy had to chuckle and im not mad at you so were even you continue pacing and ill just sit here not being mad hows that she stared down at him why are you being this way what way calling you on your behavior maybe its because how you behave in the courtroom is going to have an effect on the jury okay but were not in the courtroom now some real anger crept into her tone ive been behaving well in there all day and now if its all the same to you dismas hardy im a little bit frustrated well take it out on me then im a glutton for it here he got to his feet ill stand up be your punching bag go on hit me she squared around on him as though she actually might hardy brought a finger up to his chin touched it a few times right here god youre being awful im not im facilitating getting you in touch with your inner child who wants to hit me youll really feel better i swear this is a real technique they teach in law school in spite of herself she chuckled the anger bleaching out of her her face softening i dont want to hit you dismas we can sit down youre sure i dont want to stem your free expression she lowered herself to the concrete bench its just been a long day she said he looked down at her i hate to say that its only the first one of many but thats the truth we ought to try to keep from fighting im sorry if i pushed you there no i deserved it i pushed you well either way hardy put his hands in his pockets leaned against the bars behind him this is worse for you and im sorry they were in a cell in an otherwise open hallway that ran behind all of the courtrooms every minute or so a uniformed bailiff or two would walk by with another defendant or sometimes an orangesuited line of them in tow the place was lit of course but in some fashion hardy was dimly aware that outside it was close to dark out and still cold down the way somewhere quite possibly in an exact double of the cell in which they sat but invisible to them they both could hear someone crying she sounds so sad catherine said it could be one of my daughters thats what im missing the most the kids she took a deep breath its bad enough now with them having to deal with all that high school nastiness with their mother in jail what they must be going through day to day but what i really agonize about is how its going to affect them in the long run if i wind up she stared at her hands in her lap thats not going to happen hardy said im not going to let that happen down the hall they heard the crying voice suddenly change pitch and scream no no no and then the clank of metal on metal from out of nowhere at the same instant their bailiff opened the courtroom door at the mouth of their cage you want dinner we better get you changed he said wordless catherine hesitated let out a long sigh then resigned she nodded stood up and held out her hands for the cuffs the pediatric heart specialist at kaiser dr aaron trueblood was a short slightly hunchbacked softspoken man in his mid to late sixties now he was sitting across a table from glitsky in a small featureless room in the maternity wing his hands folded in front of him his kindly face fraught with concern treya had been a trouper they got to the hospital well before nine oclock that morning and after eight hours of labor glitsky breathing with her throughout the ordeal she delivered an eightpound twoounce boy they would call zachary crying lustily after his first breath he looked perfectly formed in all his parts glitsky cut the umbilical cord treyas obgyn joyce gavelin gave him apgar scores of eight and nine about as good as it gets in a bit under an hour though the euphoria of the successful delivery gave way to a suddenly urgent con cern dr gavelin had the usual postpartum dutiesthe episiotomy delivering the placenta and so onduring all of which time zachary lay cuddled against his mothers stomach in the delivery room the doctor released mother and baby down to her room in the maternity ward and glitsky walked beside the gurney in the hallway while they went and checked into the private room theyd requested where the hospital would provide a special dinner and where he hoped to spend the night after making sure that treya and zachary were settled the boy took right to breastfeedingglitsky went down the hall to call his father nat to tell him the good news and check up on rachel who was staying with him everything was as it should have been when he came back to treyas room though she was crying and zachary was gone dr gavelin had come in for a more formal secondary examination of the newborn but what began as a routine and cursory procedure changed as soon as she pressed her stethoscope to the babys chest immediately her normally upbeat cheerleader demeanor underwent a transformation what is it joyce talk to me is everything all right but dr gavelin frowning now held up a hand to quiet treya and moved the stethoscope to another location on the babys chest then another another around to his back she let out a long breath and closed her eyes briefly perhaps against the pain she was about to inflict i dont want to worry you treya but your little boys got a heart murmur she said id like to have one of my colleagues give a listen and maybe run a couple of tests on him well need to take zachary away for a while take him away what for the doctor put what she might have hoped was a comforting hand on treyas arm as i said to run a few tests shoot some xrays maybe get a little better sense of the cause of the murmur weve got a terrific pediatric cardiologist couldnt you just do it here have somebody come down i dont think so well want to do an xray and an echocardiogram at least and then maybe some other testing what kind of testing to get a handle on what we might be dealing with treya but you just said it was a murmur arent murmurs fairly common some kinds yes but not this kind dr gavelin hadnt moved her hand and now she squeezed treyas arm i dont know she said gently thats why i want to have a specialist look at him and then somehow by the time glitsky got back from his phone call zachary was gone sometime later the volunteer maternity staff people wheeled in the special dinner that had been ordered for this room and seemed confused that the baby wasnt with the parents who were both on the bed silent clearly distraught each holding the others hands they didnt even look at the food finally when the orderlies came back to remove the untouched trays glitsky decided he had to move he didnt have any idea how long he and treya had been sitting together waiting but suddenly he had to get proactive he needed to get information like first where was his son and what exactly was wrong with him he told treya that hed be back when hed learned something and walked out into the hallway he at once had recognized gavelin and an older man approaching heads down in consultation one of them must have looked up and seen him because without exchanging too many words it seems that they decided that joyce would go back in to talk to treya and the other doctorthe stooped sad and kindlooking onewould break the news to glitsky too worried to argue the logisticswhy werent they seeing him and treya togetherhe followed trueblood into the tiny room but they werent even seated when glitsky said when can i see my son i cant tell you that exactly glitsky recognized something in truebloods voicethe same sympathetic but oddly disembodied tone hed used numerous times before when he had to inform relatives about the death of someone in their family he knew that your words had to be clear and carefully chosen to forestall denial you were recounting an objective fact that could not be undone painful as it was to hear at that toneby itselfglitsky felt his heart contract in panics grip truebloods next words even more gently expressed were a depth charge in his psyche im sorry but this may be very serious you mean he might die trueblood hesitated then nodded its not impossible were still not sure exactly what were dealing with arguing as though it would change anything glitsky said but my wife said it was just a murmur truebloods redrimmed exhausted unfathomably cheerless eyes held glitskys his hands were folded in front of him on the table and he spoke with an exaggerated care yes but there are different kinds of murmurs your sons zacharys is a very loud murmur he said now this can mean one of two thingsthe first not very good and the second very bad so not very good is the best that were talking about trueblood nodded he piled the words up as glitsky struggled to comprehend it could be and this is the not very good option that its just a hole in his heart just a matteroffact nod its called a vsd a ventricular septal defect its a very small pinholesized hole that can produce a murmur of this volume sometimes so the very bad option is more likely statistically with this type of murmur perhaps slightly glitsky couldnt hold his head up anymore they shouldnt have tried for this baby he shouldnt have let treya talk him into it she was already in love with it with him with zachary as was glitsky himself after the long wait to welcome him in only a couple of hours zachary had moved into their hearts and minds and not just the thought of him the presence the person but trueblood was going on in any event the other option is called aortic stenosis which in a newborn can be very difficult to correct he let the statement hang between them for a second but thats what were testing to see now weve xrayed the heart already and it doesnt seem to be enlarged which is the most obvious sign of aortic stenosis glitsky grasping at anything resembling hope said and youre saying it doesnt seem enlarged no but at his age well need to analyze the xrays more closely a heart that size were talking millimeters of difference between healthy and damaged well need to have a radiologist give us a definitive read on it and when will that be weve got a call in for someone right now but he may not get his messages until morning in any case it wont be for a few hours at best and the echocardiogram couldnt be scheduled until tomorrow we felt we had to talk to you and your wife before then glitsky met the doctors eyes again what if its the vsd the hole in the heart the better option well if its a big hole we operate but i dont think its a big one why not the murmur is too loud its either a tiny tiny hole or or aortic stenosis a death sentence not necessarily not always but most of the time not infrequently so what about this tiny hole what do you do with that we just let it alone as long as we can sometimes they close up by themselves sometimes they never do but they dont affect the persons life but if the hole does cause problems we can operate on the heart yes openheart surgery yes thats what it is and its successful a vast majority of the time glitsky was trying to analyze it all fit it in somewhere so best case were looking at heart surgery is that what youre saying no best case is a tiny hole that closes by itself and how often does that happen trueblood paused about one out of eight well have a better idea by the morning glitsky spoke half to himself what are we supposed to do until then the doctor knew the bitter truth of his suggestion but it was the only thing he could bring himself to say you might pray that its only a hole in his heart only a hole in his heart thats the best we can hope for considering the alternative that would be good news yes it was eight thirty and hardy told himself that he should close the shop and go home he reached up and turned the switch on the green bankers lamp that hed been reading under his office and the lobby through his open door were now dark a wash of indirect light from down the associates hallway kept the place from utter blackness but he felt effectively isolated and alone it wasnt a bad way to feel he knew he could call yet wah and have his shrimp lo mein order waiting for him by the time he got there but something rendered him immobile and hed learned over the years to trust these intuitive inclinations especially when he was in trial the primary reality in a trial like this is that there was just too much to remember you could have pretty damned close to a photographic memory as hardy did and still find yourself struggling to remember a fact a detail a snatch of conflicting testimony the big picture the individual witness strategies the evidence trail the alternative theoriesto keep all these straight and reasonably accessible some unconscious process prompted him to shut down from time to timeto let his mind go empty and see what claimed his attention it was almost always something hed once known and then forgotten or dismissed as unimportant before hed had all the facts and which a new fact or previously unseen connection had suddenly rendered critical once in a while hed use the irrational downtime to leaf through his wall of binders pulling a few down at random and turning pages for snatches of a police report witness testimony photographs other times hed throw dartsno particular game just the back and forth from his throw line to the board and back again tonight he backed his chair away from his desk and simply sat in the dark waiting for inspiration or enlightenment he hadnt noticed her approach but a female figure was suddenly standing in the doorway she reached for the doorknob and started to pull the door closed hello hardy said oh sorry the voice of gina roake his other partner diz is that you i saw your door open i thought youd left and forgotten to close it nope still here a pause are you all right first day of trial i hear you howd it go you can flip on the light if you want im not coming up with anything it went okay i think i hope i even got a little bonus from strouts testimony so maybe i should declare victory and go home but roake didnt turn on the room lights her silhouette leaned against the doorpost arms crossed over her chest except except i dont know i was waiting for a lightning bolt or something to illuminate the darkness right but not happening its the first day roake said its too soon it never happens on the first day youre probably right hardy admitted i just thought it might this time and why would that be because catherine didnt he stopped didnt what thats it okay i give up what i told her she wouldnt spend the rest of her life in jail spontaneously that i wouldnt let that happen silent roake shifted at the doorpost i dont think she did it gina thats why i said that she didnt do it but gina had been in more than a few trials herself well youd better defend her as though you think she did sure of course thats about all ive been thinking about all these months how to get her off there you go but its all been strategy get the jury to go for murdersuicide play up the harassment angle with cuneo hammer the weak evidence right all of the above but the bottom line is somebody else did it she snorted the famous other dude no not him a specific human being that ive stopped trying to find roake was silent for a long moment a little free advice sure always defend her as if you believed with all your heart that shes guilty as hell youll feel better later i promise but driving home he couldnt get the idea out of his mind so basic so simple and yet hed been ignoring it for months lost to strategy and the other minutiae of trial preparation if catherine didnt kill them someone else did he had to get that message into the courtroom in front of the jurors in his career hed found nothing else that approached an alternative suspect as a vehicle for doubt it struck him that glitskys failure to get an alternative lead to pursueanother plausible suspect had derailed him from any kind of reliance on the soddit or some other dude did it defense he never had come back to it and he should have because in this case some other dude had done it it wasnt his client it wasnt catherine somehow from the earliest weeks and without any overt admission or even discussion of the question of her objective guilt hardy had become certain of that this was a woman hed known as a girl whom hed loved theyd met nearly every day for months and months now and even with all the life changes for both of them every instinct he had told him that catherine was the same person shed been before hed been with her when she sobbed her way through the sound of music one time the two of them had rescued a rabbit that had been hit by a car shed been a candy striper at sequoia hospital because she wanted to help people who were in pain this woman did not plan and execute a coldblooded killing of her fatherinlaw and his girlfriend and then set the house on fire it just did not happen he couldnt accept the thought of it as any kind of reality every night as he sought parking near his home he would drive up geary and turn north on th avenue the block where he lived he never knewonce or twice a year hed find a spot his house was a twostory standalone victorian wedged between two fourstory apartment buildings with a postagestamp lawn and a white picket fence in front and dwarfed by its neighbors it projected a quaintness and vulnerability that to hardy gave it great curb appeal not that hed ever consider selling it hed owned the place for more than thirty years since just after his divorce from jane and now hed raised his family here he felt that its boards were as much a part of who he was as were his own bones and tonighta sign from the heaven he didnt really believe intwenty feet of unoccupied curb space lay exposed directly in front of his gate automatically assigning to the vision the status of mirage he almost drove right by it before he hit his brakes and backed in he checked his watch saw with some surprise that it was ten after nine realized that he hadnt eaten since his lunchtime lamburger in his home welcoming lights were on in the living room and over the small front porch when he got out of the car he smelled oak logs burning and looked up to see a clean plume of white coming out of the chimney home cuneo didnt hear the telephone ring because he was playing his drums along with wipeout turned up loud he had the cd on repeat and lost track of how many times hed heard the distinctive hyena laugh at the beginning of the track the song was a workout essentially three minutes of fast timekeeping punctuated by solos on the tomtoms midway his sixth or seventh time through the tune cuneo abruptly stopped shirtless shoeless wearing only his gray sweatpants he sat on the stool breathing heavily sweat streaked his torso ran down his face beads of it dropping to the floor in the kitchen he grabbed a can of beer popped the top and drank half of it off in a gulp noticing the blinking light on his phone he crossed over to it and pressed the button dan dan you there pick up if youre there would you its chris rosen okay youre not there call me when you get in anytime im up late cuneo finished his beer went in to take a shower came out afterward wrapped in a towel armed with another cold one he sat at his kitchen table and punched up rosens numbers hey its me you called yeah i did i just wanted to make sure you were still cool about this glitsky thing totally i mean today earlier it just pissed me off thats all it still does but what am i gonna do well thats what i wanted to talk to you about what youre going to do nothing thats what you said right its what i said yes but ive been reconsidering maybe we can spin this sexual thing back at them i mean everybody already believes hardys poking her right so shes the loose one shes easy get it rosen gave cuneo a moment to let the idea sink in i mean isnt she the kind of woman who would have made the first move we didnt want to bring it up before because well i mean what would be the point try her on the evidence not on innuendo or her personal habits more professional blah blah blah we didnt want to embarrass her but once they introduce the whole question the jury needs to hear the truth i mean only if it is the truth of courseim not trying to put words into your mouth but if she did come on to you first and you rejected her its your word against hers and youre a cop with an unblemished record and shes a murder suspect if we bring it up first as soon as i get you on the stand you know what im saying cuneo brought the icecold can of beer to his lips his internal motor suddenly shifted into a higher gear accelerating now on the straightaway instead of straining up a steep grade hed never done anything to harass catherine hanover he knew it whatever it was had been her imagination and her lies not him he was sure of that lets see how she liked it for the first couple of hardys murder trials frannie had tried to have some kind of dinner waiting for him when he got home she went to some lengths to try to time his arrival at home to coincide with dinner being done so that they could sit down as a family togetherthe sacred ritual especially when the kids had been younger but the effort turned out to be more a source of frustration than anything else try as he might hardy couldnt predict when hed get home with any regularity it was another of the many things in their daily lives that was out of their control aspects not as ideal as they had once imagined it and yet were part and parcel of this constantly evolving thing called a marriage tonight as hardy stood at the stove and frannie in jeans and a white sweater and tennis shoes sat on the kitchen counter with her ankles crossed watching him neither of them remembered the growing pains of the dinner issue that had led them here hardy was in trial so he was responsible for his own meals that was the deal because it was the only thing that made any sense from frannies perspective the best thing about hardys cooking was that it was all onepotor more specifically onepan he never messed up the kitchen or created a sinkful of dishes this was because he was genetically predisposed to cook everything he ate in the teninch gleamingblack castiron frying pan that had been the one item hed taken from his parents house when hed gone away to college ignoring his own admonition to keep the iron from the barest kiss of water lest it rust she noticed that he was steaming rice as the basis of his current masterpiece covering the pan with a wok lid that was slightly too small talking about the usual daily kid and home trivia interspersed with trial talk and then some more trial talk and once in a while a word about the trial shed watched him add a can of tuna to the rice then a lot of pepper and salt a few shakes of dried onions a small jar of pimentos a spoonful of mayonnaise some green olives a shot of tequila finally she could take it no more what are you making she said he half turned i havent named it yet i could make you immortal and call it frannies delight or something if you want lets go with something now what are you putting in there anchovy sauce since when do we have anchovy sauce since i bought it last summer i think maybe two summers ago what does it taste like i dont know i just opened it and yet you just poured about a quarter cup of it into what youre making its the wild man in me youve never even really tasted it nope not until just hardy put a dab on his finger brought it to his mouth now well what primarily he said it smacks of anchovy hardy dipped a spoon and tasted the cooking mixture close were very close he opened the refrigerator nosing around moving a few items i know she said teasing coming over next to him banana yogurt good idea but maybe not he closed the refrigerator and opened the cupboard from which he pulled down a large bottle of tabasco sauce when in doubt he said and shook it vigorously several times over his concoction he then replaced the cover and now simmer gently are you taking a conversation break while you eat this she said or do you have more work if youre offering to sit with me if i dont open binders ill take a break she put a hand on his arm and looked up at him were okay right perfect he leaned down and kissed her were perfect he said arson inspector arnie becker took the oath and sat down in the witness box in a sport coat and dark blue tie over a light blue shirt he looked very much the professional completely at home in the courtroom he canted forward slightly and from hardys perspective this made him appear perhaps eager but this was neither a good nor a bad thing chris rosen stood and took a few steps forward around his table until he was close to the center of the courtroom after establishing beckers credentials and general experience the prosecutor began to get specific inspector becker in general can you describe your duties to the court yes sir in the simplest terms i am responsible for determining the cause of fires basically where and how they started if theres a determination that its a case of arsonthat is a fire thats deliberately setthen my duties extend to other aspects of the crime as well who might have set the fire the development of forensic evidence from sifting the scene that kind of thing do you remember the fire in alamo square at the home of paul hanover on may the twelfth of last year i do i was called to it right away very early on it looked like an obvious arson what was obvious about it there were two dead bodies in the foyer they appeared to have been victims of homicide rather than overcome by the fire the assumption was that someone started the fire to hide the evidence theyd left hardy raised a hand your honor objection speculation braun impatiently shook her head overruled she said rosen ignored the interruption would you please tell us about the bodies well as i say there were two of them they looked like a man and a woman although it was difficult to tell for certain the burning was extensive and the clothes on the tops of their bodies had burned away under them later though we found a few scraps of clothing rosen gave the jury a few seconds to contemplate this visual a common prosecutorial technique to spark outrage and revulsion for the crime in the minds of the panel anything else about the bodies inspector well yes each had a bullet hole in the head and what appeared to be the barrel of a gun was barely visible under the side of the man so that being the case i decided to try to preserve the scene of the crimethe foyer just inside the front dooras carefully as possible and asked the firefighting teams to try to work around that area and were they able to do that pretty much yes sir after producing another easel upon which he showed the jury a succession of drawings and sketches of the lobby the position of the bodies the location of the woundsthe prosecutor definitely favored the showandtell approachrosen took a while walking becker stepbystep through the investigative process and the jury sat spellbound according to the witness the blaze began in the foyer itself the means of combustion in his expert opinion was one of the most effective ones ever inventedordinary newspaper wadded up into a ball about the size of a basketball even without accelerants of any kind a ball of newspaper this size in an averagesize roomand the foyer of hanovers would qualify as thatwould create enough heat to incinerate nearly everything in it and leave no trace of its source you used the term accelerant inspector can you tell us what you mean by that and becker gave a short course finishing with gasoline the accelerant used in this particular fire but with all these other accelerants inspector surely they would burn up in the blaze how can you be sure that this one was gasoline becker loved the question thats the funny thing he said that people always seem to find difficult to understand maybe you can help us then inspector hardy longed to get up and do or say something to put a damper on the lovefest between these two earlier hardy had interviewed becker himself and had found him to be forthcoming and amiable rosens charming act played beautifully herethe jurors were hearing interesting stuff talked about by two really nice guys not only were they giving him nothing to work with if they did get on something worth objecting to and hardy rose to it he would look like he was trying to keep from the jury what this earnest and obviously believable investigator wanted to tell them so he sat there hands folded in front of him his face consciously bland and benign and let becker go on all these accelerants in fact everything needs oxygen to burn so whatever burns has to be in contact with the air but there is only one part of a liquid that can be in contact with the air and that is its surface so what you can have and actually do have in a case like this is the gasoline running over the floor sometimes slightly downhill pooling in places but no matter what its doing the only part of it thats burning is its surface maybe the stuff that isnt burning underneath the liquid soaks into some clothing fabric or into a rug both of those things happened here so we were able to tell exactly what kind of accelerant it was and it was gasoline inspector you used the word exactly surely you dont mean you can tell what type of gasoline it was hardy and catherine were of course both intimately familiar with every nuance of this testimony unable to bear his own silence any longer he leaned over and whispered to her surely he doesnt mean that a wisp of a smile played at catherines mouth thats exactly what i mean becker gushed on explaining the massspectrometer reading the chemical analysis more charts of valero gasoline the pointbypoint comparison finally rosen having established murder and arsonalthough no absolute causal relationship between the twochanged the topic now inspector if we could go back to the night of the fire for a while after you told the firefighters to preserve the crime scene as best you could what did you do then i went outside to direct the arson team he went on to describe the members of this teamanother arson inspector the police personneland their various functions concluding with getting the names and contacts of possible witnesses from people gathered at the scene and why do you want to do that becker seemed to have some trouble understanding the question suddenly his eyes shifted to hardy but he braved a reply well lots of people tend to come to a fire and you never know which of them might have seen something that could prove important sometimes a spectator might not recognize the importance of something theyve seen we just like to have a record of everybody who was there so inspectors can go back and talk to them later the reason for beckers sudden edginess soon revealed itself rosen had obviously rehearsed this part of the testimony to get to this inspector isnt it true that in your experience when arson is involved the arsonist the person who set the fire often comes back to admire his or her handiwork hardy shot up objection your honor no foundation the witness is not a psychologist this was kind of a lame objection since the question was more about what arson inspectors observed than what was in the mind of arson suspects but it sounded good and the judge went for it sustained rosen tried again inspector becker among arson inspectors is it common knowledge that a person who sets a fire hardy wouldnt let him finish objection hearsay and speculation sustained mr rosen ask a specific question or drop this line all right your honor rosen stood still all but mouthing his words first to make sure he got them right inspector in your own experience have you personally ever identified andor arrested an arsonist who had returned to a fire he or she had created hardy was on his feet your honor im sorry but i must object again but rosen this time had made it narrow enough for the judge to accept objection overruled go ahead mr rosen thank you your honor hardy caught a bit of a smirk in the prosecutors face and suddenly realizing his own blunder he tightened down on the muscles in his jaw by objecting time and again to rosens questions hed fallen for the prosecutors bait thus calling the jurys attention to an item they might otherwise have overlooked as unimportant now no one in the courtroom thought it was unimportant and hardy had no one to blame for that but himself rosen asked the reporter to read back the question which she did as hardy lowered himself to his chair the answer of course was yes becker himself had personally had cases where arsonists had returned to or remained at the fire scene at least a dozen times so now you were outside across the street from the fire can you tell the jury what happened next hardy had seen this coming he might have objected on relevance with some chance of being sustained this time but he had a use in mind for the information becker answered yes a woman saw that i was in a command position and she approached me and told me that she was related to the man who owned the burning house do you recognize that woman in this courtroom i do would you point her out for the jury please yes he held out his hand right there at the table let the record show that inspector becker has identified the defendant catherine hanover rosen gave his little bow thank you sir turning to hardy your witness inspector becker hardy said in your testimony you used the word sifted when you talked about recovering evidence from the scene of the fire what did you mean by that in spite of the time hed already been on the stand becker remained fresh and enthusiastic well its not a very hightech procedure but what we do is kind of sweep up and bag everything around a body and then try to identify everything that was at the scene down to pretty small items and you used this technique after the hanover fire yes we did were you looking for anything specific to some extent yes i hoped to find the bullet casings for example hardy feigned surprise you mean you could locate and sift out something that small sure and even smaller than that by the time were through were pretty much down to ash and nothing else and did you in fact find the bullet casings yes two of them yes were there any fingerprints or any other identifying marks on either of the casings yes mr hanovers mr hanovers hardy said not catherine hanovers no what about the gun itself were there fingerprints on the gun yes mr hanovers and some others some others how many others its hard to say there was nothing to compare them with it might have been one person or maybe two or more but did you try to compare them to catherine hanovers fingerprints yes of course and did you get a match no and the other stuff in the house was all burned up in other words inspector becker there is no physical evidence to indicate that catherine hanover had ever touched either the gun that has been identified as the murder weapon or the bullets that were used on the victims is that correct yes no evidence she was ever even near the gun at any time ever none in fact inspector isnt it true that in your careful sifting of all the evidence found in the house after the fire you did not discover any physical evidence that linked catherine hanover either to these murders or for that matter to the fire itself becker answered with a professional calm yes thats true hardy took the cue and half turned to face the jury yes he repeated driving the answer home but he came right back to becker id like to ask you a few questions now about the first time you saw catherine hanover on the night of the fire did you question her not really she came up to me and said she was related to the homes owner that was about it there was really nothing to question her about at that time nothing to question her about did anyone else join the two of you at about this time yes sergeant inspector cuneo arrived from the homicide department which wed called as soon as we discovered the bodies and did inspector cuneo question mrs hanover a little bit yes just a little bit a few minutes as i said there was no real reason to question her yes you did say that and yet inspector cuneo chose to question her your honor rosen said objection wheres this going sergeant cuneo was a homicide inspector called to a crime scene he can talk to anybody he wants for any reason i assume braun said stiffly that your objection then is for relevance in which case ill overrule it hardy took a beat hed gotten in the inference hed wantedthat cuneo basically just wanted to chat up catherine and now he was almost finished inspector becker on that first night that hed seen her did sergeant cuneo express to you any thoughts about catherine hanovers physical appearance as a bonus rosen reacted snorting objecting again braun spoke sharply overruled inspector you may answer the question do you need mr hardy to repeat it hardy with a second chance to put it in front of the jury wasted no time did sergeant cuneo express to you any thoughts about catherine hanovers physical appearance yes he did what did he say he said she was a damn finelooking woman those were his exact words pretty close when hardy got back to his table catherine leaned over and urgently whispered to him what about the ring what ring missys paul gave her an enormous rock if they swept up everything in the room down small enough to find a bullet casing they must have found the ring too right maybe it was still on her finger oh okay youre right id just assumed no its worth asking hardy said although he couldnt have elucidated exactly why he thought so ill go back and ask strout mr hardy braun stared down over her lenses if were not keeping you no sorry your honor braun shifted her gaze to the other table mr rosen call your next witness rosen got to his feet the people call sergeant inspector daniel cuneo hardy put a hand over his clients hand on the defense table gave what he hoped was a reassuring squeeze get ready he whispered this is where it gets ugly glitskys prayers were answered it appeared that it was only a hole in zacharys heart after all it was so small that the doctor thought it might eventually close up on its own although glitsky and treya shouldnt count on that since it was equally possible that it might not but whether it eventually closed up on its own or not zacharys condition required no further immediate medical intervention and neither doctorgavelin nor truebloodsuggested an increased stay in the hospital for either mother or child so paganucci had come out to the hospital with glitskys car and abe and treya were back to their duplex by noon both of them completely wrung out with the stress and uncertainty of the previous twentyfour hours neither had slept for more than an hour or two and they were nowhere near out of the woods yet with their boy there was still some likelihood that hed need open heart surgery in the very near termthe doctors and his parents would have to keep a close eye on his overall development heart size energy level skin colorturning bluish would be a bad sign for example but what had seemed a badodds bet yesterdaythat zachary might be the one child in eight born with this condition able to live a normal life without surgerynow seemed at least possible and that was something to hang on to albeit precariously at least it was not the probable death sentence of aortic stenosis rachel was staying another day with her grandfather nat by pretending that he was going to take a muchneeded nap with her glitsky got treya to lie down in the bedroom with zachary blessedly sleeping in the crib beside her within minutes she too was asleep glitsky got out of bed went into the kitchen turned in a full circle then walked down the hallway by rachels room he checked the back door to make sure it was locked deadbolt in place and came back out to the living room outside a bleak drizzle dotted his picture window but he went to it anyway and stared unseeing at the view of his culdesac below eventually he found himself back in the kitchen apparently hed eaten some crackers and cheesethe crumbs littered the table in front of him he scooped them into his hand dropped them in the sink and punched the message light on his telephone the only call was from dismas hardy wondering where he was telling him that suddenly he had many questions all of them more critical than the location of missy damienss car they needed to talk thered already been a few developments in the first day of the trial that would affect him but more than that he needed to revisit what abe had done to date glitsky looked at the clock on his stove ten after one there was some chance that hardy wouldnt yet be back in court after lunch in some obscure way and despite his pure fatigue glitsky all at once became aware of a sharp spike in his motivation maybe the sense of impotence hed experienced while unseen doctors performed tests on his newborn had upset his equilibrium or was it the fact that now there appeared to be a reasonable chance that his son would be all right that sometimes a cause might appear lost and that this appearance of hopelessness could be a stage on the route to success or even redemption all he knew was that it all seemed of a piece somehow it was time to get back in this game and a critical point he could do it from his home and in a way conducting an investigation from his home would give him another advantage there would be no reporters nobody to witness what he was doing to question who he might talk to rosen and cuneo busy in trial mode would certainly never take any notice everything he did would remain under the radar where he wanted it he reached for the telephone hardys pager told him to leave a number he did that then immediately placed another call to his own office if and when hardy called back theyd coordinate their actions in the meantime missys car was a question even glitsky had failed to ask in fact he realized every strand of his failed investigation up until now had emanated from paul hanoverhis business dealings his politics his personal life to glitskys knowledge neither he nor hardy nor cuneo nor anyone else involved in the case had given the time of day to missy damiens she was just the mistress then the fiancee unimportant in her own right but what if at the very least it was somewhere he hadnt looked and nowhere else had yielded any results deputy chief glitskys office melissa its me abe his secretary lowered her voice how are you and treya both of us are pretty tired but all right a pause and the baby tompaganuccitom said glitsky cut her off zacks going to be fine zack of course tom didnt know what you called him she was obviously spreading the news to the rest of his administrative staff his name is zachary now she was back with him thank god hes all right weve all been sick here wondering well to avoid going into any more detail at the moment glitsky switched to business listen though the reason i called youre not working are you im trying to melissa but youve got the computer id like you to run a name and vehicle ro registered ownerfor me on a michelle damiens d apostrophe hardy felt the vibration of the pager in his belt but he was in the middle of an uncomfortable discussion with catherines husband hardy had originally intended to huddle with catherine in the holding cell during the lunch recess but had noticed that mary and will were the only family members whod made it to the courtroom today and he needed to talk to both of them separately and sooner rather than later so he cut his time with catherine short and was waiting at the defense table when the brother and sister got back from their lunch together they had nearly a half hour before court would be back in session so he walked back and said hello and asked will if he could spare a minute then mary when he and will were finished if there was time so although obviously unhappy about this unexpected ambushwill thought he knew what it was about money and he was righthe accompanied hardy back up to his table inside the bullpen both men sat down so will began with a not entirely convincing show of sincerity how can i help you hed given hardy a retainer of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars eight months before between hardys hourly rate the billable time his associates and paralegals had spent drafting motions and preparing briefs the large and longrunning newspaper advertisements to try and locate the girl whod run out of gas in the presidio the fees for filings and his jury consultant and the private investigator hardy had hired to find out the truth about will and his secretary an irony will would certainly not have appreciated had he known the retainer was long gone now will was past due on his last two monthly invoices nearly forty thousand dollars the point is hardy said after a short recap and overview i dont want this billing issue to interfere with my defense but we discussed this you remember when i first signed on how it was going to get more expensive when it got to the trial not that its exactly been cheap up until now no granted murder trials are expensive even at the familyandfriends rates youre enjoying will chuckled enjoying i like that hardy shrugged id hope so since its saved you nearly sixty thousand dollars so far but even so i wanted to ask you if there was a financial problem frankly it makes me uncomfortable to be here in the first days of the trial and have my client so far behind in payments its not that far is it sixty days hardy waved that off but thats not the issue the issue is that i know youve come into quite a large sum of money recently im assuming youve got significant cash flow so thats not the problem and meanwhile im going ahead with my defense of your wife and youre not paying your legal bills well i please let me finish i find this conversation as difficult as you do believe me but i told you coming in that my trial day fees are three times my normal billing rates and at the time you said that sounded reasonable its still reasonable but i want to tell you youre going to get whiplash from sticker shock next month if you dont keep up on these monthly payments are you saying youre raising your rates now not at all its all in the contract we signed last june but the trial has started and that changes everything hardy leaned in closer and lowered his voice you may not realize it will but its standard practice among criminal attorneys to get the entire cost of the defense up front you know why that is because a client who gets convicted often loses his motivation to pay his lawyer anymore now i didnt make that demand with you and catherine because of the personal connection but im beginning to wonder if maybe i should have will hanovers eyes were flashing around the courtroom and when they came back to hardy hed obviously decided to be shocked and outraged youve got some balls trying to shake me down at a time like this ive paid you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars already up front if thats not good faith i dont know what is it was then hardy said this is now and i wanted to put you on notice that its becoming a big issue or what youll quit youd abandon catherine over a late payment youve got to be kidding me hardy didnt rise to the question instead he said what might be easiest is if you provide another retainer like the first one youre out of your mind hardy didnt pause like the first one to cover what you owe and get us through this month if the trial goes on that long and then to begin the appeals process if we need it if we need an appeal in other words if you lose thats right hardys voice was calm we wont need to appeal if we win well im not writing you a check for another hundred and fifty thousand dollars on that off chance ill tell you that and you can take that to the bank hardy pushed himself away from the table draped an arm over the back of his chair and looked into the callow and handsome face with an air of sadness he came forward again will i know that youre through with catherine however this comes out i appreciate you coming down here to trial and putting on the face of the good husband but i also think i know why youre really doing it and thats because you dont want to lose the respect of your kids will shook his head in disgust ive had enough of this you dont know what youre talking about he started to stand up im talking about karyn harris will your secretary sitting back down he said theres nothing between me and karyn harris hardy nodded thats been the party line anyway that youve worked so hard to keep from your kids you werent having an affair it was just catherine who was crazed right right defiant still and so to your kids youre still the good guy arent you the dad they can trust whos holding the whole thing together thats right but what if they found out youve been lying to them the whole time too how would they feel about that about you i havent been lying to them there was no affair hardy stared at him for several seconds when he spoke there was no threat to his voice or in his manner it was more the measured tones of disappointment that things between them had come to this pass will he said do yourself a favor take a look at the statements ive sent you over the past months youre going to notice payments totaling about five grand to an entity called the hunt club you know what that is no its a privateinvestigator service wills initial expression of disdain turned to disbelief and then a distillate of fear itself hardy went on if you werent having an affair one of the things i considered early on was that you had the same motive to kill your father as catherine did youd gone to some lengths to create an airtight alibi you would have been perfect so i had to know you see if you were really in san francisco on may twelfth or down south he let the words hang in the air between them understand that i dont have to bring up any of this for catherines sake and really never planned to for my purposes its enough that catherine believed you were being unfaithful and suddenly she needed to go see paul to find out where a divorce would leave her but if you in fact were having this affair and the jury knew it they might view catherine in a more sympathetic light and all other things being equal thats always to the good wills hands were shaking his color had gone gray youre blackmailing me he said ive had this for four months if i was blackmailing you i would have started then will glanced back at the gallery which had started to fill for the afternoon session in the bullpen the popular court reporter jan saunders was sharing a laugh with a bailiff several of the jurors had wandered back in and taken their seats where is all this stuff he asked locked away hardy said no one ever has to see it no one ever will hardy kept his poker face straight no one would ever see the documentation of wills affair with his secretary because it didnt exist the hunt club had come to the conclusion that will and karyn had spent their four days aboard the kingfisher the captain of that boat morgan bayley wasnt talkinghardys private investigator was of the opinion that the newly wealthy will hanover had sent him a quiet bundle of cash to keep his mouth shut and had given karyn a nice raise hardy was running a pure bluff and wasnt one hundred percent sure he was right until will stood up and growled down at him youll get your fucking check by the weekend sergeant cuneo did you have a specific reason to question the defendant on the night of the fire yes i did and what was that well i was called to the scene to investigate a double homicide the defendant said that she was related to the owner of the house that alone justified talking to her but she also admitted that shed been to the house that afternoon and had talked to mr hanover did she say what theyd talked about at first yes she said theyd talked about family matters but when i asked her if she could be more specific she became evasive evasive hardy stood up with an objection objection witness is offering a conclusion braun overruled him and rosen barely noticed the interruption when you asked the defendant to be more specific about these family matters what did she say she asked why i wanted to know and what did you tell her i said i was going to need to know everything that happened in paul hanovers last hours which included what shed talked to him about and did she then go into the substance of her discussion with mr hanover no she did not did you specifically ask her about this yes probably half a dozen different ways and she did not answer not the substance of the questions no she kept saying its private or that was between me and paul or i cant think about that right now did you press her on this issue no not really why not because she was obviously distraught over the fire shed acted like shed just learned that her fatherinlaw her childrens grandfather was probably dead she became very upset after a while at the time i thought she had a pretty good reason i decided to let it go hardy thought this was pretty good rosen letting cuneo present himself as sensitive and empathetic and now he was going on all right now inspector did you have occasion to notice anything specific about the physical person of the defendant of course im supposed to notice things its my job i checked out her clothes and what was she wearing hardy squirmed in his chair he wanted to break this up object on relevance but he knew that braun would overrule him catherine had been wearing what shed been wearing and there wasnt anything he could do about that now a blue blouse under a leather jacket and jeans would you please tell the jury why you particularly recall the defendants clothing that night sure accommodating cuneo faced the panel hardy wondered if he might have taken a valium or two during the lunch recess there was little sign of the trademark jitteriness hed exhibited before the break when we interviewed witnesses later someone described a woman who had left paul hanovers house just before the fire wearing a blue blouse under a leather jacket and jeans but you didnt know that on the night of the fire no rosen wore his satisfaction on his sleeve he paused for a drink of water then came back to his witness sergeant we may as well address this question now did you make a comment to inspector becker about the defendants attractiveness cuneo handled it well theyd obviously rehearsed carefully he shrugged with an almost theatrical eloquence i may have i dont remember specifically but if inspector becker said i said something of that nature i probably did does a remark like that seem out of place to you in that context at the scene of a fire and double murder i dont know i dont even remember saying it or thinking about it it was a nonevent all right sergeant moving along on the day after the fire did you see the defendant yes i went to her house and what was your specific purpose on that visit i had two reasons first shed mentioned the night before that the victims had been fighting and i wanted to find out a little more about that second i wanted to get some answers about the family issues shed talked to him about at that time did you consider her a suspect here cuneo showed a little humanity to the jury another nice move that early on he said with a smile everybodys a suspect then he got serious but no the defendant wasnt particularly a suspect at that time okay and did you get to ask your questions no why not because right after she asked me inside and offered me some coffee she told me that shed been talking to deputy chief glitsky for the record you mean abe glitsky san franciscos deputy chief of inspectors thats right how did he know the defendant i dont know rosen threw a perplexed glance at the jury he came back to his witness inspector is it unusual to have a deputy chief personally interview witnesses in a homicide investigation assigned to another inspector ive never seen it happen before never before not once hardy raised a hand your honor asked and answered sustained all right rosen said we may come back to the involvement of deputy chief glitsky in a little while but meanwhile you were with the defendant in her kitchen thats right can you describe for the jury what happened next sure she was in the middle of making homemade pasta noodles and she asked me if i liked them her husband she said was out of town catherine grabbed at hardys arm and started to whisper something to him he couldnt let the jury see her react badly and he all but jumped up raising his voice objection your honor brauns voice was mild merely inquisitive grounds counselor hardys thoughts churned he had gotten to his feet to shut catherine up and to challenge cuneo out of pure rage because he knew the man was lying but these werent grounds for objection relevance braun didnt have to think about it are you guessing counselor i believe youve made a point about this topic yourself in your opening statement objection overruled the gallery behind hardy stirred at the promise of more fireworks rosen smiled up at braun thank you your honor he went back to cuneo all business now inspector but hardy whispered quickly to his client and was again out of his seat cutting off the question your honor making no effort to hide her exasperation braun pulled her glasses down and peered over them yes mr hardy defendant would like to request a short recess at this time request denied mr rosen go ahead but hardy wouldnt be denied your honor may i approach her endurance all but used up braun rolled her eyes then folded her palm upward beckoning hardy forward with a warning look he left the desk came to the base of the podium spoke in a low voice im sorry but my client urgently needs to use the restroom your honor urgently thats a nice touch she whispered furious the judge paused for several more seconds this is beneath you counselor finally she lifted her gavel and brought it down with a snap court will recess for fifteen minutes i cant believe hes just lying like that actually its worse than that hes not saying anything you can deny but i didnt you did you told him will was gone you asked him if he liked homemade pasta youve told me this then ill lie and say i didnt hardy moved his hands up beside his ears dont even privately say that to me please we have got to stick with the truth here its all we have they were in the holding cell five minutes to go in the recess but theyre going to think i wanted to get him close to me so he wouldnt keep investigating around me thats right thats what theyre going to think so how are we going to fight that i dont know that yet catherine i dont know but the most important thing right now the only thing right now is that you cant react in front of the jury dont let them see you do more than look disgusted in the end hardy couldnt keep it from the jury cuneos testimony was that catherine had offered him at least dinner and maybe more hed certainly gotten that impression anyway hed had to rebuff her reminding her that she was a suspect in a murder investigation she did not take the rejection well and scorned had refused to answer any more of his questions after a while hed decided to leave for the first time he began to regard her as a possible suspect and then the damage done on that front rosen brought it back to glitsky im curious inspector did deputy chief glitsky give you any explanation of why he too would be investigating the death of paul hanover hardy stood up objection hearsay and irrelevant mr rosen your honor this goes to deputy chief glitskys bias and motive to skew testimony in this case if he perceives hes under political pressure to obtain a certain result in this case his recollection conduct and testimony are all highly suspect your honor hardy countered the deputy chief hasnt testifiedhes not a witness so far so there is nothing to impeach this testimony if relevant at all only comes in after the witness says something that makes it relevant if that happens later then it happens but its premature right now hardy knew he was going to have to face this sooner or later but he wanted abe to bring it up first have him explain his status in the case in his own terms first and not take the stand already burdened with the jurys preconception that he was somehow suspect hardy knew he was rightthat braun should have waited until there was a foundation to admit the testimony but she wasnt having any the judge took a breath counsel given what ive heard so far im going to let this in now subject to a motion to strike but youre on a short leash here mr rosen keep this very focused hardy didnt like it but the order of testimony was something within the courts discretion rosen had the recorder read the question back to cuneothe gist of which was whether or not glitsky had tried to explain why he would be investigating hanovers death yes he did he said that mayor west asked him to become involved mention of san franciscos mayor brought a pronounced buzz to the gallery but it died quickly no one wanted to miss the next question did he tell you why no sir he was my superior it was a fait accompli i just assumed it was something political and didnt worry too much about it hardy objectedspeculationand braun sustained him but it was a small and insignificant victory amid a string of setbacks and more to come sergeant how did deputy chief glitskys involvement affect your investigation well the most immediate effect was that he warned me off talking to the defendant warned you off rosen displayed his shock and amazement to the jury what do you mean warned you off he said that she was threatening to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against me and if i knew what was good for me i should leave her alone and how did deputy chief glitsky tell you he found out about this she called him did he say why she called him hardy was up again this time citing speculation and hearsay he was sustained again and he took a breath of relief and sat down but rosen never skipped a beat inspector cuneo did the defendant in fact file a sexual harassment complaint against you this of course had been something catherine and hardy had discussed from the beginning in the end theyd decided that to bring the complaint after shed been charged with the murders would only be seen as frankly cynical and duplicitous so theyd opted against it now of course it looked like that might have been the wrong decision cuneo actually broke a tolerant smile he shook his head of course not he said she did not no sir she did not treya and zachary still slept glitsky had no luck running down the car it had not been reported stolen and it was not listed among the citys towed vehicles he had called around to nearby public garages where she might have leased a parking space nothing this in itself glitsky thought was provocative where was the darn thing he placed a call to traffic and ran a check on the booted vehicles and struck out there too odd although he knew it was entirely possible that someone had boosted the car one fine day and then decidedhey a mercedesto keep it damiens being dead and all wouldnt be likely to report it stolen but what glitsky did get was an address where damiens had lived at one time when she registered her car embarrassed for not having discovered it earlier when it had always been as close as a computer check with the dmv he reminded himself that the french woman had never really assumed any prominence in his investigations she was the invisible victim an adjunct to paul hanover nobody in her own right thats probably what she still was he thought but at least here was a trail he hadnt been down it might take him somewhere or maybe it would lead him to eleventh avenue and stop there with something of a start he realized that the place wasnt four blocks from where he sat at his kitchen table in five minutes hed written a note to treya should she wake up he was just taking a walk around the block hed be back in twenty minutes outside the day hadnt gotten any nicer a thick cloud cover hung low over the city and the fine drizzle of an hour before held visibility to a quarter mile or so glitsky wore his favorite weathered brownleather flight jacket with the fauxfur collar he walked with his hands in his pockets taking long strides his shoulders hunched against the cold like most ofthe other buildings in the neighborhood indeed like glitskys ownthe place was an upperlower duplex with damienss address as the streetlevel unit he went to the small covered entryway and rang the doorbell its gong reverberating after no one answered he peered through one of the small glass panes in the door and could make out some furniture a rug and a bookshelf in a home that seemed to be very much like his own hello an old womans tremulous voice with a brooklyn accent echoed down from above and behind him theyre not home theyre working can i help you looking up into the stairway that led to the upper unit he stayed below on the bottom step as a large black man glitsky knew that the welcome mat wasnt automatically out for him he got out his wallet opened it to his badge and said im with the police department do you mind if i come up theyre not in trouble are they they seem like such nice people then with another thought or dead are they oy tell me theyre not dead god not again glitsky stopped on the fifth step again my last tenant missy such a nice girl an officer comes she made a hopeless gesture and just like that he tells me shes gone lost in a fire until this moment glitsky had been under the impression that hanovers fiancee had been residing at the house on alamo square but apparently she had kept this address as well still he wanted to be sure missy damiens youre talking about god rest her soul yes he touched the mezuzah on the doorpost youre jewish i see so am i she squinted at him not at all sure she believed him abraham glitsky he extended his hand which she gingerly took ruth guthrie and actually i was hoping to talk to somebody about missy damiens she was squinting at him youre really jewish baruch atah adonai he said glitsky had had his bar mitzvah many years before and he attended synagogue with his father several times a year the high holy days he could still spout liturgical hebrew when the occasion demanded his scarred and weathered face worked its way to a smile well come in then out of this soup mrs guthrie said can i get you something warm some coffee maybe tea tea sounds good thank you go in sit sit im right behind you taking a seat in one of the slipcovered chairs in the living room he heard her running water in the kitchen then the click click click of the gas starter on the stove in less than a minute she appeared with empty cups and saucers sugar and cream and some cookies on a tray when the kettle whistles youll excuse me she sat down so you own this place he asked since if you can believe my nat bought it as an investment nat glitsky said my fathers name is nat too she pointed at him now you are teasing me he held up his right hand i swear to you after a second or two she decided to believe him she sat back on the couch all right abraham son of nathaniel how can i help you it didnt take him three minutes to acquaint her with where he was this wasnt really official she might have even seen something about the case in the newspapers over the past months but there were some other issues about paul hanovers estate that related to missy damiens unfortunately all efforts to contact her next of kin had been in vain i know some of your police colleagues came and asked me about that right after it happened but i didnt know anybody else who knew her when she moved in here did she fill out any paperwork sure nat always said trust everybody but make sure they sign the papers so she had references mrs guthrie gave a sad little laugh for all the good what do you mean well they were all in french she read them to me in english translated but you know she could just as well have made them all up what am i going to do call and check references anyway nat was gone and she seemed nice and she had the money ahh theres the whistle she went again to the kitchen glitsky got up and followed her so she had a job yes where was it now she poured the water into a kettle lipton okay fine he said her job just a minute its coming she turned and led him back to the living room ah ha here it is she exclaimed whats the name of that place arrgh ah beds and linens and things something like that you know the one almost downtown glitsky did know it it was a huge warehouse store for household goods with perhaps hundreds of employees glitsky thinking that this would be the next step in this trail found himself asking if she paid her rent with checks mrs guthrie thought sipped tea and said yes you wouldnt have kept any of the stubs would you she might have had something left in the bank when she died she nodded another thing nat said you dont throw it away you store it god bless him he was right those tax bastards but wait it was just last year right her folder would still be right here in my files in the courtroom cuneo was still on the stand as rosens witness the fireworks from his earlier testimony were mere prologue they hadnt even gotten to any of the evidence but after another recess that was about to change inspector cuneo were you specifically looking for something when you made your search of the defendants home of course you cant get a warrant without a list of specific items youre looking for cuneo and the jury were already on familiar terms now the helpful instructor he turned to face the panel the list of items youre looking for its part of the search warrant okay rosen said and what did you list on the warrant for your first search the clothes shed been wearing on the night of the fire and you found such clothing yes in the closet and also the hamper in the master bedroom the tennis shoes shed been wearing along with the pants and the blue shirt rosen had the clothing in the courtroom separated into three plastic bags after cuneo had identified each of them rosen had them entered as the next peoples exhibits after the gun the casings one of the bullet slugs theyd recoveredtheyd now gotten to numbers and then he came back to his witness and what did you do with these items delivered them to the police lab to look for gunshot residue bloodstains or gasoline and was the lab successful in this search partially cuneo said there were traces of gasoline on the pants and the shoes gasoline thank you rosen didnt pause but walked back to his table picked up a small book and crossed back to the witness box hardy knew what was coming nextthe diary he really hated anew catherines insistence that heather be excused from testifying it might have caused her some temporary pain true but on the other hand hardy could have made rosen look especially heartless and perhaps even nasty forcing the poor girl to testify against her own mother jury sympathy for catherine and her daughter would have flowed but there was nothing for all that now it was going to play out sergeant rosen continued in a neutral tone do you recognize this item cuneo examined it briefly flipped it open closed it back up i do and would you please tell the jury what it is sure this is heather hanovers diary heather is the defendants youngest daughter while rosen had the diary marked as peoples the gallery came sharply alive with the realization that this was the defendants own daughters diary part of the peoples case inspector rosen asked when did you first see this diary the monday after the fire i was by now considering the defendant my chief suspect and i obtained a second search warrant for documents in her house what kind of documents i wanted to look at her financial records especially but also downloads on the computers telephone bills credit card receipts even postits with shopping lists anything written which of course included diaries like this one that could verify or refute her alibi for the day of the murders the defendant had said her children were away we wanted to check records to substantiate that and what did you learn from this diary heathers diary cuneo turned his head slightly and brought his testimony directly to the jury heather unexpectedly decided to come home after school and was home all that afternoon and night and what had the defendant told you she told me that she came home after her afternoon talk with paul hanover and had stayed there all night until shed seen the news of the fire on television inspector rosen said would you please read from the relevant portion of heather hanovers diary on the day that her grandfather was killed hardy stole a rapid glance at the jury every person on it seemed to be sitting forward in anticipation as hed known it would be this was a damning moment for his defense and doubly so now that he had just ascertained to his own satisfaction that will hanover had in fact been having an affair with his secretary if he could at least demonstrate the truth of that assertion it might lend credence to catherines actions on the night of the fire even if she had originally lied about them as it was though he only had catherines lie no corroboration of the affair and her own daughters handwritten refutation cuneo had opened the little book and now cleared his throat for some reason mom wanted us all out for the night and told us to stay out and get a pizza or something but the homework this week is awesome two tests tomorrowso i told saul to just drop me off here so i could study had to scrounge food since mom was gone again which is like getting to be the norm lately cuneo paused got a nod from the prosecutor and closed the book and did you later talk to the defendants daughter about the entry rosen asked i did and what did she tell you she said she was home alone that night her mother was not home cuneo skipped a beat and added gratuitously the defendant had lied to us hardy didnt bother to object cuneos testimony took up most of the afternoon and braun asked hardy if he would prefer to adjourn for the day rather than begin his crossexamination and have to pick up tomorrow where hed left off today after only a few questions like everything else about a trial there were pros and cons to the decision should he take his first opportunityright nowto attack the facts and impressions of cuneos testimony so that the jury wouldnt go home and get to sleep on it or would it be better to subject the inspector to an uninterrupted crossexamination that might wear him down and get him back to his usual nervous self again in the end and partly because he got the sense that braun would be happier if he chose to adjourn and he wanted to make the judge happy hardy chose the latter so it was only a few minutes past four when he and catherine got to the holding cell behind the courtroom they both sat on the concrete bench hardy hunched over with his head down elbows on his knees what are you thinking she asked im thinking that i wish youd have gone home after you talked to your fatherinlaw i know he looked sideways at her so how did you hear about the fire what do you mean i mean if you werent home watching the news on television and you werent what made you go back to pauls the question stopped her cold i dont know i must have heard it on the radio maybe i had the radio on must have hardy suddenly was sitting up straight and snapped out the words maybe you had the radio on what kind of shit is that its not you went to the fire catherine you were there talking to becker and cuneo what made you decide to go there i im not sure i mean i knew about it of course you can hear something and not remember exactly where youve heard it cant you i was parked outside karyns for i dont know how long that night then i drove all the way out to wills office and nobody was there that late and after that i was just driving around not knowing where to go im sure the radio was on then in the car i must have had it on and when they announced the fire she ran out of words you told both of the inspectors and me that you heard about it on television i did i mean i remember you remember what what you told them or what really happened no both dismasshe ventured to touch his arm dont be this way he pulled away from her got to his feet im not being any way catherine yes but youre scaring me im scaring you i must tell you youre scaring me he sat down again and lowered his voice maybe you dont understand but were looking at something like five hours between when you left pauls the first time and when you came back for the fire youve told me all this time that you went to karyns house and sat outside and waited and waited for her to come home just hoping that shed come home which meant she wasnt with will now im hearing you drove out to god knows where maybemaybe i love thatwith the radio on jesus christ standing again turning away from her he walked over to the bars of the cell and grabbed and held on to them it took a minute but finally he got himself under control came back and sat beside his client you know catherine a lot of thiseverything weve been through together on this its all felt like the right thing because ive taken so much of what you are who you are as a matter of faith youre the first woman i ever loved and i dont want to believe and have never been able to believe that youre capable of what youre charged with here she started to say something but he cut her off no let me finish please i believed you before when you lied to me about this alibi and said you didnt want me to think you were the kind of person who would spy on her husband now i know you are that kind of person and i can accept it and you know what it didnt even really change how i felt about you it was okay lots of us arent perfectyoud be surprised but more lies are something else again lies are the worst lies tear the fabric id rather you just tell me you killed them because then i know who you are and wed work with that catherines hands were clasped in her lap and her tears were falling on them you know who i am an hour ago i would have said that was true now im going to sit here until you tell me something i can believe the silence gained weight as the seconds ticked hardys whole body felt the gravity of it pulling him toward despair he turned his head to see her she hadnt moved her cheeks ran with tears without looking back at him she spoke in a barely audible monotone i did see it on the television he waited i went to a bar they had a tv over the bar what bar harrys on fillmore i stayed parked outside at karyns until it was dark and when she didnt come home i knew she was someplace with will and i just decided it just seemed that i ought to go cheat on him too pay him back that way my kids my girls especially they cant know i did this i dont act that way dismas i never had before but i was in a panic the life id had for twenty years was over i know you see that i dont know what i see hardy said who picked you up thats just it i chickened out i had a margarita and talked to some guy for an hour or so but anyway the fire saved me on tv yes you had to go see the fire because it was your fatherinlaws house right and only a few blocks away i had to go she touched his arm again this time leaving it there dismas thats really what happened its what i was doing its why i couldnt say you have to believe me its the truth more tears this time frannies her face was streaked with them as she sat holding zachary treya on one side of her and twoyearold rachel on the other all of them on the couch in the glitskys living room treya still wiped out had nevertheless gotten dressed rachel was uncharacteristically silent picking up the strained atmosphere from the serious adults she sat pressed up against frannie holding her little brothers bootied foot in her own tiny hand as soon as frannie had heard the news she wanted to know what she could do to help at the very least she was bringing dinner over tonight she called her husband at work telling him to meet her at the glitskys as soon as he could get awaysomething was wrong with their new babys heart they might be taking rachel to live with them for a while if that was needed but he looks so perfect she said sniffling i know treya said its just that they dont really know very much yet they know its not aortic stenosis glitsky said but his voice wasnt argumentative he and the guyshis father nat and dismas hardywere arranged on chairs on the other side of the small room glitsky gave everybody a short course on the cardiologists initial visit the two possibilities hed described for zacharys condition with the vsd being the best outcome they could have hoped for so were choosing to believe that were lucky although at the moment i cant say that it feels like it but theyre sure its a hole in his heart hardy asked yes treya said as of this morning but it could change frannie wanted to know well not from being a hole treya said its not going to turn into aortic stenosis if thats what you mean they dont think she added trey glitsky trying to keep her accurate theyre sure of that its not aortic stenosis right now it looks like a benign murmur thats what theyre saying the hard thing treya said is that they cant predict anything yet he could turn blue tomorrow or today or in the next five minutes or never glitsky said maybe his wife agreed or maybe never right nat glitsky in his eighties got up and shuffled across the room time to let the kid get to know his grandpa he said if one of you lovelies would scoot over and give an old man some room who you calling old frannie said making room hardy gave glitsky a sign and the two of them went into the kitchen out of earshot of the rest of them as long as they spoke quietly hardy took the large casserole theyd brought out of its brown paper shopping bag then took the foil off the top frannie had made her worldfamous white macaroni and cheese with sausages it was still warm hardy slipped it into the oven then pulled a head of lettuce out of another bag salad bowl he asked then when glitsky got it out of the cupboard and handed it to him how you holding up a little rocky glitsky let out a long breath it comes and goes the hospital was pretty bad when the doc said i should hope its only a hole in the heart i wanted to kill him hardy was silent hed lost a child once he knew glitsky was going on i just keep telling myself its good news its good news the scar through his lips was getting a workout dealing with the emotion we go in for some more tests tomorrow then well see tomorrow glitsky nodded the first days they like to keep a close watch but they let you go home hes fine at home except if things change i had a few minutes today when i managed not to think about it at all he went on to tell hardy about his unsuccessful efforts to locate missys car but getting her address his talk with ruth guthrie all the while hardy was silently washing the lettuce rinsing it tearing it into bitesize pieces and dropping them into the large wooden bowl after glitsky had gotten through where missy had lived where shed worked and that she had paid her rent from her checking account hardy dropped the last piece of lettuce in the bowl do you have premade salad dressing or should i whip up a batch maybe you didnt hear me glitsky said i heard you im glad it gave you something to do and got your mind off all this stuff here but missy damiens isnt going to matter why not partly because she never has mattered but mostly because catherine changed her alibi today again at the trial no thank god privately with me he met his friends eyes you think she did it i dont think its impossible anymore lets go with that he went over and grabbed a dish towel off the handle of the refrigerator drying his hands he said so now letting her testify looks like it could be a huge mistake why is that because theyll ask her about her alibitheyll have to since theyve already got that she lied about it originally and to answer them shell either perjure herself or change her story again either way a disaster but if she doesnt testify there goes the sexual harassment which was always my theory of why cuneo got on her in the first place and more than that its one the jury might have believed you dont think theyll believe me oh sure theyll believe catherine told you about it but so what if i dont have her take the stand and say it herself then you have nothing to corroborate your account is just plain hearsay and inadmissible you know as well as me to say nothing of the fact that weve already made a big deal about this and were committed so no chance if she doesnt testify and if she does were screwed glitsky was leaning back against the counter arms crossed a deep frown in place i dont want to believe cuneos been right on this all along i dont either but rosens got his eyewitnesses coming up next after my cross on cuneo and thats not going to be pretty either they all say they saw catherine and im beginning to think theyre saying that because they did glitsky remained quiet for a second or two then asked so you think shes got the ring after all the ring yeah missys ring at hardys questioning look he explained ruth guthrie mentioned it today again before i left and i remembered id heard about it way back at the beginning of this thing and i know its never showed up in evidence i was going to call strout about that youre sure it wasnt on the body no possibility i saw the body diz no ring no fingers in fact okay but why would i think catherines got it because if well if shes in fact guilty whoever did it most likely took it off the body the things supposed to be worth what a hundred grand and it hasnt showed up whats that leave somebody took it or it fell off in the fire okay then it would have been in the sweep and maybe becker or one of his men kept it glitsky didnt like that unlikely he said ive been at some of these things and the arson guys log everything so why do you think catherine didnt take it hardy didnt answer right away it was a good question mostly he said because she asked about it only yesterday at the trial i dont think she would have brought it up if she had stolen it but mostly it just occurred to her and she blurted it out thats what it really seemed like im positive it wasnt rehearsed it was like wheres the ring okay glitsky said so how bad is her new alibi no worse than the last one its just that its different why i mean is it plausible could it be true do you think its true hardy brought his hands up to his forehead cause if its true glitsky continued even if its different she still didnt do it hardy looked up at the ceiling shook his head uttered an expletive you need to find the ring glitsky said hardy put the little disagreement hed had with his wife out of his mind of course shed been disappointed that he wasnt coming home after their dinner with the glitskys but she knew what trial time was like shed get over it and so would he but the reality now was that he had to try to talk to mary rodman catherines sisterinlaw shed been in the gallery today and hed wanted to get together with her for a few words but the billing talk with will had trumped that and taken all of hardys time but the unusually rapid pace of the actual trialas opposed to the glacially slow movement of the endless pretrial motions and accretion of evidence over the past monthswas outstripping his efforts to keep a step ahead of the proceedings now merely to keep up he had to effectively utilize every single possible working second in this and the coming days even under that pressure hed felt he needed to see abe and treya tonight to be there if they needed his support but now that mission had been accomplished that message delivered and he was back on the clock on his clients time hed made the original appointment for seven thirty from his office as soon as hed come in from his day in court before hed even checked his messages when he got the call from frannie about meeting at abes for dinner hed called mary again and asked if he could change the time to nine oclock and at precisely that hour he rang her doorbell the rodmans lived in a wellkept brickfronted house on upper masonic hanovers youngest daughter mary like seemingly every other woman involved in this case was gourmet armcandy of a high order over the course of his involvement in this case hardy had come to realize that hanover was one of those men who had an enviable penchant for pulchritude his first wife theresacatherines motherinlawalthough in her seventies and with the personality of a domineering tyrant was still very easy on the eyes a latterday nefertiti both of pauls daughters beth and mary had carried those genes into the next generation catherine perhaps the bestlooking of all of them had married into the family and missy damiens had been about to join it beauty everywhere you looked after introducing hardy again to her husband carlos and her son pablo she led him back out to a tiny sunken living room hardly the size of glitskys but what the room and the house for that matter lacked in size it made up for in charm comfortable burgundy leather wing chairs and highly placed narrow windows bracketed a functional and working fireplace in front of it a dark wine persian rug covered parquet floors theyd artfully framed and tastefully hung several original watercolors mary indicated the couch at the far end of the room from the fireplace and sat at the opposite end of it from hardy like the other hanover women she wore her dark hair long a few inches below her shoulders unlike theresa her mother thoughand catherine for that mattermary was physically petite fragilelooking with somber eyes she wore the same sweater and slacks that shed had on in the courtroom today and little makeup catherine had told hardy that she was the most emotional of the siblings and the most sympathetic somewhat to his surprise she spoke first i have to say you managed to upset my brother pretty badly after lunch is that your approach now that youre in trial to get everybody all worked up hardy asked with a mild curiosity who else is worked up are you well no but will was will wasnt paying me mary i didnt want to have to abandon catherine so i you wouldnt have done that maybe not but lets let that be our secret all right she flashed a weary smile i think hes being horriblewill i meanplaying the kids off her she was always a good mother she shook her head i dont know what to think anymore i never thought they would arrest her and then when they did it just didnt seem real that she would i mean that it would get to a trial with all this incredibly weak evidence against her it just doesnt seem like catherine could have done she trailed off though depressing it was good for hardy to hear this from someone whod been at the trial the whole time if she was thinking this way it was a litmus for the jury the evidence seems bad to you then does it well i know you said that there wasnt any physical evidence and maybe there isnt too much of that but the rest of it the circumstantial evidence thats it i mean that might seem to some people that it points to her doesnt it but it doesnt to you not a question you know catherine better than that dont you she says the two of you are pretty close why else do you think im there in court every day shes got to know that the whole family hasnt abandoned her she bit her lip i mean will and my mother it just seems so cruel i dont know why hes doing that their marriage was on the rocks before he said now with this with her accusations against him its a war i dont know why catherine said all that about wills secretary and him she could have just i dont know kept it between them thats one of the reasons mom is so mad so you dont think will was having the affair i dont know its just all so sordid dont you think i dont want to believe hed lie to his kids though i mean people have affairs and get divorced all the time sure but he doesnt want his kids to think hes the reason for it hed rather they think its her and especially with this thing now at trial this morning cuneo saying she came on to him now the dark eyes flashed that was horrible that mans creepy you see the way hes always moving bouncing jittering like hes on drugs or something theres no way catherine is going to i mean just no but with all these accusations flying i can see where people might not know what to think anymore do you believe catherine yes but i believe will too hes my brother hes my blood thicker than water you know she sighed deeply its like this terrible nightmare i just wish we could all wake up it is like that i know hardy took his opening but listen ive taken enough of your time ive got a specific question i wanted to ask you if you dont mind no of course i dont i mean if it will help catherine great hardy didnt want to let her think about it do you remember back on the afternoon of the fire after catherine had gone to see your dad and found out his plans about missy and the family i was reviewing all of my talks with her the other day all the details shed told me and i came upon the fact that right after shed left your dads housethis was long before the fireshe said she called you do you remember that mary nodded sure i remember that very well she was really upset and what about you i was upset too i suppose but were doing okay here carlos and i i mean i didnt like what dad was doing but didnt see any way that we could stop it then perhaps realizing what shed said she put her hand to her mouth i didnt mean that the way it sounded nobody was going to try to stop anybody it was just a shame thats all dad being so gullible with missy you mean nodding she said but hed made his own money and i guess he could spend it however he wanted the minority opinion in the family but you didnt believe missy loved your father not for a minute okay lets go back to the phone call for a minute why did catherine call you well i guess because were friends we talked all the time our boys are about the same age too so theres that and after she left dads she wanted everybody to know the whole family so we could decide what we were going to do but she and beth arent all that closebeths really serious and not much of a chatterer like meand there was no way catherine was going to call mom so did you call them then yeah mom right away i remember but not beth she hates being bothered at work i should have called catherine back too i realize now and maybe invited her to come out to pablos soccer game and we could have just talked and gotten everything calmed down if id have done that she shook her head anyway i didnt is that all you wanted to ask me about that phone call pretty much he said its part of catherines alibi and i wanted to make sure i had the chronology straight before i put her on the stand this was not even close to true but it sounded plausible and more important mary bought it there is one other thing though sure what can you tell me about the ring she shook her head that stupid ring what do you want to know anything you can think of she thought a minute well it was the dumbest thing dad ever did buying that for her then telling us of course what he paid for it six figures he said like hed finally gotten into some exclusive club but thats really what started all the i mean thats when everybody started taking missy seriously and mom i thought shed die he spent over a hundred thousand dollars on a rock for her finger he never even gave her my mom i mean an engagement ring at all they could only afford a couple of gold bands in those days but then when dad got this this monstrosity for her she shook her head at the memory blew out a sharp breath anyway thats the ring why its come up a couple of times lately no one seems to know where its gone to the fact seemed to strike mary as odd and her face clouded briefly but by then hardy was getting to his feet two minutes later the two of them shook hands outside in the cold night at her front door she closed it behind him and hardy jogged down to where hed parked in his living room at his reading chair the lone light in the house on over his shoulder hardy reviewed his notes on talks hed had long ago with catherines family he was happy to see that his memory hadnt completely deserted him from the outset of this case hed realized that every member of the hanover family had the same motive to kill the patriarch so hed questioned mary beth and will as to their whereabouts at the time of the fire will of course had been out on the ocean somewhere off the coast of california with or without karyn harris beth a consultant with an environmental insurance firm stayed at her office crunching numbers with a team of four other colleagues until nearly eight thirty mary worked in investment banking downtown where shed taken catherines call shed checked her calendar and found that her husband had picked her up from work at quarter past five and the two of them had gone together out to golden gate park to take in their sons six oclock soccer game at the time hed done these interviewsearly in the process late last summerhardy hadnt fully appreciated the degree to which theresa remained involved with her offspring and with the lives and futures of their kids her grandchildren still to date he hadnt ever talked to theresa about what shed been doing on the night of may among the various other dudes hed considered shed somehow never made the list she was merely paul hanovers exwife long estranged from him but evidently still connected enough either to him or to his memory to become enraged about the size and expense of his new fiancees engagement ring and what hardy did finally know now again thanks to his conversation with mary tonight was that mary had called her mother right after shed heard from catherine in the late afternoon of the day paul and missy had been killed about three hours before the fire started hardy closed up his notes binder turned off the back light and walked to his little tool room behind the kitchen where he kept his maps there he looked up theresa hanovers address which was on washington street at scott in pacific heights fifteen blocks in a straight line from alamo square hardy was up at five oclock showered shaved and dressed in a half hour opening the door to his upstairs bedroom he was surprised to see light from the kitchen more surprised to see his daughter rebecca up and dressed for school she sat writing at the dining room table with her schoolbooks spread around her looking up at him she smiled howdy stranger not you too what you know what im in trial its how i support us financially and unfortunately it involves putting in long hours once in a while which is not something i enjoy as much as everyone here at home seems to believe have you eaten no plan to she shrugged i could make you something what are you having just some coffee ill have that too no food you know protein to see you through those grueling school hours she stopped writing smiled up at him again are you having any im an adult he said i have no needs well im eighteen im vaguely aware of that i was there for your birth but whats your point just that im an adult too in many states but here as a fulltime student with energy needs you still need food but not breakfast its the most important meal of the day thats what everybody says but if i eat it every morning ill get fat youll never get fat you work out every day i might stop when you do you can stop eating a pause okay ill have something if you do hardy felt his shoulders relax he walked over and planted a kiss on the top of his daughters head the way you argue you ought to be a lawyer id hate to face you in court abstractedly she reached an arm up and put it around his neck i love you you know even when youre gone a lot but i do miss you i love and miss you too but it cant be helped im going to make hash and eggs she gave him her arch look held up three fingers then turned her hand sideways still three fingers out hardy translating the sign language effortlessly picked up the w and the e and proud of himself said whatever an approving glance not bad she said hardy shrugged for an adult while breakfast cooked in his black pan he went out to the front porch down the front steps and out into a steady dark rain he picked up the chronicle out by the gate then hurried to get back inside in the kitchen he shook the paper out of its plastic wrap and checked under the lid of his pan where the eggs hadnt quite set thinking hed give them another minute or two he dropped the paper on the counter and opened it up though the trial had provided a great deal of sleazoid fodder for the tabloid press as well as a steady if lessthansensational flow of ink as local hard news it hadnt been getting frontpage play to date in the local newspaper so the headline on the front page stopped him cold conspiracy alleged in hanover trial then in smaller but still bold type mayors ties to defense team questioned leaning on the counter with his hands on either side of the paper hardy read the double homicide trial of catherine hanover took an unexpected turn yesterday when one of the prosecutions chief witnesses and the lead inspector on the case homicide sergeant dan cuneo testified that mayor kathy west personally enlisted the aid of deputy chief of inspectors abraham glitsky to direct and perhaps obstruct the police departments investigation of the murders of lobbyistsocialite paul hanover and his fiancee missy damiens questioned after his appearance in the courtroom yesterday sergeant cuneo expanded on the conspiracy theme saying that glitsky and by extension mayor west herself had repeatedly undermined his efforts to apprehend his chief suspect catherine hanover in the slayings last may they cooked up sexual harassment charges against me they told me to keep away from her told me not to do any more interviews tried to direct me to other potential suspects it was a fullcourt press several groups in the city have already expressed outrage over the allegation although the mayor herself has thus far declined to comment marvin allred spokesperson for the urban justice project a police watchdog group has called for a fullscale investigation into the mayors relations with senior police officials the mayors arrogance and sense of entitlement undermine the very basis of our system of justice this peddling and trading of influence in our political leaders is a cancer on the body politic of this city and has to stop he said another half dozen quotes spun the story the same way it wasnt just an accusation anymore strongly implied was proof of a conspiracy cuneos allegations also implicate catherine hanovers defense attorney dismas hardy whose cozy relationship with top cop glitsky and the mayor has long been a subject of conjecture and discussion among hall of justice regulars cuneo went on to say that everybody knows that he dated catherine hanover when they were both in high school theyve been friends since they were kids when it was obvious that she would be my chief suspect he went to his friend the mayor and asked her and their friend glitsky to use all of her influence to keep me away from her luckily it didnt work deputy chief glitsky has not been at work for two days and did not return calls to his office and hardy likewise could not be reached for comment dad are you all right still leaning on his hands the paper spread open under him hardy stood immobile if any of the jury saw this or heard about it were going to ask for a mistrial ive got to or im incompetent now he straightened up pressed a hand to his eyes im going to have to do this all over again and catherine in jail all that time lord his daughter moved up next to him put an arm around his waist he turned back to the front page so she could read the article from the top when she finished she rested her head against him but none of it is remotely true no what makes it so effective is that most of it is true the mayor and abe and i are friends she asked abe to look into the investigation i used to date catherine the facts are fine its just all twisted i especially love where it says that abe hasnt been in the office for two days implying that hes ducking questions when in fact he had a baby born with a hole in his heart you think that might account for it how about your relationship with uncle abe being a source of discussion my cozy relationship and its discussion and conjecture dont forget conjecture i never would but whats that supposed to mean it means were somehow up to no good they both stood over the paper staring down at it so what are you going to do rebecca finally asked well first lets see if i can get the judge to ask if any of the jurors saw this or heard about it do you really want that i dont have a choice its too big to ignore i think i can convince braun to declare a mistrial he nodded if any of the jurors read this and im almost certain at least three of them can read then its extremely prejudicial they get kicked off just for ignoring brauns instructions if they discussed it with the other jurors the whole panel goes suddenly he let out a little yelp of alarm and reached over to uncover his black pan and flick the heat off under it i like a nice crust on hash rebecca squeezed his waist dont worry about that but hardys lapse in timing bothered him ive never ruined anything i cooked in this pan before he said miserably and still havent his daughter responded besides its not ruined its well done same thing its got to be an omen no its a sign besides i hate runny eggs hardy stuck the corner of his spatula into one of the hard yolks well theyre not that and what would it be a sign of she gave it a second perseverance staying in the frying pan even when its too hot the lighthearted feelgood words resonated on some level although hardy couldnt put his finger on it you think he asked positive she said in the passion pit two hours later the attorney and his client sat on either end of the library table that served as the rooms only furnishing this is unbelievable catherine said as she put down the paper whats it going to mean it means we might be able to start over if you want she threw a terrified glance across at him you dont mean from the beginning pretty close i cant do that dismas i couldnt live here that long hardy wasnt so sure that she was exaggerating hed known a lot of people whod gone to jailincluding some who more or less called it homeand most of them went through the original denial of their situation hating every second of the experience but then came to accept the surroundings as the reality of their life over these eight months if anything catherine had come to hate her incarceration more and more each day shed lost the weight because shed all but stopped eating another eight months or more preparing and waiting for another trial might in fact kill her if she didnt kill herself first the year before hardy had had another client try to do that very thing well catherine after we find out if any of the jury has seen this and they have then if i dont move for a mistrialregardless what braun rulesits damn close to malpractice id never sue you for that no but an appellate court might find me incompetent she couldnt argue with that i dont want to stop though i think were doing okay thats heartening you dont honestly catherine i dont know cuneo has he stopped what an idea had occurred to him but he didnt inadvertently want to give catherine any false hope nothing im just thinking weve still got some rocky ground ahead of us you testifying for example he explained his problem with her old and brandnew alibi how the discrepancy would sound to the jurors but i have to testify if im going to talk about cuneo isnt that our whole theory about why he kept coming after me yes initially anyway would a second trial be any different maybe slightly i dont know a venue change might make a difference are you still mad at me the question took him by surprisetalk about irrelevantbut he nodded yep i didnt kill anybody dismas i know you dont like to talk about that youve told me not to go on about it but its the truth it really is and i cant stay in here too much longer ive got to see the end in sight dont do anything stupid catherine i wont but i cant start all this over again hardy boosted himself from the table and walked across to the glassblock walls of the jails attorneyclient visiting room he couldnt remember the last time hed let a trial get so far away from him and now he wasnt sure how to proceed most defense attorneys spend a great deal of their time trying to get delays for their clientsto put off the eventual day of reckoning and the finality of the sentence but catherine didnt want delay couldnt accept it she wanted resolution but if hed tried to deliver on that at the expense of a winnable strategy a shortchange on the evidence issues or a blunder in his refusal to press for an obvious mistrial he stood the very real risk of condemning her to life in prison but maybe he was beginning to think there was another approachlegal but rarely invokedthat could change everything if he could get braun to rule that cuneos statements to the press were a result of deliberate misconduct on the part of the prosecutionie rosen she might give him a mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct in this case catherinehaving once been placed in jeopardy by the statewould under the theory of double jeopardy walk out of the courtroom a free woman they couldnt try her again for the same crimes even if they were capital murder but of course this made it a potentially huge decision for the judge since it would undo the efforts of the grand jury that had issued the indictments as well as those of the district attorney and the police department and there would be an immediate uproar from the conspiracy buffs that somehow the fix was in but catherine cut him off midthought can i ask you something she said from behind him he turned is this true what cuneo says that the mayor asked glitsky to intervene yes why did she do that because she was afraid of your fatherinlaws enemies she thought it might have been about business somehow the citys towing contract and glitsky followed that up til it ended with nothing and all the other leads every one he could find yes how about the political one you mean with the mayor no with the president you know the cabinet thing in the endless reams of newsprint leading up to the trial the nascent potential cabinet appointment naturally got its fifteen minutes of spin and conjecture but no onereporters private investigators or administration officialshad uncovered or revealed anything remotely approaching a connection to hanovers murder many people including hardys investigator had looked and all had concluded that hanover hadnt been involved in anything controversial on the national scene beyond that the nomination process itself had not even formally begunhanovers vetting by the fbi was still at least weeks away when hed been shot hardy shook his head i dont know if glitsky has looked at that specifically why has something occurred to you hardy was more than willing to take anything she could give him a little ripple of concern ran through him here he was nearly a year into his defense of this woman on the third day of her actual trial and in the past two days shed given him not one but two potentially important factsthe ring and the nomination which hed previously given short shrift it brought him up short were his own personal demonshis concern over cuneos conspiracy theory allowing the personal element inevitably to creep into his representation of his old girlfriend the media madness abes personal and professional issueswere these concerns threatening his ability to conduct a competent defense blinding him to other critical facts the basic rule of trial strategy is that you didnt want to be surprised by anything once you got to the courtroom and now in two successive days he realized hed been vulnerable to broadsides twice luckily it had not yet happened in the courtroom but hed obviously been so sloppy in his preparation that it would only be a matter of time it was unconscionablehe ought to go in to braun and get a mistrial declared today and then bow out entirely in waves of selfloathing he realized that hed failed catherine and even failed himself he was unprepared she would go down but catherine was still on the nomination thats what they were fighting about you know the nomination im sorry hardy said who was fighting missy and paul when hardy all but babbling dismas that day dont you remember i said theyd been arguing though it didnt eradicate the disgust hardy was feeling with himself he did realize that hed reread this bit of information the arguing while reviewing his binders last night though he hadnt recognized its relevance if any and didnt even now but catherine was going on thats why missy wasnt there when i was shed left all upset that morning why was she upset because she didnt want paul to go for the nomination why not i think mostly it was the house shed just spent over a year redecorating the place the thought of moving to washington dc i dont really blame her is that what paul told you what that she didnt want to move no he said she was paranoid about the government and their background check which he thought was ridiculous she didnt even want them to start she thought theyd be prejudiced somehow because she was foreign she just didnt want to be involved it scared her he said but paul wanted it the nomination did he want it did paul hanover want national recognition for a lifetime of public and private service does the pope shit in the woods of course he wanted it missy would come around he said they werent going to break up over it they loved each other shed see there wouldnt be anything to worry about he told her that morning that he was going ahead anyway and thats when theyd fought and shed walked out and then come back hardy said in time to get shot this sobered catherine right up i know great timing huh in the end though hardy thought with some relief this at least was an example of a fact to be filed under interesting even fascinating but irrelevant paul and missys argument on the day of their deaths didnt lead either one of them to kill the other someone else had killed them both which left hardy only with the ring and the question of theresa hanovers alibi for the night of the fire but the bailiff now knocked at the door and announced that it was time to go over to the hall hardy in a dangerous emotional state in any event had to bite his tongue to keep from telling the bailiff not to cuff his client that she didnt need that indignity but he knew that this would have been wasted breath the cuffs clicked into place marian braun was a superior court judge when barry bonds was still playing baseball for serra high school down in san mateo her chambers reflected that longevity with an unusual sense of homeyness shed had builtin wooden bookshelves installed all across the back wall put down a couple of nice large rugs to cover the institutional linoleum floor hung several pleasant california landscapes here and there drapes under sconces softened the two window areas and the upholstered furniture for her visitors marked a significant departure from the typical judges chamber setting of a few metal chairs in front of an often imposing and distancing desk but the comfortable physical setting wasnt making anybody in the room more relaxed at the moment to no ones surprise braun had summoned cuneo and counsel for both sides here as soon as her bailiff told her they were all in the courtroom at the same time shed had the bailiffs bring in a copy of the mornings chronicle and told them to instruct the jurors not to speak with each other even casually until she came out into open court now hardy leaned against the bookshelf hands in his pockets and chris rosen held up the wall next to him jan saunders had pulled in her portable chair from the courtroom and was setting up her machine on the coffee table in front of the couch braun silent as a stone buddha sat at her desk sipping coffee and pointedly ignoring everyones entrance as she turned the pages of the mornings paper she was waiting for saunders to be ready to record the discussion and didnt seem inclined to make small talk to cut the tension until that moment arrived in fact to hardy the gathering tension seemed to be her point saunders hit a few keys then cleared her throata prearranged signaland braun glanced at her took a sip of coffee put down her newspaper she looked first at rosen then over to hardy then over to cuneo and finally back to the prosecutor mr rosen do you remember a couple of weeks ago when we were starting with jury selection and i said i didnt want anybody talking to the press about this case rosen pried himself off the wall into a respectful stance yes your honor of course here in the legal world we call that a gag order does that phrase ring a bell yes your honor and since inspector cuneo has been in the courtroom sitting next to you at the prosecution table since the formal start of these proceedings do you think its unreasonable of me to assume that he is part of the prosecutorial team and that therefore the gag order would apply to him as well yes your honor but braun held up a hand stopping his reply and turned to cuneo inspector she began what do you have to say for yourself but rosen rushed to his inspectors protection before cuneo could say a word i dont think inspector cuneo quite recognized the sensational nature of his comments your honor or how they would be taken oh since when does a gag order mean say whatever you want as long as its not sensational and just by the way she turned to cuneo inspector you didnt realize that naming the mayor as a coconspirator to obstruct justice in the case before this court would hit the news cycle cuneo had both hands in his pockets patting his legs inside them judge he said im sorry if its caused a problem but nobody ever told me not to talk to reporters no but ill wager that no one ever told you to wear your trousers here to court today either and yet you did how long have you been a cop two weeks you were sitting there when i imposed the gag order did you figure i was talking to myself the gag order told you not to talk to reporters about this trial while it was going on but judge how about your honor okay your honor but in this case theres reporters all over this trial thank you braun said ive noticed which was the point of the order she shifted her gaze to the prosecutor came back to cuneo shook her head into the pause rosen ventured an excuse you didnt formally call it a gag order at the time your honor if you recall and im sure mr hardy would agree with me you said in the interests of fairness youd like to see us refrain from discussing the case with the media braun stared for a second in frank disbelief thats what a gag order is mr rosen and in any case as soon as we go back outside assuming we proceed with this trial at all which is not at all certain im issuing a formal gag order and sequestering the jury which id very much hoped to avoid shifting at her desk she brought her steely gaze to hardy if we hear what i expect we will hear mr hardy im assuming youre going to request a mistrial perhaps review your changeofvenue motion like rosen hardy came to attention when the judge addressed him that was my intention yes your honor originally braun narrowed her eyes a question but my client is opposed to simply beginning again she doesnt want to spend more time in jail cocking her head braun frowned is that some kind of a joke no your honor did you explain to her the prejudicial nature of inspector cuneos remarks how they could affect the jury even if i query each of them individually which i will do and they deny they read the papers i think i did yes your honor the judge couldnt seem to get her mind wrapped around catherines objection does she know what prejudicial means that to some perhaps quantifiable degree these comments make it more likely that shell spend the rest of her life and not just a few more months in jail yes your honor and yet she still might want to proceed it depends your honor before things went much further braun wanted to poll the jury see where they stood out in the courtroom hardy learned that he was one off on his estimate of the jurys literacynot three but four of them had read the article one claimed to have read only the headline a second said hed only read a couple of lines incredibly two others admitted that theyd read half of the article before realizing that it was about this case no one admitted talking to anyone else about it there were four potentially excludable jurors and only three alternates now they were back in chambers braun talking so its down to you mr hardy what are you asking the court to do were asking for a mistrial your honor with a finding of deliberate prosecutorial misconduct that will bar any further trial because of double jeopardy rosen exploded in true wrath get out of here turning to hardy thats the most outrageous mr rosen the judges voice cracked in the room you will address the court only any more of this arguing with opposing counsel and ill hold you in contempt she pointed a shaking index finger at him and dont think i wont without waiting for any response from rosen she whipsawed back to hardy if memory serves that provision only applies if the prosecution did this on purpose to cause a mistrial is that your contention yes your honor hardy knew what she was going to ask nextwhy would rosen deliberately screw up the case at this point so he could get a mistrialand he rushed ahead to tell her mr rosen obviously wasnt sufficiently prepared the real story of inspector cuneos sexual advances to my client which is going to have a huge impact on the jury comes out in my crossexamination today and suddenly his case weak to begin with but rosen interrupted your honor this is absurd ive got eyewitnesses braun nodded with some impatience which is the main reason why i denied mr hardys nineninefive dont get me started but she wanted to see where hardy was going with this and turned back to him and so because mr rosens case may become potentially more difficult you contend hes trying to to get me to ask for a mistrial yes your honor and why would he want to do that so he can start again fresh more aware of your strategy thats a reach counselor thats not exactly what im saying your honor he wants a mistrial because he cant take the chance of a not guilty verdict in a case this big not if he wants to be da someday my god your honor i dont believe braun held up her hand stopping rosen without saying a word mr hardy what im proposing hardy said is a hearing on the issue the court needs to know who talked to whom and when particularly mr rosen and inspector cuneo but possibly other witnesses and maybe some reporters as well at the end of that hearing defense may ask for a mistrial but i dont want to do that until ive heard the evidence on prosecutorial misconduct and what would this misconduct be specifically breaking the gag order your honor and perjury rosen was beyond fury cuneo looked ready to take a swing at hardy braun hated the whole thing hardy kept talking there is no mention anywhere in the record going all the way back to inspector cuneos grand jury testimonynot in any of his reports nowherethat my client made any inappropriate advances to him i think the court needs to see whether he mentioned these alleged advances to any of his colleagues or anyone else previous to the other day or whether perhaps after a discussion with mr rosen he just made up a new story and then got encouraged to speak to the media to further discredit deputy chief glitsky your honor rosen cut hardy off this is an obscene accusation that will be impossible to prove one way or the other anyway its up to mr hardy to ask for a mistrial if he doesnt choose to do that fine perhaps we replace some jurors who might have read todays articles but then we take our chances out in the courtroom thats what trials are about but braun was mulling sullen i dont need you to remind me how to conduct this case mr rosen now she bit out her words its your witness whos caused us this problem because you obviously failed to keep his enthusiasm in check meanwhile on an issue of this magnitude i wont be ready to make any kind of ruling on mr hardys question until tonight or tomorrow id like to keep this ship afloat if i can but ill be damned if ill let it go on and get reversed on appeal and while were talking about appeal mr hardy perhaps youd best tell us the tactical reasons why you will only accept a mistrial with a finding of deliberate misconduct seems to me that even without that youve got ample grounds that may be your honor hardy said but it may also be that inspector cuneos intemperate comments will work in my clients favor this was the crux and for a second brauns fuse blew they shouldnt work at all goddamn it she whipped on saunders like a snake strike that last then back to hardy cuneos comments to the press werent made in the courtroom under oath they should have no bearing on this case none thats the issue yes your honor braun sat back in her chair stared into the middle distance for a beat came back to hardy im curious how might these allegations help mrs hanover she thinks the conspiracy idea is too farfetched to believe on the face of it the jurys going to think cuneos a presshungry hot dog he brought both other men into his vision which by the way he is cuneo took a threatening step toward hardy while rosen snorted and said well see about that yes we will but this small exchange riled braun even further she straightened her back and raised her voice to a crisp schoolmarmish rebuke you gentlemen will not address each other on the record but only the court is that clear coming forward in her chair she said just so were completely unambiguous here mr hardy the defense isnt requesting a mistrial without a finding of misconduct thats correct your honor meanwhile youre both prepared to proceed today both counsels nodded the judge nodded drew in a deep breath and released it all right she said rising and walking to where her robes hung time to go back to work braun herself had a very tough morning and it didnt measurably improve her already charming disposition after reiterating her gag order to the participants on the record in front of the disgruntled media assembled in the gallery she then nearly set off a riot among several members of the jury when she announced her decision that they would be sequestered for the remainder of the trial until they had reached a verdict or announced they were unable to do so hardy had to like the suggestion that a hung jury was a possibility every little bit helps she wound up dismissing three of themthose who had admitted reading any part of the article though she retained the juror who had only read the headlineand substituted them with two men and one woman none of whom had read the article thus exhausting all the alternate jurors braun didnt want to inadvertently inform the remaining jurors who hadnt read the article what it was about but she cautioned them again that the deliberations and conclusions they would eventually reach in this case must be based only on statements given under oath in the courtroom and evidence submitted to the court they must disregard anything they heard on the news or read in the newspaper before and must not read or listen to anything new and to that end she would be allowing neither television access nor newspaper delivery to the jurors for the duration and this really nearly sparked a mutiny among the panel several days without a television what would they do how could they live one panel member dewayne podesta even asked for and received permission to speak to the court as a representative of the whole jury and he argued that the jurors were good citizens doing their civic duty and didnt the constitution forbid cruel and unusual punishment and if sopodesta really thought it didcertainly deprivation of television qualified eventually braun restored order to the courtroom but the machinations cautions pronouncements and simple business consumed the whole wretched morning when they resumed in the afternoon braun announced they would begin with hardys crossexamination of sergeant cuneo until thenshe slammed her gavelcourt was adjourned glitsky and treya were having opposite reactions to the boulder that had settled on each of their respective hearts with the concern over their babys life in treyas case it might have had something to do with the physical exertions of the birth itself she had been sleeping nearly around the clock since theyd brought zachary home only waking up to feed him and for a couple of hours last night when the hardys and nat had been by glitsky on the other hand hadnt slept for more than a few hours now it was nearly ten oclock on a wednesday morning and hed been awake since first light finally having dozed off sometime a little after two twenty or at least that was the last time he remembered looking at the bedroom clock rita their nannyhousesitter god bless her had made herself available and was back with rachel now and the two of them were watching the television down the kids hallway the sound a barely audible drone their cardiology appointment with zachary was in three hours and sitting at the kitchen table a cold mug of tea untouched in front of him glitsky stared at the clock and wondered how long he should let his wife sleep if she needed another hour maybe more he was inclined to let her take it in the four or so hours since hed gotten out of bed glitsky had of course read the morning paper and made calls to jeff elliot at the chronicle to the mayor to hardy at his office and to his own office the first three had not yet called him back at his private home number his voice mail at work was clogged with reporters and even a few colleaguesincluding he was happy to see chief of police frank batiste offering his encouragement and support but for the most part nothing that happened outside the walls of his home was having much of an impact on him nothing was as important even remotely as important as the immediate health of his son the stark and terrible reality from his perspective all the hopeful talk of bestcase scenario notwithstanding was that the boy likely faced openheart surgery in the next few days or weeks as soon as he was old and stable enough to possibly survive it that possibility hung over him and treya like a thick cloud of dread they might still lose their baby the thought was paralyzing and at the same time acted like a narcotic a numbing agent that worked as a barrier to whatever reaction the events in the real world might otherwise have causedwhether anger or hurt or betrayal clearly the city was getting itself worked up over this alleged conspiracy between himself kathy west dismas hardy and catherine hanover but glitsky felt no sense of urgency to refute any of it or even to respond to the half dozen requests from reporters in various media it was as if it were all happening somewhere else already on television perhaps just another story that would fade when all the facts had come out because it simply wasnt true what was true was that they were taking zachary to the doctors at one oclock to check his progress or lack thereof that as far as glitsky was concerned was the whole world he went to the darkened bedroom for the fifth or sixth time this morning zachary was still swaddled sleeping peacefully treya completely covered in blankets didnt so much as stir coming back into the light he went out to the living room and stood at the windows looking down at the street he was wearing the same clothes hed worn all day yesterday hands in his pockets he stood and listened to the faraway drone of the childrens channel on the television down the hall and watched the rain fall and fall when glitsky first pulled the piece of paper out of his pocket its origin and significance eluded him for a second or two on it was a womans handwriting in pencil barely legible then it came back to him ruth guthrie shed written down the name of the store where missy damiens had worked and her bank and account number last night hardy had said that he doubted that missy damiens was going to matter in the trial and with this mornings blowup in the paper over the conspiracy nonsense it appeared that the case was moving in an entirely new direction one that would further remove either of the victims from the center of attention to say nothing of the missing ring which seemed a much more promising avenue of inquiry still glitsky had discovered something they hadnt known before yesterday and after all the time hed spent on the investigation so far that was provocative in its own right he could follow it up in five minutes and get the last niggling tidbit off his plate at least to his own satisfaction god knew hed worked every other angle of this case trying to break cuneos lock on the apparent facts and hed come up empty a quick phone call or two would close the circle on damiens and then at least he would have been thorough even if as hardy said and glitsky believed it was probably unimportant so he sat on the couch picked up the phone and punched up information not identifying himself as a police officer he finally got to the human resources office at the housing goods warehouse store and said he was an employer checking the reference of a woman whod applied to work for him replying that she was only allowed to verify the dates of employment the woman went on to explain that she wasnt allowed to comment on the quality of the previous employees work or attendance or anything else we have to be very aware of the potential for lawsuits she said if we say anything you wouldnt believe it comes back to bite us thats all right glitsky said i understand that im just verifying the dates of employment all right the name please michelle damiens it says on her resume that she calls herself missy there was a short silence then the woman spoke again did she say she worked at this store this location yes glitsky read off the address why do you ask because i have personally approved the hiring of everybody whos worked here for the past six years and i dont recognize that name ill check my files of course if youll hold on but does she say she worked here for a long while glitsky knew roughly when shed moved into ruth guthries duplex and he took a stab a couple of years starting three years ago so she just left like a year ago now the officious voice reeked with skepticism just one moment please yes a minute later she was back im afraid its not good news she said nobody by the name of michelle or missy damiens has ever worked here some part of hardy thought it was the stuff of comedypodestas notion that asking someone to live without a television for a few days was cruel and unusual punishment would stick with him for a whilebut somehow he failed to find any of it amusing too much was at stake he had too little time abandoning catherine to the holding cell and another jailhouse lunch he ducked out the back door of the hall and took a cab to his office on sutter street on the ride over hed considered calling glitskyhed even punched in the first few numbers of his pagerbut then stopped when he remembered that his friend was bringing his son in to the doctor for tests today he wasnt going to be available to do legwork and legwork was what hardy needed he got out of the cab in front of his office stood still a moment then abruptly turned and entered the garage next to the managing partners spot the elevator allowed him to bypass the main lobby and phyllis and norma his office manager and any and everyone else who would clamor for his attention or in the wake of the article for simple news of what was going on instead he could ride straight to the third floor where his partner wes farrell had his office im afraid i cant diz im busy i really am farrell didnt look busy when hardy had barged into his office after a perfunctory single knock at the door wes was in one of his milder trademark tshirtsdont use no negativesand shooting a yellow nerf ball at the basket hed mounted on his wall what are you busy doing thats a fair question under the circumstances some people shoot darts to meditate your humble servant here shoots hoops youre meditating fiercely im surprised you have to ask wes listen to me hardy sat down on the overstuffed sofa i need to know what catherine hanovers motherinlawher names theresawas doing on the day and night paul got killed why dont you just call and ask her i dont want anybody to ask her directly id prefer she didnt know i was interested in that shes a prosecution witness and wait a minuteyour clients motherinlaw is testifying for the prosecution hardy nodded sweet isnt it i dont know if rosen actually plans to call her but shes on his list against somebody in her own family just the hated daughterinlaw jesus and i thought my motherinlaw was bad you dont have a motherinlaw wes you and sam arent married no my first one we werent exactly close but even so i dont think she would have testified against me to put me in the slammer for life whats she going to say this theresa well thats the thing i havent talked to her personally when i saw her name on the list i asked catherine and she said theresa and she just never got along about anything she wasnt good enough for will she ought to get a job and help support the family she was too strict with the kids you name it wait a minute whose kids are we talking about catherines her own kids what did theresa have to do with them evidently a lot she expected to be a handson grandma if you can believe it she came close to suing them over grandparents visitation rights one of those huh at least the womans a piece of work and of course shes pretending to be a reluctant witness rosen or cuneo just happened to ask her if shed ever heard catherine threaten missy or paul and it just so happened she did it was the truth so what could she say if they called her as a witness she had to tell the truth didnt she its a sacred thing wes said i couldnt agree more hardy replied but the real truth is that theresa wants catherine out of her life out of her sons life out of her grandkids lives and if a few words about catherines motive in front of a jury can help get that done shes on board for it farrell plopped into one of his stuffed chairs okay where would i come in if i did not saying i will you make an appointment to see her as my representative youre helping me out with the trial and wanted to get some sense of her testimony before she got to the stand i thought you said you knew what she was going to say i do but tell her you want to hear it from her and maybe coach her a little maybe we can throw the prosecution a curve ball you know that she needs to tell the truth of course but if theres any way she can somehow help catherines defense shed want to do that too wouldnt she and why exactly when she asks didnt you get around to talking to her before this tell her i really didnt think shed get called and still dont but rosen had talked about some motive witnesses and i thought just to be safe you get the idea so what are you really trying to get at hardy broke a grin i thought youd never ask sergeant cuneo you testified in front of the grand jury before this did you not yes sir and you were under oath yes sir and where was that upstairs in the grand jury room how long did that testimony last cuneo was bouncing already slight but visible tremors erupting through his shoulders every three to five seconds i dont know exactly id guess something like three hours now sergeant in this threehour testimony did you talk about your initial visit to catherine hanovers house yes did you make any mention of catherine making it clear to you that she wanted you to stay for dinner no i dont believe i did no you dont believe you did hardy went back to the defense table gave a confident nod to catherine and picked up some sheets of paper that had been stapled together walking back up to the witness box he handed the stack to cuneo do you recognize these documents sergeant he flipped quickly through the pages these are copies of my reports on this case of your interviews with catherine hanover and others is that correct yes all right now sergeant how long have you been a policeman hardys change in direction caused cuneo a moments pause his eyes flicked over to rosen then back to hardy sixteen years so youve written reports such as the ones you now hold in your hand many times yes yes of course and the purpose of these reports is to memorialize evidence is that right yes good now when you write up these reports you try not to leave out important facts isnt that true cuneos shoulders seemed to be closing in around him his neck sinking down into them he was closing down defensively his next answer came as a brusque nod im sorry sergeant hardy said was that a yes you would never knowingly leave an important fact out of one of your formal police reports another nod this time braun leaned over from the podium answer the questions with words sergeant do you need the question read back again no your honor he leveled a malevolent glare at hardy yes i try to make my reports accurate to keep the press on hardy ignored the answer instead he repeated his exact question using the precise same rhythm tone and level of voice it highlighted the fact that cuneo had not answered the question the first time you would never knowingly leave an important fact out of one of your formal police reports no thank you now did you know that you were going to testify in this case of course and did you know that you would be asked about the reports you submitted yes and that others would rely upon the accuracy of these reports yes so as youve testified was your habit and inclination you tried to make your reports both accurate and complete is that right cuneo continued to wilt if hardy wasnt having such a good time he might have let a little sympathy creep into him and let up a bit but the thought never occurred to him accurate and complete he said and never more so than in the case of a homicide correct yes pulling a page from rosens book hardy went to his table and drank some water returning to his position in front of cuneo he started in again sergeant when you conducted your interview with my client did you taperecord it no i did not so the only record of your conversation with my client is in these reports these complete and accurate reports is that so yes i suppose it is all right then please point out for the jury where in your report you state that catherine asked you to dinner or came on to you in any way cuneos shoulders twitched he stretched his neck flicked his eyes to rosens table cleared his throat i did not include it in the report no sir hardy said no you did not hardy went back to his desk returned to the witness stand with another bunch of paperscuneos grand jury testimony same questions same answers no cuneo hadnt mentioned anything about catherine hanover coming on to him asking him to dinner making inappropriate small talk hardy allowed surprise to play about his face for the jury to see he hoped that by now that the word had spread to the panel that this witness was the reason that they wouldnt be watching any television for the next few days why they would be locked up in their hotel rooms he hoped they were primed to hate him and he was going to give them more detective cuneo he said when deputy chief glitsky conveyed to you my clients complaint about your conduct you denied that any such exchange ever took place didnt you yes i did i didnt want to thank you in fact sergeant the very first time you ever claimed that my client made an improper sexual advance to you was after she made her complaint to glitsky isnt that a fact i dont know im not sure of the exact timing all right then how about the first time on the record that you mentioned her invitation to dinner wasnt it when you were on the stand here just before this crossexamination it may have been yes or no sergeant i believe so ill take that as a yes when you were on the stand under oath like you were under oath at the grand jury your honor objection badgering the witness braun nodded all right sustained mr hardy im sure sergeant cuneo realizes when he is under oath thank you your honor i just wanted to make sure your honor rosen again sustained braun glared down from the bench dont get cute mr hardy im warning you hardy straightfaced i apologize your honor he came back to the witness so sergeant did you remember the alleged invitation before you took the stand of course i remembered it and yet you did not mention it why was that i didnt think it mattered you didnt think it mattered i didnt think it would be part of the case besides nobody asked me about it that might explain why it didnt come up in your threehour testimony by the way there was no defense lawyer at the grand jury was there no no one to ask you the sort of questions im asking now hardy didnt wait for the answer no one to challenge your account of what took place no would it be fair to say sergeant that you could talk about anything you wanted to the grand jury and no one would hear the other side of the story could it be sergeant that you never brought up the incident because catherine hanover did not in fact extend any such invitation no she did she did can you recall her exact wording i dont think so it was almost a year ago she asked me if i liked homemade pasta and said her husband wasnt going to be home ah her husband since he was the son of the deceased werent you interested in his whereabouts yes of course since youve told the jury that everyone was a suspect at the time was will hanover a potential suspect as well yes and did you ask his wife where he was the questions were flying fast now in a rhythm and cuneo answered without any forethought yes and wasnt it this sergeant hardy continued your question about her husbands whereabouts and not an improper advance that prompted catherines admission that her husband was gone and wouldnt be home for a few more days suddenly cuneo straightened up in the witness box i took it as an improper advance obviously you did was that because this kind of thing had happened to you before rosen must have been waiting for his chance to break it up and this was it objection his voice had taken on some heat irrelevant but hardy wasnt going to let this go without a fight not at all your honor he jumped in this jury needs to hear if other female witnesses have found sergeant cuneo irresistible your honor rosen was frankly booming now outraged anew i object bam bam bam brauns gavel crashed down again and again counsel counsel come to order both of you approach the bench when they were before her she fixed them with a frozen gaze thats it from both of you last warning clear it might be clear but that wasnt the point to rosen your honor he began this line of questioning i heard you mr rosen im going to sustain your objection and instruct the jury to disregard any innuendo contained in the question mr hardy this is my second warning to you in the last ten minutes there wont be a third now were going to take a short break and let everybody calm down she looked over the lawyers heads to the gallery slammed down her gavel again fiveminute recess she said hardy hated to leave off on the sexual harassment but he knew hed be able to come back to it meanwhile hed soon be talking to eyewitnesses whod identified catherine and the jury needed to understand how cuneos methods in securing those identifications had been flawed so he walked back to his table and picked up a small manila folder it looked like the kind you could get in any officesupply store but one side had six holes cut in it through the holes you could see six color photos three on top three on the bottom each was a front mug shotstyle color likeness of a young womans face the women were all brunette all of a similar age and hairstyle none wore jewelry none were smiling or had their mouths open there was no writing nothing distinguished one photo from the others except the facial features of the women depicted one of the women was catherine now inspector he began id like you to take a look at what im about to present to you and describe it for the jury taking the folder in his hand cuneo opened it glanced at the plastic pages inside then closed it up and faced the jury its a folder used to hold photographs have you ever used something like this in your work inspector sure all the time in fact this sort of display is used so commonly that it has a nickname doesnt it we call it a sixpack why is that because each page holds six pictures in the slots not just six pictures inspector but six photos as similar as possible to one another right yes sergeant in your career as a homicide inspector in roughly what percentage of your cases have you employed the use of a sixpack to assist you in obtaining identifications cuneo again looked at rosen but this time there was no help i dont know exactly he said roughly hardy repeated fifty percent sixty percent maybe that much yeah more than that eighty percent your honor the witness says he doesnt know but braun shook her head overruled give us an estimate inspector all right say eight out of ten so a great majority of the time and a hundred percent of the time when the id is in doubt correct yes now inspector can you explain to the jury why in the great majority of cases you would use six photographs of similarlooking individuals to positively identify a suspect as opposed to simply showing the eyewitness a picture of that suspect and asking if its the same person they saw commit the crime cuneo hated it and was stalling trying to frame some kind of response hardy jumped him its to be sure the witness can really make an id right that he can pick out the suspect from similar individuals that would be one reason and another would be to protect against the witness feeling pressured by police to agree that the one photograph theyre shown is in fact the suspect that might be one reason can you give us another inspector cuneo rolled his shoulders crossed his legs not off the top of my head so at least one good reason that the police and you yourself commonly use a sixpack is to avoid the witness feeling pressure from police to identify their suspect i guess so so an eyewitness who identifies a suspect from a sixpack would be more reliable than one who was only shown one picture and asked to verify its identification this time rosen stood objection speculation calls for conclusion hardy didnt wait for a ruling let me ask it this way inspector youve had lots of training including preparation for the examination to become an inspector that taught you that this is precisely the function of the sixpack to avoid mistaken identification right cuneo hesitated hardy pressed on thats a yes or no inspector havent you had literally hours of classes about the identification of suspects where you learned that the sixpack is one way to avoid mistaken identification cuneo ducked ive had hours of training on ids yeah i dont recall how many involved sixpacks specifically hardy felt the lame answer made his point better than either yes or no and sailed on inspector cuneo at any time in your investigation of catherine hanover did you use a sixpack to assist eyewitnesses in their identifications cuneo didnt answer braun looked down at him inspector should i repeat the question hardy asked all innocence this earned him a glare from the judge who repeated inspector no i did not cuneo just couldnt let it go so he made it worse we use this to confirm an id when the witness doesnt know the person when you know somebody we might use a single photo just to be sure that were talking about the same person i mean if you say you saw your cousin we might show you a photo of your cousin just to be sure we got the right guy shoulders twitching cuneo tried an evasion its pretty obvious im sorry inspector whats obvious that witnesses can make mistakes or that you shouldnt coach them to make an identification rosen was up in a second objection sustained hardy didnt even slow down when there is a question inspector you use a sixpack to be sure there is no mistake correct yes and you never ever tell a witness ahead of time who you think should be idd or even give vague hints of what they look like correct yes just a hint of sarcasm entered hardys voicetoo little to object to but just enough for the jury to discern and you as a professional intent on making sure that the wrong person doesnt get accused you would always do what you could to make sure an id was correct wouldnt you cuneo got a bit heated now yes i would so your failure to use a sixpack was not designed to bolster your preconception of who was coming out of mr hanovers house was it no it was not but the first time you showed a photo you thought the person coming out was missy damiens right so you showed the witnesses a single photo and got your id right and then when you decided it must have been catherine coming out of the house you went to the same witnesses and used another single photo and again got the id you wanted right it wasnt a question of what i wanted it was what the witnesses said cuneos eyes went to rosen for an instant but the prosecutor could do nothing to help him just this side of surly he turned to face the jury box no i didnt use a sixpack for these ids these witnesses all said they had seen this woman before which woman was that inspector missy damiens you remember her the first woman they idd for you or catherine the second woman whose single photo got you an id too in both cases you told the witnesses who you thought they had seen then showed them a single photo and surprise you got the id you wanted right hardy on a roll of adrenaline and anger kept piling it on you said that you use a sixpack when the id is in question didnt you inspector can you think of anything that might put an id in question more than a previous id of someone elses photo another shrug another glance at rosendo something rosen tried to help your honor objection vague not vague but compound and argumentative do it a piece at a time mr hardy and perhaps a bit less sure your honor then with a slow and thoughtful cadence he began again inspector you showed a single photo of missy damiens and got ids right cuneo couldnt disagree correct and after that catherine accused you of harassment right i dont know what she said inspector after you got the id on missy and before you got the id on my client deputy chief glitsky told you catherine had complained of harassment right yes thats what he told me and with this information in mind you took a single photo of catherine went back to those same witnesses and said words to the effect of you made a mistake last time heres the woman you really saw correct thats not what i said the bottom line inspector is that knowing these witnesses had already identified somebody else you took a single photo of my client showed it to them and asked if this was the person they saw not the other person they had idd right cuneo had nowhere to go yes tell me inspector in all your hours of training has anyone even hinted to you that this was a proper way to make an id not that i recall hardy bowed from the waist thank you but even after all this there was one more nail to be driven into the inspectors coffin he pressed ahead sergeant cuneo during your visit to catherine hanovers house for your first interview did you touch her no i did not did you shake hands i may have done that i dont remember but to the best of your recollection you did not touch her otherwise no in passing perhaps your honor asked and answered crossexamination mr rosen ill allow it cuneo no aside from the handshake did any part of your hand come into contact with any part of catherine hanovers body at any time objection overruled cuneo no were you standing close enough to catherine hanover to touch her during any part of your discussion objection this time braun obviously irritated by the needless interruptions paused briefly hardy hoped the jury caught the signal overruled sergeant you may answer the question cuneo obviously didnt want to but he couldnt refuse although first he looked at rosen for a cue by now he had the whole imaginary drum kit going his eyes slits at hardy maybe maybe you were or you werent close enough sergeant which is it yes then i was standing close enough to touch her yes but in fact you touched neither her arm nor her shoulder rosen from his table your honor but cuneo thoroughly worn down replied before the judge could rule i dont know behind him the gallery which had obviously been closely following the testimony made itself heard even through the security screen as cuneo mumbled maybe i touched her once or twice by mistake hardy stood stock still then delivered the coup de grace im sorry your honor i missed that could i have it read back jan saunders read cuneos words again playing it straight i dont know she said maybe i touched her once or twice by mistake glitsky and treya kept getting what they were told was good news but it didnt seem to give them much relief the great news was that the echocardiogram ruled out aortic stenosis todays xrays on zacharys heart also showed no abnormality or sudden growth in size the ekgwires and leads stuck all over the infants body while he lay exposed and cold on the gurney sheetalso indicated that the heartbeat was regular through it all the baby didnt cry but endured it with a stoicism that would have done his father proud all the tests took the better part of an hour in his office when they were done dr trueblood walked a careful line between optimism and realism i have to tell you that zacharys condition as of today is the best that we could possibly have hoped for just a couple of days ago of all the children that i see in here hes in the top one percent and this is really terrific terrific news these wonderful tidings were delivered however in a funereal tone the old hunched man sat behind his desk with his shirt undone his tie askew and his mottled hands linked in front of him the light in the office itself was muted the shades drawn against the dreary wetness outside while the pitter of the constant rain provided the only soundtrack all that said i feel i need to caution you that though this is far better than aortic stenosis its still something to take very seriously sometimes a vsd can change quickly especially in the early months well want to keep a very close eye on zachary what does that mean treya asked well first i mean just watch him if he shows any marked or dramatic change in color breathing feeding or energy level you can call me at any time day or night youve got all my numbers right but then beyond that it would be a good idea to bring him in here every week for the next four to six weeks for the same kind of tests treya interrupted every week yes for the next month or month and a half then if theres no change well go to once a month and see how that works out what then holding his wifes hand glitsky didnt want to betray his own fear treya needed him to be calm and even optimistic and his voice reflected that he wasnt relaxed but they were moving into a routine one theyd grown used to he just wanted to know where they were now then trueblood said say when hes a year old well go to once every six months and then once a year for how long the glitskys asked it simultaneously well assuming the hole doesnt close up by itself and it may do that because its so smallbut assuming that it doesnt once a year certainly until hes a young adult maybe longer forever glitsky said trueblood nodded possibly yes but remember theyve found these vsds in autopsies of ninetyyearolds so youre saying zachary could have a normal life treya asked barely daring to hope he could youll have to be aware of his situation of course hell have to be premedicated for any dental work or surgery but other than that its possible that it may never affect him at all maybe hell be able to run play sports do anything maybe hell need heart work in the short term or in five years we just dont know yet at this stage reading the agony in their faces trueblood broke out of his professional voice i realize that its difficult not knowing he said but please try to remember that its better than almost any alternative we had just a day ago its entirely possible that zacharys going to grow up to be a fine normal healthy child treya squeezed glitskys hand forced a smile of sorts he knew her knew that she didnt want to hear any false or possibly false cheer she wanted to know what to do so that they could be prepared for it and do it right so i guess wed better set up an appointment for next week then thats the next step they got home by three oclock and treya said she didnt want the two of them moping around together until it got dark so glitsky called his driver paganucci thinking he would go check in at work for a few hours maybe catch up on his mail answer some of the more legitimate urgent calls perhaps even talk to batiste or kathy west about the conspiracy and the various issues it raised but the normally taciturn driver hadnt taken him a block when he said excuse me sir hed been looking at the slow continuous rain his mind on his wife and new son wondering how long it would take for this oppressive weight to lift for life to begin to feel real again in the backseat arms crossed he cleared his throat what is it tom well sir its the hall you know theyre having the hanover trial there and the place is a circus way worse than usual even going through the jail door youre going to have to break through a line of em to get in and then upstairs theres probably a dozen in the hall just outside your office theyve been there all day since the morning waiting for you to show up paganucci depleted after the lengthy string of words glanced into the rearview knowing what youve been going through at home i didnt know if you were really feeling up for that glitsky was silent for a beat that bad huh a zoo plus look at the time the trials going to be getting out about when we get there or a little later and then were talking maybe three times as many of the vultures i wouldnt normally say anything you know sir but i just thought you ought to get a headsup i appreciate it tom thanks they were moving east on geary why dont we take a detour and think about it you got it paganucci hung a right onto fillmore street anyplace in particular i dont know my wife doesnt want me home says im too morose you think im morose tom no sir me neither its just most people dont have my sense of humor not that ive had a lot to laugh about lately no sir were close enough why dont we swing by the painted ladies see how theyre doing the painted ladies sir lets kick it up tom lights and sirens sir joke ah then good one there you go hanovers old place was now a gaping hole still shocking even after most of a year especially since its sisterscousins daughtershad been resuscitated and now preened with all or more of their former glory on the block of steiner paganucci back to his habitual silence drove the long way around alamo square and pulled over to the curb in front of the empty lot hat on in full uniform glitsky opened the door and let himself out into the steady drizzle walking up the steps to the front landing he stepped over onto the earth in the footprint of the old building though soaked with the constant rain the site still crackled with broken glass and the remnants of cinders glitsky thought he could still detect a slight burned odor walking through the vacant space he got to the back of the lot and turned around due west to face the park across the streeta grassy knoll topped by windswept cypressesdeserted now in the awful weather crunching back the way hed come he made it back to steiner turned and looked at the row of lovely houses one more time he had no idea why he had come here could it have been as random as paganuccis suggestion that he might want to avoid his office downtown today he didnt think that was it something nagged at him the house next door had a small sign in the front window that read another quality remodel by leymar construction the health issues with his son had buried any other thoughts for the better part of the past few hours but now suddenly he found that the loam had heaved as an idea mushrooming to the surface of his consciousness no not one idea exactly more an accumulation of related inconsistencies what did it mean that jim leymar of leymar construction said he hadnt charged hanover anything near a million dollars why did missy damiens apparently lie to her landlady about where she worked for that matter what had happened to her car or to the ring at the outset glitsky had of course considered from several angles the possibility that missy damiens and not paul hanover might have been the primary intended victim but she had never assumed a prominence always cast into semiobscurity by pauls huge shadow and then lost in the swirling maelstrom of events and media insanity that had seen catherine charged and arrested missys death came to feel to glitsky like a kind of unfortunate footnote in an unsung and unknowable life in some ways she had become to him just another one of san franciscos homeless albeit a wealthy one who one day merely disappeared never to be mourned or missed but even the homeless he knew were sometimesin fact depressingly oftenkilled for their meager possessions for their shopping carts for their prime begging turf for half a bottle of thunderbird as a more or less random human being walking around in san francisco glitsky suddenly began to appreciate how tempting a target she might have been on her own without reference to the hanovers and their politics or money she wore a very visible diamond worth a hundred thousand dollars or more and drove a mercedes with a hefty price tag as well anyone could have seen her an apparently defenseless woman alone followed her home and broken in or simply knocked at the door on some pretense many people who kept guns for their personal protection kept them in the headboard of their beds and this might simply have been a bonus for the burglar and thief after hed killed them both he removed the ring from her finger probably rifled the house for other valuables there might have been gasoline in a container in the garage and hed used that to torch the place then driven off in damienss car on its own terms it wasnt impossible but it didnt explain the other discrepancies in missys storythe construction business the false employment back in his car glitsky sat with his arms folded over his chest paganucci saw him reflected in the rearview mirror and decided not to ask him where he wanted to go glitskys natural authority was forbidding enough when he scowled as he did now his jaw muscle working and the scar through his lips pronounced he was truly fearsome after a few moments he shifted in his seat searched in his wallet then in the little book he kept theres a bank of america branch at twelfth and clement tom lets go see if theyre still open with full darkness outside and the rain still falling hardy stood at the window of his office looking down on sutter street and spun around at the knock on his open door anybody here i am wes what are you doing standing around in the dark thinking you can turn the lights on if you want fiat lux the room lit up you know that theresa was at the fire you talked to her hardy got to his desk sat in his chair at length i think she developed a little bit of a crush on me from what i hear shes not exactly the crush type well as the song says diz theres someone for each of us they say what song is that i think a bunch of em say it you ought to listen to more country music you know that i mean it sam got me into it and now i dont listen to anything else ill put it on my list hardy said she was at the fire farrell plopped himself into one of the upholstered chairs in front of hardys desk this is going to sound familiar but she saw it on tv and drove over got her name and address taken by one of the arson guys and everything she didnt see catherine but thats not really surprising given the number of spectators she said there were probably a couple of hundred people out there that night maybe more okay what im wondering if it means anything did you ask her what she was doing before that watching television wes hardys patience sorely tried throughout the long day was all used up farrell held up a placating hand im getting there i promise she works in real estate you knew that right and she does okay pays the bills goes on a vacation every couple of years but not much extra anyway the point is she was home alone she remembers specifically because well it was that day mostly but also because i think youll like this she remembers the call from mary hardy was in fact glad to hear this for theresa to be any kind of a convincing alternate suspectfor the jurys benefit if not in actual facthe had to be able to establish that she had found out on the same day as catherine that paul was going ahead with his marriage to missy and that he was possibly changing his will in the very near future perhaps the next week she had to be strongly motivated to stop him immediately and without the phone call from mary to spur her to act the theory would have had no traction so she was home got the call from mary then what then nothing she and mary talked about it for a while and she was extremely pissed off and upset enough so that she canceled a date for dinner that night farrell nodded pleased with hardys enthusiastic reception i know its almost too good to be true but there it is she got a stomachache who was she going out with one of her girlfriends ive got the name and we can talk to her if we need to we might but meanwhile theresas so sick she cant go out to dinner but a couple of hours later shes at the fire right but i mean remember this is her exhusbands house burning down maybe with him in it of course shes going to go all right i know but still still no alibi i get it hardy scratched at his desk blotter his partner often took a humorous and lowkey approach but he didnt miss much which was why hardy had thought to send him on this errand anybody ever question her about it her alibi i didnt get that impression cuneo glommed onto her over catherine but he never thought about her as a suspect and youre right by the way that theyre not close catherine and theresa she should have stood up against her when will said he was going to marry her but she didnt and hes been paying for it ever since did she say that more or less verbatim farrell paused if you havent gathered by now diz she doesnt particularly want to help us out on the defense shes finally got catherine out of the family and wants to keep it that way wills happier wills a jerk hardy said well at least hes a happier jerk four million dollarsll do that did she say anything about the money i believe the subject came up farrell stood up and walked over to the wet bar opened the refrigerator and took out a bottled water you drinking no probably smart he closed the refrigerator and turned okay money he said she seemed slightly bitter about the whole missy thing to put it mildly she and paul split up before he got super rich and after the kids had moved out so she fell into the crack there between alimony and child support yeah but the community property peace my friend im ahead of you so she took away about three hundred grand from the marriage grew it up to a million some all invested in guess what i bet i can hightech a nod so now its considerably less the exact figure not forthcoming but the smart guess is a lot lot less so she needed the money for herself too not just the grandkids it wouldnt kill her hasnt in fact each of the kids has already cut her in again no exact figures hardy whistled so shes made out like a bandit here shes better off than she was lets go that far and no alibi farrell nodded no alibi and one other interesting tidbit im listening she bought a new car hardy cocked his head to one side with the estate money uhuh before that early last summer how did that come up i told you she likes me i have my ways but the fact is she traded in her youre going to love this her black ctype mercedes for a red lexus convertible and paid cash for the difference hardy said frannie brought her wineglass to her lips it was wednesdaytrial or no trial the traditional date night and they were at zarzuela waiting for their paella and sharing a plate of incredible hors doeuvresbaby octopus and sausages anchovies olives and cheese how much are we talking about maybe as much as forty fifty thousand dollars and this means it means she got a lot of cash from somewhere late last may or early june how about from her savings maybe but also maybe from pawning a ring frannie looked carefully at a baby octopus shed picked up with her fork she put it back down on the plate and went for an olive instead for his part hardy didnt appear to see or taste any of it which didnt mean he wasnt putting away his share youre seeing how this plays for me arent you she asked he smiled nodded reached across the tiny table and touched her hand a little bit you think she might have done it no idea but she could get the jury thinking it might not have been catherine reasonable doubt but what do you really think i think she had motive to spare she hated paul and missy she has no alibi what about the eyewitnesses who say it was catherine hardy hesitated for a long moment then broke a rueful grin im hoping they die of natural causes before they testify all at once the bantering quality went out of frannies voice she put down her fork and looked squarely at her husband let me ask you something really she said how do you handle them what do you mean i mean the eyewitnesses what do you tell yourself his wineglass stopped halfway to his mouth he set it back on the table i think they must have made a mistake all three of them the same mistake he scratched the side of his neck i know you think they mistook theresa for catherine no though the hanover men seem to go for the same basic physical type but theresas got fifteen years or more on catherine i cant really see it how about missy then thats a better call if she wasnt dead except she is again i know so whos that leave one last time he twirled the stem of his glass met her eyes i know i know glitsky entered his duplex dripping he hung his wet raincoat on the peg by the front door then his hat over it in the little alcove the light was dim and the house quiet there was a light on in the living room to his right but assuming that everyone else was asleepit was nearly nine oclockglitsky turned left into the dark kitchen and opened the refrigerator nothing appealed he decided hed go check in on treya and zachary and then come back out and fix himself something to eat when he heard a suppressed giggle from the living room in a couple of steps he was in the doorway and rachel jumped from the couch finally yelled da and broke into a true delighted laugh running across the rug at him to be gathered up but the real cause of the baby girls hilarity and surprise was glitskys son orel a sophomore now at san jose state about fifty miles south of the city sitting on the couch next to treya and holding his little half brother easily in his arms hey dad the boy was beaming id get up but we thought youd never wander in here treya said what were you doing in there foraging treya seemed transformedwhether by the reasonably good news of the afternoon about zachary or by orels appearance glitsky couldnt saybut the change was dramatic shed put on some makeup brushed her hair back donned a nice maroon blouse tucked into some prepregnancy jeans most important there was life in her eyes again glitsky went down on a knee in front of her shared a kiss with her and rachel patted orel on the leg it is so good to see you he said how did you nat he said what you werent going to tell me i had a brother no i mean yes of course we just we didnt think you could get up midweek anyway glitsky said to see my new brother are you kidding me plus there was he looked to treya for help but orel obviously had heard chill dad he said its all right all wight rachel echoed and glitsky kissed her again and said i know it is frannie and hardy had just gotten back from their dinner when he got the call from brauns clerk at ten fifteen apologizing for the late hour she informed him that her honor had denied his motion for a hearing on deliberate prosecutorial misconduct but that she would reconsider a motion for a mistrial if hardy cared to renew it might that be his intention now he told her no well in either case the judge wanted him to know that she would entertain such a motion until nine thirty the following morning when court went into session after that a mistrial would be off the table and the trial would continue with the eyewitness testimony now at glitskys the two babies were asleep and the two adults and one nearadult sat at the kitchen table with cups of tea sweetened with honey the pizza carton still covered most of the table in the middle of them but none of them paid any mind the mood was still far from euphoricin the circumstances how could it be otherwisebut the sense of imminent doom was gone they were catching up family news and gossip treyas daughter raney had just been back home for winter break from johns hopkins in december along with all of abes boysisaac from la jacob all the way from milan and orel from san jose and of course nat and rachel a full reunion by now a large extended family the glitskys had celebrated both hanukkah and christmas before the diaspora had flung people to the far corners again im just glad nat got to see everyone one last time glitsky commented especially what do you mean one last time leaning back on two rear legs of his kitchen chair orels face clouded over nats okay isnt he i think so why do you ask because you just made it sound like hes dying of something not that i know of but hes in his mideighties orel hes not going to live forever you know orel brought his chair down leaned into the table jeez dad you kill me what what things dont always turn out bad thats what i dont think they do yes you do look at me remember when i was thirteen or fourteen after mom died and i started to stutter and you thought i wasnt ever going to stop okay so nobody else really thought you were going to stop either yeah but i did didnt i and then you werent ever going to meet anybody else good enough again after mom were you he turned to his stepmother and look right here at this very table voila good enough and thats saying something treya inclined her head with a small smile thank you yes but but then if you remember you had a heart attack and somehow got completely better enough to be walking around and actually get shot a year later oh after having your great little baby girl whos sleeping down the hall even as we speak wait wait time out glitsky made the signal in all fairness lets acknowledge what really happened over that time aside from my miraculous recoveries all right you got over your stuttering but your mom did die i did have a heart attack and then got shot and then had a few minor complications after that for a year or so if you remember i do remember dad but heres the deal you got better after the complications you didnt die but glitsky wasnt going to give up his worldview without a fight yeah i got better in time for them to demote me down to payroll from which i might point out you got promoted over half the guys with your seniority and now youre deputy chief way farther than you ever thought youd go or wanted to orel shaking his head turned to treya am i the only one who sees this then back to his father sometimesi really do think and you might consider sometimes its half full dad on the way to full you know not half empty glitsky took a breath sipped at his tea everybody does die orel thats a fact ill grant you that but they live first thats the part that counts the living part you cant wait around doing nothing because everybodys going to die i mean in a hundred years were all dead right do we have to talk about dying treya asked orel sighed im not talking about dying im talking about living he seemed at a loss for words for a moment twirling his mug on the table guys look i know its been a tough few days you dont know abe said okay right not as much as you i admit but didnt you tell me that already the kids beaten the odds you heard at first i mean wiped them out top one percent of heart irregularities right he looked at the two parents who looked with heavylidded eyes at one another orel lowered his voice he didnt want to browbeat didnt your doctor even say he could have a normal life but might not glitsky said yeah but i might not either you might not okay so maybe the odds are slightly less for zachary right now glitsky interrupted putting his hand across the table over his sons o he said gently you dont know what youre talking about its not all roses with the prognosis believe me i do believe you obviously its hard obviously i dont feel it as much as both of you but my question is what does it get you to always keep expecting the worst that nats going to die before the next time were all together that zachary wont get a chance to live look at what youve got right now dad look where you are in spite of it all things have worked out pretty good havent they i mean doesnt that count in their bedroom later glitsky getting out of bed leaning over the bassinet picking up zachary for basically the first time what are you doing treya asked just holding him he sat on the side of the bed the baby in his lap behind him treya shifted closer to him her hand rubbed his back came to rest on his leg im thinking orels right he whispered i never believe things are going to work out and then they do and i still dont believe it i wouldnt beat myself up over that youre fine the way you are no i miss things i havent held this guy yeti dont know if youve noticed i noticed sure well thats because i thought hed die and then if id never held him it wouldnt be as bad i wouldnt feel it as much of course then i also wouldnt have felt this while hes here right i know a small nightlight glowed dimly near floor level at the door and provided the only light in the room but it was enough to see by glitsky moved the blankets out from around his babys face hes got your eyes he said i think so your nose poor kid glitsky scooched himself up and around so he was leaning up against the beds headboard then after a while id better enjoy every minute i think so both of us the night settled heavily around them glitsky still holding the boy in his lap out of the mouths of babes huh he said orels a good boy she said reminds me of his dad except for that rogue positive streak not a bad thing maybe no another extended stretch of time in the shadowy dark trey yeah hon the reason i got home so late i found something out today completely off topic off topics okay what was it hardys case this missy damiens the dead woman what about her she had a bank accountour branch of bank of america if you can believe it you know patti the manager uhhuh i asked her if i could look it up the account completely illegal of course i need a subpoena i need to go through their legal department but she knows me okay treya now up on an elbow interested even cloistered as shed been shed been aware of the latest news stories the conspiracy theory the hanover case like it or not was part of their lives and probably would be for some time what she had a checking account and a safedeposit box a big one he drew a breath she closed the account and the box on may seventh five days before she was killed what does that mean i dont know he looked over at her eightyeight hundred dollars plus whatever was in the box hardy was in his kitchen with glitsky the overhead light was onit was still black out through the window over the sink though the rain seemed to have stopped the clock on the stove read from the back ofthe ground floor came the muted sounds of hardys children knocking around using the bathroom getting ready for school from upstairs the shower the house waking up hardy awakened by glitskys call fortyfive minutes earlier was in one of his dark gray courtroom suits white shirt muted tie he blew over his mug of coffee took a sip missy signed it out herself he asked theres no other way to get it wire transfer shed still have to sign something yeah but she could have done that months ago but somebody would have had to place the order right either way it doesnt matter she signed the with drawal form took it in cash they had the hard copies still there howd you get a look at them without a subpoena glitsky considered hesitated for a second thats a state secret that could get the manager fired i know her but forget the logistics for a minute she got her hands on more than eight grand maybe a lot more no way to tell five days before she got killed hardy put his mug on the counter boosted himself up next to it and picked it up again whered she get that much money hanover she inflated the remodel costs and skimmed im thinking she might have had as much as a few hundred thousand dollars in her safedeposit box a few hundred thousand youve got to be kidding no if thats true she was leaving him not a question had to be he didnt have a clue though you know that according to catherine theyd evidently been arguing about this cabinet appointment and thats why she was gone during that last day but paul told catherine it would blow over missy wasnt leaving him no way glitskys frown was pronounced so he didnt know i hope its true and he didnt just lie to catherine to rile up the family that might have been what got them both killed suddenly hardy brought himself up short a palm against his forehead lord what am i thinking im sorry abe trial time the focus is a little narrow hows your boy hes all right glitsky said evenly top one percent of kids in his boat theres a relief a bit but glitsky didnt trust himselfwith optimism too long if they kept talking about zacharys health so he went right back to business i thought id do it legal today get your sorry signature on a subpoena so we can have copies of the records by next week you mean missys bank records glitsky nodded i thought you could help me get em as essential to this case tie it into hanovers estate and missing money you sign a subpoena the records just come to court rosen wont care that weve got them ive got one for you hardy said howd you get on this in the first place missy you got me on it glitsky said the car mirroring hardy boosting himself on the counter by the stove he told him about the series of unusual findings hed happened upon as he had followed up leads on missy from the address hed gotten at the dmv site to ruth guthrie her landlady to the bed and bath store where she hadnt worked which had led to the checking and other accounts and the bank wait a minute hardy said when glitsky had finished so youre telling me that before she showed up here in san francisco when three years ago you still dont know anything about where she came from no she came from somewhere they speak french apparently but how she got here she dropped out of the sky although theres a sociala social security numberon her bank of america accounts and i was going to run that too if youll sign off on the subpoenas in fact it was no big deal for hardy to request missys bank records and both men knew it preparing the subpoena wouldnt take hardy five minutes im just saying it might help diz hardy felt a wash of fatiguethe coffee wasnt kicking in quickly enough he brought his hands to his eyes then grabbed his mug and tipped it up i know it might he said sorry im thinking about eyewitnesses if i could just see how i can use this damiens thing if she had all that cash on her plus the ring and catherine knew about it but if anything that only strengthens her motive im not guaranteeing any of this is going to help your case glitsky said id just like to know more so would i hardy said perennially sometimes its just not in the cards true but itd be dumb not to look not if it doesnt help my client which is pretty much all im thinking about right now glitsky shrugged your call im going to do what i can anyway hardy threw a veiled and vaguely malevolent glance over his coffee mug theres a surprise he said when hardy came around the corner in the hallway and saw catherine in the holding cell behind the courtroom she was sitting hunched over almost as if shed been beaten as though huddled against further blows when he got to the cell door she looked over quickly but smoothing her hands down over her face didnt get up didnt change position when the bailiff let hardy in he went and sat beside her her face hadnt completely dried putting an arm around her he drew her in next to him and she broke down he let it go on until it ended just allowing her to lean against him until shed sobbed it all out when her breathing finally slowed he gave her the handkerchief hed learned always to have with him then gave her a last buckup squeeze with his arm and stood up he walked over and stood by the bars giving her some space while she got herself back together he consulted his watch they werent due in court for another twenty minutes plenty of time finally he went back to her and sat im so sorry she said i dont know what its all right she nodded ive been trying to keep myself from thinking about my kids but todays pollys birthday she took a shaky breath now ive missed every one of them since ive been in here i know i still dont know where to put any of this how this can be happening to me she gestured at the surroundings none of this is in my life dismas even after all this time i cant understand how ive gotten here i keep telling myself to just be strong and bear up and dont give them anything they can use but then i think so what its already been too long im not their mom anymore youre still their mom catherine they visit here every chance they get but i cant i mean again she bowed her head shaking it slowly side to side side to side this isnt getting us anywhere im sorry first one more apology and i start pulling out your fingernails youve got every right to be miserable and lonely and afraid and have all of this get to you second we dont always have to be getting anywhere thats for in there he indicated the courtroom here we can just sit if we want she nodded again then reached over and took his hand can we do this for a minute im timing it he said seconds ticked by at last her shoulders settled in a long sigh ive been wondering if i could have seen the seeds of all this back when will and i first started if that wasnt my original mistake and everything followed from that you got your kids out of it hardy said so maybe it wasnt all a mistake i know thats true but i also knew it was a different thing with him than i had with you you know what im saying hardy nodded he knew but id finished college and worked almost ten years and pretty much given up on dating because of all the losers and then suddenly here was this kind of cute guy who could be fun in those days but i knew i knew diz in my heart that it wasnt well the same as id always wanted but i also thought there wouldnt ever be anything better so i settled i settled so so stupid you did what you did catherine you made a life that worked for almost twenty years thats not failing a bitter chuckle look around you getting to here isnt failing its not over yet it isnt it feels like it is even if they let me go thats what im saying i understand what youre saying but i cant have you bail on me now the first job is to get you acquitted after that when youre back outside she was shaking her head and let go of his hand dismas dont dont what dont give me the standard pep talk we both know i might not get back outside i dont know that hardys tone was firm nearly harsh he turned on the bench to face her directly listen to me taking her hand back almost angrily holding it tight with both of his i believe youre innocent and because of that the jury will not convict you ill make them see it and you need to hold on to that thought i need you to do that for me she closed her eyes took a deep breath and let it out all at once all right she whispered nodding her head all right i can try moving on to news and strategy he told her of farrells interview with her motherinlaw the remote but arguable possibilities presented by the missing ring combined with theresas purchase of a new car for cash while acknowledging without much enthusiasm that it might be something hardy could introduce to the jury she really didnt show much interest until he got to what glitsky had told him about this morning you mean missy was stealing from paul when she was going to get all the money anyway on the slab concrete bench the two of them might have been coaches huddled on the sidelines conferring in intimate tones she wouldnt have gotten any if she left him hardy said no i know but that much i mean if thats true she must have been planning to leave for quite a while and i dont understand that at all they only got formally engaged six months or so before they died and the remodel had already been going on long before that hardys shoulders went up an inch maybe she wasnt sure theyd ever really get married and she wanted to make sure she got something out of him for the time invested then by the time they actually started making plans shed already socked all this money away maybe but i dont know what it means why did she take it out you said it they were arguing paul might have thought it wasnt a major issue but maybe she didnt agree she was leaving him catherine sat straight up maybe im stupid dismas but that doesnt make any sense she wasnt going to leave him over some possible minor subcabinet appointment paul told me that day remember thats what the fight was about he was going to tell them to go ahead and start the vetting process but beyond that there were other candidates he might not have even gotten the nomination and if he had he still would have had to be confirmed the whole thing was months away at least if it happened at all i cant see missy deciding to leave last may over it im not arguing with you but the fact remains that she did take out the money if she wasnt leaving him what was she doing maybe giving it back to him hardy tossed her a getreal look maybe not in the hallway in front of them two bailiffs led eight jailhouse residents in their orange jumpsuits to another holding cell down the long corridor the chains that bound them together rattled and echoed then died and hardy said now if somebody was blackmailing her what for i dont know but thats kind of been the mantra around missy hasnt it nobody knows anything about her even the tabloid guys never printed any dirt and if they couldnt find anything ive got to believe that if something was there it was well hidden but now i wonder if somebody found some nasty secret of missys and threatened to tell paul so missy would have had to pay to keep it quiet catherine barely dared say the words are you thinking theresa shes the exwife hardy said she hated missy more than anybody shed be motivated to look for dirt on her he didnt add though they both knew that theresa had no alibi that shed paid cash for a new car soon after missy had withdrawn the money hardy didnt want to overplay it but the suddenly very real possibility that theresa might have killed paul and missy was there in the cell between them did anybody else in the family ever talk to missy about her life hardy asked even when you all were first introduced to her it wasnt like we all got together and played parlor games diz she and paul ran in different circles than all of us wed see them both at holidays or sometimes at some social thing but we werent doing sleepovers and trading intimate secrets i promise you out of the corner of his eye hardy saw the bailiff appear in the small wiredglass window to the courtroom door they heard the keys and the door swung open showtime they were just back from the first morning recess and so far hardy felt he was doing very well on the eyewitness front he was delighted with rosens decision to call jeffrey jeffie siddon since the young gas station attendants demeanor was unsympathetic to say the least flat of effect and subtly hostile to if not bored by the entire proceeding his mumbling responses surely didnt inspire any confidence in the jury further his identification of catherine was not exactly emphatic yes hed picked her out of a photograph then out of her booking mug shot hardy had already made his point about ids from a single photo but the fact is that other people were saying they recognized catherine and this guy would be just one more but facing her in person he seemed to hesitate rosen had to ask him twice if he recognized in the courtroom the person who had bought the gasoline in the container from his station could he point out that person to the jury jeffie had raised his hand an inch or two nodded and pointed briefly at catherine hardy thought from the performance that it was almost as if he had pantomimed the words i think afterward even beyond all that though and far more important was the legal nicety that even if every word siddon said were completely true in all respects and if his identification of catherine had been firm and convincingeven given all of that his testimony did not put her at the crime scene at any time there was simply no connection hardy had argued in a motion to exclude this testimony before the trial but braun had allowed it for god knew what reason the inference that because catherine may have bought gasoline in a container somehow implicated her in the arson was hardy thought absurd he could tell that the judge and most of the jury thought the same thing still he rammed the point on crossexamination reestablishing that jeffie hadnt picked catherine out of a sixpack of photographscuneo had only shown him one at a time he hadnt even seen hardys client leave the station hadnt noticed the direction shed driven in when she left hadnt ever seen her again afterward and then hardy had completely destroyed him on the question of what day even what week he had noticed the woman in the blue shirt the station records showed that someone had purchased two gallons of gasoline on that wednesday afternoon and jeffie had finally admittedin his defensive mannerthat he figured it must have been her he remembered her and therefore she was the one who had come by that day maxine willis would be rougher but still hardy thought manageable unlike jeffie siddon she had no trouble pointing out catherine as the woman shed seen leave the hanover home a half hour before the discovery of the fire fortunately though hardy had interviewed both her and her husband at some length in the course of these talks he had discovered a foothold from which he was confident he might pick his way through crossexamination mrs willis he began your initial identification of the woman who left the hanover home a few houses down from yours on the night of the fire was made to an arson inspector on the night of the fire is that right yes could you tell the jury about that cooperative she turned to face the panel there really isnt much to tell my husband and i live three houses down from mr hanovers house and were evacuated the night of the fire when it looked as though our place might catch fire as well we were all standing outside when a gentleman came up and identified himself as being an arson inspector with the fire department he got our names and address and asked if we had anything wed like to report about the fire did the man have identification yes and did that identification say that his name was sid bosio that was it yes hardy went back to his desk pulled a sheet of paper from his open binder he showed it to rosen and the judge and had the clerk enter it as the next defense exhibit then came back to the witness mrs willis do you recognize this document i do would you tell the jury what it is please its a statement i wrote for the arson inspector after he talked to me on the night of the fire all right and is this your name and address on the top of the paper and your signature on the bottom of this piece of paper yes it is indicating that the statements are true and correct thats right as i knew them at the time no surprise mrs willis had been coached since the last time hardy had spoken to her now she looked out into the courtroom over to rosen finally back to hardy she knew what was coming even gave him a confident smile mrs willis will you please read for the jury what you signed off on sure the whole thing hardy smiled back at her after your name and address the highlighted area all right she studied the document for a minute saw occupant of house miss damien exit structure shortly before fire and by miss damien you actually meant one of the victims in this case missy damiens isnt that right yes i got her name a little bit wrong thank you thats fine hardy took the paper back from her placed it back on the evidence so mrs willis just to make this absolutely clear you gave this statement to arson inspector bosio on the night of the fire yes all right then moving along the next time you had an opportunity to identify the person leaving the hanover home a short while before the outbreak of the fire it was by photograph was it not thats right a photograph shown to you by inspector cuneo correct thats right now did you pick the photograph of the person you saw leaving the hanover home that night out of a group of photographs no there was just the one inspector cuneo showed you only one photograph and asked you to identify who it was is that right correct nodding amiably hardy cast a casual eye over to the jury he strolled easily back to his table and took from it both the newspaper picture of missy damiens and the original hed subpoenaed from the chronicles files after having them marked as the next defense exhibits he showed the glossy of it to the witness do you recognize this photograph i sure do thats the picture i saw the first time inspector cuneo came by all right so inspector cuneo showed you this picture now mrs willis do you know who this is a picture of thats my exneighbor missy the same missy damiens who is one of the victims in this case is that right yes and the same missy damiens you identified to arson inspector bosio as the woman whod left the hanover house just before the fire is that right yes but and you identified her to inspector cuneo as well is that correct she hesitated well that was before mrs willis im sorry hardy cut her off in his most respectful tone is it correct that on this first occasion with inspector cuneo you identified the woman in that picture defense exhibit f as missy damiens yes or no yes but hardy held up a palm and it was only later that you idd the photo of catherine is that right yes and each time you were shownsergeant cuneo showed youa single photo correct yes just to be clear he never showed you a variety of photos from which to choose correct right and when sergeant cuneo showed you the first photograph exhibit f you had already said it was missy coming out of the house right right and so he clearly expected you to id the person he named yes and you did identify the woman in exhibit f as missy damiens on that occasion did you not yes i did hardy took a breath all right he said now lets talk for a minute about the next time sergeant cuneo asked you to identify the person whod left the hanover home that afternoon on that second occasion did he also show you one photograph of a single person yes and he told you that you must have been wrong the first time since missy damiens was dead yes thats right so it couldnt have been missy that you saw right okay and next he told you did he not that he thought the person whose photo he now showed you was the person you must have seen hardy didnt give her a chance to answer and again you idd the person whom inspector cuneo clearly expected you to id isnt that right yes i suppose thats true but that doesnt mean let me ask you this mrs willis did sergeant cuneo ever give you an opportunity to view several photos of different people well no he did he ever ask you to consider the possibility of a third person no thank you mrs willis thatll be all he spun on his heel and took a step toward his table but she started again he whirled on her thank you he repeated with slightly more emphasis no more questions but rosen was already on his feet moving forward redirect your honor a nod from braun mrs willis did you know missy damiens well no hardly at all hardly at all had you ever had a conversation with her no spoken to her at all no never all right so you could easily have been mistaken in identifying her your honor hardy said speculation but braun was already ahead of him sustained rosen stood in the center of the courtroom for a moment then came at it another way mrs willis did you have occasion to change your mind about the identity of the woman whom youd earlier identified as missy damiens yes i did and when was that when inspector cuneo brought a picture of another woman and i realized it wasnt who id first said and that is the picture of the defendant catherine hanover peoples exhibit that you identified earlier is that correct yes it is and did you subsequently identify the defendant as the woman whod left the hanover home minutes before the fire from the booking photograph peoples yes did you also identify the woman whod left the hanover home minutes before the fire from a police lineup held on or about july eleventh of last year a lineup that included five other women yes i did and would you please tell the members of the jury once again if you see the woman you saw leaving the hanover home minutes before the fire in this courtroom today yes i do you have already pointed her out to the court but may i ask you to please do so once again she pointed and rosen said let the record show that the witness has once again identified the defendant catherine hanover mrs willis thank you no further questions he turned to hardy recross hardy was in front of her before rosen had sat down mrs willis when you idd the first photo of missy damiens you were telling the truth were you not of course i was of course and you were as sure of that first id as you later were of the second true well at the time let me rephrase did you express any hesitation or reservation with that first id no and thats because you were sure correct she didnt like it but she had to admit it at the time yes but so you were sure as sure as you are now that it was catherine correct she didnt answer and hardy didnt wait but of course you were wrong glitsky wasnt going to deal with any part of the media he was laying low on this mission he hadnt done much more than check into his office early in the morning then disappeared to move on these damiens questions he wasnt carrying his cell phone and had turned his pager to vibrate in the bank of americas eponymous polished granite building downtown he now sat in an enclosed cubicle office in the legal department on the eleventh floor outside his windows an immovable cloud blocked any view five attorneys and their secretaries worked in the space just outsidethe lawyers in their own cubicles about the size of the one glitsky was using their slaves at desks against the opposite wall glitskys guide for his tour of the damiens financials was a serious young woman with mousy brown hair in a beige suit and cokebottle eyeglasses probably not yet thirty her name was lisa ravel and she was the right person to sit with him while they searched diligent knowledgeable about the banks systems enthusiastic for the work she had already printed out the final statement that glitsky had gotten a look at yesterday at his local branch they only kept physical records in the branches for two years now she suggested that they review deposits over the nearly threeyear course of the entire account moving toward the present glitsky remembered that he wanted to run missys social security numberfind out something more about herand he called back to his office and asked melissa to get on it to page him when she had something then he and ravel began in earnest the opening deposit had been in cash for exactly glitsky who by now was disposed to see a sinister pattern emerging found that interesting if only because banks were mandated to report any cash transactions of over ten thousand dollars and this was just under that threshold at the beginning now more than four years ago thered been very few checks and all of them predictableto ruth guthrie every month for rent for phone utilities and the like over the next five months the account had almost gotten down to zero when regular deposits in the thousanddollar range began turning up glitsky whod given ravel an overview of the situation at the outset said i think by now this must be when shes seeing hanover after a while the deposits started averagingagain that threshold figurearound nine thousand dollars per month damiens started making monthly payments on the mercedes in february of the year before shed died regular deposits and checks started turning upone every month for twenty months in the six to eightthousanddollar range but three of them greater than a hundred thousand dollarsto leymar construction then more standardsize monthly payments to a macys credit card a nordstrom card she got a visa card and started making regular payments on it here was a check for made out to the offices of dr yamashiru another similar check for glitsky pointed to the screen this guy he was her dentist he said she must have had teeth problems looks like bad ones ravel said and no insurance this struck glitsky no insurance they kept scrolling i ought to go get a subpoena for hanovers accounts while im at this he said compare the construction bills i think she was taking cash out of her deposits and putting them in her safedeposit box well wait a minute ravel said she hit a few buttons on the keyboard there you go the screen revealed that glitskys theory at least insofar as the deposits went was correct the backup record of several of the more normal deposits indicated the cash disbursements from the amount of the checks shed cashed and deposited hanover evidently had written her regular monthly checks to cover both her living expenses these perhaps unwittingly and leymars contracting fees the three that were over a hundred thousand dollars were neatly paired with checks shed written to leymar in the same amounts less that critical nineteen thousand dollars the other leymar checks though came in at nineteen thousand dollars per month glitsky surmised that she took this money deposited half in her checking account and the other halfninetyfive hundred dollars a monthinto her safedeposit box over the twenty or so months of hanovers regular payouts to her this would have come to roughly two hundred thousand dollars so he was supporting her too ravel said look at what she was stealing he said she wouldnt have needed him to i cant believe the irs didnt get wind of this somehow i dont know she kept everything under ten thousand dollars you notice okay but the income maybe she didnt file ravel shook her head playing with fire she wasnt american maybe she didnt get it well she may not have been an american she pointed at the screen but thats a real social security number which reminds me glitsky called back to his office where melissa had gone to lunch leaving another message he got back to their computer finally at it for almost two hours nowprinting out pages as they went the two of them getting along theorizingthey got to the last months closing statement again at his belt he felt his buzzer thats my secretary but checking the number it wasnt it was hardy glitsky called him right back i just thought of something you said this morning hardy said you know the car i know the car we still dont know where it is yes we do somebody stole it disappointment sounded through the line you know that for sure no i deduced it since its nowhere else somebody must have taken it and there wasnt anybody to complain so its not been reported stolen good diz i think i just said that whats your point my point is where did you look glitsky fought the rise of impatience you want a list i looked traffic and parking warrants booted vehicles towed vehicles where what towed vehicles at the tow lots yeah but for both companies a hint of anger leaking through now glitsky began what do you then stopped realizing in a flash that if the car had been towed in the first few weeks after the fire it would have naturally gone to the towhold lot but less than six weeks later bayshore autotow had taken over and since thats where the city now towed its cars thats where glitsky had checked the transition after the contract change to the citys new towing company had gone anything but smoothly with records lost or mislaid cars dismantled or stolen with towhold dragging its feet supplying anything that would help bayshore become efficient and productive the citys computer hadnt come close to catching up and didnt look like it would for a while towhold glitsky said just a thought hardy said joseph willis was the last eyewitness and presented the most significant challenge which was of course at the same time a golden opportunity erudite softspoken nattily dressed in a soft camelhair sport coat light blue dress shirt and red bow tie maxines husband didnt have any uncertainty whatsoever surrounding his identification of catherine rosen had walked him through his testimony which was unambiguous and delivered with great confidence unlike his wife on the night of the fire he had never told arson inspector bosio that it had been missy leaving the house hed only ventured that it had been a woman he hadnt been home for inspector cuneos first visit when hed brought around the newspaper photo of missy either and so he hadnt tentatively identified her first he too had picked catherine first from cuneos photo next from her booking mug shot and finally from the july lineup hardy rising to crossexamine knew that he had his work cut out mr willis id like to go over your testimony about the woman you saw leaving the hanover home on the night of the fire and whom youve identified as catherine hanover certainly like his wife joseph knew he was key to the prosecutions case and he tooand with more justificationseemed to revel in the role i thought you might this brought a titter to the gallery and hardy let himself appear to smile he was a swell guy able to take a little goodnatured ribbing splendid he said then were in accord he paused for an instant would you mind telling me about what time you saw the woman leave the hanover home on that night i dont know exactly i didnt check my watch could you hazard a guess well our friends had come by and wed made cocktails the show we hoped to attend started at nine and we wanted to get there by eight thirty which meant wed have to leave by eight so id say we were in the living room between seven fifteen and seven fortyfive and what kind of evening was it as i recall it was cool with a breeze and then got foggy later he looked over to the jury and added as usual in may and june meaning to be casual and friendly but coming across to the jury hardy hoped as pedantic and even condescending all right cool with a breeze and youve testified that you noticed the womans dark blue shirt because it was shiny some kind of silklike material is that right yes joseph willis shifted in the witness box crossed one leg over the other from his expression he didnt understand where this line of questioning was headed was that a question mr willis or an answer im sorry yes the shirt was shiny and so are we to assume that the sun was out your honor rosen spoke from his table calls for speculation braun looked down over her podium mr hardy let me rephrase he came back to the witness id ask you to close your eyes if it would help you to remember sir when you first saw the woman leaving the hanover home was the sun shining much to hardys surprise willis actually complied when he opened his eyes again after a couple of seconds he nodded i believe it was yes good now when did you first notice the woman coming down the steps at hanovers three houses up the street from your own thats right about a hundred feet would you say about that and at that time the very first look you got you told mr rosen that you thought the woman was missy damiens i did and why was that well primarily i think because it was her house she lived there id seen her in similar clothing i would have expected it to be her all right and where were you standing in your own home by the front window a jutting bay window is that right yes all right now after this woman came down the steps you said she crossed the street is that right yes on a diagonal or directly across i wasnt really watching that closely i couldnt say you werent watching her no not specifically i was having cocktails with friends as i said thats right how many cocktails had you had by this time by the way for the first time williss affable manner slipped clearly affronted he flashed an angry look at hardy one he answered with no expression in other words you were on your first cocktail or youd already had one and were on your second your honor rosen trying to come to the rescue argumentative not at all mr rosen braun said overruled mr willis you may answer the question janet jan saunders read it back and willis straightened his shoulders i dont recall exactly i believe it was my first one all right hardy said and for the record what kind of cocktail was it your honor this time rosen stood up with the scraping of his chair but before he could even state his grounds braun overruled him it was a manhattan willis said hardy gave him a cold grin the men were enemies now punctiliously courteous in direct proportion to their growing hatred for one another thats two shots of good bourbon and a shot of sweet vermouth is that right thats right all right now lets go back to the woman who is now across the street correct yes the woman you initially thought was missy damiens i thought she must have been missy damiens i didnt think she was ah hardy brought in the jury with a look then went back to the witness what made you change your mind she walked differently she walked differently how do you mean i mean she had a different walk i think its rather clear she didnt walk the same so youd studied ms damienss walk this brought another rolling round of laughter to the gallery and willis glared out at it with nearly the same intensity as braun i noticed it as one notices things i didnt study it all right then so this evening you simply noticed ms damienss walk yes hardy heard a sound behind him a dull thud he guessed it was rosen letting his hand fall in frustration to the table but he didnt dare slow down enough to turn and look he didnt know ifwillis realized what hed just said but he was certain some members of the jury had all right he said but let me ask you this if you were looking at ms damienss walk how did you see her face i just he stammered i just saw it as she came abreast of where you stood in your bay window yes directly across the street yes so you only saw her in profile this stopped willis for an instant yes he said with a resurging bravado yes i guess i must have mustnt i i believe so said hardy he wasnt going to push on willis any harder now hed already wounded him badly and the jury would resent him for it instead he took a beat a breath then asked quietly mr willis your bay window is on steiner street facing due west is that true yes so it faces the sun as it sets right yes and the sun was out on the day of the fire correct yes low in the sky since it must have been at least seven fifteen and possibly as late as seven fortyfive when the woman came out of hanovers house mr willis hardy continued to review for the jury you saw a woman whom you initially took to be missy damiens leave the hanover home at around seven thirty you saw her again in profile only across the street from your bay window looking directly into a setting sun in the course of which you were in the middle of an alcoholic beverage made with two shots of spirits and one of fortified wine is all of this correct yes willis said as far as it goes i think it goes pretty far sir hardy said he turned and walked back to his table and sat down next to catherine who reached over and gripped his arm redirect mr rosen braun intoned no all right mr willis youre excused in farrells office hardy was prepared to beg if need be wes i need this you needed her missing alibi too diz which i dutifully provided if you recall but even assuming the lovely theresa hanover would see me again i thought she had a crush on you i may have overstated that slightly but as i say even if she would see me again sam and i have a date tonight you have no children you can have dates every night we do in fact and every one a treasure but this one is actually planned weve got reservations with some pals at farallon hardy grimaced and farrell horizontal with a legal brief open on his chest up until now straightened up on the couch with a deep theatrical sigh for informational purposes only what do you want to know this time how much she knew about missy damiens if she ever dug to find any dirt on her if she might have been blackmailing her farrell nodded just the kind of stuff i might easily work into a casual conversation you realize shell understand pretty quick whats going on didnt the cops ask her any of this cuneo didnt no and you expect me to find this out in a couple of hours sooner if you want to make your dinner how do i do that your usual wes charm brains psychology whatever it takes you really think she did this i really think its not impossible id like to have some kind of song i can get the jury to dance to farrell threw his abandoned brief down onto the floor at his feet he swore in resignation then looked up at hardy all right ill give her a call thank you and do me one other favor would you of course it goes without saying i live to perform favors for all and sundry what is it be careful the money got glitsky nowhere the social security number or ssn turned out to be valid although inactive because of the death of the person to whom it was issued hed spent three hours with lisa ravel and learned that missy damiens was a careful and perhaps sophisticated money moverover a twentyoddmonth period and with the exception of the straight passthroughs of large sums to leymar construction she had never moved a sum of money either to cash or to another account greater than ten thousand dollars occasionally when the balance in her checking account wouldnt be completely depleted before the next deposit was due she would withdraw all the cash down to a few hundred dollars and sometimes this would be as much as four thousand more dollars destined for her safedeposit box in all glitskys rudimentary math revealed that she might have squirreled away nearly four hundred thousand dollars and that meant that for at least a few days before she died shed had access to that much money in cash maybe shed even carried it with her on her person somewherein a backpack a briefcase a shopping bag if the wrong person even caught a glimpse then this glitsky knew was plenty to get yourself killed over what he didnt know and couldnt figure out was why other than hardys theory that she had been planning to leave paul hanover shed withdrawn it just when she had he was beginning to think it had to be some sort of blackmail a payoff had gone wrong in the hanover home and the witnessesvictims hadnt survived coincidence he believed was not an option but there was something hed clearly overlooked and that now beckoned as the next maybe the only logical step left for him to take although the specific destination remained murky why did he care so much about missy damiens was it just a desire to prove that cuneo had been wrong all along or was it that his gene for justice wasnt being served he kept discovering more facts about her only to learn that in some ways he seemed to know less but he couldnt stop himself all of this money her sophistication the duplicity about where and whether she worked her exotic and unknown backgroundall of these factors contributed to the fascination she was the key to something significant he was certain of that maybe it wasnt the key to her own murder as well but her story begged for a resolution and glitsky felt that if he could provide one it might help to close a circle for him as well and not incidentally though he couldnt predict exactly how he believed it might have an impact on hardys trial he called paganucci while he waited for lisa ravel to finish her xeroxing then thanked her for her time and expertise when he exited the building his driver was waiting on the kearny street side heading downtown even with the lateafternoon rush hour it didnt take them fifteen minutes to get back to the towhold headquarters a few blocks south of the hall of justice on townshend a large brownish brick warehouse that now screamed desertionfrom the street the place looked as though it hadnt seen any sign of life in a decade the large auto bay doors were closed at both the front and sides several windows high up on all three visible sides were broken black jagged holes and the others covered with cobwebs dust and soot were opaque paganucci pulled up in front of the entrance with its peeling white paint and faded logo and lettering he put the car in park turned it off got out and opened glitskys door to the gritty and wet wind much to glitskys surprise the door was open he entered and turned into the administrative office that had been drywalled into the semblance of a planned room a dozen or so gray metal desks squatted in the bullpen behind the counter the tops of each of them were bare except for a computer terminal a telephone a blotter and a twotiered metallic inout basket he saw no one but heard a radio somewhere and walked by the counter then behind it following the sound within the larger office a smaller unit sulked in one corner and here glitsky found two slightly beyondmiddleaged men playing cardsit looked like gin rummyon another desktop this one completely bare whos winning he asked the fat man facing him raised his eyes and showed no surprise at the sight of a large uniformed black police officer filling his doorway glen he said his breath rasping with the exertion but not for long ha glen didnt even turn around to look glitsky stepped into the room im trying to locate a car got a license for it yes welp the fat man put a p on the end of his well punctuating it further with a little pop of breath as though the syllable had nearly exhausted him he placed his cards facedown in front of him wheezing he lifted himself out of his chair squeezed his way out from behind the desk he extended a hand as he passed said horace and kept going into the outer office stay here you dont mind watch him he dont cheat he said ha glen said again horace got himself situated behind one of the outer desks fiddled with the mouse waited for the screen to brighten whats the number glitsky gave it to him mdc horaces fingers moved he waited staring at the screen each labored breath the sigh of a bellows after a bit he nodded yep mercedes c thats it your lucky day he said they took it here space n your car no a crime victims horace made a sympathetic clucking sound through the rasping he leaned in closer and squinted at the screen mitchell damien he okay she glitsky said and shes dead from the other room hey horace you playing or what im what is what keep your pants on he shook his head in displeasure at his opponents impatience then came back to glitsky welpa deep breathso what do you want with the car i just want to look at it see if she left anything in it that might identify her killer he left the doorway of the smaller room and got close enough to horace where he could see the screen does it say where you picked it up sure two hundred block of eleventh avenue thats where she lived there you go horace leaned back ran a hand around his florid face theres nothing in itthat dont mean nobody stole nothin means there wasnt nothing in it when it got here okay glitsky said could i trouble you to print out a copy of the record for me sure take two seconds for whatever good it would do glitsky thought already today he had added sixtysome pages of bank of america records to the damiens folder hed been developing just being thorough but it would be foolish to abandon the practice now horace pulled the page from the printer by the counter and handed it over taking glitskys measure one last time and seemingly satisfied he walked with great effort all the way back across the outer office to a large white panel about six feet on a side that swung out to reveal a numbered grid of eyehooks most of which held sets of keys he picked the one off of n walked back and handed it to glitsky youve got the keys glitsky asked she left her keys in the car no car sits in the lot this long unclaimed generally its going to auction so we need keys we used to have a couple of locksmiths on staff even but those days are gone now stillhe pointedthose ought to open the thing up its inside about twothirds of the way back theyre numbered you cant miss it ill flick on the lights for you bring the key back when youre done im off at five thirty so before then or come back tomorrow glitsky looked at his watch he had fortyfive minutes today ought to do it he said thanks what if he doesnt call her as a witness glitsky referring to theresa hanover was in hardys office throwing his darts hardy weary but still rushing with adrenaline and elationhe thought hed basically kicked ass with all of the eyewitnessessat crossways on the love seat perpendicular to his desk hes got to call her shes the motive the jurys got to hear how badly catherine wanted the money and from her own sweet reluctant motherinlaw it ought to break hearts and then what and then i introduce our alternate theory on cross theresas own motive every bit as good as catherines her own lack of alibi her attendance at the fire itself the ring and paying the cash for the car plus whatever wes might be finding out even as we speak and the judge will let you do all that maybe not the cash for the car but the rest maybe at least the beginning of it ill be subtle besides i think her honor is beginning to thaw the eyewitness testimony was rosens case and if i do say so myself it took a pretty good hit today id hate to jinx my good fortune but if im rosen im a worried man about now and theresas his last witness she might be close to it anyway which is why im going to need you around youre next up after i call catherine for the defense i love it glitsky threw the last dart in his round and was walking to the board halfway there he stopped and faced his friend his expression black starting tomorrow all day hardy nodded most of it anyway but look at the bright side like you always do i ask you questions and the answers eviscerate cuneo but glitsky was shaking his head i dont like him any more than you do more than that between you and me this whole conspiracy thing hes on about terrifies me hes too close and maybe hes got other people thinking i go up on the stand against him its going to look personal and hes going to itch to pay us both back personally if he can tell me you havent considered this of course as things now stand hes a threat i grant you a big threat and im not just talking careers i get it abe really but whats the option ive already creamed him on cross he cant hate me worse than he already does or you probably but above all hes a cop diz cops dont testify against cops maybe youve heard so you think theresas a reluctant witness waitll you get me up there you really dont want to go on get the son of a bitch id rather get the murderer and thats not catherine glitsky wasnt going to fight him on that all right he said but i hope youre real aware that my friends in uniform are not going to double their love for me after i snitch out a cop on sexual harassment glitsky got to the dartboard and slowly pensively pulled his round from it reading the body language hardy came around square on the love seat sitting up he spoke quietly with some urgency all youll be talking about is what catherine said to you abe thats not you accusing cuneo of anything catherine will say what happened youll simply say she reported it before she got arrested glitsky barked a bitter little laugh that distinction might not sing to the troops itll have to i need the testimony i know i know i just wish youd found something else a nod almost anything god knows i looked i thought between the banking and the car something would have popped but nothing really nothing at all glitsky indicated the folder of damienss stuff hed brought up with him youre welcome to look at all the fascinating details but i wouldnt get my hopes up i wont but if its any consolation maybe i wont need it for your client maybe not but theres still the murders and whoever did them is still walking around on the street yeah but theres a lot of that abe it happens granted but thats no reason to accept it the words came out perhaps more harshly than hed intended i dont mean glitsky let the phrase hang then laid hardys three darts on the polished surface of the desk im going home he said im done in hardy knew lawyers who couldnt get to sleep until nearly dawn for the duration of their trials others who crashed after dinner and woke up at three thirty in the morning the one constant seemed to be the disruption of sleep patterns for his own edification and amusement hardy played it both ways which tended to wreak havoc on his life and psyche two days ago up at five am asleep at one am then this morning glitskys call again around five now here he was at his office no dinner inside him eight pm hed called home an hour ago and told them he would be late dont wait up hardy had been going through the damiens folder glitsky had delivered the precise relevance of all this continued to be elusive although hardy couldnt escape the same conclusion that glitsky had reached it may not have been what killed damiens and hanover but some other intrigue was definitely going on in her life blackmail extortion money laundering something hed been surprised enough to learn about the siphoned money but even the smaller details rankled he hadnt known that shed kept up her rent on the place on eleventh avenue for example not that it mattered but still or why she would have lied about her employment the fact that shed written the leymar checks out of her own account if any kind of significance came to attach itself to these details and so far none did hed have to try to find out from catherine maybe she knew how missy and paul had specifically connected there had to have been a mutual friend or acquaintance hardy didnt believe paul had just picked missy up somewhere although of course that was also a possibility maybe missy had in fact set her sights on paul just as his exwife and children suspected for his wealth and standing the galling thing was that he didnt even know why he was continuing with the exercise studying numbers going over the monthly statements page by agonizing page deposits withdrawals deposits withdrawals at one point he looked up and said aloud who cares but he kept up the routine halfway through he made himself a double shot of espresso and brought it back to his desk no word at all yet from wes farrell when he finished he checked his watch again and saw that it was nearly nine he stood and closed the folder leaving it on the center of his blotter all that work like so much of trial preparation to no avail the worst thing about it he thought was that you very rarely knew what youd need so you had to know everything cricking his back he brought his coffee cup over to the sink then crossed to the door and opened it he vaguely remembered a knock on that door in the past hour or so one of the associates telling him she was leaving he was the last one left in the building if he wanted to set the alarm on the way out in the lobby dim pinpoints of ceiling lights kept the place from being completely dark but it was still a far cry from the bright bustling business environment it assumed during the day off to his right through its immense windows the solariums plants and ferns and trees cast strange shapeshifting shadows that seemed to move which made no sense in the empty space hardy had once had some bad luck in the supposedly empty office and now curious he walked over and opened the door to the room a small birdsparrows got in through the side door from time to timeswooped down out of one of the trees and landed in the center of the conference table where it eyed him with a distant curiosity hardy flicked on the lights and walked around the outside of the room at the door that led out to the small patch of ground that held the memorial bench theyd installed in honor of david freeman he stopped and turned the sparrow was still watching him too hardy opened the door all the way and went outside the sides of buildings rose on three sides around him the memorial garden existed thirtysix feet above the sutter street sidewalk with a grilled fence along the parapet on the open side hardy sat down on the freeman bench it was very still here and quite dark with only the barest of muffled sounds coming up from the city below he let his burning eyes go closed his breathing slowed the passage of time ceased and then suddenly wide awake he sat up straight hyperaware of the silence and emptiness around him he brought his right hand up to his forehead whispering wait staring unseeing for another several seconds into the open space in front of him his head pitched slightly to the side he sat as if turned to stone he dared not move afraid that the stillevanescent thought might vanish with as little warning as it had arrived he looked at it from one angle then another trying to dislodge the force of it there was the fact itself and then far more important there was what it meant what it had to mean what it could mean nothing else but when it appeared that the idea had setunnoticed by hardy the sparrow had flown out to the bench then off into the nighthe went back inside closing the door behind him back at his desk he hesitated one more moment before opening the folder again it was still there the fact that had finally penetrated the only significant detail in the mass of minutiae just where it had been before and not a mirage at all its not a trick question your honor hardy was in brauns chamber first thing in the morning on three hours of sleep and was aware that a bit of testiness had found its way into his voice it didnt bother him too much im trying to accommodate my witnesses some of whom mr rosen might admit have lives outside of the courtroom if they are not going to be needed until tomorrow or even next week id like to let them go home or back to their jobs reasonable enough mr rosen braun said lets answer mr hardys question shall we is theresa hanover your last witness i dont know how long shell be on the stand your honor rosen said then itll be a surprise for all of us whats your problem here no problem your honor i like to keep my options open hardy knew that braun was not a fan of sarcasm and so tried with some success to keep the irony in his tone to an acceptable level if he changes his mind and calls another witness your honor you have my word i wont appeal brauns reaction showed that hed come close but after the quick squint at him she directed her words to rosen defense counsel will not hold you to your statement here all right now barring lastminute decisions that youll have every right to make do the people currently plan to rest after theresa hanovers testimony is complete yes your honor thank you that wasnt so hard now was it but she didnt wait for him to answer instead she said mr hardy youve got your witnesses here i take it yes your honor good then she started to rise from her couch pulling her robes around her but hardy interrupted there is one other small point we need to discuss though with a frown and a grunt of disapproval the judge lowered herself back onto the cushions and that is before i begin my case in chief id like to recall one of the states witnesses for further crossexamination rosen didnt want any part of this and shaking his head in disbelief at his opponents gall he immediately spoke up in both outrage and indignation your honor mr hardy has had his fair chance to crossexamine every one of my witnesses and now because perhaps hes remembered something that hes overlooked or should have asked the first time he shouldnt be allowed a second chance he can just call the witness during his case hardy simply stood at ease a bland expression on his face his eyes on the judge your honor he said further crossexamination of this witness may materially change the way i present my defense rosen didnt believe it sure it will so first were supposed to let you know who im calling today so you can accommodate your witnesses and then i tell you and youre stalling anyway though hed addressed hardy directly and not the court braun didnt seem to notice this morning i dont have any other witnesses in court today except theresa and sergeant cuneo anybody else well have to subpoena again it could take weeks is it one of them rosen asked do you want to play twenty questions hardy asked he turned to the judge this is ridiculous your honor ive already spoken to the witness just last night and he told me hed be happy to come down and talk on the record he is in fact in this building right now i didnt need a subpoena to get him to do it hes interested in the truth this brought a guffaw from rosen i bet braun turned on him now that will be enough mr rosen mr hardy who is this witness dr yamashiru and you say hes here now outside in the hallway your honor i talked to him just before we came in here there will be no delay at all and your crossexamination will focus on what hes already testified to yes your honor in light of these new facts his testimony is of course central to the peoples case and i believe these new facts will be critical if the jury is to reach a just verdict would you care to share these facts with the court back here if it please the court dr yamashirus testimony will speak for itself rosen couldnt hold back from addressing hardy directly so now youre withholding discovery turning to the judge your honor this is both blatant and outrageous but braun countered legal if he calls his own witness he has to give you his statements as you know if he recalls one of yours its just further cross and he doesnt she turned to hardy this had better be further cross counselor and not new material braun wasnt sure that she liked it but hardys motion specifically excluded questions that he might have neglected to ask through oversight or error the first time yamashiru had testified she knew that new facts sometimes did get discovered in the middle of a trial and when they were legitimate should be admitted braun let out a heavy sigh gathered her robes around her again and this time stood all the way up how much time are we talking about mr hardy a half hour id say at the most mr rosen any objection if he goes first get it out of the way at last rosen seemed to understand the way the wind was blowing if its really a half hour your honor i have no objection it didnt even take half of a half an hour braun succinctly explained the situation to the jury and then hardy called back up to the stand the forensic odontologist whod identified missy damiens by her dental records the clerk reminded yamashiru that he was still under oath and he said he understood that and sat erect in the witness box he was a mediumsized wiry man in his early fifties well dressed in a dark gray suit and a modernlooking multicolored tie his attitude was of expectancy even eagerness recognizing his patient catherine hanover at the defense table he gave her a friendly though discreet nod hardy noticed it and hoped some of the jurors had seen it as well anything to humanize the defendant he held some loose papers in his handthe dailies from the day earlier that yamashiru had been on the stand testifying for nearly two hours hed studied them this morning at his dining room table just after hed gotten up an hour before dawn now in the courtroom he stood six feet in front of his witness and bowed slightly dr yamashiru since its been a while since you gave your testimony i wanted to review for a moment the thrust of what you said the last time you were here it is true that missy damiens had dental work done at your office on several occasions between keeping it concise but detailed enough to jog the memories of the jurors who like hardy had possibly slept through parts of yamashirus earlier testimony he brought the witness up to the present and you concluded did you not doctor based on your expertise and experience that the dental records identified in your office as those of missy damiens correlated exactly with those of the female victim of the fire in this case yes i did exactly exactly there was no doubt whatever thank you doctor hardy took a surreptitious deep breath as he walked back to the defense table where catherine sat staring at him with a laserlike intensity a mixture of fear and faith he hadnt had time to meet with her before they got to the courtroom today and even if hed found the time to talk to her in the holding cell he wasnt completely sure he would have told her his plans until it was done it wasnt done and he was loath to raise her hopes walking back to his place in front of the witness he said doctor did you yourself do any dental work on missy damiens no even through the security doors hardy was aware of the expectant buzz in the gallery but he dared not pause no you were not her dentist not personally she came to my office but the work was done by my associate dr kevin lee and is dr lee still with your practice doctor no he opened his own shop in san mateo about a year ago think back carefully doctor do you recall if you ever actually met missy damiens yourself it took yamashiru twenty seconds an eternity in a courtroom no i cant say that i did and yet you identified her records yes well i had the records i examined the records they were in her name thank you doctor back at the defense table hardy reached over and squeezed catherines hand and then straightened up and turned back around he walked to the table off to the right of the jury box that held the prosecution and defense numbered and lettered exhibits there he picked up the eightbyten original photograph of missy damiens that hed introduced for his crossexamination of maxine willis as defense exhibit a turning again he faced the judge may it please the court he said i am holding in my hand a photograph earlier designated as defense exhibit a id like to pass it around the jury if i may hardy waited in suspended tension as the photograph made its silent way down the front row of six then to the back rowman woman man man and at last it was back in his hand taking another breath to calm his nerves now jangling he advanced right up to the jury box dr yamashiru he said would you please take a careful look at this picture and tell the members of the jury who it is a picture of yes its missy damiens doctor if you never met her how do you know that well i guess first because inspector cuneo told me it was her when he showed me the picture and then of course i saw her picture in the papers too please think back doctor when inspector cuneo showed you this photo it was a single photo wasnt it yes im sure it was and he didnt ask you if it was missy damiens he told you it was didnt he yes so doctor you merely confirmed what the inspector already knew correct yes doctor if i told you that your former associate dr lee who actually worked on the patient told me just last night that this was not the person whom he knew as missy damiens would you have any reason to doubt him yamashiru paused again no behind hardy an audible gasp rippled through the courtroom he heard catherines restrained oh god and one of the jurors swore under his breath up on the bench braun looked for a moment almost as though shed been struck but hardy didnt savor the moment he needed to nail it down for the record dr yamashiru he said id ask you to please take another moment to look at this picture and once again id ask you outside of what youve read or been told do you know who this woman is no have you ever seen her before i dont think so has she ever personally been a patient of yours no suddenly hardy felt the strain go out ofhis shoulders he drew a breath let it out and addressed the judge your honor the defense will be adding dr kevin lee to our witness list catherine gripped his hand as he came back to the defense table how can that be she asked what does it mean she brought his hand up to her mouth and kissed it oh thank you thank you hardy brought both of their hands back down to the table covered hers with both of his firmly easy he said easy its not over all around them in the gallery as well as the jury box pandemonium had broken loose and braun was gaveling to get her courtroom back under control to hardys left rosen was on his feet as though he were going to ask some questions of dr yamashiru but he hadnt yet moved from the prosecutions table beside him cuneo slumped head in his hands their case was suddenly in shambles and everyone in the courtroom knew it rosen threw a look over to hardy then brought his eyes back front gradually as order was restored braun seemed to remember that she still had a witness on the stand mr rosen she intoned almost gently redirect shellshocked rosen opened his mouth to speak but couldnt manage a syllable hardy saw his opening and decided to take it normally in a largely pro forma gesture the defense would make an oral pitch for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the prosecutions case in chief this motion asked the judge to rule that as a matter of law the prosecution hadnt presented a sufficient weight of evidence to satisfy its burden of proof therefore without the defense even having to present its case the defendant should be released in practice the release of a defendant in this manner was a rare event indeed but it did happen on occasion there was ample precedent and hardy thought that if ever a directed verdict were called for it would be now after all catherine was charged with killing missy damiens if she wasnt the victim in this case if missy wasnt in fact even dead for certain and that now appeared to be the case then that charge against catherine became moot even more satisfyingly the botched identification of one of the victims underscored the ineptness and even prejudice of the original police investigation if they couldnt even get the victim right how was the jury going to believe anything else they proposed so hardy was standing now and the judge was nodding indicating with her hand that counsel should approach the bench in the relative calm of lou the greeks hardy and glitsky sat in a darkened back booth about a half hour before the lunch crowd would arrive in earnest hardy was dipping pita bread into the lous version of tsatsiki which incorporated soy sauce and hot chili oil into the standard yogurt garlic and cucumber mix and somehow the resulting glop managed to work i blame you hardy said if you hadnt whined so much about having to testify i wasnt whining hardy put on a voice if i testify against a cop the other uniforms wont like me anymore he popped some bread so if i wanted to save you all the embarrassment and worse i figured i had to come up with something all right but how did you get it the car the car he nodded i always said that was the key now if youd only have found it earlier but i guess better late than never huh im sure you did the best you could glitsky wasnt going to rise to the bait what about the car though it was towed from in front of missys apartment yes it was so so she drove it there right and and if she died in the steiner street house it would have still been somewhere near alamo square where she had parked it where the willises had seen her get into it no they said it was catherine thats what they said but they were wrong it was missy all right at least i assumed it had to be it couldnt have been anybody else really but i wasnt completely sure until i talked to yamashiru then found dr lee and went by his place last night and showed him the picture actually i had some more family snapshots of missy too and yamashiru didnt recognize any of them i just wanted to pin yamashiru down before cuneo got him to remember seeing missy around the office and if she wasnt the one in the fire glitsky said she couldnt have been the one he identified from the dental records exactly right so she did it missy thats the money bet hardy said then she split with the money you have any idea why i thought id leave something for you to figure out thats police work as you are no doubt aware i deal only in the realm of exalted and abstract thought glitsky couldnt fault him for crowing a little he figured hed earned the right so wheres it at now he asked the directed verdict brauns deciding technically she shouldnt grant it the motion only goes to the peoples case and whether that evidence alone could support a verdict yamashiru has only said he doesnt really know if the photo belongs with the records in his office those records are in the alleged victims name and dr lee hasnt testified yet but everybody knows whats coming and brauns so pissed at rosen and cuneo she might just pull the trigger and whether she grants the motion or not the jurys got to believe the police investigation was totally inept if not completely contrived citytalk by jeffrey elliot the big news around the hall of justice this week was the bombshell dropped by forensic odontologist read dentist toshio yamashiru in the doublemurder trial of catherine hanover dr yamashiru had previously testified about the identity of the female victim in the case whose body had been discovered burned beyond recognition with that of paul hanover at his alamo square mansion last may hanovers girlfriend missy damiens had been one of the patients in dr yamashirus practice and he compared damienss dental records with those of the deceased woman and pronounced them identical on thursday morning however defense attorney dismas hardy recalled the dentist to the witness stand for crossexamination during the questioning hardy showed him a chronicle file photograph of missy damiens and inquired if dr yamashiru could identify the woman in the picture he could not stating that hed had no real contact with the woman his patient who had called herself missy damiens as well was still clearly the deceased but evidently she was not the person whod been engaged to mr hanover dental records are often the only way to identify a body that is otherwise unidentifiable outside the courtroom after the stunning testimony dr yamashiru emphasized however that the forensic odontologist only verifies that the teeth of the victim match those of his sample dental records the actual identification of the individual is left to the detective in charge of the case yamashiru explained sergeant dan cuneo and he got it wrong judge marian braun called a halt to further proceedings today while she mulls over her ruling on mr hardys motion to dismiss all charges against his client whobecause a double murder mandates the charge of special circumstancesis facing life imprisonment without the possibility of parole which of course leaves two related questions assuming hardy is right and the dead woman is not missy damiens who is the dead woman and where is missy damiens in the end the district attorney himselfclarence jackmanappeared before braun could rule on the motion your honor he said in light of the new evidence weve seen in this case the people move for catherine the ordeal was over part three on a fogbound windswept and blustery thursday in early march six weeks to the day after jackman dismissed the charges against catherine hanover and braun ordered her released from jail glitsky was doing his own driving he was not in uniform instead he wore a pair of dark heavy slacks and a blue dress shirt and his new glock automatic in his shoulder holster when he got out of the car hed cover the weapon with his allweather jacket the night before hed checked out another cityissued taurus and this morning hed gone against the traffic over the bridge to the east bay and taken interstate east now just beyond american canyon road outside of vallejo he encountered a blanket of some of californias central valley foghed heard of tule fog but hadnt before experienced it for his money the stuff put its more notorious san francisco counterpart to shame never mind the fog that rolled in over the city for six months out of the year off the pacific this he thought was the real deal every year he knew it was responsible for multivehicle wrecks and doubledigit fatalities from redding to bakersfield fairfield to auburn visibility was under a hundred yards and glitsky got into the slow lane and decreased his speed to thirtyfive which still felt too fast but on his left cars continued to fly by at twice his speed each on the tail of the vehicle in front of it three times people in the slow lane had come up on him hellbent for leather from nowhere out of the whiteness disappearing back into it as they swerved to avoid him honking all the way flipping him off idiots glitsky wasnt in a hurry and even ifhe was this wasnt the time or the place hed get where he was going when he got there and that would be soon enough the reason for his reluctance was that he wasnt completely certain of the wisdom of his intended actions and the more time he took before they became irrevocable the more comfortable hed remain he might even give himself enough time to change his plan entirely but he didnt think so on the damiens matter and the hanover murder they were one and the samehed decided to stay on in the role of prime mover in whatever events unfolded the smart move the professional approach he knew would take him out of the loop he should leave it to the local jurisdiction in the valley now or to the fbi each had an equally strong claim to supervise and carry out the apprehension of missy damiens but almost a year ago kathy west had asked him to take a watchdog role in the case hed been unable to prevent cuneo from endrunning around him getting an indictment on a woman who was almost undoubtedly innocent then the trialwith all of its tabloid stupidity vulgarity and wastehad led to the renewed currency of the conspiracy theory cranks came out of the woodwork and insisted on involving him hardy and his client the mayor possibly even chief batiste and district attorney clarence jackman as players in every problem plaguing the city from potholes to a rise in the rate of auto theft and for every one of his good coconspirators the charges and innuendoes had been and in some cases remained a huge burdenalways personally always politically and sometimes in business terms as well but for glitsky and hardy specifically the charge held an even greater threat for they both had conspired yes there had been defensible reasons even compelling ones but they were conspirators and while the word was bruited about they were both in constant if not to say imminent danger of being discovered even at this remove in time and all of it glitsky believed on some level was his fault hed been intimidated by cuneo whod unwittingly played on glitskys own deepest fear that someone would discover his role in the shootout that had killed a police lieutenant hed been outmaneuvered by both the inspector and rosen then during his investigation while the trial went on hed been plain outthought by his best friend at every turn of this case at every opportunity to make a difference glitsky had failed a murderer had killed in the jurisdiction for which he held the ultimate responsibility and that person was still at large after a lifetime of service glitsky was finally in a position of real authority as the deputy chief of inspectors but the entire hanover affair had destroyed much of his own selfesteem far more importantly he knew that it had sullied his reputation among the police departments rank and file and perhaps also at higher levels he felt it every day in many ways large and smalla silence when he entered a room a failure to meet his eyes invitations for anniversaries and retirements that somehow never got delivered to him he was afraid now that his ascension to upper management had turned him into what he swore hed never becomea functionary a bureaucrat peterprincipled out at his position if he didnt get back the respect of his peoplefrom below and from abovehis tenure at the top would remain in a hollow holding pattern he would achieve nothing greatneither revolutionary change for the better nor even simple efficiency his earlier promise would forever be perceived as a chimera his promotion a function of the conspiracy nepotism and cronyism his future only a slow slide into retirement when he would become a forgotten and pitiful fullpensioner a father of grandfather age unable to keep up with his young children or even his wife the fog thinned somewhat and he punched it up to fifty passing vacaville nowenormous malls and outlet stores lining the freeway for miles on both sides housing developments all on top of each other he didnt get out here to the valley very often but the growth seemed all out of proportion somehow when his first set of kids had been younger hed driven this road many times on the way up to ski the sierra and it had all been farmland back then really not too long ago fifteen twenty years and all of it gone now isnt this where california was supposed to grow its crops what were they going to use for land when the rest of it was all covered up and built over keeping his mind from confronting the real issue missy damiens the first glimpse the tuesday after the dismissal hardy picks him up at the hall glitsky putting on his seat belt hardy greeting him you said were going somewhere we are glide memorial i wouldnt have bothered you except its hanover and you might have questions of your own im all over it you gotta love a field trip you will the soupkitchen dinner was over by most nights but some people stay around making sandwiches to give out for the next day glitsky stands at the door a minute until an older grayhaired black man looks up puts down his knife wipes his hands and comes over lieutenant glitsky using the civil service rank glitsky had given him he sticks out his hand jesse stuart rev stuart thanks for meeting with me this is dismas hardy hes interested because he defended the woman charged with killing missy rev stuart doesnt much carehis life is feeding starving homeless people white men in suits dont figure much in the picture but hes polite so what can i do for you id like to go over a little of what we talked about earlier today about missy sure i looked it up in the meanwhile and it was like i said she started coming in to help out about four years ago now she was a regular couple of nights a week for most of a year then slowed down eventually stopped altogether some do and dorris no last name the minister smiles none i ever knew she was just dorris im sorryhardy says but whos she a regular here til last year last may right glitsky says throwing hardy apregnant look right i remember because she came in on my birthday and brought me a flower so dorris stopped on may tenth didnt never come again did you report her missing hardy asks stuart doesnt try to show that he thinks this is a dumb question but a hint of it leaks out no sir we try to feed as many as we can but we dont keep tabs on em but you didnt think it a little strange that she just stopped no happens all the time people come and go glitsky steps in did you know anything about her where she lived who with she didnt live anywhere or she lived anywhere say it any way you want she usually came in alone though sat by herself if she could but didnt make nothin out of it she was friendly enough to me and a good talker if you got her going actually pretty educated did some college one time how old was she glitsky asks stuart shrugs thirty fifty somewhere in there mostly she was hungry and she and missy became friends glitsky getting to it i wouldnt say that exactly sometimes theyd sit together thats all then one day she comes in im talking dorris now and shes all smiling showing off her teeth all clean and fixed up you know the clinics dont generally do dental so somebody asked and she said she had an angel that was all thats really all i remember about it nothing connected to missy herself it was just another little miracle like happens all the time here hardys is all game face hes got his own teeth clenched hard in his mouth his lips set glitsky thanks the reverend and they walk outside together she paid dorris to establish the dental records hardy says she knew she was going to kill her maybe not when she made the deal to get dorriss teeth fixed glitsky says maybe just setting it up in case she ever needed to glitsky knew that davis california was the home of one of the campuses of the university of california but that was about all he knew of it hed never before stopped in the more or less upscale college town which was located about ten miles southwest of sacramento the fog had lifted and now a drizzle surrounded the car steady enough to keep his windshield wipers on intermittent swipe leaving the freeway deep in thought he made an inadvertent wrong turn until a sign for a surgery clinic next to a sushi place struck him as so incongruous that it shook him out of his reverie and he realized hed come the wrong way and turned around heading back toward downtown he waited in a surprisingly slow and lengthy line of traffic ten minutes later the reason for the delay became clear some genius of a smalltown city planner had evidently decided it would be a good idea to have the five lanes of the freeway overpass funnel down into a narrow twolane tunnel underpass beneath an old railway line but glitsky was a longtime resident of san francisco to whom traffic delays were an everyday fact of life if he let traffic bother him he would have had a nervous breakdown or psychotic episode years ago there was a light at an intersection up ahead of him just in front of the tunnel that had already cycled through red twice it wouldnt be long another few minutes at most hed just wait it out its one week after the dismissal five weeks ago to the day and fbi special agent bill schuyler sits with glitsky down stairs in one of the halfhidden back booths across from the hall at lou the greeks its way after hours going on nine at night and glitsky hasnt yet been home everything he is doing with the hanover matter and all week hes been at it has been transpiring outside the realm of his daily work the two men have had a professional relationship for more than six years but its never easy with overlapping jurisdictions different procedures and priorities feds and locals werent like oil and water more like oil and oranges this is about to become clearer than ever schuyler says yeah glitsky hands around his mug of hot tea nods hes not surprised by the admission so much as by the sudden current of anger that courses through him youre telling me you knew i didnt know personally myself but yeah somebody in the bureau knew and whoever it was didnt think it might be worth mentioning say to the cops investigating a double murder schuyler isnt going to fight about it nope she was dead we checked ourselves and she was gone what difference would it make it might have made a small difference to the woman who spent eight months in jail accused of killing her not my problem neither is this i inquired into it as a favor to you and got what you wanted i dont see whats your beef tell you the truth she was connected into witness protection okay thats what you asked then somebody else apparently killed her so so maybe the killer was who she was being protected against it was determined that wasnt the case glitsky presses the skin at his temples runs his finger over the scar through his lips it was determined thats what they told me schuyler doesnt move a muscle his hands are clasped on the table in front of him he may know glitsky somewhat as an individual but this is not a personal conversation on any level it is bureau business so what was the protection about thats need to know then softening somewhat so i dont know any way to find out a shrug and what about now when it appears shes alive that i did ask seems she fooled us too so shes really gone thats what i heard why would she do that shake your protection if it was working schuyler shakes his head no idea glitsky wills himself to speak calmly let me ask you this bill your personal opinion would somebody in the bureau have helped her with this with what getting away after a minute he nods its barely possible i suppose but not if it involved killing hanover and another citizen and then torching the house but you do agree that it must have been her its possible i dont have an opinion officially shes still dead shes not dead theres no body okay youve only known that for a week before that shed been dead for ten months in the system shes still dead this isnt glitskys war besides dead or missing the official call doesnt matter to him do you know who her connection was a flare goes off in schuylers eyes he does a favor for glitsky and the guy wants to go around him higher up negative he says and they wouldnt tell me if i asked need to know again thats how we do it schuyler truly pissed off now starts to slide out of the booth glitsky reaches out a hand touches his arm stops him shes alive bill i intend to find her but i need something to work with i need to know who she is put in a request he gets out of the booth if anybody wants to talk theyll call you glitsky came to believe that the only realistic possibility of tracing missy damiens had to be through the very large sum of money shed stolen she wouldnt want to carry it around in cash she would have to put it somewhere if only for safekeeping so on the day after his meeting with schuyler he had made some inquiries with the local branch of the department of homeland security and had finally been put in contact with the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network known as fincen he didnt hold out much hope that the financial search would yield any results since hed already learned that missys social security number was inactive due to her apparent death but he had nothing else to pursue as a law enforcement officer glitsky had the authority to initiate what they called a section a request under that numbered provision of the patriot act at the same time he petitioned the attorney general of the united states indicating that the person he was investigating in the witness protection program had been charged according to usc section et seq with an offense that is punishable by more than one year in prison or that is a crime of violence the a request originally intended to monitor the financial dealings of suspected terrorist groups had in fact become primarily a tool to identify money laundering there was glitsky knew a host of problems with this approachprivacy issues first amendment questions the basic problem of government interference with the lives of private citizensbut they were not his problems not now and beyond that the approach seemed somewhat backward but to his astonishment his research turned up the fact that banks and most other financial institutionseven in post americadidnt try very hard to verify the identity of their customers in california and several other western states banks hire a private company to validate addresses and maintain databases on drivers license information for example but these verifications only concern themselves with whether the information is properly formatted that dates of birth are made up of a month a day and a year for example or that residence addresses are not in fact business addresses or that there are nine digits in the ssn broken in the right placesalthough inactive ssns due to death are flagged most unbelievably to glitsky banks did not even have to try to verify whether a given social security number matched a name instead they would open an account with a valid ssn or business tax id number and accept an accompanying drivers license or other form of id if the drivers license had your picture on it with the name joe smith and it seemed like a valid license then the bank would take your ssn and list the account under joe smith there was no system in place to identify fraudulent or fictitious names by comparing them to ssns or for tying all of this various identification information together the a procedure is straightforward simple lowtech every two weeks the government compiles a hardcopy list usually with between fifty and two hundred names of the government and law enforcement requests and sends it by fax or email to every financial institution in the country each one of these institutions within two more weeks then must provide information on whether it maintains or has maintained accounts for or engaged in transactions with any individual entity or organization listed in the request if a match is found the bank must notify fincen with a subject information form and when glitsky had gotten that form forwarded to him as the requesting party submitted to fincen by putah creek community bank in davis california he had gone to district attorney clarence jackman in great secrecy only jackman the judge whod signed the warrant and glitskys wife knew that he had obtained a search warrant for the records referenced in the report downtown davis was arranged in a grid with lettered streets running northsouth and numbered ones east west and glitsky had no trouble finding the putah creek community bank at third and c it was a small corner building about half the size of glitskys bofa branch in san francisco he drove by it continued on to fifth and turned right about a mile farther on outside the downtown section he navigated an unexpected roundabout and pulled into the parking lot of a lowrise building that looked new as an armed onduty officer from another jurisdiction he needed to check in with the local police not only as a courtesy but to try to avoid any of those complicated misunderstandings that sometimes cropped up when darkskinned men carrying concealed weapons encounter uniformed patrolmen glitsky didnt expect anybody to hold a parade in his honor but it couldnt hurt to have the locals know that he was in town he knew that he might also need to make arrangements for support and logistics the chief matt wessin came out and greeted him in the lobby ten or more years glitskys junior wessin exuded health competence and vigor the shape of his body indicated that he worked out for a couple of hours every day his hair bore not a streak of gray either on top or in the clipped military mustache the face itself was as smooth and unlined as a boys but he was every inch a professional cop first talking privately to glitsky about the situation in his office then bringing him into a small conference room to brief a small team of detectives and a couple of patrolmen who he assigned to temporary detail ladies and gentlemen he began there were two women in the room a lieutenant and a sergeant he made the introductions then continued by now youve all had a chance to look over the fax pages that deputy chief glitsky sent down yesterday hes got some more showandtell today mostly a couple more pictures of the woman hes hoping to locate here in town although she may already be gone as these pages indicate it appears that shes closed up her post office box she may also have simply abandoned her safedeposit box which is down at putah creek community bank but the upshot is that her address if any is a mystery im going to pass these new pictures around and invite you all to look at them and then review for a minute who were actually talking about this isnt something we hear every day i know but in this case id take it to heart she should be considered armed and extremely dangerous she got the deposit box under the name monica breque although she has previous aliases which include michelle or missy damiens if youll open the files in front of you youll see its two and a half weeks ago just after lunch on a monday afternoon glitsky made his a request more than three weeks ago and hasnt gotten any response yet an hour ago zachary was cleared for a month without the need for more testing and the dour and cautious dr trueblood even allowed himself what looked like a genuine and even optimistic smile glitsky gets back to his office at the hall ofjustice in the early afternoon he greets melissa spends a minute giving her the good news about zachary then turns left out of the reception area passes through the small conference room adjacent to it and into the short hallway that leads to his office where he stops his door is closed when he left for the doctors appointment three hours ago hed left it open he almost goes back to ask melissa if shed locked up for him while he was gone but then realizes that its probably nothing maybe some cleaning staff somebody leaving a note not an issue so he opens the door inside on one of the upholstered chairs in front of glitskys desk in a relaxed posture slumped even with his legs crossed is a man hes never seen before hes wearing a business suit and looks over at glitskys entrance you might want to get the door he says glitsky doesnt move who are you a friend of bill schuylers theres no threat in the softspoken voice he points you mind the door never taking his eyes off him glitsky complies the man returns the gaze for a second then stands up he is probably in his forties tall slim and pale half bald with a welltrimmed tonsure of blond hair hes already got his wallet in his hand and opens it up flashes some kind of officiallooking identification scott thomas he says youve been making inquiries about missy damiens do you really believe shes still alive i do i dont think theres any doubt of it are you fbi a small tidy almost prim chuckle no im sorry cia glitsky takes a beat i understood she was in witness protection she was we put her in it farmed it out to the bureau another ironic smile the company isnt allowed to operate domestically all right glitsky says how can i help you maybe we should sit down im okay on my feet thomass mouth gives a little twitch the man clearly isnt used to being gainsaid his orders even his suggestions get followed his eyes the pupils as black as a snakes show nothing resembling emotion it might take a minute he says in a pleasant tone well be more comfortable he sits again back in the easy chair and waits until glitsky finally gives up crosses behind his desk and lowers himself into his chair i want to tell you a story thomas says in the next hour glitsky hears about a young woman born monique souliez in in algiers the sixth child and youngest daughter of a very successful frenchtrained surgeon she too was schooled in france linguistically talented she traveled widely during her vacationswithin europe over several summers singapore another san francisco sydney rio but she came from a wellestablished and very closely knit family and when her formal education was completed in she returned to algeria where she took a job in junior management at the local branch of the banque national de paris and soon fell in love with a young doctor philippe rouget in she and philippe got married in a highly visible society wedding this was also the year in which a party of some moderate but mostly radical islamists called the islamic salvation front or fis won a round of parliamentary elections for the first time this victory prompted algerias ruling party the national liberation front fln to outlaw the fis and this in turn led to the first violent confrontations between the fln and the fis confrontations that within a year had grown into a fullscale civil war monique and philippe were not particularly political true they both came from the upper classes and socialized almost exclusively within that circle but mostly they kept to themselves and to the strong souliez extended family of doctors engineers professional people and their educated sophisticated welltraveled relatives the young couple themselves were contented newlyweds doing work that they felt was important and that would go on regardless of who was in power after monique became pregnant their personal world became even more insular even as the civil war escalated throughout the country and all around them idealistic and unaffiliated with any of the warring factions philippe volunteered when he could at both emergency rooms and makeshift clinics that treated both sides sometimes these werent clinics at all but calls in the night wounded and dying young men at their doors the slaughter meanwhile continued unabated until the government finally took the conflict to another level anyone suspected of fis sympathies would simply disappear amid rumors of mass graves and torture the government issued weapons to previously noncombatant civilians and this led to a further breakdown in order with neighbors killing neighbors with armed bands of simple thieves creating further confusion and havoc on the rebel side a splinter organization that called itself the armed islamic group or gia began a campaign of horrific retaliatory massacre sometimes wiping out entire villages killing tens of thousands of civilians favoring techniques such as assassinations car bombings and kidnappingand then slitting their victims throatsthey brought a new definition of terror to the conflict philippe and monique considered leaving the country of course they had a baby jeanpaul to protect now the rest of the family would understand but the rest of the family wasnt fleeing this was their home they and their civilized counterparts in similar predicaments believed it their duty to stay and philippe and monique came to feel the same way they would be the only hope for the country when the fighting stopped as they believed it eventually would but it didnt stop in time for philippe and jeanpaul pounding on their door in the middle of the night a twentyman squadron of government security forces broke into their home informants had told authorities that theyd seen philippe working on the gia wounded he was therefore with the gia they dragged him from the house knocking monique unconscious with rifle butts in the street as she screamed and fought and tried to get them to stop when she came to philippe was gone the door to her house was open and nearly everything in it was destroyed jeanpauls broken body lay in a corner of his bedroom with his dismantled toys and slashed stuffed animals littering the floor around him here glitsky holds up a hand iget the picture he pauses explains im not in a good place to hear stories about dead babies right now thomas jarred out of his narrative narrows his obsidian eyes in impatience or even anger then he checks himself glitsky suddenly gets the impression that he knows about zachary its unnerving sure thomas says noproblem he gathers himself picks up where he left off after the government thugs killed her husband and her son monique became transformed both by her need for vengeance and by her passionate hatred for the government and particularly its socalled security units within a month of the twin tragedies shed endured she went underground and joined one of the revolutionary brigades at this time the rebels still lacked a strong organizational structure or even a cohesive political platform they were united in seeking to overthrow the current administration and replace it with an islamic state but there was no central command or even a consensus on what type of islamic structure the country would eventually embrace if they were victorious the typical cell consisted of a loosely confederatedgroup of between ten and twentyfive individuals most of these were islamic of course but many christians and even some europeans were drawn to the cause in the way monique had beenby the governments brutality or by simple hatred of individuals in power many too joined the rebels because they hated france which supported the fln and its militarydominated regime the details ofmoniques next couple of years were sketchy but it was clear that she had become affiliated with one of the cells she may or may not have actually participated in many raids and ambushesthe accounts variedbut she certainly became comfortable with a variety of weapons and took part in planning and funding operations especially against security details such as those that had killed her family but as the governments ongoing campaign continued to decimate the rebels numbers the individual cells were forced to congeal into more cohesive and ever more secretive units the gia effectively beaten as an army had to abandon the pitched street battles that had marked the civil war stage of the conflict although they continued to assassinate to bomb and to kidnap the government for its part waged what began as a successful torture campaign against captured prisoners who were suspected of gia affiliation increasingly marginalized the rebels countered with an effective tool to guarantee the silence of its captured operatives if a captive talked his or her entire family would be killed not just husbands and wives and children but fathers mothers grandfathers and grandmothers uncles aunts and cousins to the third degree the most celebrated of these slaughters occurred in the government arrested a nineteenyearold boy named antar rachid on suspicion of taking part in the carjacking and assassination of a minor algiers municipal official three days after rachids arrest government security forces raided the downtown cafe out of which rachid had operated in the process killing three other gia soldiers and confiscating a large cache of automatic weapons cash and ammunition from the hidden room in the cafes cellar obviously they broke rachid with torture and he talked here glitsky speaks again how many of his relatives did they kill i was getting there the number seems to slow down even the phlegmatic thomas he takes a breath tries to sound matteroffact one hundred and sixtythree raids in algiers itself and in thirteen villages over the next couple of days gone before they knew what hit em after that thomas says captured suspects stopped talking and started dying in jail in algeria finally got a new civilian president abdelaziz bouteflika and he offered amnesty to rebels who hadnt been convicted of rape or murder or other heinous crimes along with about eightyfive percent of the rest of them monique returned to civilian life moving back in with her father and mother going back to work at the bank but shed proven herself a valuable organizer and strategist to the gia and they werent ready to abandon her it wasnt the kind of organization where you simply walked outrachids experience and many others similar to it made that crystal clear it was like the mob it doesnt matter if you were arrested or if you tried to leave on your own you are never out but by now im talking thomas continues things have really begun to change over there a new faction called the gspc splits off of the gia and though theyre still hitting government and military targets they swear off civilian attacks within the country after all the killing of the past years this has a lot of grassroots appeal the gia leadership doesnt see it that way but theyre losing influence and more importantly members and funding they need to do something dramatic to call the faithful to them this is jihad now not just revolution the will of allah will be done and even if fellow muslims are killed it is acceptable because they all become martyrs thomas pauses again the gia decides they are going to blow up the biggest elementary school in algiers six hundred kids lord the world glitskys elbow is on his desk his hand supports his head but monique wont help them she cant go there its too much glitsky snorts a note of derisive laughter a saint huh in some ways she was actually thomas shifts in his chair but now shes got an even bigger problem on the one hand she hates the government and what it stands for but on the other she cant let the gia go ahead with this bombing but if she tells anybody if she betrays her cell she knows what happens next her family disappears all of it shes seen it happen not just to antar rachid and his family but maybe half a dozen other times shes got four brothers and a sister all of them married with kids her mother and father both still young enough to be working her mother comes from a family of five her fathers the oldest of four shes got about fortyfive cousins thomas comes forward finally showing a hint of urgency theyre all dead if she talks theres no doubt about it meanwhile shes in on the planning if she refuses shes with the enemy she cant show a thing glitsky nodding appreciates her problem so she comes to you guys she comes to me personally im stationed over there at the time my cover is im with the visa section at the embassy but shes been underground for four years and shes figured that out i do some banking at her branch and she approaches me one day tells me her story the only way she figures she can do it is if she appears to be killed in the raid on the planners if id help her appear to die shes got information on a major planned terrorist attack remember this is pre but the cole had already happened the african embassies it might have been a trap but the bottom line is i believed her and it turned out it was all true they raided the cell and found the explosives and the government announced that monique souliez was one of the rebels killed in the raid and monique became missy damiens thats right glitsky sits in silence for a minute so why are you here now with me i thought you needed to hear the story why is that maybe so youll understand where shes coming from shes a quality person maybe the best thing would be to leave her alone wherever she is more than anything else shes a hero but glitsky doesnt even begin to accept this more than anything else she killed two people in my town i cant leave her alone that might not have been her no ill entertain other suggestions if youve got them it could have been gia glitsky snorts here they found her here but thomas keeps on with it its not impossible you know the guy they arrested at the canadian border with explosives bound for lax he was gia theyre still very much active theyre not going away maybe so glitsky says but they didnt befriend some homeless woman so they could establish phony dental records for her thomas takes in the truth of that it costs him some but he tries another tack if shes exposed they kill her family even now i would hope they wouldnt do that the words say it all thomas hears them clearly this his personal mission has failed but he tries one more argument id ask you to think of what shes been through its so different over there she hasnt lived in the same world as most of us do if she did kill these two people i know it was to save her family two deaths against sixty thats the kind of choice she had to make all the time back home it must have seemed like the only option she had maybe it did glitsky says but he doesnt give him any more after a last moment of silence poor lovesick scott thomas gets up out of his chair walks to the door opens it and like the spook he is vanishes inside the putah creek community bank three tellers sat ready to work the windows but there werent any customers a couple of other employees were huddled over a desk behind the screened work areamuffled voices that seemed to be talking gossip not banking out front a matronlylooking middleaged woman raised her head at the entrance of glitsky and matt wessin with a nervous smile she rose from her seat behind a shiny empty desk glitsky in his allweather jacket with a gun in his armpit hung back a few steps while the chief extended his hand to the woman obviously the two were acquaintedsmall town traci he said this is deputy chief glitsky from san francisco police yes we talked a couple of days ago more handshakes and wessin went on hes told you i believe that hes got a warrant to view the records of one of your accounts and also the contents of a safedeposit box linked to the same account do you remember a match in a a form you sent in a couple of weeks ago monica breque i do i think its the first one weve had out of this branch but im afraid i dont remember her when i saw the name on the formshe turned to glitskyand then when we talked the other day i tried to remember something about her but nothing came to me wessin said maybe one of these will help he produced from the folder he carried several likenesses that glitsky had brought up with him including not only the glossy of the chronicle photo but also several of hardys snapshots from the hanover family albums now traci examined the pictures slowly one by one when shed gone through them all she shook her head im afraid i dont know her at all and we pride ourselves on personal service knowing our customers on sight by name she might have had a bit of a french accent if thats any help glitsky offered she stopped shaking her head a french accent now that rings a bell and she started here last may we said that would have been me if it was a new account too im sorry traci looked back down at the pictures i just dont have any memory of someone who looked like this i do remember the accent though is it all right if i show these to the staff five minutes later one of the tellers admitted that like traci maybe shed seen the woman or someone who looked like her if it was the same person though the hair was certainly different and she doubted if shed been wearing the same kind of tailored highend city clothes she fancied in the pictures but all the same id bet its her great face so she still comes in here glitsky asked i dont know carla said i wouldnt call her a regular can you think of what was different about the hair the teller closed her eyes and gave it a try maybe it was short and not so dark but i cant really be sure she checked the picture again but ive seen her definitely this was reasonably good news but didnt get them anywhere so glitsky and wessin went back to the managers desk and got to the account records themselves missy or monique or monica did not use her checking account to write checks she had deposited a hundred dollars to open the account on may and hadnt touched it since this gave glitsky a sense of foreboding that he tried to ignore lets take a look at the safedeposit box he said they all walked into an oldfashioned vault with a heavily reinforced door its inner workings and tumblers open to the lobby traci had a set of the banks master keys for one of the locks and shed called in a locksmith to drill out the other one which needed the customers key in short order she was taking the box from its space in the wall she placed it on a table in the center of the vault it was one of the larger boxesa foot wide eighteen inches long four inches in depth it only took another few seconds to get it open unwittingly wessin whistled under his breath the stacks of moneyfifty and hundreddollar billswas what caught the eye first but then glitsky noticed what looked to be a rogue bit of tissue paper stuck against one side of the box he picked that up first and opened it in his hand it was of course the ring with the stone actually larger than hed pictured it wrapping it back up rather more neatly than it had been he put it on the table next to the box i guess we ought to count this next he said tuesday two days ago early afternoon in jackmans office with the door closed behind him and thick rare slabs of sunshine streaking the floor over by the windows the wind screaming outside jackman is in his oversize leather chair behind his desk his fingers templed at his mouth treya on the second day of her first week back at work after zacharys birth stands guard with her back against the door glitsky is looking on while the da reads the a form i just got this thing and wanted to run it by you i dont understand how this can be jackman says didnt you tell me her social security number came up deceased when i checked six weeks ago yes but if she opened this account within a few weeks of the hanover fire say or even sooner than that the computer wouldnt have caught up with her yet treya says shes a banker sir she knew it wouldnt glitsky adds shes done this before remember established an identity in a new town withginnedup docs undoubtedly she knew they dont check names against socials if nobody ever thought to ask and nobody has now for ten months shes golden what she didnt know about were the changes since jackman asks so what name is she using now monica breque i bet people call her missy treya says i wouldnt be surprised jackman straightens up in his chair we need to get her in custody have you talked to the davis people police yes sir a little and there is still a problemi talked to the manager at the bank and got a local address that seems not to be hers its not fictitious its just not where she lives they sent some officers around to check right away and it was somebody elses house entirely so we dont know where she is jackman isnt too fazed by this its a small town somebodyll know where she lives ill be following up on that i thought you might be jackman hesitates abe he talks quietly but hes firm why not have them work on the followup the davis police have them bring in the fbi if they want its a banking matter so its federal and shes a protected witness and when they find her and surround her and place her under arrest then have them bring her down here for her trial when theyre done with her youve found her you dont physically have to bring her in glitsky is standing in the atease position between his wife and the da he wouldnt be at all surprised if they both had the same opinion of what he should do now but he is not going to be drawn into this discussion instead he nods in apparent assent good point he says three hundred and fifteen thousand four hundred dollars even it took them nearly an hour to count it twice and be sure traci left the two policemen to the work toward the end of it wessin seemed to become a bit impatient checking his watch several times and glitsky learned that he was to be the speaker at a rotary event at noon glitsky had loosened up by now and had become nearly voluble he told wessin he should have known that the chief would have some public event he needed to attendhalf of glitskys own life was administrative stupidity and public relations both men agreed that if people knew theyd never want to move up through the ranks even so they both understood the importance of wessins speaking gig and picked up their speed when they finally finished wessin still had fifteen minutes they called traci back in to lock up the box again and insert it into its proper location a nexttoworstcase scenario for glitskyafter the possibility of her escaping again altogetherwould be if they could not locate the woman in a day or two of canvassing shopkeepers and neighborhoods and had to assign a fulltime person to keep watch in case she went to the bank for some cash but he had hopes that it wouldnt come to that already this morning wessins task force had gone out into the town and onto the university campus armed with their photographs two officers were going to the post officethey had what they hoped was a current alias and if shed ever gotten so much as a gas bill under that name they could find where she lived the french accent would stand out as would the face all talk of small town aside though the population of the greater area during the school year when college was in session was something in the order of a hundred thousand souls if she were consciously laying lowand her years as a rebel in algeria had certainly prepared her for thatthey could miss her for a very long time perhaps forever and thats if she were still here at all although the money argued that she was glitsky and wessinby now they were abe and mattwere standing on the sidewalk outside the bank the drizzle had let up along with most of the wind and though the streets were wet and it was still overcast patches of blue were showing in the sky above them people will be checking back in at the station after lunch abe i could drop you back there now if youd like or you could grab a bite downtown here its not san francisco but theres a couple of places to eat ill find em you dont have a jewish deli do you no but if you want deli zias is pretty damn good italian its on the next block on the way to where im going to talk you want ill show you it was a sad but true fact of glitskys life that since his heart attack and the neverending battle with cholesterol he rarely ate sandwiches anymore especially freshly sliced mortadella and salami and all those great nitrates with cheese and vinegar and oil on a justoutoftheoven sourdough roll but he was having one now enjoying it immensely washing it down with san pellegrino water thinking he liked this lowrise notquiteyuppified town even as he wondered where the black people were with the improving weather a steady stream of mostly young peoplestudents he surmisedpassed in front of him where he sat outside on the sidewalk he saw as many percapita asians as there were in san francisco and hispanics and from the evidence a thriving lesbian communityin fact ethnicities and minorities of every stripe seemed well represented here but there was nary a black person what he wondered was that about more than anything else he found it odd out of sync with the world he inhabited it was clouding up again as he was finishing his sandwich and his drink and he went back inside the crowded little deli to discard his bottle and napkins he looked at his watch he wasnt due to meet wessin for another twenty minutes so he stopped for a moment to look at the display of imported italian goods around the shelves maybe hed pick up some eggplant caponata for treya or roasted red peppers and surprise her they hadnt had much romance in their lives since zacharys birth and now she was already back at work after the maternity leave he should really get her something he never thought to surprise her he ought to change that in fact he should bring her presents more often he was thinking let her know how much she was appreciated appreciated he silently berated himself for the understatement he way more than appreciated her in four years she had become the center of his life some days he felt she had given him the gift of feeling again when it had for so long been dormant maybe some chocolate a box of baci or little kisses too romantic what was too romantic what kind of concept was that carefully replacing the roasted red peppers and the little jar of relish so they wouldnt fall he went over to the cash register where they kept the boxes of candy and was reaching out to pick one up when the woman behind the counter waved and cheerily called out au revoir madame an answering chirp of au revoir came from the doorway and glitsky whirled to catch a glimpse of female profile as she walked out the door and turned left up the street the candy forgotten now his mind completely blank he stood for a long instant frozen in his steps he wasnt completely sure whoever she was had become blond now hair cropped so short that it nearly appeared crew cut hed only glimpsed her briefly and the first impressionafter the shock of recognition itself was her youth this could not be a thirtynineyearold former terrorist and killer this was an anonymous student possibly in graduate school wearing very little if any makeup and sporting maybe a piercing through her eyebrow he didnt exactly have to fight his way out of the little shop but if he didnt want to push people over and cause a scene he had to be careful by the time hed come out onto the sidewalk she was already at the corner crossing walking away from him his mind racing he fell in behind her he had his pager on his belt but had left his cell phone in his car back at police headquartersthey were only going down to the bank and then back on a quick errand and hed had no reason to think hed need it he did have his gun but the sidewalk was if not packed solid with humanity at least well traveledtwenty or more people shuffled and strolled and simply walked in the space that separated them reluctant to close too much of the space between them he overruled his early inclination to try to make an arrest alone in the midst of these people he knew nothing about her own preparations or readiness in case of trouble she herself might well be the embodiment of that old clichearmed and extremely dangerous he could not risk provoking anything like a hostage situation he also had no idea how she would react if he tried to place her under arrest by himself the sight of a black man with a gun in a strange curiously whitebread town might cause the citizenry to react unpredictably even if he flashed a badge there might be enough craziness to allow a young screaming woman to get away in the startled crowd he had to get a plan he had to get a plan half a block further on she stopped to look in a shopwindow and it gave him a chance to close the gap already he was within the same block close enough to study her he had lived with the photographs of her now for six weeks that face from any number of angles that face with a wide range of expressions a car honked on the street behind him and she turned to look and any doubt melted away he had found her she wore oversize tan overalls and sandals with no socks on top an overlong sweater in a washedout green hid any intimation of the form beneath she was any dowdy even slovenly student unconcerned about her appearance without the casually overheard french goodbye glitsky might have stood next to her in the deliprobably had been standing next to herand he would have missed her entirely she brought a hand to her mouth biting into some kind of pastry perhaps a cannoli from the deli she leaned over slightly to keep the crumbs from falling on her then she began walking again glitsky stepped into the doorway of the magazine store where she had slowed down and watched as she crossed over diagonally in the middle of the block a few raindrops hit the pavement and she looked skyward threw her pastry into a corner trash can and picked up her pace he was going to lose her if he didnt move but when he crossed behind her and got to the corner she was still within the block stopping under the shelter of a buildings overhang she seemed to be checking her reflection in the banks window then brushing crumbs or the rain from her clothes with another glance at the sky she started up again walking away from downtown they crossed what glitsky recognized as fifth street and after that entered a residential neighborhood with small standalone houses on tiny lots the foot traffic here only three blocks from downtown was nonexistent which obliged him to extend the distance between them he ran the slight risk of losing her but he didnt think he would in any case he had the feeling that this was her general neighborhood she had come out for a snack or for lunch and now was walking home he could of course rush her now with no other pedestrians about he could put her on the ground if need be and place her under arrest but he was most of a full block behind her and there would be very little possibility of surprise and if she did notice him coming up on her and was in fact armed it could become needlessly ugly very fast better and it looked as if the opportunity would soon present itself would be to remain unseen and unnoticed behind her and let her get home then he would have her address after which he would immediately get to a phone and call for backup and the arrest would be done according to hoyle she crossed another larger streeteighththen turned right and left and into the driveway of a parking lot in front of a twostory stucco apartment building jogging glitsky managed to reach the driveway in time to see her disappear into the next to last downstairs unit he checked his watch wessin would have finished his talk and would be waiting by his car wondering where glitsky was but he could do nothing about that now all he needed was the unit number and he didnt even strictly speaking need that he knew it was the second from the end unit on the ground floor but he wanted to know for certain when he called it in it would be bad luck to get it wrong and have a bunch of eager patrolmen guns drawn come crashing through the door of some piano teacher he stood now in a steady light rain at the outer entrance to the open asphalt parking lot it was a small enough area with hash lines marking spaces for each of the eight apartment units and occupied at the moment by three wellused cars none of them models from the current millennium in number three where shed gone a light came on in the window he took a few steps into the lot getting some relief from the rain under a tree he still had the option to take her now by himself under any pretense or none at all he could simply knock at her door and wait until she opened it why would she suspect anything shed been living here apparently unmolested for ten months now and her life must have settled into some kind of a routine but he would be wise not to take her too lightly shed had years of experience in the terrorist underground of algeria and in that time had learned who could say how many tricks to elude capture or incapacitate authorities when capture was a synonym for death and truth be told though it galled him he was not sufficiently prepared for an arrest even if she had no weapon at her disposal he had no handcuffs and no way to restrain her except at the point of a gun which might turn out to be a limited option if he wasnt prepared to shoot her out of hand he had to get to a phone he thought it unlikely that having just returned home she would leave again especially in the rain he wondered if one of the cars in the lot was hers maybe the apartment belonged to a friend and she was visiting not living there he had to move he could lose her if he waited until every possible contingency had been covered but she was right here he stood under the tree torn by indecision mesmerized by the light in her window had a shadow just moved in the room he moved a few steps to his left to get a better view the rain fell in slow steady vertical drops a little harder now in front of him suddenly audible above him in the leaves of his sheltering tree he had to move the familiar snick semiautomatics round being chambered sounded very close to his ear the womans voice from behind him was quiet and assured with no trace of panic or even unusual concern i have a gun pointed at the back of your head dont turn around dont make any sudden movements keep your hands out in front of you where i can see them the only reason youre still alive is that i need to know who youre with san francisco police walk toward the apartment house second door from the left are you going to shoot me if you dont walk yes glitsky moved forward out into the rain he heard her footsteps now behind him and marveled that she could have come up behind him so quickly without a sound or a warning stop she said when he reached the door turn the knob and kick the door all the way so it swings open following her instructions to the letter glitsky stood in the threshold now walk into the middle of the room and link your hands on the top of your head he did as he was told heard her come in behind him and close the door now turn around the orders continued specific and organized take your right hand onlyslowly very slowlyand unzip your jacket all the way thank you get it off easy slowly and drop it to the floor behind you step away from it now she held the gun steadily in one hand glitsky noted how comfortable she looked with it and at the same time how nearly unrecognizable shed made herself the haircut was not so much short as chopped unevenly with no lipstick or other facial makeup and with the silver post through her bleached white eyebrows she had adopted the look of an all but marginal figure anonymous by looks alone she was a kind of lostlooking older and pathetic waif a sparechange artist from whom people would naturally tend to avert their eyes but she never took her eyes from him hold your left arm straight out like im doing okay now with your right thumb and first finger only lift the gun out of the holster and put it on the floor stand she raised her own gun to his chest and glitsky thought she was going to execute him but she extended her arm instead and said back up more the backs of glitskys knees hit the couch and he heavily awkwardly went down to a sit on the piece of furniture she got to his gun picked it up put it into the pocket of her overalls pull both of your pant legs up to your knees all right you can let them back down now hands back on your head link them neither eyes nor gun ever leaving him she went to the open kitchen area six feet away and pulled a metal chair over onto the rug in the center of the room she sat on it facing him whats your name abe glitsky youre with the san francisco police yes i am you need training in how to follow people youre no good at it ill keep it in mind next time he said but she didnt follow up on that a conversation line that he thought might humanize him which in turn could perhaps give her pause as she was deciding whether or not to kill him although to protect her identity and her family he knew that she would have to but she simply said its about paul then and dorris glitsky would keep her talking if he could even if he had to bait her you remember dorris she moved her shoulders in a kind of shrug dorris had to be in the world there are millions of dorrises who have uses and then become expendable i wish it hadnt been necessary almost as an afterthought she added i thought i was done with killing but no one will ever miss her she didnt matter and what about paul we wont talk about paul in fact there is nothing more to say her eyes went to the gun in her hand but there is he was staring at the guns barrel if it moved he would try to jump her and probably die trying but maybe they werent quite to that point yet i dont understand what happened he said you had a life together you were going to get married shaking her head as though to ward off the thought she snapped out the words i loved him then matteroffact i loved him but you killed him i killed him thats what i do i betray people and then kill them or someone else does glitsky risked unlinking his hands lowering them slowly onto his lap why because i have no choice he gave me no choice i begged him please please what please not to let them how do you say its not exactly the right word investigate him for what for the nomination glitskys every nerve pulsed with urgency he knew that if he was to have a chance at life he would have a split second to recognize his moment and seize it but part of him settled to a stillness with this information you mean the cabinet post with the government yes and they needed a background check the fbi yes but dont you see he didnt need it the post he had position and power and money and love he didnt need it i begged him not to let them even start because once they started on him theyd get to you she nodded they would have to i was his fiancee soon his wife they would have to background me too you could have left him wouldnt that have been better of course if it would have been possible you think i would not have done that but it wouldnt have done any good i was too close to paul they would still have needed to check me but the fbi already knew about you you were in witness protection yes so the people checking me and paul were a different department she hacked in disgust they could do nothing i asked them they would not they said they could contain it did you try to tell them it was life and death ha of course the cia in algeria knew that but the fbi didnt believe it or didnt care i didnt matter its government dont you understand wherehow do you saythe left doesnt know what the right hand is doing and doesnt wash the other even if they could and the fbi doesnt answer to the cia so they would have found out who you were and gone public with it thats what they do not on purpose certainly very discreetly of course need to know high security like every junior congressman and tabloid journalist in washington and their wives and their whores and anyone who would trade the information for something they wanted and you believe that word would have gotten back to algeria that you were still alive dont you understand there is no way that it wouldnt have it was too valuable a secret to keep who could have a million dollars and not spend any of it suddenly her expression changed glitsky tensed on the couch focused on the gun ready to spring but she didnt move the gun canting her head to one side she went still eyed him inquisitively how do you know about that because i know who you are missy or monique she stared at him hung her head for a heartbeat but not long enough to give him an opening when she looked back up her face had set into a mask of conviction then that is your death warrant she said and started to move the gun glitsky put his hands up in front of his face but didnt make another move its too late he said ive told the police here its already public youre lying if you worked with the police here theyd be with you now call your bank then ask them if i was there this morning with your police chief she rested the gun on her knee youve been to the bank to your box missy three hundred thousand dollars and pauls ring i told your story to the district attorney in san francisco and got a warrant the affidavits under seal but its only a matter of time everyone will know it by tomorrow if you kill me they may know it by tonight outside they heard the rain suddenly falling with a vengeance monique michelle monica missy put a hand up to her forehead and pulled nervously at the stud over her left eye they will murder my family dont you understand that im sorry he said and he meant it but it cant be undone the two of them sat about eight feet apart the one light by the front window flickered with the freshening wind the power of the deluge the gun was on her leg but she was no longer pointing it at him what is your name again she asked abraham my parents i cannot let she choked on the rest maybe we can contact the cia and what what do they do in algeria ask their muslim brothers for mercy for someone who betrayed them dont you see there is no mercy so long as i am alive glitsky had come to the front of the couch and was now sitting slightly forward in a relaxed posture with his elbows on his knees and his hands clasped in front of him missy he said im going to stand up now she immediately gripped the gun in both of her hands and pointed it at the center of his chest his eyes locked on hers youve had enough of killing to protect your secret thats over now the secret is out it isnt youre lying his voice was calm and reasonable im not lying you know that a long pause then a longer pause you said you were tired of killing but that you had to do it but killing me now will accomplish nothing so im giving you another minute to think it over then im leaving shoot me or not run or stay its over you know that he gave her the promised moment to think then he stood dont come any closer now im going to walk around you no dont you move ill kill you i swear to god i will i dont think you will he said it wouldnt accomplish anything he was moving up to where she sat giving her a wide berth she stood up too and took a step back going slowly and smoothly never stopping he leaned over to pick up his jacket then putting it on he continued past her feeling the gun trained on him at every step until his back was to her now and there was nothing to do but reach for the doorknob and pray that he was right never looking over his shoulder he closed his hand around the metallic orb and gave a yank then stepped out into the downpour and pulled the door closed behind him half an hour later eight davis city police cars were parked in the streets surrounding and in the parking lot in front of the apartment building the rain had resumed its regular steady drifting the police switchboard had received three calls from the immediate neighborhood in the past twenty minutes reporting what sounded like a gunshot but no one was disposed to take unnecessary chances the policemen had gone doortodoor in the apartment building rousting the six students who lived there getting them out of harms way matt wessin used the bullhorn and informed missy that she was surrounded by police and had sixty seconds to throw out her weapons and give herself up when the minute was up and there had been no response abe glitsky held up a hand to wessin and his men and all alone walked across the few open feet of parking lot to the front door he stopped for an instant drew a breath and gathered himself before he pushed slumped over to her right the terrorist the killer the lover the martyr was on the couch where hed been sitting not so long before glitsky took a step into the room his chin fell down over his chest always professional still and always an exception to the rule missy damiens had shot herself in the head in a moment glitsky would turn and nod to wessin and the routines would begin he tried to imagine some other way it could have gone something he might have done differently but it had all been ordained and set in motion long before hed been involved he was lucky to have escaped with his life when so many others had not that was going to have to be enough on a sunny saturday evening a couple of weeks into april hardy was driving with his wife top down on the convertible on the way to glitskys a week before hed come across a cd of perry comos greatest hits and since then had been alienating everyone close to him especially his childrenwith his spontaneous outbursts into renditions of papa loves mambo and round and round and others that were to him classics from his earliest youth when his parents used to watch the crooners show every sunday night now as his last notes from hot diggity dog ziggity boom faded to silence along with the cd track frannie reached over and ejected the disc you really like that guy dont you whats not to like i know theres something but i cant quite put my finger on it maybe its just that hes before my time perry hes eternal besides you dont hear polkas often enough nowadays if you did the world would be a happier place im thinking of trying to find an oktoberfest record so we can have more of them on hand at the house the kids might kill you on second thought i might kill you no youd all get used to it pretty soon all their friends are coming over for polka parties youre the hostess wearing one of those cute frau outfits i can see it as the next big new thing he broke into a snatch of the song again dismas he stopped after a moment driving along he turned to his wife okay if polka isnt going to be your thing do you want to hear an interesting fact i live for them okay how about this the zip in zip code it stands for zone improvement plan did you know that she cast him a sideways glance youve been reading that miscellany book again true actually my new life goal is to memorize it why so ill know more stuff you already know too much stuff impossible i mean the zip fact for example zone improvement plan he looked over for her response wow she said come on frannie did you know that dont you think thats neat to know no i do i said wow even didnt you hear me it sounded like a sarcastic wow never okay then they drove on in silence for a moment zone improvement plan frannie suddenly said after half a block imagine that hardy looked over at her a tolerant smile in place okay well drop it but only because theres yet another unusual and interesting fact you may not know and probably want to more than i want to know about what zip stands for i cant believe that this dinner tonight at abes he asked me what kind of champagne to buy abes drinking champagne i got the impression he intended to wow not sarcastic she added whens the last time you saw him drink anything with alcohol in it somewhere far back in the mists of time certainly not in the past few years so whats the occasion i dont know but its got to be a good one hardy found a spot to park within a block of glitskys house and figuring hed won the lottery pulled his convertible to the curb setting the brake he brought the top back up turned off the engine and reached for the door handle frannie put a hand on his leg and said do you mind if we just sit here a minute he stopped and looked questioningly over at her whatever you want he took her hand is everything all right thats what i wanted to ask you if everything was all right with me yes you mean with us us you everything he stared for a moment out through the windshield he squeezed her hand turned toward her look at us right now look at where we are its a good place not if youre unhappy in it im not unhappy i wouldnt trade this what ive got with you for anything whats got you thinking this it just seems youve been distant especially since the trial now that youve stopped seeing her every day he said nothing it makes me wonder if what we have isnt enough for you enough what enough anything excitement maybe fun its all kid stuff and routines and bickering sometimes and you think catherine was more fun that it was fun at all you want me to be honest i think you loved every minute you spent with her this was close to the bone hardy chose his words with some care thats not the same as wanting to be with her now it seems to me that the way this marriage thing works is you keep making a choice to be in it every day even if it makes you unhappy but it doesnt make me unhappy not at all to the contrary in fact and heres an unfashionable thought unhappiness is a choice and its one i dont choose to make he raised her hand to his lips and kissed it what i want is what weve already got but i guess im not communicating that too well am i for which i apologize really maybe you ought to leave me for making you worry i would never leave you i dont even think about it well you know i never think about leaving you ever were together period the topics not open for discussion weve got our family and our life together and nobody has as much fun together as we do ninetynine percent of the time i wouldnt trade it for anything a silence gathered in the closedin space and finally frannie sighed im sorry i need reassurance once in a while thats acceptable im sorry if ive been distant im sorry youre sorry she squeezed his hand between us we are two sorry campers arent we apparently he caught her eye broke a trace of a grin two sorry campers on their way to break bread with people not laughing sounds like a good time should we go on up as one they opened the doors of the car and stepped out into the warm evening the neighborhood in early dusk smelled of orange blossoms coffee and the ocean people not laughing was in his kitchen with a cold bottle of dom perignon held awkwardly in his hands hed already struggled first with the foil wrapper then with the wire and now he was looking at the cork as though it was one of lifes profound mysteries dont point it at your face hardy said theyve been known to just blow off and take out the random eyeball hes not used to this treya said somewhat unnecessarily so how do you get it off glitsky asked hardy reached for the bottle why dont you just let a professional handle it my partner will attend the window the window frannie bowed graciously crossed to the window over the sink and threw it open hardy turned to face the opening now one carefully turns the bottle not the cork and with a satisfying pop the cork flew out the window into the warm evening voila and then the glasses were poured and the four adults stood together in the tiny kitchen if i might ask hardy said whats the occasion frannies guess is youre pregnant again glitsky let out a mock scream read that as a no treya said simply but ill propose the toast okay heres to former homicide inspector dan cuneo may his new position bring him happiness and success hardy looked at glitsky what new position he just got named head ofsecurity for bayshore autotow marcel called me this morning and thought id want to know cuneos out of the department with a big raise and great benefits how did that happen hardy asked well you might not be surprised to hear that his stock in homicide fell a bit after hanover diz he felt that people were starting to look over his shoulder when he picked up new cases they even made him take a new partner whose main job seemed to be to keep him in line i guess he saw the writing on the wall yeah but id heard he was up for the towhold gig way back when not bayshore right but its the same job if hes qualified for one he can do it for anybody its the qualified thing im thinking about if he was known to be in such low standing in homicide glitskys face was a mask i heard harlan fisk might have put in a good word to bayshore on his behalf but harlan kathy wests nephew harlan remember okay but why would he hardy asked treya jumped in you cant blame cuneo for wanting out of homicide they obviously didnt want him anymore now this new job gets him off the force and everybodys happy so its over hardy said glitsky nodded he was essentially through when you finished with him in court diz but now hes not just through hes really truly gone that really does call for a toast frannie said but hardy had a last question im just wondering how it happened i can see kathy passing the information along to harlan but how would she have heard about an opening like that a glint showed in glitskys eyes he shrugged with an exaggerated nonchalance somebody must have told her he said without further ado he raised his glass well dear and true friends heres to life lchaim acknowledgments this book was born in fire i knew it would begin with a blaze in a san francisco residence i also knew next to nothing about the workings of fire departments or
