harry turtledove the center cannot hold i l ieutenant colonel abner dowling strode into the offices of the us army general staff in philadelphia escaping the january snow outside he was a big beefy manunkind people of whom hed met altogether too many would have called him fatand walked with a determination that made other younger officers get out of his way even though his greengray uniform bore not a trace of the goldandblack ribbon that marked a general staff man he looked around with more than a little curiosity he hadnt been in general staff headquarters for many yearsnot since before the great war in fact hed spent the past ten years as adjutant to general george armstrong custer and custers relationship with the general staff had always been combustible was the first word that came to mind the first printable word anyhow but custer was retired nowretired at last after more than sixty years of service in the armyand dowling needed a new assignment i wonder what theyll give me what ever it is its bound to be a walk in the park after what ive gone through with custer anything this side of standing sentry on the battlements of hell would have seemed a walk in the park after ten years with custer the man was unquestionably a hero dowling would have been the first to admit it nevertheless he tried not to think of custer which was like trying not to think of a red fish then he got lostgeneral staff headquarters had expanded a great deal since his last visit having to ask his way did take his mind off his former superior at last by turning left down a corridor where he had turned right he made his way to the office of general hunter liggett chief of the general staff liggetts adjutant was a sharplooking lieutenant colonel named john abell when dowling walked into the office the fellow was talking on the telephone the best we can with the budget the socialists are willing to let us have he looked up and put his hand over the mouthpiece yes lieutenant colonel may i help you im abner dowling i have a ten oclock appointment with general liggett by the clock on the wall it was still a couple of minutes before ten dowling had built in time for things to go wrong custer never did anything like that custer never figured anything would go wrong dowling shook his head dont think about custer lieutenant colonel abell nodded go right in hes expecting you he returned to his interrupted telephone conversation i know what we should be doing and i know what we are doing there will be trouble one day but theyre too sure of themselves to believe it however much dowling wanted to linger and eavesdrop he went on into general liggetts inner office and closed the door behind him saluting he said reporting as ordered sir hunter liggett returned the salute he was a jowly man in his midsixties with a penetrating stare and a white kaiser bill mustache waxed to pointed perfection at ease lieutenant colonel sit down make yourself comfortable thank you sir dowling eased his bulk down into a chair what are we going to do with you liggett said it had to be a rhetorical question the answer surely already lay there on his desk he went on youve seen a lot these past few years havent you by now i suspect you could handle just about anything couldnt you lieutenant colonel dowling didnt like the sound of that i hope so sir he answered cautiously maybe he wouldnt get a walk in the park after all ahh what have you got in mind everyone is very pleased with your performance in canada general liggett said the assistant secretary of war mr thomas spoke highly of you in his report to president sinclair he wrote that you did your best to make a difficult and unpleasant situation go more smoothly any time a soldier wins praise from the present administration he must have done very well indeed thank you sir dowling remembered that liggett had become chief of the general staff during the present socialist administration replacing general leonard wood that made him watch his tongue im glad mr thomas was pleased i didnt really do that much mostly i just sat there and kept my mouth shut n mattoon thomas had come up to winnipeg to force general custer into retirement custer hadnt wanted to go custer never wanted to do anything anyone told him to do and he thoroughly despised the socialists but theyd held the high cards and he hadnt well what ever you did say mr thomas liked it liggett said he wrote of your tact and your discretion and your good sensesaid if you were a diplomat instead of a soldier youd make a splendid ambassador liggett chuckled damn me to hell if youre not blushing im flattered sir dowling was also embarrassed like a lot of fat men he flushed easily and he knew it general liggett went on and it just so happens that we have a post where a man with such talents would be very useful very useful indeed does it do you dowling said and liggett gave him a genial nod dowling had a fair notion of where such a post might be hoping he was wrong he asked what have you got in mind sir sure enough liggett said ive had to relieve colonel sorenson as military governor of salt lake city hes an able officer sorenson is dont get me wrong but he turned out to be a little too unbending for the position by president sinclairs orders we are trying to bring utah back towards being a normal state in the union once more a tactful diplomatic officer running things in salt lake could do us a lot of good there i see dowling said slowly the only trouble is sir im not sure i think utah ought to be a normal state in the union once more the mormons in utah had caused trouble during the second mexican war back at the start of the sas a result of which the us army had landed on them with both feet then in perhaps aided and abetted by the confederates and the british from canada theyd risen in open rebellion the army had had to crush them one town at a time and had made a peace only in the tacitean sense of the word leaving desert behind it between you and me and the four walls of my office lieutenant colonel im not sure i think so either liggett answered but the army doesnt make policy thats the presidents job all we do is carry it out and so would you like to be the next military governor of salt lake city maybe i should have been a nasty son of a bitch when i was working for custer dowling thought but he said what he had to say yes sir after a moment he added if im being diplomatic yes liggett asked well sir wouldnt you say the good people of salt lake city might see it as an insult to them if a full colonel were replaced by a lieutenant colonel dowling said couldnt it lead them to believe the united states army finds them less important than it once did amusement glinted in liggetts eyes and how do you propose to make sure the good people of salt lake cityif there are anydont find themselves insulted i can think of a couple of ways sir dowling replied one would be to appoint somebody whos already a bird colonel as military governor there yes that stands to reason liggett agreed and the other he leaned back in his swivel chair which squeaked he seemed to be enjoying himself waiting to hear what dowling would say dowling had hoped the chief of the general staff would come out and say it for him when liggett didnt he had to speak for himself the other way sir would be to promote me to the appropriate rank and you think you deserve such a promotion eh liggett rumbled yes sir dowling said boldly after ten years with custer i deserve to be a major general by god and if he said no he knew hed never be promoted again general liggett shuffled through papers on his desk finding the one he wanted he shoved it face down across the polished expanse of mahogany to dowling this may be of some interest to you then thank you dowling said wondering if he ought to thank liggett he turned the paper over glanced at itand stared at his superior thank you very much sir he exclaimed youre welcome colonel dowling liggett replied congratulations thank you very much dowling repeated uh sir would you have given me this if i hadnt asked for it liggetts smile was as mysterious as the mona lisas though a good deal less benign youll never know will you his chuckle was not a pleasant sound he found another sheet of paper and passed it to dowling too here are your orders colonel your train goes out of broad street station tomorrow morning im sure youll do a fine job and i know for a fact that general pershing is looking forward to having you under his command do you all of a sudden dowlings world seemed less rosy during the war pershings second army had fought side by side with custers first in kentucky and tennessee the two armies had been rivals as neighbors often are and their two commanders had been rivals too custer was suspicious of his younger colleague as he was suspicious of any other officer who might steal his glory dowling had forgotten pershing was military governor of utah these days i think i know whats bothering you colonel liggett said if anyone knew about rivalries the chief of the general staff would be the man he went on you dont have to worry not on that score i meant what i said general pershing is eager to have you but what will he do with meto meonce hes got me dowling wondered he couldnt say that all he could say was thats good to hear sir which means you dont believe me liggett said well thats your privilege you may even be right i dont think you are but you may be dowling was by nature a pessimist if he hadnt been before ten years under general custer would have made him one ill do the best i can sir thats all he said and what ever pershing does to me by god ill have eagles on my shoulder straps that makes up for a lot general liggett nodded as long as you do that no one can ask any more of you all right sir dowling started to rise then checked himself may i ask you one more thing sir its got nothing to do with mormons go ahead and ask liggett told him i dont promise to answer not till ive heard the question i understand what i want to know is are we really cutting back on building new and better barrels ive heard that but it strikes me as foolish like most professional soldiers dowling had no use for the socialist party there as in few other places he agreed with the man under whom hed served for so long he would have expressed himself a lot more strongly had he been talking with general leonard wood a lifelong democrat and a friend of expresident theodore roosevelt but liggett nodded again and didnt sound happy as he answered we arent just cutting back as a matter of fact were gutting the program no money in the budget any more that outfit at fort leavenworth called the barrel works he slashed a thumb across his throat as our german friends would say kaputt thatsunfortunate sir dowling used the politest word he could barrels won us the last war they wont count less in the next one dont be silly colonel therell never ever be another war just ask president sinclair hes still a soldier first then dowling thought good both men laughed but for the bitter undertone in each ones voice the joke might have been funny a nne colleton was studying the wall street journal when the telephone rang she muttered something under her breath put down the fivedayold newspaper and went to answer the phone back in the days when shed lived on the marshlands plantation her butler scipio or one of the other negro servants would have done that for her and spared her the interruption these days though the marshlands mansion was a burntout ruin the cotton fields around it going back to grass and bushes anne lived in town not that st matthews south carolina was much of a town this is anne colleton she said crisply she was in her midthirties with her sleek blond good looks she could have lied ten years off her age with no one the wisertill she spoke few people younger than shefew her own age for that matter but even fewer youngercould have so quickly made plain they put up with no nonsense at all and a good day to you miss colleton replied the man on the other end of the line by the hisses and pops accompanying his voice he was calling from some distance away he went on my name is edward cl wiggins maam and im in richmond long distance sure enough anne thoughthe sounded as if he were shouting down a rain barrel what is it mr wiggins she said i dont think weve met no maam i havent had the pleasure he agreed but the colleton name is famous all over the confederate states he doubtless meant that as pleasant flattery anne colleton had heard enough pleasant flattery to last the rest of her life by the time she was sixteenone consequence of her looks men seldom thought about you can come to the point mr wiggins she said pleasantly or ill hang up on you no matter where you are once upon a time president semmes sent me up to philadelphia to see if i could dicker a peace with the yankees but they wouldnt do it wiggins said that wasnt coming to the point or anne didnt think it was but it did get her attention this would have been fairly early on before we finally had to quit she asked thats right maam he said i heard rumors about that she said with all the money i gave the whigs in those days i would have thought i deserved to hear something more than rumors but evidently not so you were representing president semmes were you yes maam in an unofficial sort of way and whose representative are you now in an unofficial sort of way im sure youre somebodys edward cl wiggins chuckled i heard you were one clever lady i guess i heard right who told you so anne asked sharply well now i was just getting to that i anne did hang up then she wasted not a minute getting back to work with her finances in the state they were they needed all the time she could give them they needed more than that too they needed something close to a miracle she wasnt a pauper as so many prewar planters were these days but she wasnt rich enough not to have to worry either and she didnt know if she ever would be a few minutes later the phone rang again anne picked it up why mr wiggins what a pleasant surprise she said before whoever was on the other end of the line could speak if it wasnt wiggins she would have to apologize to someone but she thought the odds were good enough to take the chance and it was miss colleton if you would let me explain myself she cut him off though she didntquitehang up on him once more i gave you two chances to do that you didnt if you think im in the habit of wasting my time on strange men who call me out of the blue youre mistakenand whoever told you what you think you know about me hasnt got the faintest notion of what hes talking about oh i dont know wiggins voice was dry he told me you were sharp as a tack but a firstclass bitch and that doesnt seem so far out to me im sure he meant it as an insult but ill take it for a compliment anne said last chance mr wigginswho told you that jake featherston anne had expected almost any other name than that of the freedom party leader something she didnt want to call alarm shot through her she took jake featherston very seriously that didnt mean she wanted anything to do with him shed backed him for a while yes but she backed winners and he didnt look like one any more trying to gain time to recover her composure she asked if you used to work for the whigs why are you calling me for featherston now on account of what i saw when i went to philadelphia maam he replied the united states dont respect you when youre weak if youre down theyll kick you but if youre strong they have got to sit up and take notice thats a fact i agree with that i think everyone in the confederate states agrees with that anne said well there you are wiggins said cheerily if you agree with that the freedom party is really and truly the only place for you because nonsense anne didnt care about his reasons she had reasons of her own the freedom party has about as much chance of electing the next president as i do of getting elected myself i have no intention of giving jake featherston one more dime every since that madman of a grady calkins murdered president hampton itd take a special miracle for anyone from the freedom party to get himself elected dog catcher let alone anything more i dont spend my money where it does me no good i dont think the clouds are as black as you say maam wiggins replied yes we lost a couple of seats in the election last november but not as many as people said we would well be backyou wait and see if we arent folks dont have much in the way of memoryand besides maam were right if you cant win an election whether youre right or not doesnt matter anne pointed out we will wiggins sounded confident she got the idea he sounded confident all the time he went on i want to say a couple of other things and then im through first one is mr featherston he knows whos for him and he knows whos against him and he never ever forgets the one or the other he was without question right about that featherston was as relentless as a barrel smashing through one line of trenches after another anne didnt intimidate easily but jake featherston had done the job that just gave her more reason to harden her voice and say ill take my chances edward cl wiggins chuckled he told me you were near as stubborn as he is himself and i see hes right one more thing and then im through and i wont trouble you any more go ahead anne said make it short ive already wasted more than enough time on you yes maam heres what ive got to say theres only one party in the csa thats got any notion at all about what the devil to do about the nigger problem in this country and thats the freedom party and now im done goodbye he surprised her by hanging up slowly she put the mouthpiece back on its hook and set down the telephone she said a word she was unlikely to use in public one that would have made strong men gasp and women of delicate sensibilities blush and faint wiggins had known how to get through to her after all no one was likely to forget the red negro uprising that had tied the confederacy in knots late in and early in no one knew how much it had helped the usa win the war but it couldnt have hurt the freedom party stood foursquare for vengeance and so did anne colleton and why not she thought one brother dead my plantation wrecked me almost murdered oh yes i owe those black bastards just a little the whole country owes them just a little whether the whigs and the radical liberals want to admit it or not she repeated that word louder this time behind her her surviving brother burst out laughing she whirled around confound it tom she said angrily i didnt know you were there tom colleton laughed harder than ever ill bet you didnt he answered if you had you would have said something like confound it instead he was a couple of years younger than anne and a little darker with hair light brown rather than gold hed gone into the war an irresponsible boy and come out of it a lieutenantcolonel and a man something of which anne still had to remind herself now and again she shrugged now i probably would have but i meant what i did say who was on the telephone he asked a man named edward cl wiggins anne replied he wanted money from us for the freedom party tom frowned those people dont take no for an answer do they they never have anne said its their greatest strengthand their greatest weakness did you find out why he travels with a herd of initials her brother asked she shook her head tom went on what did you tell him no of course anne answered the way things are now id sooner cozy up to a cottonmouth than to jake featherston dont blame you a bit tom colleton said hes an impressive man in a lot of ways but he shook his head he puts me in mind of a time bomb wound up and waiting to go off and when he does i dont think itll be pretty there were times when i thought he had all the answers anne said and there were times when i thought he was a little bit crazy and there were times when i thought both those things at once those were the ones that scared me scared me too tom agreed and we dont scare easy no wed be dead by now if we did anne said and tom nodded she eyed him and speaking of looking pretty youre fancier than you need to be for staying around here is that a necktie she thought its gaudy stripes of crimson and gold excessive but declined to criticize her brother nodded again sure is bought it from whatshisname the jew tailor and im going to pay a call on bertha talmadge in a little while before the war anne would have discouraged such a callwith a bludgeon if necessary the muncies berthas parents were grocers and their daughter no fit match for a planters son these days well grocers never starved and bertha talmadge though a widow whose husband like so many others had died in the trenches was reasonably young reasonably pretty reasonably bright anne nodded approval have a nice time you should find yourself a wife settle down have yourself some children he didnt get angry at her as he would have before the war in fact he nodded again himself youre right i should and as a matter of fact so should you thats different anne said quickly how because he was her brother she told him because my husband would want to try to run everything because thats what men do and odds are he wouldnt be as good at it as i am thats why and even if he was you wouldnt admit it tom said that was also true anne colleton however had not the slightest intention of admitting it giving her brother her most enigmatic smile she went back to the wall street journal m ary mcgregor was only thirteen years old but her course in life was already set so she told herself anyhow and also told her mother and her older sister as they sat down to supper on their farm outside rosenfeld manitoba the yankees killed my brother they killed my father too but im going to get evenyou see if i dont fright showed on her mothers careworn face maude mcgregor touched the sleeve of her woolen blouse to show mary she still wore mourning black you be careful she said if anything happened to you after alexander and arthur i dont think i could bear it she didnt tell mary not to pursue vengeance against the americans occupying canada plainly she knew better that would have been telling the sun not to rise the snow not to fall ever since the americans arrested her older brother during the war on a charge of sabotage lined him up against a wall and shot him shed hated them with an altogether unchildlike ferocity of course ill be careful she said now as if she were the adult and her mother the worried fussy child pa was careful he just wasnt lucky at the end he should have got that blamed general custer however much she hated americans she wasnt allowed to curse at the supper table her older sister nodded who would have thought custer would be waiting for father to throw that bomb and ready to throw it back julia said that was bad luck nothing else but she sighed she hadnt only lost her father arthur mcgregors failure had also cost her an engagement the culligans had decided it just wasnt safe to join their son ted to a bombers family part of it was their mother said mary would you please pass the butter mayhem and manners lived together under the mcgregors roof here you are ma mary said and her mother buttered her mashed potatoes mary went on what do you mean part of it was bad luck it all was her mother shook her head no only part the americans suspected your father they came sniffing around here all the time remember if they hadnt suspected custer wouldnt have been ready to to do what he did what hed done by throwing the bomb back had blown arthur mcgregor to red rags the family could have buried him in a jam tin no one still alive wanted to think about that ill be careful mary said again she brushed a wisp of auburn hair back from her face in a gesture her mother might have made maude mcgregor had reddish hair too julia was darker as her father had been maude mcgregor said i just thank god youre only thirteen and not likely to get into too much mischief for a while you know the yankees will keep an eye on us forever on account of what the menfolks in our family did alexander never did anything mary said hotly they thought he did and that was all that mattered to them her mother answered your father never would have done any of the things he did if that hadnt happenedand wed all be here together she stared down at the heavy white earthenware plate in front of her im sorry mother seeing her mother unhappy could still tear mary to pieces inside but she wasted little time amending that im sorry i made you unhappy she wasnt sorry she wanted revenge on the americans nothing could make her sorry about that weve been through too much i dont want us to have to go through any more her mother said maude mcgregor quickly brought her napkin up to her face pretending to wipe her mouth she dabbed at her eyes instead she tried not to let her children catch her crying sometimes try as she would she failed mary said canadas been through too much there isnt even a canada any more thats what the americans say anyhow if they say it loud enough and often enough lots of people will start believing it but i wont i wont either julia said i quit the schools when they started teaching american lies but youre rightplenty of people are still going and plenty of them will believe what ever they hear what can we do about it weve got to do something mary exclaimed though she didnt know what her mother got up from the table what ever we do we wont do it now what we will do now is wash the dishes and get ready for bed well have a lot of work tomorrow and its not any easier because she shook her head its not any easier thats all its not any easier because we havent got any menfolk left alive to help us that was what shed started to say that or something like it and things would only get harder when winter of turned to spring and they would have to try to put a crop in the ground by themselves like any farm daughter mary had worked since she could stand on her own two feet the idea didnt worry her having to do mens work as well as womens how could the three of them manage without wearing down to nubs she didnt know that either she only knew they had to try my father kept trying and he made the yankees pay i will too somehow julia washed dishes and silverware and scrubbed pots till her hands turned red mary dried things and put them away yesterday theyd done it the other way round tomorrow they would again after the last plate went where it belonged mary took a candle upstairs she used it to light the kerosene lamp in her room the americans had started talking about bringing electricity out from the towns to the countryside but all theyd done so far was talk more lies she thought she changed out of her shirtwaist and sweater and skirt into a long wool flannel nightgown with thick wool blankets and a down comforter on the bed she didnt fear even a manitoba winterand if that wasnt courage what was before she lay down she knelt beside the bed and prayed and keep mother safe and healthy and keep julia safe and healthy and help me pay the americans back she whispered as she did every night please god i know you can do it if you try god could do anything she believed that with all her heart getting him to do itthat was a different and harder business when marys head did hit the pillow she fell asleep as if clubbed she woke the next morning in exactly the same position as when shed gone to sleep maybe shed shifted back into it during the night maybe she hadnt had the energy to roll over once she crawled out of bed the aromas of tea and frying eggs and potatoes floating up to the bedroom from the kitchen helped get her moving she put on the same skirt and sweater with a different shirtwaist and hurried downstairs good her mother said when she made her appearance another five minutes and idve sent julia after you here you are she used a spatula to lift a couple of eggs from the skillet and set them on marys plate potatoes fried in lard went alongside them thanks ma mary put salt on the eggs and potatoes and pepper on the eggs she ate like a wolf her mother gave her a thick china mug full of tea mary poured in milk from a pitcher and added a couple of spoonsful of sugar she drank the tea as hot as she could bear it julia was already on her second cup how do the americans stand drinking coffee all the time she wondered aloud its so nasty its disgusting mary said she honestly believed she would have thought that even if the yankees hadnt done what theyd done shed tried coffee a couple of times and found it astonishingly bitter to her surprise her mother said coffees not so bad oh i like tea better but coffees not so bad itll pry your eyes open even better than tea will and thats nice of a morning hearing maude mcgregor defending something mary thought of as american and therefore automatically corrupt rocked her she didnt quarrel though she had no time to quarrel as soon as she finished breakfast she put on rubbers and an overcoat that had belonged to alexander it was much too big for her even though shed nearly matched her mothers height but that didnt matter along with earmuffs and mittens it would keep her warm while she did the chores im going out to the barn she said her older sister shut the door behind her instead of heading straight to the barn mary paused at the outhouse first it didnt stink the way it did in warmer weather but she would almost rather have sat down on a pincushion than on those cold planks she got out of there as fast as she could several motorcars were coming up the road from the us border toward rosenfeld the snow that scrunched under marys rubbers sprayed up from their tires they were all painted greengray which marked them as us army machines i hope something horrible happens to you mary thought but the motorcars cared nothing for her curses they just kept rolling north the railroad line ran to the west of the farm coal smoke spewing from the stack a train rumbled past the shriek of the whistle far off in the distance seemed the loneliest sound in the world the train was probably full of yankees too more and more these days the yankees were tying the canadian railroads to their own damn them mary mouthed and went into the barn it was warmer there the body heat of the horse and the cow and the sheep and the pigs and she supposed even the chickens helped keep it that way and the work she had to do certainly kept her warm she gathered eggs and fed the animals and shoveled manure that would go on the fields and the vegetable plots when warmer weather came again as she worked she looked around somewhere in here her father had made the bombs that did the americans so much harm before one of them killed him us soldiers had torn the farmhouse and the barn to pieces looking for his tools and fuses and explosives they hadnt found them of course they didnt find them mary thought my father was cleverer than a hundred yankees put together he just wasnt lucky with general custer thats all she picked up the basket of eggs which shed set on an old broken wagon wheel that had been sitting in the barn as long as she could rememberand probably a lot longer than that she sighed she didnt want to go back out into the cold even to take the eggs back to the farmhouse idly she wondered why her father had never repaired and used the wheeleither that or got a few cents for the iron on the tire and the hub he hadnt been a man to waste much if i had the tools if i knew how would i make bombs and keep fighting the americans mary nodded without a moments hesitation despite the thought that followed hard on the heels of the other if they caught you theyd shoot you more than most children her age she knew and understood how very permanent death was losing alexander and her father had agonizingly driven home that lesson i dont care she said as if someone had said she did it would be worth it we have to hit back we have to one of these days ill learn how it wont take so long either i promise it wont father she picked up the basket of eggs from the old wagon wheel and however little she wanted to went back out into winter f lags flying horns blaring rails decked in bunting of red white and blue the uss obrien came into cork harbor the irish had laid on a spectacular welcome for the destroyer with the fortunately hibernian name with fireboats shooting streams of water high into the air on the shore a brass band in fancy green uniforms blared away schoolchildren had the day off some of them waved american flags others the orange white and green banner of the republic of irelandwhich with us help had finally gained control over the whole island from his station at the forward fourinch gun ensign sam carsten grinned at the celebration hed seen the like before in dublin he was a tall muscular very blond man who burned whenever the sun came out no matter how feebly a cloudy day in irish late winter suited him down to the ground he didnt have to worry about smearing zincoxide ointment and other things that didnt work onto his poor abused hide not for a while he didnt he turned to the petty officer who was his number two at the gun they wouldnt have been so friendly if wed come in while the limeys were still running this place eh hirskowitz youre right about that sir nathan hirskowitz was a dour jew from new york city as dark as carsten was fair he had swarthy skin brown eyes and a blueblack stubble he had to shave twice a day getting called sir still bemused carsten he was a mustang up through the ranks hed spent going on twenty years working his way up from ordinary seaman if the officer in charge of the gun hed served on an aeroplane carrier hadnt encouraged him he didnt think he would ever have had the nerve to take the qualifying examination he wished he were still aboard the remembrance naval aviation fascinated him even if he was a gunnery man first but the carrier hadnt had any slots for a newminted ensign and so matter of fact theydve tried to blow our heads off sam said hirskowitz nodded carsten scanned the harbor lots of fishing boats some merchant steamers a couple of old us destroyers now flying the irish flag and he stiffened then pointed weve got company nobody told me we were going to have company hirskowitz let out a disdainful sniff you think theyre going to tell you things you need to know just because you need to know them the s was a german destroyer a little smaller than the obrien mounting three guns rather than four the german naval ensign fluttered from her stern a busy banner with the black hohenzollern eagle in a white circle at the center of a black cross on a white field in the canton where the stars went on an american flag was a small version of the german national banner a black maltese cross on horizontal stripes of black white and red as the obrien edged toward a quay the s dipped her flag in salute a moment later the american ship returned the compliment you see theyre allies nathan hirskowitz said in a different tone of voice that would have sounded light cheery optimisticall words noticeably not suited to the petty officers temper as things were hirskowitz packed a world of doubt and menace into four words yeah carsten did his best to match him in one without a doubt the united states and the german empire were the two strongest nations in the world these days what was in doubt was which of them was stronger officially everything remained as it had been when they joined together to put britain and france and the csa in the shade unofficially if our boys go drinking and their boys go drinking theres liable to be trouble carsten said probably hirskowitz sounded as if he looked forward to it after making a fist and looking at it in surprisewhat was such a thing doing on the end of his armhe went on if there is trouble theyll be sorry for it yeah sam carsten said again for one thing the obrien had a bigger crew than the german destroyer for another winning the great war had made him certain the usa could win any fight he shook his head in bemusement that was certainly a new attitude for an american to take after losing the war of secession and getting humiliated in the second mexican war americans had come to have a lot of selfdoubt in their character amazing what victory can do he thought he peered toward the s by the polished way the sailors over there went about their business theyd never heard of selfdoubt and why should they have under bismarck and under kaiser bill germany had gone from triumph to triumph victories over denmark and austria and france let her unite as a single kingdom and victory in the great war left her a colossus bestriding europe in almost the same way the usa bestrode north america sailors aboard the obrien threw lines to waiting longshoremen who made the destroyer fast to the quay welcome one of the longshoremen called in a musical brogue ill be glad to buy some of you boys a pint of guinness that i will whats guinness hirskowitz asked carsten its what they make in ireland instead of beer sam said helpfully its black as fuel oil and almost as thick tastes kind of burnt till you get used to it after that its not so bad oh hirskowitz weighed that well ill see they make real beer too some and whiskey got some good whiskey the last couple of times i was here when was that sir once during the war carsten answered we were running guns to the micks to help em give the limeys hell they paid us back in booze he smacked his lips at the memory and then again in remembrance afterwards when we were helping the republic put down the limeys and their pals up in the north the captain of the obrien an improbably young lieutenant commander named marsden assembled the crew on the foredeck and said im pleased to grant you men libertythis is a friendly port and everybody has gone out of his way to make sure were welcome i know youll want to drink a little and have a good time sailors nudged one another and grinned somebody behind sam said skippers all right aint he carsten frowned he knew boys would be boys too but that didnt mean an officer was supposed to encourage them he wouldnt have done that as a petty officer and he wouldnt do it now but then marsden stiffened and seemed to grow taller his voice went hard as armor plate as he continued having a good time doesnt mean brawling it especially doesnt mean brawling with the kaisers sailors were on the same side us and the germans anybody whos stupid enough to quarrel with them will have the book thrown at him and thats a promise everybody understand yes sir the sailors chorused what do you say then aye aye sir good lieutenant commander marsdens smile showed sharp teeth because youd better dismissed sam carsten didnt get to go into cork for a couple of days he was less than impressed when he did it wasnt a very big city and it was grimy with coal smoke and he almost got killed the first two or three times he tried to cross the street like their former english overlords the irish drove on the wrong side of the road looking right didnt help if a wagon was bearing down on you from the left before long carsten discovered hed given nathan hirskowitz at least half a bum steer along with the swarms of guinness is good for you signs pubs hereabouts also extolled the virtues of a local stout called murphys sam strolled into one and in the spirit of experiment ordered a pint of the local stuff hed changed a little money but the tapman shoved his sixpence back across the bar at him youre one o them yanks he said your moneys no good here thanks very much carsten said my pleasure sir that it is the fellow left a little more than an inch of creamy head on the pint and drew a shamrock in the thick froth with the drippings from the tap catching sams eye on him he smiled sheepishly just showing off a bit sam smiled back hed seen the same stunt and heard the same line in dublin every tapman in the country probably used it on strangers this one slid sam the glass enjoy it now i bet i will carsten took a sip the tapman waited expectantly sam smiled and said thats mighty good but in truth he couldnt have told murphys from guinness to save his life a couple of american sailors came in not long after he did he nodded to them they sat down well away from himhe was an officer after all even if he sometimes had trouble remembering itand ordered drinks of their own then a couple of more sailors came in an irishman stuck his nose in the door saw all the blue uniforms and decided to do his drinking somewhere else carsten raised his finger to order another murphys the tapman was pouring it for him when half a dozen more sailors walked into the pub they too wore navy blue uniforms but theirs were of a different cut and their hats struck sams eye as odd they were off the s not the obrien they eyed the americans already there with the same wariness those americans were showing them sam didnt know german rank markings any too well but one grizzled german sure had the look of a senior petty officer the man spoke english of a sort friends ja yes friends carsten said before any of the obrien s men could say anything like no not friends gut gut the german said england frankreich he shook his head no france he made it sound more like a mans namefranzthan a countrys but carsten nodded to show he got it england franceso the squarehead made a thumbsdown gesture that might have come from a roman amphitheater all the americans got that yeah one of the sailors said to hell with england and france and the horse they rode in on the german plainly didnt know about the horse they rode in on but the smiles from the americans encouraged his pals and him to come in and order beers for themselves sam noticed the tapman took their money where he hadnt for any of the americans if the germans noticed that too it might cause trouble picking up his pint of murphys he went over and sat down by the german who knew a little english hello he said good day sir the veteran said he didnt come to ramrod attention the way he would have for one of his own officersthe germans were devils for discipline even by the tough standards of the us navybut he wasnt far from it one of his own officers probably wouldnt have deigned to talk with him at all we should stay friends your country and mine eh sam said jawohl mein herr the petty officer said he translated that for his pals they all nodded sam got out a pack of cigarettes he offered them to the germans the tobacco was as good as prewar imported from the csa all the germans took a cigarette or two except one man who apologetically showed him a clay pipe to explain why he didnt danke the petty officer said thank you youre welcome carsten raised his mug lets stay friends again the petty officer translated again his men solemnly nodded they all drank with sam a couple of the americans came over one spoke a little german about as much as the petty officer spoke english a couple of hours passed in a friendly enough wayespecially since the tapman had the sense to stop charging the germans but sam knew he would have to draft a report when he got back to the obrien he suspected the german petty officer would be doing the same thing on the s friends he thought well maybe he eyed the capablelooking german sailors the fellow with the clay pipe sent up a cloud of smoke maybe friends yeah but rivals oh you bet rivals for sure w inter spring summer fallthey didnt matter much in the sloss works it could be snowing outsidenot that it snowed very often in birmingham alabamabut it would still be hell on earth on the pouring floor in the steel mill jefferson pinkard shook his head sweat ran down his face it was hot as hell in here no doubt about that but hed seen hell on earth fighting the red negro rebels in georgia and again worse fighting the damnyankees in the trenches in west texas you could hurt yourselfyou could kill yourselfright here but nobody was trying to do it for you when the shiftchange whistle screameda sound that pierced the din of the mill like an armortipped shell plowing through shoddy concretehe nodded to his partner and to the men whod come to take his crews place night fred night calvin night luke see yall tomorrow he clocked out by himself once upon a time hed worked side by side with his best friend and nextdoor neighbor bedford cunningham but bedford had got conscripted before he did and had come back to birmingham without most of his right arm pinkard had stayed at the sloss works a while longer working side by side with black men till he got conscripted too but after hed put on butternut after hed put on butternut emily had got lonely shed been used to getting it regular from him and she wanted to keep getting it regular regardless of whether he was there or not hed come home on leave one night to find her on her knees in front of bedford cunningham neither of them wearing any more than theyd been born with pinkard growled deep in his throat stinking tramp he muttered it was the war it was the goddamn war nothin else but even after hed come back when the fighting stopped their marriage hadnt survived now he lived in the yellowpainted cottagecompany housingall by himself it was none too clean these daysnothing like the way it had looked when emily took care of thingsbut he didnt care he had only himself to please and he wasnt what anybody would call a tough audience he headed back toward the cottage part of the stream of big weary men in overalls and dungarees heading home he walked by himself as he always did these days another similar stream was coming in the swing shift it had a few more blacks mixed in than the outgoing day shift but only a few blacks had taken a lot of better jobs during the war now whites had almost all of them back hey jeff one of the whites waved to him freedom freedom pinkard echoed when you gonna get your ass to another party meeting travis i be go to hell if i know the other steel worker answered when they take me off swing i reckon but god only knows when that is remember me to the boys tonight will you sure will pinkard said thats a promise he walked on when he got to the cottage he lit a kerosene lamp there was talk about putting electricity into the company housing but so far it was nothing but talk got a fire going in the coalburning stove and took a ham out of the icebox he cut off a big slice and fried it in lard then did up some potatoes in the same iron frying pan the beer in the icebox was homebrewalabama had been formally dry since before the warbut it washed down supper as well as anything storebought could have he put the plate and the frying pan in the sink atop a teetering mountain of dirty dishes one day soon hed have to wash them because he was running out of clean ones not tonight josephine he muttered hed started talking to himself now that he was the only one in the house i got important things to do tonight by god he scraped stubble from his chin with a straight razor splashed on water and then shed his overalls and work shirt for a clean white shirt and a pair of butternut wool trousers he wished he had time to shine his shoes but a glance at the windup alarm clock ticking on his nightstand told him he didnt not if he wanted to get to the meeting on time and there was nothing in the world he wanted more the trolley stopped at the edge of the company housing looking back over his shoulder jeff saw the mills throwing sparks into the night sky almost as if it were the fourth of july a couple of other men came up to wait for the trolley they too wore white shirts and khaki trousers freedom jefferson pinkard said freedom they echoed jeff sighed back in the days before grady calkins had shot down president hampton when he came to birmingham a lot more men would have come to party meetings the freedom party had looked like the wave of the future then now only the dedicated the men who really saw something wrong with the csa and saw that jake featherston knew how to fix it went to freedom party meetings these days and even now wheres virgil jeff asked both other men shrugged dont rightly know one of them said he was at the foundry so i dont reckon hes feelin poorly bell clanging the trolley came up jeff was glad to climb aboard and drop five cents in the fare box so he wouldnt have to think about what virgils absence might mean he was also glad to pay a fare measured in cents and not in thousands or millions of dollars after the war inflation had ripped the guts out of the confederate states its easing had hurt the freedom party too but that was one bargain pinkard was willing to make several more men in white shirts and butternut trousers got on the trolley at its next few stops jeff liked the uniform look they had it reminded him of the days when he and a lot of others who were now freedom party members had worn confederate butternut together theyd been fighting for something important then just as they were now theyd lost then this time by jesus we wont the freedom party men all got out at the same stop not far away stood the old livery stable where the party met in birmingham as a livery stable the place was a failure with motorcars and trucks driving more horses off the road every year as a meeting hall it was tolerable jeff thought but he was smiling as he went inside this was where he belonged emily was gone she was gone at least in part because the freedom party had come to mean so much to him whatever the reason though she was gone the party remained this was such family as he had left party members crowded the floor the hay bales on which men had once sat werent there any more folding chairs replaced them their odor though and that of horses still lingered in the building the smells had probably soaked into the pine boards of the wall jeff found a seat near the rostrum at the front he shook hands with several men sitting close by freedom they said pinkard had to be careful to whom he used the party greeting at the sloss works whigs and especially radical liberals had no use for it caleb briggs the freedom party leader in birmingham ascended to the rostrum and stood behind the podium waiting for everyones attention the short scrawny dentist looked very crisp the next thing to military even if hed never be handsome party men whod been standing around chatting slipped into their seats like schoolboys fearing the paddle freedom briggs said freedom the members chorused jefferson pinkards shout one among many i cant hear you briggs might have been a preacher heating up his congregation freedom they shouted again louderbut not loud enough to suit caleb briggs who cupped a hand behind his ear to show he still couldnt hear freedom they roared pinkards throat felt raw after that better the leader allowed jeff heard him through ringing ears almost as if after an artillery bombardment briggs took a sheet of paper from the breast pocket of his white shirt i have a couple of important announcements tonight he said first one is well be looking for an assault squad to hit a whig rally saturday afternoon a host of hands shot into the air briggs grinned see me after the meeting you need to know therell be cops there and theyre taking a nastier line with us after the unfortunate incident that was what the party called president hamptons assassination ill go pinkard muttered by god i want to go he hadnt been a brawler before he got conscripted but he was now second thing briggs said briskly the damnyankees are backing the popular revolutionaries in the civil war down in the empire of mexico goddamn lickspittle richmond government isnt doing anything about that but fussing we need to do more the partys looking to raise a regiment of volunteers for the emperor to show the greasers how its supposed to be done if youre interested in that see me after the meeting too jeff kept fidgeting in his seat through the rest of briggs presentation and the rest of the meeting too not even the patriotic songs and the ones from the trenches held his interest he swarmed forward as soon as he got the chance i want to volunteer for both he said all right pinkard caleb briggs replied cant say im surprised he knew about emily i dont make any promises on the filibuster into the mexican empire but the other well find a way to get you over by city hall and they did pinkard worked a half day on saturday as soon as he got off he hurried to the trolley and went downtown he gathered with the other freedom party men at a little diner one of them owned there he changed from his overalls into the white shirt and butternut trousers he carried in a denim duffel bag there too he picked up a stout wooden bludgeontwo and a half feet of ash wood so newly turned on the lathe it smelled of sawdust along with the other freedom party men he hurried up seventh avenue north toward the city hall they naturally fell into column and fell into step people scrambled off the sidewalk to get out of their way jeff made a horrible face at a little pickaninny the boy wailed in fright and clung to his mothers skirts she looked as if she might have wanted to say something but she didnt dare you better not he thought in front of city hall a whig speaker with a megaphone was exhorting a crowd that didnt look to be paying too much attention to him eight or ten policemen stood around looking bored outstanding briggs exclaimed nobody gave us away theyd be a lot readier if they reckoned we were gonna hit em his voice rose to a great roar freedom freedom jefferson pinkard bawled along with his comrades they charged forward tough and disciplined as theyd been during the war whistles shrilling the birmingham policemen tried to get between them and the suddenly shouting and screaming whigs if the cops had opened fire they might have done it as things were their billy clubs were no improvement on the freedom party bludgeons jeff got one of the men in gray in the side of the head then he was in among the whigs yelling freedom and damnyankee puppets at the top of his lungs his bludgeon rose and fell rose and fell sometimes he hit men sometimes women he wasnt fussy why fuss they were all traitors anyway a few of them tried to fight back but they didnt have much luck the whig rally smashed their enemies bloodied the freedom party men withdrew in good order jeff had a hardon all the way back to the diner those bastards he thought they got just what they deserved s ylvia enos wasnt used to being a celebrity she wished people wouldnt stop her on the streets of boston and tell her she was a hero she didnt want to be a hero shed never wanted to be one all i wanted was to have george back again she thought as she hurried back toward her block of flats but shed never see her husband again george enos had been aboard the uss ericsson when the css bonefish torpedoed herafter the confederate states yielded to the usa roger kimball the captain of the bonefish had known the war was over too hed known but he hadnt cared hed sunk the destroyer that carried george and more than a hundred other sailors and then hed sailed away hed tried to cover it up too no one could prove a british boat hadnt done the deedtill the bonefish s executive officer in a political fight with roger kimball broke the story in the papers to discredit him the story said kimball was living in charleston south carolina and so sylvia had taken a train down to charleston customs at the border hadnt searched her luggage why should the confederates have bothered she looked like what she was a widow in her thirties that she also happened to be a widow in her thirties with a pistol in her suitcase had never crossed the confederates minds but she was and when she got to charleston and found out where kimball lived shed knocked on his door and then fired several shots into him shed expected to spend the rest of her life in jail or to hang or to cook in an electric chairshe hadnt known how south carolina disposed of murderers instead thanks to politics and thanks to an extraordinary woman named anne colleton she found herself free and back in boston the csa couldnt afford to be too hard on someone who killed a war criminal she thought and why because the united states are stronger than they are that was heady as whiskey till the great war the csa and england and france had called the tune no more but no matter how strong the united states were they werent strong enough to give her back her husband the hole in her life the hole in her family would never heal she had no choice but to go on from there a tall skinny man in an expensive suit and homburg stopped in front of her so that she either had to stop too or to run into him youre sylvia enos he exclaimed ive been looking for you give me a moment of your time he didnt even say please sylvias patience had worn thin why should i she asked and got ready to push past him she reached up to fiddle with her hat she had a hat pin with an artificial pearl at one end and a very sharp point at the other some men were interested in her for the sake of politics others for other murkier reasons but this fellow proved one of the former sort why for the sake of your country thats why he had the map of ireland on his face the slightest hint of a brogue lay under his flat new england vowels look whoever you are i havent got time for anything except my children so if youll excuse me she started forward if he didnt get out of the way maybe shed use the hat pin whether he had designs on her person or not my name is kennedy mrs enos joe kennedy he said im the head of the democratic party in your ward no hat pin then except in an emergency if she got on the wrong side of a politician he could make life hard for her and life was hard enough already with a sigh she said speak your piece then mr kennedythough i dont know why youre bothering with me after all women cant vote in massachusetts his answering smile was forced the democrats had always been less eager for womens suffrage than either the socialists or what was left of the republican party but he quickly rallied do you want us weak too weak to take our proper place in the world if you do the socialist partys the perfect place for you theyre trying to throw away everything we won in the war that did hit home what do you want from me mr kennedy tell me quickly and ill give you my answer but i have to get home to my son and daughter something glinted in his eyes it made sylvia half reach for the pin again kennedy wore a wedding ring but sylvia had long since seen how little that meant men got it where they could george she made herself remember had been the same way but all the ward leader said was an hour of your time at our next meeting would be very fine to show you stand with us on the issues of the day he acted as if it were a small request something where she wouldnt need to think twice before she said yes but she shook her head you must be rich to have hours you can throw around when im not working im cooking or minding the children im sorry but ive got no time to spare kennedys mouth tightened he drummed the fingers of his right hand against his trouser leg sylvia got the feeling he wasnt used to hearing people tell him no the vapor that steamed from his nostrils as he exhaled added to the impression it also made him look a little like a demon but then as suddenly as if hed flipped the switch to an electric light he gave sylvia a bright smile if you like my own wife will watch your children while you come rose would be glad to do it she knows how important to the country winning the next election is that couldnt mean anything but my wife will watch your children if i tell her to whatever it meant it did put sylvia in an awkward position she said you know how to get what you want dont you i try joe kennedy said this time the smile he gave her had nothing to do with the automatic politicians version hed used a moment before this one was genuine a little hard a little predatory and a little smug too how could anyone marry a man with a smile like that but that thank heaven wasnt sylvias worry kennedy stood there with that hot fierce smile waiting for her answer now hed gone out of his way to give her what shed said she wanted how could she tell him no she saw no way though she still would have liked to with a sigh of her own she told him ill come to your meeting if its not at a time when im working i hope it isnt he said the smile got broadershed given in she might almost have let him take her to bed he went on we hold them saturday afternoons so most people can use the halfholiday sylvia sighed again all right though heaven only knows how ill get my shopping doneor why you think your people want to listen to me dont worry about your shopping kennedy said which had to prove he didnt do much for himself and people want to hear you because you took action you saw a wrong and you fixed it teddy roosevelt would be proud of you even the socialists had to take notice of the justice in what you did and ill be by to pick you up saturday afternoon at one oclock if thats all right i suppose so sylvia said still more than a little dazed joe kennedy tipped his homburg and went on his way sylvia checked the mailbox in the lobby of her block of flats found nothing but advertising circulars and walked up three flights of stairs to her apartment what took you so long mother george jr asked he was thirteen now which seemed incredible to her and looked more like his dead father every day mary jane who was ten was frying potatoes on the coal stove i ran into a man sylvia answered he wants me to talk at the democratic clubs ward meeting his wife will keep an eye on you two while im gone she went to the icebox and got out the halibut steaks shed fry along with the potatoes mary jane still wasnt up to main courses saturday afternoon i wont be here anyway george jr said what why not sylvia asked because i got a job carrying fish and ice down on t wharf thats why her son looked ready to burst with pride thirtyfive cents an hour and it lets me get started ma slowly sylvia nodded your father started on t wharf right about your age too she said people who caught fish in boston almost always started young but george jr suddenly didnt seem so young as all that he was old enough to have convinced someone to hire him anyhow he said ill bring all my money home to you ma every penny cross my heart and hope to die if i dont i wont spend a bit on candy or pop or anything honest i wont i know we need it so did the fellow who hired me he asked if i was pas boy and when i said yes he gave me the job right there his names fred butcher oh yes i know himyouve met him too you know sylvia nodded again he used to go out with your father on the ripple he was first mate in those days and hes done well for himself since as soon as i can ma ill go out and make money mary jane promised adding i dont much like school anyway you need to keep going a while longer sylvia said sternly she rounded on her son and so do you if you study hard maybe you can get a good job and you wont stay down on t wharf your whole life she might as well have spoken chinese staring at her in perfect incomprehension george jr said but i like it down on t wharf ma sylvia flipped the halibut steaks with a spatula she thought about explaining why all the backbreaking jobs associated with the fishing werent necessarily good choices but she could tell he wouldnt listen his father wouldnt have either she didnt start a fight she had no hope of winning instead she just said supper will be ready in a couple of minutes go wash your hands both of you joe kennedy and his wife knocked on the door that saturday afternoon a few minutes after sylvia got home rose kennedy was pretty in a bony way and more refined than sylvia had expected she did warm up a little to mary jane youre sweet dear will we be friends mary jane considered then shrugged joe kennedy said come on mrs enos my motorcars out in front of the building people are looking forward to hearing you they really are that still astonished sylvia so did kennedys motorcar shed expected a plain black ford the kind most people drove but he had an enormous oldsmobile roadster painted fireengine red he drove as if he owned the only car on the street too which in boston was an invitation to suicide somehow he reached the democratic party hall unscathed sylvia discovered a belief in miracles here she is ladies and gentlemen kennedy introduced her as if she were a vaudeville star the brave lady youve been waiting for sylvia enos looking out at that sea of faces frightened sylvia the wave of applause frightened and warmed her at the same time she stammered a little at first but gained fluency as she explained what shed done in south carolina and why shed told the story before it got easier each time she finished if we forget about the war try to pretend it never happened what did we really win nothing the applause that came then rang louder still americanempire thecentercannothold ii j ake featherston drummed his fingers on his desk spring was in the air in richmond the trees were putting on new leaves while birdsong gladdened every ear or almost every earit did very little for featherston hed led a battery of threeinch guns during the war and much preferred their bellowing to the sweet notes of catbird and sparrow when the guns roared at least a man knew he was in a fight and we are god damn it featherston muttered the leader of the freedom party was a lanky man in his midthirties with cheekbones and chin thrusting up under the flesh of his face like rocks under a thin coat of soil on some farm that would always yield more trouble than crops his eyes some people were drawn to them while others flinched away he knew that he didnt quite understand it but he knew it and used it i always mean what i say he told himself and that shows with all the lying sons of bitches running around loose youd better believe it shows if he looked out his window he could see capitol square and the confederate capitol in it his lip curled in fine contempt if that wasnt the home of some of the biggest lyingest sons of bitches in the whole wide world if it isnt then im a nigger featherston declared he talked to himself a fair amount hardly noticing he was doing it more than three years of serving a gun had taken a good deal of his hearing people who didnt care for him claimed he was selectively deaf they had a point too though he wasnt about to admit it the capitol shared the square with a large equestrian statue of george washingtonwho being a virginian was much more revered in the csa than in the usa these daysand an even larger one of albert sidney johnston hero and martyr during the war of secession somewhere between one of those statues and the other woodrow wilson had declared war on the usa almost ten years before we shouldve licked those yankee bastards featherston said as if somebodyd claimed otherwise if the niggers hadnt risen up and stabbed us in the back we wouldve licked those yankee bastards he believed it with every fiber of his being and if that jackass down in birmingham hadnt blown out president hamptons stinking brains what there were of them the partyd be well on its way towards putting this country back on its feet again jake slammed a scarred callused fist down on the desk papers jumped i was so close dammit hed come within a whiskerwell two whiskersof winning the presidential election in looking toward hed seen nothing but smooth sailing ahead of course one of the reasons the freedom party had almost won in was that its members went out there and brawled with anybody rash enough to have a different opinion if you looked at things from one angle president hamptons assassination followed from the freedom partys nature almost as inexorably as night followed day jake featherston was not had never been and never would be a man to look at things that way hed watched the party lose seats in the congressional elections hed been glad the losses werent worse other people celebrated because they were as large as they were up till that damned unfortunate incident the freedom party had gone from success to success each building momentum for the next unfortunately he was finding the process worked the same way for failure what do we do if the money doesnt keep coming in what can we do if the money doesnt keep coming in he wondered only one answer occurred to him we go under thats what when hed first joined the freedom party in the dark days right after the war it had been nothing to speak of a handful of angry men meeting in a saloon with the membership list and everything else in a cigar box it could end up that way again too he knew as much plenty of groups of disgruntled veterans had never got any bigger and the party had swallowed up a lot of the ones that had some other group could swallow it the same way no goddammit jake snarled for one thing he remained convinced he was right if the rest of the world didnt think so the rest of the world was wrong and for another hed got used to leading an important political party he liked it without false modestyand he was singularly free of modesty false and otherwisehe knew he was good at it he didnt want to play second fiddle to anybody else and he didnt want to go back to being a big fish in a tiny pond the telephone on his desk jangled he picked it up featherston he barked into the mouthpiece yes mr featherston his secretary said i just wanted to remind you that youve got that talk on the wireless coming up in a little more than an hour youll want to make sure youre at the studio on time thank you kindly lulu featherston answered he was more polite to lulu mattox than to practically anybody else he could think of unlike most people his secretary deserved it she was a maiden lady somewhere between forty and seventy once upon a time hed read or heardhe couldnt remember where or whenthat roman catholic nuns were the brides of christ what he really knew about catholicism would fit on the head of a pin hed been raised a hardshell baptist and he didnt get to any church very often these days but lulu mattox without a doubt was married to the freedom party she gave it a singleminded devotion that put the enthusiasm of any mere party man to shame she had all the files at her fingertips too for she was the bestorganized person jake had ever met he didnt know what he would do without her a few minutes later he went downstairs guards outside the building came to attention and saluted freedom they said the uniforms they wore were similar but not quite identical to those of the confederate army the bayoneted tredegar rifles they carried were army issue someone might have asked questions about that but the freedom party had gone out of its way to show the world that asking questions about it wasnt a good idea freedom jake echoed returning those salutes as if he were a general himself part of him loathed the fat fools with the wreathed stars on their collar tabs whod done so much to help the csa lose the war the rest of him wished he had that kind of power himself id do a better job with it than those bastards ever could have a motorcar driven by another uniformed freedom party man stopped in front of the building it was a boxy birmingham built in the csa jake featherston was damned if hed go around richmond in a yankee automobile that wireless place he told the driver sure sarge the man replied he was a large burly fellow named virgil joyner hed been with the freedom party almost as long as featherston had and hed been through all of the faction fights and the brawls with the whigs and the radical liberals not many people could get away with calling jake anything but boss but hed earned the right the broadcasting studio was in a new brick building on franklin near seventh not far from the house in richmond where robert e lee and his family had lived for a time after the war of secession featherston knew that only because hed grown up in and around richmond nothing remained of the house these days yankee bombs and the fires that so often followed them had leveled it hello mr featherston exclaimed the bright little man who ran the studio and the wireless station of which it was a part his name was saul goldman since he was a jew featherston assumed he sounded so cheerful so friendly because he was getting paid he was bound to be a radical liberal himself if not an outandout red long as we give em the money these bastardsll sell us the rope we use to hang em featherston thought scornfully but if goldman acted friendly hed play alongfor now good to see you he said and shook hands polite as a banker everything ready for me yes sir youre in studio b this time follow me you have your script oh yeah you bet i do featherston followed goldman down a narrow dingy hall to a cramped little studio whose walls and ceiling were covered by what looked like the cardboard bottoms of egg cartons the stuff looked funny but it helped kill echoes the studio held a table with a microphone on it and a rickety chair that was all jake pointed to the engineer in the next room whom he could see through a window hell give me the signal when its time saul goldman smiled thats right you know the routine almost like you work here id better by now dont you think featherston sat down in front of the microphone and set his script on the table he went through it quickly to make sure he had all the pages once hed lost one and had to adlib a bridge to the next one he had goldman slid out of the studio closing the door behind him the back of the door had more of those eggcarton sound deadeners glued to it after a bit the engineer flashed two fingerstwo minutes to go jake nodded to show he got it the engineer was a professional a man whose competence jake respected one fingerone minute then the fellow pointed straight at him at the same time as a red light went on for half an hour the airwaves were his confederates wake up he said harshly this is jake featherston of the freedom party and im here to tell you the truth he used that phrase to introduce every wireless talk he leaned toward the microphone as he would have leaned toward a crowd the first few times hed done this not having an audience in front of him had thrown him off stride now though he could imagine the crowd hear it in his mind shouting for more and he had more to give it we can be a great country again he said we can but will we not likely not with the cowards and idiots weve got running things in richmond these days all they want to do is lick the yankees boots you couldnt say some things on the air no you couldnt say them but sometimes implication worked better anyhow they want to lick the yankees boots jake repeated theyre great ones for sucking up to people the whigs are they even suck up to our negroes our own negroes if you can believe it and do you know what folks theyve got reason to do it may i go to the devil if i lie he couldnt say hell on the air either but he got his message across ill tell you what the reason is thanks to the whigs some of those niggers are citizens of the confederate states just like you and me thats right friends this here was supposed to be a white mans country but do the whigs care about that not likely thanks to them weve got niggers who can vote niggers who can serve on juries niggers who dont have to show passbooks to anybody thatd be bad enough if theyd put the coons in the army so we could win the war but they put em in and we lost anyways and then the whigs went out and won the next election even so maybe some of you all see the sense in that i tell you frankly i dont he went on till the engineer signaled it was time to wind down and ended as the man drew a finger across his throat when he walked out of the studio his shirt was as sweaty as if hed spoken before a crowd of thousands saul goldman came up and shook his hand very good speech the jew said very good indeed i will be damned featherston said i think you really mean it youre not making fun of me goldman nodded jake asked the obvious question how come ill tell you goldman had not an accent but the ghost of one barely enough to suggest his parents would have spoken differently anywhere else when things go wrong what do they do they blame the jews here you blame the colored people i am a jew a jew in a country where things went wrong and no one wants to kill me on account of it shouldnt i be grateful jake had never been much for seeing the other fellows point of view but he did this time well well he said isnt that interesting p art of colonel irving morrelland the bigger part at thatwanted to be back at fort leavenworth making barrels larger and stronger and better part of him but not all the rest the part that was a student of war rather than a combat soldier found a lot to interest it back at the general staff quite a few things crossed his desk that never made it into the newspapers he showed one of them to lieutenant colonel john abell asking is this true let me read through it first abell said general liggetts adjutant was thin and pale and almost sweatless a pure student of war though probably brave enough he would have been out of place on anything so untidy as a real battlefield he and morrell didnt much like each other but over the years theyd developed a wary respect for each others abilities he took his own sweet time reading the report then gave a judicious nod yes this ties in with some other things ive seen i believe its credible the turks really are massacring every armenian they can get their hands on morrell asked abell nodded again morrell took back the typewritten report saying thats terrible what can we do about it we as in the united states abell asked precise as usual morrell gave him an impatient nod he said as best i can see colonel nothing what influence can we bring to bear in that part of the world morrell grimaced and grunted his colleague was all too likely to be right hed had to find armenia on a map before fully understanding the report hed received how many americans would even have known where to look the distant land at the edge of the caucasus might have been lost among the mountains of the moon as far as most people were concerned with the best will in the world the navy couldnt do a thing and as for sending soldiers across a russia whose civil strife looked eternal the idea was absurd and he knew it he tried a different tack can kaiser bill do anything when germany spits the turks start swimming and the armenians are christians after all lieutenant colonel abell started to say something then let out his breath without a word a moment later after sending morrell a thoughtful look he said may i speak frankly colonel when have i ever stopped you morrell asked in turn a point abell admitted all right then there are times when you give the impression of being a man whose only solution to a problem is to hit something and to keep hitting it till it falls over teddy roosevelt spent a lot of time talking about the big stick lieutenant colonel morrell said as far as i can see he had a pretty good point john abell looked distinctly pained sniffing he said our former president however gifted was not a general staff officer nor did he think like one which brings me back to what i was sayingyou often give that same bullmoose impression and then you turn around and come up with something not only clever but subtle that might be worth pursuing it would have to go through the state department of course morrell grunted again and why should the boys in the cutaways and the striped trousers pay any attention to us greengray types for once abells answering smile was sympathetic the united states were one of the two most powerful countries in the world these days sure enough very often the american diplomatic corps behaved as if the us army had had nothing to do with that such a supercilious attitude infuriated morrell of course his fury mattered not at all had people in the state department known of it it would more likely have amused them than anything else abell said may i make a suggestion please if it were i the brainy lieutenant colonel said flaunting his grammatical accuracy i would draft a memorandum on the subject send it to general liggett and hope he could get it to the secretary of war or one of his assistants being civilians they have a better chance than we of getting the diplomats to notice the paper thats not bad lieutenant colonel morrell said abell hadnt even tried to steal the idea for himself and he had liggetts ear though it wasnt obvious at first glance he could be useful morrell chuckled he probably thinks the same about me he went on ill take care of it right away thanks always glad to be of service sir now abell sounded as coolly ironic as usual when morrell spoke that evening of what hed done during the day his wife nodded vigorous approval i hope something comes of it irv agnes morrell said hasnt this poor sorry world seen enough killing these past few years well i think so morrell answered you wont find many soldiers singing the praises of murder you know of course i know that agnes told him more than a little indignantly she was in her early thirties not far from his own age and had been another soldiers widow before meeting him at a dance back in leavenworth she had brown eyes her black hair these days was cut short in what the fashion magazines called a shingle bob it was all the rage at the moment morrell didnt think it quite suited his wife but didnt intend to tell her so as far as he could see such things were her business not his she went on supper will be ready in a few minutes smells good morrells nostrils flared compared to some of the things hed eaten in sonora and the canadian rockies and kentucky and tennessee it smelled very good indeed what is it back on the battlefield thered been plenty of times he hadnt wanted to know horse donkey cat buzzard he couldnt prove it which meant he didnt have to think about it too often chicken stew with dumplings and carrots agnes said thats the way you like it isnt it spit flooded his mouth as he nodded i knew i married you for a couple of reasons he said a couple of reasons her eyebrows plucked thin flew up in mock surprise what on earth could the other one be he walked over to her and let his hand rest lightly on her belly for a moment well find out if its a boy or a girl sooner than we think it wont be tomorrow agnes reminded him shed been sure she was in a family way for only a few weeks there wasnt much doubt any more not only had her time of the month twice failed to come but she was perpetually sleepy and she had trouble keeping food down she gave irving morrell a much bigger helping than she took for herself and she ate warily when they undressed for bed that night he used a forefinger to follow the new tracery of blue veins that had sprung out on agnes breasts she gave him a mischievous smile all those veins probably remind you of the rivers on a campaign map well i wouldnt have thought of it just that way morrell answered cupping her breast in the palm of her hand what sort of campaign did you have in mind honey oh i expect youll think of something she answered he squeezed gentlybut not quite gently enough the corners of her mouth turned down theyre sore people say you get over that but i havent yet he tried to be more careful and evidently succeeded for things went on from there when theyd progressed a good deal further agnes climbed on top of him the idea had startled him when she first proposed it hed always thought a man belonged in the saddle but she didnt have his weight on her tender breasts this wayand hed discovered it was fine no matter who went where a couple of days later he got called to general hunter liggetts office with general liggett was a tall longfaced man five or ten years older than morrell colonel id like to introduce you to mr n mattoon thomas the assistant secretary of war pleased to meet you sir morrell lied without hesitation thomas was the man whod gone up to canada to put general custer out to pasture morrell still didnt know if custer was a good general he had his doubts in fact but custer had turned a whole great assault column of barrels loose against the csa and morrell had ridden a barrel at the head of that column without the breakthroughs theyd won the great war might still be going on likewise colonel im very glad to meet you n mattoon thomas was probably lying too in the army it was an axiom of faith that the socialists wanted to get rid of everything that had let the usa win the war that thomas had forced george custer into retirement didnt speak well for him not in morrells eyes hunter liggett said colonel i passed your memorandum on the unfortunate situation in armenia to the assistant secretary here in the hope that he might send it on to the department of state a very perceptive document thomas said i dare hope it will do some good although one never knows very perceptive indeed he studied morrell as an entomologist might study a new species of beetle i should hardly have expected such a thing from a soldier morrell gave him a smile that was all sharp teeth sorry sir we dont gas grandmothers and burn babies all the time silence slammed down in general liggetts office the head of the general staff broke it saying what colonel morrell meant sir was i know perfectly well what colonel morrell meant thomas said his voice cold as the middle of a meat locker he resents my party for telling him he may not play with big iron toys forever and tell the american people hang the expense we may need these one day i wear his resentment as a badge of honor he gave morrell a nod that was almost a bow and what have you got to say about that colonel you seem in an outspoken mood today ive never said hang the expense sir morrell answered but we may need better barrels one day and they arent toys if your party thinks what we do is play why not get rid of the army altogether and the navy too before thomas could reply the telephone on general liggetts desk rang he snatched it up confound it you know what sort of meeting im in he snapped from which morrell concluded he was talking to lieutenant colonel abell in the outer office but then liggett said what whats that color drained from his face leaving it corpseyellow dear god in heaven he whispered and hung up what is it morrell and n mattoon thomas said the same thing at the same time general liggett stared blindly from one of them to the other tears glistened in his eyes all at once he looked like an old old man teddy roosevelt is dead he said sounding as stunned and disbelieving as a shellshocked soldier he was playing a round of golf outside syracuse and he fell over and he didnt get up cerebral hemorrhage they think oh my god again morrell and thomas spoke together thomas might be a socialist but theodore roosevelt had been a mighty force in the united states for more than forty years no one regardless of party could be indifferent to that so far morrell thought and no further then what hed just heard really hit him to his amazement and shame and dismay he began to weep a moment later blurrily he saw tears running down the faces of hunter liggett and n mattoon thomas too c ongresswoman flora blackford should have been packing for the trip from philadelphia to chicago for the socialist partys nominating convention president upton sinclair would surely get his partys nod for a second term the socialists first president elected almost forty years after the modern socialist party began in chicago when in the aftermath of the second mexican war abraham lincoln led the republican left wing out of one organization and into another yes the presidential nomination was a foregone conclusion the vice presidency flora smiled to herself the vice presidency was a forgone conclusion too nothing in the world as far as she could see would keep hosea blackford her husband from getting the nomination again and then in hed once said he didnt expect to get the nod for the top of the ticket then maybe though maybe he was wrong such things were what she should have been thinking aboutwhat she had been thinking about up till a few days before now she put her most somber clothes into a suitcase she wouldnt be going to chicago not yet and neither would her husband shed always wanted to visit the city where the modern party was born and she wouldbut not yet instead she packed for the short trip down to washington dc for the funeral of theodore roosevelt hosea blackford came into the bedroom carrying black trousers and a white shirt as he put them in the suitcase he shook his head im almost as old as teddy roosevelt and i still feel as though my father just died both of floras parents were still alive but she nodded everybody in the whole country feels that way near enough she answered we didnt always like him if we were socialists we practically never liked him hosea blackford said nodding flora went on but whether we liked him or not he made us what we are he raised us he raised this whole country its no wonder we feel lost without him no wonder at all her husband said over his shoulder as he went back to the hall closet for a black jacket and a black homburg he was always sure he knew what was best for us he wasnt always right but he was always sure he chuckled sounds like my pa ill tell you that his flat great plains accent was a world away from her yiddishflavored new york city speech he went back for a black cravat flora closed the suitcase are we ready to go she asked i expect so he looked out the window of the flat that had been his aloneacross the hall from herswhich they now shared a motorcar waited in front of the building grunting he picked up the suitcase when they went outside the driver saw him carrying it and rushed to take it from him grudgingly blackford surrendered it he gave flora a wry grin ever since she was elected to congress shed wrestled with the problem of the privileges members of governmenteven socialist members of governmentenjoyed for all her wrestling for all her commitment to class struggle she had yet to come to a conclusion that satisfied her she and her husband enjoyed even more privilege on the southbound train a fancy pullman car all to themselves and food brought to them from the diner when they got to washington another motorcar whisked them to the white house the flag in front of the famous building flew at half staff the white house itself looked much as it had before the great war repairs there had been finished almost a year before the washington monument off to the south however remained a truncated stub of its former self scaffolding surrounded it it would rise again to its full majestic height if theres ever another war all this work will go to waste flora said one more reason thered better not be another war her husband answered and she nodded president upton sinclair met them in the downstairs entry hall after shaking hands with his vice president and kissing flora on the cheek he said i would sooner have done this in philadelphia but roosevelt left word he wanted the ceremony here and i couldnt very well say no hardly hosea blackford agreed what does it feel likestaying in the white house i mean well look at the place i feel as though i were living in a museum sinclair waved he was a tall slim man in his midforties the youngest man ever elected president his youthful vigor had served him well in when teddy roosevelt even then past sixty could be seen as a man whose time however great had passed him by the president shook his head its even worse than living in a museum its the reproduction of a museum they didnt get a whole lot out of here before the confederates bombarded the place in frankly id rather be in philadelphia the powel house doesnt make me think ill get thrown out if i speak above a whisper flora found herself nodding it is more like the american museum of natural history than any place where youd want to stay isnt it thats right president sinclair nodded emphatically strange that we should be doing the honors for roosevelt hosea blackford observed he was a great man flora said a class enemy but a great man easier to admire a foe especially an able one after hes gone sinclair said like a lot of men largely selftaughtabraham lincoln had been the sameher husband was fond of quoting shakespeare why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves an american caesar president sinclair nodded that fits but flora shook her head no if hed been caesar he never would have given up the presidency when he lost four years ago he would have called out the troops instead and if teddy roosevelt had called them they might have marched too no one cared to contemplate that hosea blackford said well hes gone now and i come to bury caesar not to praise him and well give him a grand funeral too the president added we can afford to do that hes a lot easier to deal with dead than he was alive sleeping in the mahan bedroom felt strange to flora it was as big as the flat in which she and her whole family had lived in new york the next morning a colored servanta reminder that washington had once been closely aligned with the states now forming the confederacybrought her and her husband bacon and eggs and fried potatoes she ate the eggs and potatoes her husband demolished her bacon along with his own i shouldnt i suppose he said dont worry about it i dont she answered which was true most of the time only later did she wonder in what the eggs and potatoes had been cooked bacon grease lard she was socialist and secular and very jewish all at the same time and every so often one piece bounced off another and left her unsure of what she ought to feel tenshundredsof thousands of people lined the route from the capitol to the remains of the washington monument and then south she and hosea blackford took their places on a reviewing stand near the monument to watch theodore roosevelts funeral procession along with members of congress and some foreign dignitaries she recognized the ambassador from the confederate states who stood close by his colleagues from britain france and the empire of mexico in a glum knot no one else came very close to them down among the ordinary spectators near the stand were a middleaged woman wearing a gaudy medalthe order of remembrance first classand a younger one who looked like her with the slightly less flamboyant order of remembrance second class hanging around her neck they both held young children the grayhaired man with them who had a distinguished service medal on his black jacket said if she gets fussy nellie give her to me i will hal the older woman answered flora wondered what shed done during the war to earn such an important decoration she never found out indeed a moment later she forgot all about the people in the crowd for flourishes of muffled drums announced that the procession was approaching behind the drummersone each from the army navy marines and coast guardcame a riderless black horse led by a soldier as the animal slowly walked past flora saw that it had reversed boots thrust into the stirrups and a sheathed sword lashed to the saddle six white horses teamed in twos drew the black caisson carrying roosevelts body in a flagdraped coffin all six of the horses were saddled the saddles of the three on the right were empty a soldier a sailor and a marine rode the three on the left president upton sinclair in somber black marched bareheaded behind the caisson along with some of roosevelts relativesincluding one man of about floras age who had to be pushed along in a wheelchair she wondered what sort of injury hed taken in the war that had crippled him so the premier of the republic of quebec strode along a few paces after sinclair and the roosevelt family accompanied by a couple of central american heads of state whod taken a fast liner to reach the usa in time for the funeral after them came the ambassadors from the german empire austriahungary and the ottoman empire the great wartime allies given pride of place envoys from chile and paraguay and the empire of brazil came next followed by other emissaries from europe and the americasand the ambassador from the empire of japan elegant in a black cutaway alone of all the entente nations japan hadnt yielded to the central powers shed just stopped fighting it wasnt the same thing and everyone knew it after the foreign dignitaries marched a band playing soft somber music another riderless horse brought up the rear of the procession flora found that excessive but nobodyd asked her opinion and the socialist party being in power did have an obligation to send the departed roosevelt to his final rest with as much grandeur as possible to keep the democrats from screaming about indifference or worse once the procession had passed the reviewing stand it turned south toward the potomac the crowds there were just as thick as they had been between the capitol and the washington monument the sounds of weeping rose above the music of the band say what you will the people loved him hosea blackford remarked i know flora shook her head in wonder in spite of the war he led them into they loved him that war had cost her brotherinlaw his life and her brother a leg and david voted democratic despiteor maybe because ofthat missing leg though hed been a socialist before her husband said well he won it no matter how much it cost and now he gets his last revenge on the confederate states he chuckled in reluctant admiration flora didnt know whether to admire teddy roosevelts final gesture or to be appalled by it on the southern bank of the potomac in what had been virginia but was now annexed to us west virginia robert e lee had had an estate since the great war rolled over it it had lain in ruins that hadnt bothered roosevelt at all hed left instructionsand president sinclair had agreedthat his last resting place should be on the grounds of arlington c larence potter paid two cents for a copy of the charleston mercury thanks very much he told the boy from whom he bought it youre welcome sir the boy said the thick drawl of the old south carolina coastal city flavoring his speech he cocked his head to one side you a yankee sir you sure dont talk like youre from hereabouts not me son potter shook his head the motion threatened to dislodge his steelframed spectacles he set them more firmly on the bridge of his long thin nose i came to charleston after the war though i grew up in virginia oh the newsboy relaxed he probably hadnt gone more than ten miles outside of charleston in his whole life and wouldnt have known a virginia accent from one from massachusetts or minnesota holding his newspaper so he could read as he walked potter hurried down queen street toward the harbor he moved like an exsoldier head up shoulders back and he had been a soldierhed served as a major in intelligence in the army of northern virginia during the war his accent had aroused some talk and some suspicion there too even men who knew accents thought he sounded too much like a yankee for comfort and so he did not long before the war hed gone to yale and the way people spoke in new haven had rubbed off on him below the fold on the front page was an account of a speech by jake featherston raising holy hell because teddy roosevelts bones were resting in the sacred soil of virginia potter clucked and rolled his eyes and made as if to chuck the paper into the first trash can he saw he would have bet featherston would make a speech like that but in the end he didnt throw away the mercury he opened it and read till hed seen as much of the speech as it reprinted he clicked his tongue between his teeth as he refolded the newspaper featherston would pick up points for what hed said damn teddy roosevelt and his arrogance potter thought as far as he was concerned anything that helped the freedom party was bad for the confederate states of america hed got to know jake featherston pretty well during the war featherston had made the fatal mistake of being right when he said jeb stuart iiis negro servant pompey was in fact a red rebel young captain stuart not believing it had got pompey off the hook only to have his treason proved when the negro uprising broke out a little while later stuart had gone into action seeking death after that and on a great war battlefield death was never hard to find general jeb stuart jr a hero of the second mexican war was a power in the war department in richmond hed made sure jake featherston whod been right about his sons error in judgment never got promoted above the rank of sergeant no matter how well he foughtand jake fought very well indeed for that matter potter himself had also been involved in uncovering jeb stuart iiis mistake and hed advanced only one grade in three years himself but his failure to get promoted affected only him had jeb stuart jr relented and given featherston the officers rank he deserved the csa would have been saved endless grief clarence potter was sure of that featherston had been taking out his rage and frustration against confederate authorities ever since i knew even then he was monstrous good at hating potter thought did i ever imagine while the fighting was going on that hed turn out to be as good at it as he has he shook his head he was honest enough to admit to himself that he hadnt hed thought jake featherston would disappear into obscurity once the war ended most menalmost all menwould have the exceptions were the ones who had to be dealt with for the time being it looked as if featherston had been dealt with not so long before his speech would have stood at the top of the front page not below the fold he was a falling star these days with luck he wouldnt rise again when potter got to the harbor he stiffened a us navy gunboat was tied up at one of the quays seeing the stars and stripes here where the confederacy was born and the war of secession began raised his hackles the flag stood out the cs navy used the confederate battle flag as its ensign not the stars and bars that so closely resembled the us banner and the us navy mens dark blue uniforms also contrasted with the dark gray their confederate counterparts wore these days clarence potter made his living as an investigator hed been looking into smuggling going through the harbor and had headed there to report his findings to the harbormaster but that warship flying the hated northern flag drew him as a magnet drew iron he wasnt the only one either men in both cs naval uniform and in civilian clothes converged on the us gunboat yankees go home somebody yelled scores of throats roared agreement potters among them avast that shouting a us officer on the deck of the gunboat bawled through a megaphone weve got every right to be here under the armistice agreement and you know it damned well were inspecting to make sure you confederates arent building submersibles in these parts if you interfere with us while were doing our duty youll be sorry and so will your whole stinking country they love us no better than we love them clarence potter reminded himself and that lieutenant commander had a point if he and his men couldnt make their inspection the csa would pay in humiliation and maybe in gold as well the yankees had learned their lessons well as victors they were even more intolerable than the confederates had been yankees go home the crowd on the quay shouted over and over at a barked order the sailors on the gunboat swung their forward cannon to bear on the crowd the gun was only a threeinchera popgun by naval standardsbut it could work a fearful slaughter if turned on soft flesh rather than steel armor sudden silence descended thats better the us officer said if you think we wont open fire youd goddamn well better think again youll never get out of this harbor if you do somebody called the us lieutenant commander had spunk he shrugged maybe we will maybe we wont but if you want to start a brand new war against the united states of america go right ahead if you start it well finish it no one from the united states would have talked like that before the great war the confederate states had been on top of the world then no more the yankees had the whip hand nowadays and people in charleston knew it the crowd in front of the us gunboat dispersed sullenly but it dispersed some of the men who walked away knuckled their eyes to hold back tears the confederates were a proud folk and choking on that pride came hard potter made his way to the harbormasters office that worthy a plump man named ambrose spawforth fumed about yankee arrogance those sons of bitches dont own the world no matter what they think he said you know that and i know that but do the damnyankees know it potter answered ill tell you something else i know the way that bastard in a blue jacket acted he just handed the freedom party a raft of new votes spawforth was normally a man with a good deal of common sense when he said well good a chill ran through clarence potter the harbormaster went on isnt it about time we start standing up to the usa again that depends potter said judiciously standing up to them isnt such a good idea if they go and knock us down again right now they can do that you know dont i just spawforth said were weaklings now we need to get strong again we can do it we will do it too not behind jake featherston potter spoke with absolute conviction but he didnt impress spawforth no matter how certain he sounded the fat man said hell tell the yankees off hell tell the niggers off hell tell the fools in richmond off too that all needs doing every bit of it one of potters eyebrows rose splendid he said and what happens after he tells the yankees off huh plainly that hadnt occurred to spawforth the likeliest thing is they take some more of our land or they make us start paying them reparations again potter said we arent strong enough to stop them you know do you want another round of inflation to wipe out the currency he washe always had beena coldly logical man that made it easy for him to resist even to laugh at jake featherstons fervent speechmaking it also made him have trouble understanding why so many people took featherston seriously ambrose spawforth was one of those people well what we need to do is get strong enough so the usa cant kick us around any more he said the freedom partys for that too splendid potter said again even more sardonically than before we tell the united states we aim to kick them in the teeth as soon as we get the chance im sure theyll just go right ahead and let us youve got the wrong attitude you know that the harbormaster said you dont understand the way things work what potter understood was that you couldnt have whatever you wanted just because you wanted it even if you held your breath till you turned blue that didnt mean you were entitled to it as far as he could see the freedom party hadnt figured that out and didnt want to he also understood getting deeper into an argument with spawforth would do him no good at all the man didnt have to hire him to snoop around the harbor yes hed been in intelligence during the war but plenty of beadyeyed needlenosed men were at liberty in charleston these days a lot of them could do his job and do it about as well as he did and so however much he wanted to prove to the world at largeand to ambrose spawforth in particularthat spawforth was an ass an imbecile an idiot he restrained himself instead of laying into the man he said only well i didnt come here to fight about politics with you mr spawforth i came to tell you about the fellows whore sneaking dirty moving pictures into the csa and taking tobacco out tobacco so thats what theyre getting for that filthy stuff is it spawforth said and potter nodded the harbormaster looked shrewd if its tobacco theyre likely yankees i wouldve reckoned em some other kind of foreignersgoddamn germans maybefrom the girls on the films but they dont talk or nothin so i couldnt prove it yes the films are coming in from the usa im sure of that potter looked at ambrose spawforth over the tops of his spectacles so youve seen some of these moving pictures have you the harbormaster turned red it was in the line of duty damn it have to know whats going on dont i id look like a right chucklehead if i didnt know what all was coming through charleston harbor he had enough of a point to keep potter from pressing him and the veteran in the course of his own duties had seen some of the films himself he didnt think the girls looked german they were certainly limber though he took some papers from his briefcase heres my reportand my bill j onathan moss hadnt taken up the law to help canadians gain justice from the us occupying authorities such thoughts in fact had been as distant from his mind as the far side of the moon before the great war started hed spent the whole war as an american pilot in ontario beginning in observation aircraft and ending in fighting scouts hed come through without a scratch and as an ace not many of the men whod started the war with him were still there at the end he knew exactly how lucky he was to be here these days and not to need a cane or a hook or a patch over one eye us forces had planned to take toronto within a few weeks of the wars beginning but the canadians and the english had had plans of their own the us army had taken three years to get there almost every inch of ground around lake erie from niagara falls to toronto had seen shells land on it the city itself having spent a lot of time shooting it up from the air moss knew what sort of shape toronto had been in when the fighting finally stopped it was far from the only canadian place in such condition either towns came back to life only little by little wrecked buildings got demolished new ones went up to take their places but the key words were little by little canadians these days didnt have much money and the american government was anything but interested in helping them with their troubles that meant a lot of people doing the wrecking and the rebuilding werent canadians at all but fastbuck artists up from the states that was certainly true in berlin where moss had has practice the town had briefly been known as empire during the war but had reverted to its original name after the americans finally drove out stubborn canadian and british defenders americans in conquered canada often behaved as if the law were for other people not for them sometimes the military government looked the other way or encouraged them to act like that moss had defended one canadians right to reclaim a building he incontrovertibly ownedthat it was the building where hed had his office made the case especially interesting for him not only had he taken the case hed won it that got him more such business these days most of his clients were canucks some of his own countrymen accused him of being more canadian than the canadians he took it as praise though doubting they meant it that way and when saturday rolled around and the courts closed till the following monday he got into his powerful bucephalus and roared off to the west the motorcar did more to prove his family had money than to prove he did the road to the little town of arthur proved nobody in the province of ontario had much money to set things to rights what had been shell holes in ground torn down to the bone were now ponds or simply grassy dimples in fertile soil rain and ice and grass and bushes softened the outlines of the trenches that had furrowed the countryside like scourge marks on a bare back even the ugly lumps of concrete that marked machinegun nests and larger fortifications were beginning to soften with the passage of time weathering and getting a coating of moss though cities were slow in recovering the farmland in the countryside was back in business several trucks hauling broken concrete and rusted barbed wire back toward scrap dealers in berlin or toronto passed moss on the opposite side of the road here and there fresh barbed wire stayed up not in the thickets of the stuff used during the war but single sometimes double strands signboards showed a skull and crossbones and a twoword warning in big red letters danger mines how long will those mines stay in the ground moss wondered from berlin over to arthur was about thirty miles even with his powerful automobile moss needed almost an hour and a half to get to the little farm outside of arthur that wasnt the bucephalus fault but the roadsespecially after rains like the ones theyd had a couple of days earlier it was truly appalling his squadron had been stationed at an aerodrome only a mile or so from this little farm it had been stationed here for a long time the front hadnt moved fast enough to make frequent relocations necessary and so jonathan moss wandering the countryside in search of whateverand whomeverhe might find had got to know a woman whose maiden name shed bragged was laura secord she was named for a relative whod made herself famous during the war of warning that the americans were coming in much the same way as paul revere had warned that the british were coming during the revolution if that hadnt been enough to make her a canadian patriot shed been married to a soldier who was either missing or captured she hadnt wanted to look at jonathan hed certainly wanted to look at her she was tall and blond and shapely and prettyand she was more of a man than most of the men he knew she could take care of herself in fact she insisted on taking care of herself hed come back right after the war ended her husband hadnt she sent him off with a flea in his ear anyhow but when she was desperate for money to keep from being taxed off the farm shed written to him while he was in law school hed lent it to her that had helped ease him into her good graces though shed paid back every dime helping that fellow over in berlin regain his building had done far more any practicalminded american would say what happened mattered more than how it happened now now when moss pulled onto the track that led from the road to her farmhouse and barn he squeezed the bulb on the motorcars horn the raucous noise made a cow look up from the long green grass it was cropping the cow didnt act too startled it had heard that noise before so had laura secord moss stopped the automobile just in front of her house she came toward him nodding a greeting she carried a headless chicken still dripping blood by the feet a hatchet was buried in a redstained stump that did duty for a chopping block hello yank she said and held up the chicken once i settle her shell make us a fine stew her layings down so i dont care about culling her suits me moss said how have you been not bad she replied by a years custom they were decorous with each other as long as they stayed outside which made moss want to hurry into the farmhouse but this moss frowned she sounded moreor rather lessthan merely decorous he asked is something wrong she didnt answer right away when she did all she said was we can talk about it a little later if thats all right sure whatever you want moss didnt see what else he could say he wondered if hed done something to put her nose out of joint he didnt think so but how could a mere maleworse an american maleknow for sure when they went inside she gutted the chicken and threw the offal out for the farm cats which were the wildest beasts moss had ever known she plucked the carcass with automatic competence hardly looking at what her hands were doing then she got a fire going in the stove cut up the bird threw it in a pot with carrots and onions and potatoes and a cabbage and put it over the fire to cook as soon as shed got the chicken stew going he expected her to throw herself into his arms that was how things had gone since they became lovers when they got inside the farmhouse all bets were off the first time theyd gone to bed together they hadnt gone to bed hed taken her on the kitchen floor if she hadnt got splinters in her behind it wasnt because he hadnt rammed her against the floorboards today though she shook her head when he took a step toward her we need to talk she said what about moss asked with a sinking feeling worse than any hed known while diving to escape an enemy pilot whenever a woman said something like that the first careless joy of two people as a couple was over come into the parlor laura secord told him that surprised him too she hardly ever used the impressivelooking room hed walked past it on the way to the stairs that led to her bedroom but he wasnt sure hed ever actually been inside it what could he do now though but nod and let her lead the way at her gesture he sat down on the sofa the upholstery crackled under his weight the sofa wasnt used to working on the table in front of the sofa stood a framed photograph of her late husband in canadian uniform moss had resolutely forgotten his surname thinking of laura by her maiden name made it easier for him to forget the dead man altogether but how could you forget someone whose image stared at you out of eyes that looked hard and dangerous the chair in which laura secord sat also made noises that suggested it wasnt used to having anyone actually sit in it she looked at moss but didnt say anything you were the one who wanted to talk he reminded her i asked you once what about she bit her lip and looked away something close to a sob burst from her shes going to send me packing moss thought with sudden sick certainty she cant stand a damn yank rumpling her drawers any more no matter how much she likes it what do i do then he wondered panic somewhere not far under the surface of his mind hed spent years alternately chasing her and tryingalways without much luckto get her out of his mind now that hed finally got her finally found out just how much woman she was losing her was the last thing he wanted but two had to say yes one was plenty for no what is it he said again like a man bracing himself for the dentists drill after this buildup dont you think youd better tell me laura nodded jerkily but then instead of talking she sprang up to light a kerosene lamp the yellow glow added enough light to the parlor for him to see how pale she was another thought intruded on him shes going to have a baby he gave a tiny shrug well deal with that dammit shakespeares first kid came along seven months after he got married the world wont end she sat down again biting her lip moss nostrils twitchednot at the way she was behaving but because hed just got the first whiff of the stew at last she said so low he had to lean forward to hear her which made the couch rustle again theres going to be an uprising here in canada against against the united she didnt get states out instead she buried her face in her hands and wept as if her heart were breaking it probably is moss realized why are you telling me i thought youd be cheering them on laura asked he nodded though leading them on was more what hed had in mind she said because i dont want you to get hurt because i she stopped again well he said quite taken aback he didnt say anything else for close to a minute what man wouldnt savor such a compliment she cares for me he thought dizzily and not just for my he shook his head and asked the other question that needed asking how do you know about this laura looked at him as if hed been foolish and so i have he decided she answered as she might have to a child i am who i ami am what i amafter all they thought youd be cheering them on too moss said cheering them on or helping them i mean yes in the one word laura secord unwittingly spoke volumes on how close theyd come to being right then she burst into tears when moss tried to comfort her she pushed him away as fiercely as if he were still the enemy shed thought him for so long l ucien galtier took life a day at a time as far as he could see that was a good idea for any man and an especially good idea for a farmer like himself sometimes you got sunshine sometimes rain or snow or just clouds sometimes you got peace sometimes hed seen you got war sometimes you got a whole new country he still had trouble remembering he lived in the republic of quebec the usa had invaded the canadian province of quebec and found enough men willing to detach it from its longtime home to make a new nation without the united states my country would not be galtier thought that had been a very strange notion the first time it crossed his mind by now though hed realized the united states did as they pleased all through north america when they point at this one and say come he cometh and when they point at that one and say go he goeth thats from the bible isnt it his wife asked when he spoke the thought aloud to her i think so marie he answered scratching his head as he tried to remember where hed found the language in which he robed his thought he wasnt a tall man or broad through the shoulders his strength was of the wiry sort that didnt show it was also of the wiry sort that endured after a bigger mans youthful power faded with the passing years hed seen his fiftieth birthday the only real difference between it and his fortieth was that hed gone gray over the past ten years hed had only a few silver strands among the midnight at forty now the black hairs were the ones that were few and far between marie as far as he could tell hadnt aged a day he marveled at how shed managed that shed lived with him for thirty years now if that wasnt enough to give her gray hair nothing ever would she said the romans in our lords day didnt use their power for good did they i dont know these things lucien exclaimed if you wanted someone who knows about romans you shouldnt have married a farmer he raised a sly eyebrow maybe you should have married bishop pascal youre trying to make me angry marie said youre doing a good job of it too its not so much that bishop pascal cant marry its thinking i might want to marry him if he could you could squeeze enough oil out of that man to light a house for a year but it would be sweet oil galtier said his wife made a face at him before they could start up again georges their younger son came into the farmhouse with a newspaper from riviereduloup in his hand theyve gone and done it he said waving the paper at lucien and marie who has gone and done what lucien galtier asked with georges with newspaper in hand he might settle on anything charles his older brother was much more like the elder galtier both in looks and character georges towered over his fatherand also as he had since he was a boy delighted in whimsy for its own sake had someone gone and hauled a cow onto a roof georges might well make a story like that out to be the end of the world not this time though the canadians have risen against the united states he said and held the paper still long enough to let his father and mother see the big black headline calisse galtier muttered mauvais tabernac marie clucked at his swearing but he didnt care he reached for the newspaper oh the fools the stupid fools he crossed himself theyll get whats coming to them georges said he took the republic of quebec for granted hed lived the last third of his life in it to him as his words showed canada was a foreign country things were different for lucien back in the s hed been conscripted into the canadian army hed soldiered side by side with men who spoke english hed learned some himself its remembered fragments had come in handy in ways he hadnt expected hed also been told talk white when he spouted french at the wrong time despite that though hed seen that englishspeaking canadians werent so very different from their quebecois counterparts and memories of when quebec had been part of something stretching from atlantic to pacific remained strong in him give me the paper he said i want to see what they say about this something in his tone warned georges this would not be a good time to argue or joke here papa he said and handed him the newspaper without another word galtier had to hold it out at arms length to read it his sight had lengthened over the past ten years too shall i get your reading glasses marie asked i know where you left themon the nightstand by the bed never mind he answered i can manage well enough uprisings in toronto and ottawa and winnipeg in calgary and edmonton and vancouver the americans say they are putting them down georges said of course they say that what else would you expect them to say galtier replied during the war both sides told lies as fast as they could the americans must have captured quebec city and montreal and toronto half a dozen times eachand they must have been chased south over the border just as often georges pointed to a paragraph lucien was about to read on his own the premier of the republic is sending soldiers to help his american alliesthats what he calls it anyhow osti galtier muttered he wasnt surprised so much as disgusted hed been thinking of the bible the americans were saying come and the quebecois were duly coming or was that fair didnt allies help allies werent quebec and the usa allies why wouldnt frenchspeaking troops in bluegray help americans in greengray can the canadians win do you think georges asked he certainly thought of his former countrymen as foreigners no galtier shook his head the americans are soft in certain thingsthey have certainly been softer here in quebec than they might have been yes he had to admit that but think even of your brotherinlaw remember what he thinks of the british the united states will not be kind in canada they will crucify the whole country and they will laugh while they are doing it the canadians are brave his son said theyre foolish galtier replied havent we seen enough war havent we seen too much war marie said actually this part of quebec had fallen to the americans fairly fast it had seen occupation but not too much true combat near montreal near quebec city the story was different they dont think so georges sounded excited he knows no better galtier thought war around here hadnt seemed too bad listen to this son galtier said after turning the paper to an inside page so he could see the rest of the story listen carefully american occupying authorities vow that these uprisings will be put down and all rebels punished under martial law this is a rebellion against duly constituted authority not a war captured rebels do not have the privileges granted to legitimate prisoners of war do you know what that means do you understand it i think so father georges for once sounded serious he didnt try to make a joke of it lucien galtier spelled things out anyhow it means the americans will hang or shoot anyone they catch who rose up against them they wont waste time with a lot of questions before they do it either and we take money from the americans for the hospital they built on our patrimony georges said we even have an american in our family you have a halfamerican nephew galtier replied you have an american brotherinlaw as i have an american soninlaw and leonard odoull is a good fellow and a good doctor and you cannot say otherwise nooo georges admitted reluctantly but if theyre doing these things in canada theyre doing them because the canadians have risen up galtier said if the canadians had stayed quiet none of this would have happened none of it has happened here in quebec nestce pas oui tu as raison papa georges said but even if you are right is it not that we have made a deal with the devil you might say that same thought had crossed galtiers mind too he did his best to fight it down whenever it did now he said no we are a small man the united states they are a large strong man who carries a gun are we foolish because we do not go out of our way to step on his toes i think not maybe his son said more reluctantly still then he asked what time is it am i a clock galtier said you can look at one as easily as i georges did and then exclaimed in dismay is it half past four already tabernac i thought it was earlier and why does the hour matter so much galtier inquired with a certain ironic curiosity part of which was about whether his guess was right sure enough his younger son shuffled his feet a couple of times before answering when i was in town i heard there would be a dance tonight i thought i might go did you yes i did georges attempted defiance he didnt do a good job of it his older brother charles or any of his four sisters could have given him lessons lucien and marie shared amused looks theyd met at a dance somewhere a little more than thirty years before nor were they the only couple in the neighborhood who hadfar from it galtier said all right son have a good time georges started to argue to protest then he really heard what his father had said he blinked its all right he asked suspiciously i said so didnt i marie added theres plenty of hot water on the stove if you have time to bathe and shave before you go merci chere maman ill do that quick as a wink georges still looked as if he didnt trust his ears he went off to the kitchen to take the hot water to the bathroom still scratching his head when he was or at least might have been out of earshot marie said high time he got married i began to worry about charles when he waited so long madeleine boileau is a nice girl and she made him a good match this past winter galtier said his wife nodded he went on she is a better match than we could have got without our american doctor soninlaw or without the money from the americans for the property on which the hospital stands i know that marie said you must know it too why bring it up now weve had these things for some time why bring it up now galtier echoed to convince myself what weve done is worthwhile thats why because there are times when i feel our money is like judas thirty pieces of silver thats why because i almost envy the canadians for rising thats why marie eyed him would you disown your grandson no never lucien didnt hesitate he did laugh all right you have me i should hope so marie said americanempire thecentercannothold iii a cold nasty rain poured down on augusta georgia had the town been up in the usa scipio suspected it would have got snow even though this was only the end of october hed seen snow a few times here and in south carolina where hed lived most of his life he didnt like it a bit the rain drummed on his cheap black umbrella some of the negroes in the terry augustas black quarter had no umbrellas they dashed through the streets on the way to work water splashing up under their galosheswhen they had galoshes scipio did he was fastidious about his person part of that was personal inclination part habit ingrained in him by more than half a lifetime spent as anne colletons butler shed always insisted on perfection in everything and shed known how to get what she wanted his foot slipped out from under him he had to make a mad grab for a lamppost with his free hand that kept him from falling on his backside but the desperate embrace left his arm and one side of his chest almost as wet as if he had fallen he muttered under his breath all the way to erasmus fish market and restaurant you buywe fry was painted on the window in big letters the front door was unlocked scipio gladly ducked inside closing the umbrella as he did so erasmus as always had got there before him the grayhaired black man was sipping on a steaming cup of coffee almost white with creamhed already been to the fish market alongside the savannah river to get the best of the days catch and put it on ice here mornin he said to scipio and then wet out he got the most mileage from every word he used do jesus sho is scipio exclaimed is soaked clean through his accent was that of the congaree thicker and more ignorantsounding than erasmus he could also use the english of an educated white managain anne colletons doingbut he had nothing between the one and the other cant be helped erasmus took another sip of coffee he pointed to the pot pour yourself some if you got a mind to xerxes i do dat scipio said no one in augusta not even bathsheba his wife knew his rightful name hed used several aliases since escaping from the wreckage of the congaree socialist republic his passbook said he was xerxes and he wasnt about to argue with it xerxes was as free as a black man in the confederate states could be scipio still had a large price on his head back in south carolina he poured less creamthe pitcher sat on ice next to some catfishinto his coffee than erasmus used but added a couple of teaspoons of sugar his boss eyes were on him erasmus didnt approve of anyone standing around idle especially not someone he was paying getting a cup of coffee didnt mean lollygagging around for half an hour till scipio finished it he took the cup out in front of the display full of ice and fish grabbed a push broom and started sweeping up under and around the restaurant tables erasmus said yous a pretty good fellow xerxes i thanks you scipio answered chivvying small specks of dust to destruction yes suh yous a pretty good fellow erasmus said again you works by the way he spoke those two traits were intimately connected he watched scipio sweep a little longer then added you know what i say i say you ought to git your own place work for your own self i hates to lose you but you smart if you go scipio stopped sweeping erasmus must have been serious for he didnt give his employee a putupon stare slowly scipio said aint never thought about that none he told the truth never in his life had he contemplated being his own master hed been born a slave before the confederate states manumitted their negroes in the aftermath of the second mexican war even after manumission hed always been a house nigger first in the kitchens at marshlands then as butler there hed done factory labor and worked as a waiter since every single place hed had somebody telling him what to do whenever he thought of anne colleton he shivered even now getting out of south carolina had put some distance between them the state border being more important than the miles was it enough he hoped so ought to do some thinkin then i reckon erasmus said you aint stupid you kin readn writen ciphermoren i kin do my ownself you works hard an you saves your money what else you need maybe he didnt expect an answer but scipio gave him one dunno dat i wants to boss other niggers around you hear what i sayin yeah i hears it but you aint real likely to hire no white folks erasmus bared his teeth to show that was meant for a joke scipio dutifully smiled back his boss went on i hear what you say but you gots to have people working fo you job gits too big fo one man to do it all by hisself don want to play de buckra scipio made as if to crack a whip he might have been driving along a slave coffle in the days before manumission i hear black folks say that every now and again erasmus admitted but you tell me true nowi treat you like white folks treats niggers no scipio admitted had one fella he werent too bad but de rest he shook his head oglethorpe erasmus said scipio nodded in surprise he hadnt mentioned his earlier boss for quite a while erasmus owned a stubborn memory he continued i knows aurelius a bit he been waitin tables for john oglethorpe since dirt he says that there buckra a lot like me you work for him he dont give you no trouble he could do that too could scipio said mebbe could dunno dat i gots it in me to give no orders though not no way he hadnt even liked giving orders as a butler when anne colleton was the ultimate authority behind them doing it on his own hook no he wasnt sure about that at all well you dont want to do what you kin do thats your business erasmus said like i told you i aint sorry you works for me but you is wastin yourself you wants to know what i think how many negroes in the confederate states arent wasting themselves scipio wondered hed got himself an education as good as any white mans what could he do with it sound impressive as the butler at marshlands during the war now wait tables if hed tried to set up as a businessmannot in the sense erasmus meant but as an investor a capitalisthe would have been lucky if whites here only laughed at him more likely they would have lynched him and most blacks besides having whites hate them most blacks never got the education that would have let them make the most of their abilitiesthat would have let them discover what abilities they had and then whites called them stupid and inferior because they didnt succeed sometimes i reckons dem red niggers dey knew what dey was doin he said hed never dared say anything like that to erasmus before the older man studied him then slowly shook his head them reds they was about tearin down not buildin up tearin down dont do no good never has never will he sounded very certain before scipio could answer the days first customer came in a fat black man dripping rain from the brim of his homburg and from the hem of his rubberizedcotton raincoat bacon an a couple eggs over medium an grits an coffee he called to erasmus erasmus already had the eggs and bacon on the stove like i dont know what you has for breakfast sophocles he said reproachfully scipio poured coffee for sophocles and brought it to him as soon as erasmus had the rest of the mans breakfast ready he carried that over too half a dollar all told he said here yare sophocles slapped down sixty cents things is up a little from last year he remarked but only a little scipio said do jesus when dey was playin games wid de money breakfas cost you fifty million dollars maybe fifty billion dollars is powerful glad dey fix itdey pretty much fix it anyways sophocles and erasmus both nodded inflation had almost destroyed the csa how could anybody do business when money might lose half its value between the morning when you got it and the afternoon when you found a chance to spend it prices were higher now than they had been when the currency was restored the cs dollar didnt trade at par with its us counterpart but it was still close and didnt seem to be sinking very fast erasmus said the white folks dont go runnin to the freedom party fast as their legs can take em when their money worth somethin sophocles nodded again chewing a mouthful of bacon so did scipio de freedom party buckra dey scares me plenty he said dey wish we was all dead dey heps we along too case we don feel like dyin more nods more customers came in on such a miserable morning business was slower than usual scipio kept hopping even so when he wasnt carrying food out to hungry men and women he was washing dirty dishes or making fresh coffee or stirring the big pot of grits erasmus didnt let him do much real cooking but did give him jobs like that he also wrapped fish for people who didnt come in to eat there however much he did he would have felt like a fool complaining about it for erasmus did more erasmus worked harder than anybody hed ever seen save possibly john oglethorpe maybe their both owning their businesses had something to do with that erasmus certainly worked harder than any other black man scipio had ever seen and hed been born a slave hed spent more time in bondage than scipio had a lot of negroes still held to the slaves pace of labor doing just enough to satisfy an overseer even though they were free now erasmus worked to satisfy an overseer too but his lived inside his head he had a harsher straw boss than any cursing whipwielding tobaccochewing white man his boss whipped him on from within could i do that scipio wondered he had his doubts he wanted things done properly yes anne colleton had made sure to instill that into him but did he have the driving need to get things done even when he was the only one urging himself on hed rarely seen it in himself hed rarely had to look for it either if he ever got his own place hed have to after the breakfast rush such as it was eased erasmus put on a widebrimmed hat of no known make and a rain slicker mind the store a spell xerxes he said i gwine buy some more fish one of the boats was late and i reckon i kin git some prime deals on account of most folks aint comin back i do dat scipio said erasmus hurried out into the rain would i do the same scipio wondered he was honest enough to admit to himself he didnt know t he closing whistle shrilled in the toledo steel mill chester martin pushed his helmet up onto the top of his head he blinked against the glare as he hurried to clock out hed been looking at molten steel through smokedglass rectangles all day now he saw all the light there was to see it was almost too much to bear as he stuck his card in the time clock he spoke up to anyone whod listen election day today dont forget to vote dammit only way you should forget to vote is if you want the democrats back in powel house that made most of the men around him grin and wave and call out agreement socialists filled the toledo steel mills as they filled so many factories after the postwar strikes the socialist party had gained more ground than at any time since the s funny martin thought as he hurried out of the big building to catch a streetcar to his polling place and his home i saved teddy roosevelts life when he came into the trenches to see what the war was like well maybe i didi sure made him get down when the confederates started shelling us he had a letter from roosevelt written after he got wounded he intended to keep that letter forever but he was a socialist all the same a streetcar clanged to a stop that wasnt his route then the right one came he climbed aboard throwing five cents in the fare box a lot of the passengers looked like him tired grubby men in overalls and heavy shoes and collarless shirts and cloth caps he had sandy hair and a pointed nose to distinguish himself from most of the rest the odor of perspiration filled the streetcar even in november toledo factory workers had no trouble breaking a sweat the american flag flew in front of the elementary school that housed his polling place the new stars in the canton that represented kentucky and houston gave it a pattern he still hadnt got used to the polling place itself was in the school auditorium which was full of seats too small for grownup backsides martin smiled remembering the days when hed sat in chairs like that id never killed anybody then he thought and the smile slipped he had to wait in line to get his ballot lots of menand women who could vote in presidential elections in ohiolined up to get their ballots here you are the clerk said when he came to the front of the line take the first available voting booth he sounded bored how many times had he said those identical words since the polls opened this morning too many by all the signs a pretty woman a few years younger than chester martin pushed aside the curtain that kept her ballot secret and came out with the folded paper in her hand they did a little accidental dance each trying to get around the other and were laughing by the time she went past him and he made his way into the booth he voted quickly he put an x by the names of upton sinclair and hosea blackford then went on to vote for the other socialist candidates he wasnt altogether happy with the way the party had handled the canadian uprising had he been in charge of things he would have taken an even stronger line than president sinclair had why did we fight the war if we coddle the canucks once its done but the socialists were his party he was making good money and there were plenty of jobs he wasnt about to abandon the party over foreign policy he went down the line from congressman to state officials voting the straight ticket after hed finished he handed the clerk the ballot the fellow ceremoniously stuck it in the locked ballot box declaring chester martin has voted martin felt proud as if his vote had singlehandedly saved the country he knew how silly that was but couldnt help it he hurried out of the auditorium out of the school his familys flat was only four blocks away hed intended to walk it and save himself five cents but seeing the pretty woman at the streetcar stop made him change his mind did you vote for president sinclair he asked fumbling in his pocket for a nickel as a matter of fact i did she said that made him grin with relief he wouldnt have wanted much to do with a staunch democrat he didnt think he would anyhow she added hes the only one i could vote for of course i dont think thats right i dont either martin said more sincerely than otherwise my sister gets to vote for the first time today and thats all she gets to mark one square it really doesnt seem fair they chatted waiting for the streetcar he found out her name was rita habicht and that she was a typist for a company that made galvanized pipe he gave her his own name just when the trolley clattered up slow down he thought as it rattled along the tracks slow down dammit but it didnt in no time at all the streetcar got to his stop he let it start up again without getting off have you got a telephone he asked she hesitated then she took a scrap of paper from her handbag wrote on it and gave it to him here he tucked it into the front pocket of his overalls thanks he said ill call you he did leave at the next stop and had to walk most of a mile back in the direction from which hed come what took you so long his younger sister asked when he finally came through the door sue had a sharp nose much like his but her hair was brown not sandy without waiting for an answer she went on i got to vote it took forever but i got to vote shed been just too young at the last presidential election good for you sis chester gave her a hug i remember how that feltthe first time i mean what took you so long coming home sue asked again trolley went past the stop and i had to walk back he answered she looked at him it must have gone a long way past the stop for you to be as late as you are he could feel himself turning red his sister started to laugh youre blushing she exclaimed as she might have done when they were both children she wagged a saucy finger at him was she pretty he looked down at the carpet and at the woven flowers and birds hed seen every day for years without really looking at them well yeah he mumbled now sue stared youre not doing that just to drive me crazy she said you really did meet somebody i met her at the polling place matter of fact martin said we got to talking and we seemed to like each other all right and i got a telephone number from her will you call her sue asked id be a fool not to dont you think he answered the door opened behind him his father came into the flat what would you be a fool about this time chester stephen douglas martin asked he was an older version of his son also a steelworker and a man whod stubbornly remained a democrat id be a fool to think i could say anything without you making a crack about it chester replied his sister said he met a girl happens to a lot of people his father observed well to a lot of fellows anyhow he turned to chester come on boy tell me more who is she what does she do how did you meet her why didnt you tell me about it sooner how could i tell you about it sooner when it only just now happened martin asked in some irritation her names rita shes a typist i met her at the polling place there are you happy now i dont know his father looked as surprised as his sister had this all sounds pretty sudden oh for heavens sake chester said i didnt propose to her all i did was ask for her telephone number ask for whose telephone number his mother asked louisa martin had heard her husband come in where she hadnt heard her son she hurried out from the kitchen to give them both a peck on the cheek chester told the whole story over again for the third time by then hed started to feel as if it had happened to somebody else his mother exclaimed so did his father in chorus with her they sounded pleased and dubious at the same time at the supper table over a pork roast stuffed with cabbage his mother said it really is about time you settled down son and started raising a family of your own he rolled his eyes i havent even asked if she wants to go to a picture show with me and youve already got me married off you shouldnt rush into things with a girl you just met his father said he could have pointed out that he wasnt rushing into anything he could have but he didnt what point neither his father nor his mother would pay the least attention he was sure of that he changed the subject i wish we had one of those wireless machines then we could find out whos winning the election tonight without waiting for the morning paper theyre so expensive his mother said theyre less than they were last year chester said maybe theyll be still less next year or the year after that his mother said if they are maybe ill think about getting one but ive got better things to do with a few hundred dollars right now than to put them into a cabinet that sits there and makes noise all the time its not just noise mother sue said its music and people talking and all sorts of exciting things i think its nothing but a fad myself stephen douglas martin said after all once youve heard a band playing john philip sousa marches once how many more times are you going to want to you could hear something different the next time chester said yes but are there enough different new things to put on the wireless every hour of the day every day of the week every week of the year his father shook his head i dont think so since chester had no idea whether there would be or notand since he didnt think his father had any idea eitherhe didnt argue he said i could go over to the socialists hall and find out well if you want to his mother said her tone suggesting she would sooner he stayed in the end he did stay hed already put in a long hard day one made longer and harder by voting and by walking back to the flat after hed met rita habicht he went to sleep in his cramped little bedroom whenever he thought about how crowded things were he remembered three years of sleeping in the trenches sometimes under rain or snow compared to that this didnt look so bad in the morning newsboys hawked papers with big black headlines sinclair reelected they shouted out the same thing chester felt like cheering his father no doubt would be irate his father could lump it for all of him four more years to show the country what we can do he thought and went off to his own dangerous backbreaking job whistling a cheery tune c incinnatus driver was sure he was the happiest black man in des moines iowa des moines didnt have a whole lot of black men in it happy or otherwise but he would have bet he led the parade the reason he was a man with a song in his heart was simple hed just found the perfect christmas present for his son achilles the tin fire engine was a foot and a half long with rubber tires a ladder that went up almost a yard a bell that made a godawful racket and half a dozen lead firemen he was sure achilles who was nine would play with it not just for hours but for weeks grinning he carried it over to the clerk behind the cash register thatll be a dollar and ninetynine cents the woman said briskly here yare maam cincinnatus gave her two dollar bills his accent was softer than the sharp local english along with his family hed left covington kentucky not long after the war ended hed hoped hed left his troubles behind him so far his hopes looked like coming true heres your change the clerk handed him a penny she smiled i hope your little boy enjoys it thank you kindly maam cincinnatus smiled too he wouldnt have got so much politeness from a white woman in covington he might not have got it here either hed seen thatsome places they wouldnt sell him things till they saw his money but on the whole negroes didnt have too hard a time in des moines they were thin enough on the ground here to be reckoned a novelty not a menace still smiling cincinnatus took the fire engine out to his truck the machine was a beatup white of great war vintage cincinnatus had driven such snorting beasts all through kentucky and down into tennessee during the war in the service of the us army now he worked on his own behalfand a white made in or was by the end of something less than it had been he didnt care the truck was a lot better than the spavined duryea hed driven from covington to des moines it held a lot he was able to make a good many repairs on it himself hed had practice and when he couldnt fix the truck hed found a mechanic who was both cheap and competent an immigrant from italy for whom a black man was but one wonder of a wonderfilled america he cranked the engine to get it to turn over one of these days im going to put a selfstarter in this machine hed had that thought before too but the motor hadnt had a chance to cool down so cranking it was easy he got behind the wheel trod on the clutch put the truck in gear and drove off night fell as he made his way to the northwestern side of town the white was of recent enough vintage to have electric headlights and not acetylene lamps he could turn them on from the cabin and didnt have to get out and fiddle with matches the truck wheezed to a stop in front of the apartment building where his family lived the motor shook and coughed a couple of times after he took out the ignition key then fell silent he got out wrapping the toy fire engine in some burlap he carried it into the building in the lobby joey chang who ran a laundry and whose family lived on the floor above cincinnatus nodded to him and said hello hello joey he answered doing his best to hide a smile the chinaman seemed as exotic to him as a mere negro did to an italian immigrant there might have been a couple of chinese in covington back when it was part of the csa on the other hand there might not have too hed never eaten chop suey before coming to des moines he liked chinese food it was cheap and good and something out of the ordinary as soon as he walked into his own flat cincinnatus was glad hed camouflaged the fire engine because achilles sat at the kitchen table doing homework the boy pointed what you got pa none o your business get back to work cincinnatus answered back in covington before the war thered been no public schools for negroes finding school not only present but required in des moines had made a lot of the hardships in uprooting his family worthwhile wagging a finger at achilles he went on i had to sneak around to learn my letters you got help i expect you to take advantage of it i am pa his son said but you still havent told me what you got there achilles accent was an odd mix of kentucky and iowa cincinnatus knew he would have said aint told me himself he also knew that was wrong but it seemed natural to him in a way it didnt to the boy he went into the kitchen where elizabeth had a beef tongue boiling in a pot with potatoes and carrots and with some cloves that gave the air a spicy smell she too pointed to the burlapwrapped toy whats that cincinnatus showed herthe fire engine wasnt for her after all her eyes widened she nodded he said you got a place in here where we can hide this till the day right here she opened a cabinet and pointed to a top shelf he stood on tiptoe to push the fire engine back as far as he could that done he gave her a kiss she smiled as if to say something might come of that later on then amanda toddled into the kitchen and wrapped her arms around his shins dada she said hard to believe she was a year and a half old now above her head cincinnatus and elizabeth exchanged wry tired grins something might not come of elizabeths inviting smile too before amanda was born cincinnatus had forgotten perhaps mercifully how much of a handful a baby in the house was shed reminded him though oh i almost forgot elizabeth said we got us a letter today a letter cincinnatus said in surprise who from mostalmost allthe mail they got was either bills or advertising circulars only a few people they knew either friends or relatives could read and write for that matter elizabeth could hardly read and write herself till achilles started going to school she hadnt even known the abcs but hed taught her some of what hed learned now she said it came from covington i know that but i cant make out who sent it and i didnt open it up didnt reckon i could cipher it out myself and i didnt know if it was anything achilles ought to see you know what i mean sure do cincinnatus looked in the icebox and took out a bottle of beer iowa was a dry state that took being dry seriously the beer was unofficial illegal homebrew made by mr chang upstairs till he came to des moines cincinnatus hadnt know that chinamen drank beer let alone made it themselves as he yanked the cork out of the bottle he said why dont you let me have a look at it now i do that she said when she left the kitchen her skirt swirled showing off her ankles and several inches of shapely calf shed finally given in to what everyone else was wearing these days cincinnatus thought the new styles risque but that didnt keep him from looking on the contrary she brought back the envelope here sure enough it bore a covington postmark cincinnatus tried to puzzle out the return address but couldnt he took a clasp knife from his pocket and opened the envelope looking up from the letter he asked elizabeth you recollect a fellow name of hadrian moved next door to my folks a little after the war ended she thought then nodded believe i do never had nothin much to do with him though how come whats he say says pas sick mighty sick maybe fixintodie sick cincinnatus wished hed never got the letter he went on says ma asked him to write me get me to come back down there fore pa goes tears blurred his vision his father wasnt an old man but anybody could take sick mama livia she cant very well write you her own self elizabeth said that was true cincinnatus mother and his father seneca were both illiterate theyd grown up as slaves back in the days when teaching a negro his letters was against the law i know cincinnatus took a long pull at the beer bottle wishing it were something stronger he read the letter again as if expecting it to say something different the second time around that was foolish but who wasnt foolish sometimes what you gwine do elizabeth asked i got to go cincinnatus said we got enough money to pull through if im gone a week or two they had more money than that even after hed bought the bigger truck hed always salted away as much as he could even when kentucky was still a confederate state hed done his best to get ahead and his best had been about as good as a negros could be in the csa elizabeth nodded all right you take the truck or you ride a train train he answered hadrian he say to wire him when i come an hell meet me at the station he finished his beer in a couple of big gulps wish he wouldve wired me i be there by now he sighed letters cheaper i reckon what can you do i say prayers sunday an every night for your father elizabeth said papa seneca hes a nice man yeah cincinnatus said tonelessly as people will hed come to take his father for granted the idea that the older man might not be there forevermight not be there for very much longerhit him hard and all the harder because it caught him by surprise everything had been going so well everything still wasfor him but with his father sick that didnt matter any more there was a western union office in the des moines train station cincinnatus sent hadrian a telegram from there a couple of hours later he boarded an eastbound train a crow flying from des moines to covington would have gone about six hundred miles the train took a longer route and took its own sweet time getting there it seemed to stop at every worthless little town along the way too cincinnatus stared out the window now and then drumming his fingers on his trouser leg in impatience on a train in the csa the attendants would have been black men here they were almost all foreigners of one sort or another they muttered things about cincinnatus that he couldnt understand but he didnt think any of them were compliments the confederates had dropped the old railroad bridge from cincinnati to covington into the ohio when the great war broke out the train rattled over its replacement in the wee small hours cincinnatus yawned and knuckled his eyes he hadnt slept a wink he hoped his father was still breathing he had no trouble spotting hadrian his familys neighbor was the only negro waiting on the platform he didnt look to have slept much either ccome along with me he said cincinnatus didnt remember him stammering he had a nervous tic under one eye too no sooner had they got off the platform than four big toughlooking white men in plain clothes surrounded them you fuckin bastard cincinnatus exclaimed he knew hed been betrayedhe just didnt know to whom yet hadrian miserably hung his head what had these people done or threatened to get him to write that letter they all piled into a big oldsmobile when it stopped in front of the city hall cincinnatus knew who had him it didnt make him feel any betterworse in fact come along boy one of the whites snapped hed probably been a cop in the days when covington belonged to the csa however unwillingly cincinnatus went the man waiting for him inside gave him a smile that might have come from a hunting hound his luminous yellowbrown eyes strengthened the resemblance howdy cincinnatus luther bliss said been a while hasnt it the head of the kentucky state policethe kentucky secret policedidnt wait for an answer he turned to cincinnatus hardfaced escorts and spoke three words lock him up e very once in a while nellie jacobs would take her order of remembrance out of its velvet box and look at it she didnt wear it muchwhere would a woman who ran a coffee shop in washington dc have occasion to wear the usas highest civilian decoration the last time shed put it on was for teddy roosevelts funeral roosevelt had presented the medal to her with his own hands hed given nellies daughter edna a medal too but hers was only second class not first she didnt know she was being a spy nellie thought lord she wouldnt have cared if the confederates held washington forever it was funny if you looked at it the right way the eagle on the order of remembrance stared fiercely back at her of course roosevelt hadnt known the whole story any more than edna had roosevelt hadnt known shed stuck a knife into bill reach the us spymaster in washington nobody knew that nobody but nellie not even her husband knew and hal jacobs had reported directly to reach he had it coming the filthy son of a bitch nellie muttered it wasnt that bill reach had been a drunkard though he had but hed also been a lecher and in his younger days a man whod hadand paid forassignations with nellie hed thought he could keep on having them too if he just slapped down the cash nellies long oval face settled into the lines of disapproval it had worn so often since shed escaped the demimonde shows how much he knew she thought shed fought hard for respectability she hadnt been about to throw it away for a drunken bastard and his red throbbing prick one of the things she liked about her husband was that he didnt trouble her in the bedroom very often old men have their advantages her mouth twisted youre no spring chicken yourself she thought shed turned fifty earlier in the year she felt every year of her age too it wasnt so much that she was going gray though she was that aside she looked a good deal younger than her years but keeping up with a fouryearold would have made anybody feel her years as if the thought of clara were enough to make her get into mischief she called ma help me tie my shoe im coming nellie said her back twinged when she got off her bed clara couldnt tie her shoes yet sometimes she insisted on trying anyhow fouryearolds were nothing if not independent that they drove their parents mad never once crossed their minds of course that was part of their charm im going to go out and play clara declared when nellie hurried into her bedroom not yet youre not nellie surveyed the damage oh child what have you gone and done actually the damage itself left little room for doubt clara had put her shoes on the wrong feet and then tied as many knots as she could in the shoelaces she couldnt manage a bow but knots she had no trouble with the shoes came up well over her ankles they were almost boots and fit snugly even before clara created her knotty problem nellie couldnt even get the shoes off her daughter till she untied someseveralof the knots clara didnt want to hold still for the process fouryearolds didnt hold still unless they were asleep or coming down with something nellie asked her twice not to squirm that failing she swatted claras bottom her daughter squalled but then did hold still for a little while it was nellie decided long enough it was at any rate long enough for her to get the shoes on their proper feet and tie a couple of bows play on the sidewalk in front of the shop here nellie warned dont you go out in the street im going to come downstairs and keep an eye on you if you even go near the street youll get a spanking like youll never forget no youll get twoone from me and one from your pa i promise ma clara solemnly crossed her heart hope to die no its so you dont die nellie thought but clara wouldnt have had the faintest idea what she was talking about lets go downstairs nellie said clara took her favorite toy a rag doll named louise and went down to the ground floor at what nellie would have reckoned a suicidal pace nellie followed more sedately nellie turned away for a moment to get a whisk broom and a dust pan the coffee shop was closed on sundays of course washingtons blue laws were as strict as any in the usa but the more cleaning she did now the less she would have to worry about come monday morning when shed also be busy brewing coffee frying eggs and ham and bacon and potatoes toasting bread and serving her customers her door might be shut but she didnt reckon sunday a day of rest before nellie had taken more than three steps brakes screeched out in the street metal crumpled glass tinkled musically it reminded her of artillery bombardments during the war but wasnt so dramatic or it wouldnt have been oh god in heaven nellie said and dashed outside clara she shouted where are you clara no answer fear rising in her like the tide nellie stared at the accident a ford and a packard had locked horns the ford predictably was the loser steam gushed from its ruptured radiator its driver descended to the street holding a handkerchief to his head which hed bloodied when he greeted his windshield face first clara nellie called again dear god please the last time shed prayed had been during the us artillery barrage that nearly leveled washington before the confederates finally sullenly drew back into virginia god must have heard that prayershed come through alive but everything back then seemed small and unimportant when set against her daughters safety clara the grayhaired man whod been driving the packard had to kick at his door before it would open he didnt seem badly hurt and started shouting at the other man you idiot you moron you thumbfingered baboon fuck you grandpa the man with the bloodied face replied you drove right into me liar liar yourself neither one of them said anything about a little girl and neither one of them paid any attention to nellie clara she called once more she didnt want to look closely at the accident for fear she would see little legs sticking out from under a wheel clara boo nellie sprang a foot in the air there stood her daughter coming out from behind the stout iron base of a street lamp thank you jesus nellie whispered she ran to her little girl and held her tight fooled you mama clara said happily i got down there and ow nellie applied her hand to the part on which her daughter was in the habit of sitting much harder than she had before they went outside clara started to howl whats that for mama i didnt do nothing oh yes you did nellie said and spanked her again you scared me out of a years growth thats what you did i was afraid one of those cars ran over you do you know that clara at the moment knew nothing except that her fanny hurt she tried to get away and had no luck whatsoever nellie dragged her back into the coffee shop louise clara wailed although nellie was tempted to leave the doll out on the sidewalk that would have cost more tears and hysterics than it was worth she snarled you stay here dont move a muscle at clara and then went back to retrieve louise she all but threw the rag doll at her daughter here thank you mama clara said in an unwontedly small voice she hadnt moved a muscle and evidently had figured out this was no time to say or do anything that might land her in more trouble when nellies husband came back from a friends later that morning nellie told him the whole story clara looked at him in silent appeal he was often softer than her mother but not this time hal jacobs sighed wuffling out his white mustache clara you must not play games like that he said your mother thought you were hurt maybe even killed im sorry pa clara said maybe she even meant it she seemed more inclined to be good for hal than she was for nellie she takes after her half sister nellie thought sourly edna had always done what she wanted not what nellie wanted shed taken great pleasure in flaunting it too and shed married well in spite of everything when she came to visit as the sun was setting she wore a maroon silk dress that daringly showed her legs halfway to her knees nellie whod had a really gamy past had spent more than thirty years trying to live it down edna in keeping with young people everywhere these daysor so it seemed to nellieflaunted her fast life be good armstrong she told her son armstrong grimesednas husband merle came from the same town in michigan as general custerwas two only a couple of years younger than clara his aunt having told him to be good edna let him run wildthat seemed to be her idea of how to raise children how are you dear nellie asked pouring edna a cup of coffee couldnt be better ma edna answered expansively she looked like a twenty years younger version of her mother but without the pinched anxious expression nellie so often wore she still thought she could beat the game of life nellie was convinced nobody could but edna had her reasons she went on merle just got himself promoted in the reconstruction agency thats another forty dollars a month and youd best believe itll come in handy bully nellie said meaning perhaps a third of it shed had to fret and scrape for every dime she ever madeshed had to do worse things than fret and scrape for some of the dimes shed made before edna was born as far as she could see her daughter had things easy but didnt begin to guess how lucky she was before edna could go on bragging a shriek rose from the direction of the kitchen ma clara squealed armstrong just pulled my hair ma edna laughed nellie didnt well pull his back she said her older daughter bristled a moment later armstrong grimes started to cry then clara shrieked again ma he bit me you going to tell her to bite him back too edna asked nellie glared children whether four or thirty could drive you right out of your mind r eggie bartlett was a firstrate weather prophet he looked at his boss and said reckon itll rain tomorrow jeremiah harmon looked up from the pills he was compounding shoulder kicking up again the druggist asked sure is bartlett answered leg too matter of fact i took me a couple of aspirins but they dont shift the ache hed spent the end of the war in a us military hospital after catching two bullets from a machinegun burst and getting captured down in sequoyah the wounds had finally healed but their memory lingered on wouldnt surprise me if you were right harmon added a little water to his mix and put it in a twentypill mold he swung the hinged top of the mold into place there we go thesell make somebody piss like a racehorse ive heard that one a million times how do racehorses piss reggie asked and then before his boss could he answered his own question pretty damn quick i bet jeremiah harmon snorted youve always got a snappy comeback dont you i do my best bartlett answered he had an engaging grin one that let him say things a dour man could never have got away with the bell over the front door jangled a customer came in help you with something sir reggie asked yes thanks chilly out there the man came up to the counter bartlett wished he hadnt his breath was so dreadful he might not have used a toothbrush since before the great war maybe if god were kind hed ask about one now or about mouthwash but no such luck he said what have you got in the way of rat poison you could breathe on them reggie thought thatd do the job the way the yankees chlorine killed the rats in the trenches on the roanoke front no matter how engaging his grin though he knew he couldnt get away with that life in richmond was too civilized for such blunt truths here let me look he said and pulled up a bright yellow box with an upsidedown rat with xs for eyes on the front of it this ought to do the job itll shift em will it the man asked breathing decay into reggies face sure will sir reggie drew back as far as he could which wasnt nearly far enough rats mice even cockroaches you put it down they eat it and they die reckon i can manage that the customer dug a hand in his pocket coins jingled how much twentytwo cents bartlett said the man gave him a quarter he solemnly returned three pennies thanks the fellow put them in his pocket he took the box of rat poison and headed out the door freedom without waiting for an answer he left the drugstore reggies boss looked up from the pills which he was removing from the mold you showed fine patience there he said i dont know if i could have done the same i could smell him all the way over here you could give a man like that a straight flush in a poker game and hed still find a way to lose bartlett said no wonder hes a freedom party man his money is as good as anyone elses harmon said in fact you can gloat if you like because his moneys going into my pocket and into yours and neither one of us can stand jake featherston were not fools i hope to god were not fools anyway reggie answered the only thing featherston can do is make a speech that sounds good if youre a sorry soandso who cant add six and five without taking off your shoes im not going to try to tell you youre wrongyou ought to know that harmon looked at the clock on the wall just about quitting time why dont you knock off a couple of minutes early call it a bonus for the way you dealt with that fellow thank you kindly i dont mind if i do bartlett put on his coat and his fedora ill see you in the morning see you then jeremiah harmon was busy making more pills reggie sometimes wondered if he ever went home at night the man with slittrench breath had been right it was chilly outside bartlett wished hed brought along a pair of earmuffs as he hurried toward the trolley stop a couple of blocks away he went past some posters that hadnt been pasted to a half ruinous wall when he walked by it on the way to work that morning vote freedom in they shouted in red letters on a white background below that in smaller type they added jake featherston talks straight every wednesday on the wireless the truth shall set you free and when will you ever hear the truth from that son of a bitch reggie muttered hed heard jake featherston on the stump in the very earliest days of the freedom party he hadnt liked what he heard then and he hadnt liked anything hed heard from featherston or the freedom party since only difference is featherston was a little snake then and hes a big snake now bartlett thought but even a big snake could lose some hide now and then reggie hooked his fingernails under the top of one of those posters and yanked as hed hoped most of it tore away the fellows whod hung the posters had done a fast job a cheap job but not a good one they hadnt used enough paste to stick them down tight whistling dixie he ripped down one poster after another he hadnt got all of them though before a raucous voice shouted hey you bastard what the hell you think youre doing taking down lies reggie answered calmly them aint lies the man said he was about reggies age but shabby scrawny still wearing a threadbare butternut uniform tunic that had seen a lot of better years veterans down on their luck swelled the ranks of the freedom party this one snarled you touch another one o them posters and ill beat the living shit out of you you dont want to try that buddy bartlett said down came another poster the shabby veteran howled with rage and trotted toward him thanks to the wounds reggie had taken in sequoyah he wasnt much good either at fisticuffs or running away hed had runins with freedom party men before too during the war a had been an officers weapon nothing to speak of when set against the tredegar rifles most ordinary soldiers carried these days the in a hidden holster on reggies belt put him in mind of an extra ace up his sleeve he took it out and pointed it at the onrushing wouldbe tough guy his twohanded grip said he knew exactly what to do with it too the freedom party man skidded to a stop in the middle of the street so abruptly that he flailed his arms and rocked back on his heels the barrel of the had to look the size of a railroad tunnel as reggie aimed it at his midriff i told you you dont want to try that reggie said youll pay for this the scruffy veteran said everybodys gonna pay for fucking with us youre going on a list you he decided not to do any more cussing running your mouth at a man with a pistol when you didnt have one of your own wasnt the smartest thing you could do even a freedom party muscle man could figure that out get lost bartlett told him he gestured with the to emphasize the words go on down to the corner there turn it and keep walking you do anything else youll be holding up a lily face working with all the things he dared not say the other man did as he was told bartlett finished tearing down the posters then went on to the trolley stop his only worry was that the freedom party man had a weapon of his own one he hadnt had a chance to use but the fellow had talked about beating him up not shooting him and he didnt reappear up came the trolley bell clanging reggie tossed a dime into the fare box and took a seat the dime should have been five cents prices werent quite what they had been before the war but they werent what they had been afterwards eitherhe wasnt paying a million dollars or a billion for the privilege of riding across town to his flat nobody on the trolley car had the slightest idea who he was or what hed just done that suited him fine too he had a chance to relax a little and look out the window before long the trolley passed more of those vote freedom in posters reggies lip curled he couldnt rip them all down however much he wished he could seven and a half years after the great war ended not all the destruction us aeroplanes had visited on richmond was yet repaired plenty of burntout and bombed building fronts stared at the street through window frames naked of glass they might have been so many skulls peering out through empty eye sockets the damnyankees made my home town into golgotha bartlett thought one of these days well have to pay them back but how he shivered though the crowded trolley was warm with humanity that was how the freedom party thought and how it got its members havent you had enough of war he asked himself asked that way he could hardly say no he got off at the shop nearest his flat for supper he fried up a ham steak and some potatoes after he did the disheshe was a fussy neat bachelorhe read for a while and went to bed he wouldnt have minded a wireless set so he could listen to music or a football game but not on the salary of a druggists assistant the next day did bring a chilly drizzle work at the drugstore went much as the previous day had he didnt bother telling his boss about the fuss over the posters jeremiah harmon had no use for the freedom party no but reggie didnt want him fussing like a mother hen which was just what he would have done hey you somebody called to reggie when he walked to the trolley stop that evening it was the veteran hed quarreled with he wore a disreputable hat to keep the rain off his face his hand went to the told you i didnt want you bothering me he said no bother pal the fellow said he pasted on a smile as he came up to bartlett and he made sure he kept his hands in plain sight weve all got to live and let live aint that right reggie stared thats not how you talked yesterday he said his voice hard with suspicion whats wrong with you now not a thing the freedom party man said i just got a little hasty is all you went through some of the things i did youd get hasty too i went through plenty myself bartlett said you want to go through it again thats what that damn featherstons got in mind no pal you dont understand at all the veteran said he still had on the same ancient tunic hed worn the evening before noticing that reggie didnt notice the footsteps coming up behind him till they stopped that made him notice and made him start to turn his pistol coming out of the holster too late he heard three shots two slugs hammered him in the chest the next thing he knew he was on the ground reaching for the that had fallen from his fingers the veteran scooped it up nice piece he said and then grinning freedom reggie heard him as if from far away and further every moment he didnt hear the man and his friend running away at all or anything else ever again t hree guards came up to cincinnatus drivers cell two of them stood in the corridor their pistols aimed at his midsection the third opened the cell door come along he said where you takin me cincinnatus asked that aint none o your business boy the guard snapped for all the world as if kentucky were still part of the csa not the usa come along you hear yes suh cincinnatus got up off his cot and came hed quickly learned how far he could go with these guards before they stopped talking and started persuading him by other means one beating had been plenty to drive the lesson home not just the beating itself but how much they enjoyed giving it to him if they ever decided to beat him to death they would do it with smiles on their faces hands behind your back the guard told him he obeyed the guard clicked handcuffs onto his wrists they were cruelly tight but cincinnatus kept his mouth shut about that too complaining just got them tightened more the guards marched him along the corridor he recognized some of the men sitting or lying in their cells some black like him were reds others whites were men whod been confederate diehards during the war and probably belonged to the freedom party nowadays maybe some of the other prisoners recognized him too if so no one gave a sign this way one of the guards told him they led him across the exercise yard he normally saw for an hour a week down another corridor and into an office a tall backless stool sat in front of the desk luther bliss sat behind it the guards slammed cincinnatus down on the stool hard here we are again the head of the kentucky state police said yes suh cincinnatus said i want a lawyer suh he hadnt tried that one in a while the worst the other man could tell him was no bliss smile never touched his huntingdog eyes if you was still in des moines maybe you could have one he answered but this heres kentucky and the rules are different here this is one of the reclaimed states and we arent about to put up with treason or rebellion you mess around with that stuff and you get caught we take care of you our own way i wasnt messin around with nothin here cincinnatus said bitterly i was just livin my life up in iowa till you got that sorry hadrian nigger to write that lyin letter to get me down here in the first place you call that fair suh i had you once before luther bliss replied in meditative tones i had you and i was going to squeeze you and teddy roosevelt made me turn you loose he made me pay you a hundred dollars out of my own pocket too i have a long memory for these things cincinnatus cincinnatus hadnt forgotten that either though bliss hadnt mentioned it till now do jesus mr bliss you want your hundred dollars back ill pay it to you just let me wire my wife an bliss shook his head i get paid back with interest ill pay you interest i got the money i done pretty good for myself up there i dont want your money i get paid back my kind of interest he was what he was his kind of interest involved pain and misery that was what he dished out that was what the people who told him what to do wanted him to dish out if every once in a while he dished them out to people who didnt really deserve them the people who told him what to do probably didnt mind they might even figure he deserved a little fun on the job like a hunting dog taking a scent luther bliss leaned forward enough chitchat about time we get down to business i reckon before cincinnatus could brace himself one of the guards slapped him in the face he tumbled off the stool and also banged his funny bone on the floor as he fell whyd he do that mr bliss he said slowly climbing to his feet i aint done nothin to nobody you lie everyone lies luther bliss sounded sad but certain policemen got used to people lying to them maybe they even got to where they expected it secret policemen probably heard and expected even more lies than any other kind bliss pointed to the stool sit your nigger ass back down cincinnatus you got to tell the truth when i ask my questions you didnt ask me no questions cincinnatus said reproachfully joe there he jus hauled off an hit me thats for all the lies youve already told me and to remind you not to tell me any more luther bliss answered again his smile never reached his eyes you ought to be thankful weve gone easy on you so far easy cincinnatus exclaimed he damn near knocked my head off a few months in jailand years of sparring before thenhad given him and the secret policeman an odd sort of camaraderie he could up to a point speak his mind without making luther bliss any more likely to do something dreadful to him bliss nodded now he just thumped you a bit worse weve done weve beaten you up that aint so much of a much cincinnatus believe you me it aint its a new age were livin in electricitys everywhere you take an ordinary car battery and some wires and you clip em to a mans ears or to the skin of his belly or maybe to his privates cincinnatus didnt want to show fear but his mouth went dry at the thought of electricity trickling through his balls would he ever be able to get it up again after something like that please jesus dont let me find out meditatively bliss went on other nice thing about that is it doesnt leave any marks you niggers dont show bruises as much as a white man would but even so he leaned forward i reckon you already told me everything you know about kennedy and conroy and the rest of those goddamn diehards mr bliss i done sung like a canary bout them bastards there cincinnatus spoke the truth he owed no loyalty to the white men whod done all they could to help the confederate cause in kentucky they might have killed him or betrayed him to us authorities but theyd had no great hold on his loyalty as far as he could see any negro who backed the confederates from anything but compulsion was some kind of idiot the secret policeman pointed to him youre still holding out though when it comes to apicius and the rest of the reds like calls to like just like the diehards you coons stick together do jesus how can i know what theyre up to when i moved away years ag cincinnatus got that far before the guard belted him again this time he was braced for it and didnt fall off the stool he tasted blood in his mouth you dont expect me to believe anything like that do you luther bliss sounded sad like a preacher contemplating sinful mankind i aint stupid cincinnatus no matter what you think i never reckoned you was again cincinnatus told the exact truth fear of bliss had helped him decide to leave kentucky but hed never thought the other man was dumb just the opposite he didnt care to live under bliss magnifying glass for the rest of this days living under his thumb though was even worse you get letters you know whats going on here the secret policeman said not hardly cincinnatus told him dont hardly know that many folks what can read an write you keepin tabs on me all the time like i reckon you been doin you know thats true for a moment he thought hed got through to bliss the mans eyes narrowed he looked thoughtful but then a moment before he spoke cincinnatus realized he was playing a part he was building up hope in his captive only to dash it well sonny so what long as youre here youll pay for everything you done anyways cincinnatus would have been more devastated if hed had more hope to lose he wanted to tell bliss where to head in a couple of times back in the days when he was still free he had told bliss where to head in hed enjoyed it mightily then too but he was paying for it now what you got to tell me about them reds luther bliss asked now i done told you everything i ever knew cincinnatus answered it wasnt quite true but he didnt think bliss knew that he did know what was coming next it came joe and the other guards got to work on him they enjoyed what they did yes but not to the point of getting carried away and doing him permanent harm they were in their way professionals it went on for a very long painful time what hurt most of all though was a casual remark bliss made halfway through the torment you might as well sing by god it isnt like anybody on the outside gives a damn about what happens to one miserable nigger in a kentucky jail at last the beating stopped the guards dragged cincinnatus back to his cell he probably could have walked he made himself out to be weaker and hurt worse than he really was maybe that made them go a little easier on him than they would have otherwise on the other hand maybe it didnt do a single goddamn thing see you next time boy joe said as his pal undid the manacles from cincinnatus wrists cincinnatus lay on his cot like a dead man had luther bliss sent for him more often he would have been a dead man in short order maybe bliss didnt want to kill him right away maybe on the other hand the secret policeman was taking so many different vengeances he wasnt in a hurry about finishing off any one of them it isnt like anybody on the outside gives a damn about what happens to one miserable nigger in a kentucky jail in a way that was a lie cincinnatus knew as much elizabeth cared achilles cared amanda cared but what could they do they were black too black in a white mans country nobody who could do anything cared about cincinnatus that burned like acid it would keep on burning long after the pain of this latest beating eased too he ran his tongue over his teeth so far the goons had broken only one hed taken no new damage there today they hadnt done anything to him this time that wouldnt fade in a couple of weeks in the meantime in the meantime its gonna hurt and aint nothin you can do about it a cart squeaked up the corridor supper trays cincinnatus wondered if hed be able to eat you better you got to stay strong a redheaded white man shoved a tray of something that smelled greasy into cincinnatus cell the fellow wore the same sort of uniform as the guards whod beaten him in a low voice the redhead said freedom cincinnatus suppressed a groan just what he neededsomebody with diehard sympathies mocking him i ought to report you you bastard luther blissd make you pay but then the fellow went on well get you out he pushed the cart away cincinnatus stared after him did he mean that and if he did whose side was he really on americanempire thecentercannothold iv a nother trip down to washington flora blackford preferred philadelphia and didnt care who knew it but she was willing to excuse the trip to the formal capital of the usa for one reason so her husband could for the second time take the oath of office as vice president of the united states now we think about she told him as the pullman car rattled south from philadelphia then she shook her head no thats not right we should have been thinking about since the minute we won last november hosea blackfords smile showed amusementand she was glad to see ambition too i dont know about you flora he said but i have been thinking about it since the minute we won last november and a while before that too when i first saw what the office was i didnt think i could do much with it or go any further ive changed my mind though good flora said you should have and youd better think about it you can be president of the united states you really can that wouldnt be too bad for a boy off a dakota farm would it he said you always hear talk about such things any mothers son can grow up to be president thats what people say having the chance to make it come true though of course if you thought being president was the most important thing in the world you never should have married me flora tried to keep her tone light other people would be saying the same thing much more pointedly in the years to come she was as sure of that as she was of her own name a presidential candidate with a jew for a wife unheard of how many votes would it cost him that has occurred to me hosea blackford said slowly it couldnt very well not have occurred to me but then i decided that if i had to choose between the two i would rather spend the rest of my life with you than be president so ill take my chances and the country can take its flora stared at him then she kissed him one thing led to another the run from philadelphia down to washington wasnt a very long one especially not when traveling on president sinclairs express they barely had time to get dressed again and set their clothes to rights before the train came in to union station its a good thing you dont have to wrestle with a corset the way you would have before the war hosea said adjusting his necktie in the mirror dont speak of such thingsyou dont know what youre talking about flora answered the only thing i can think of is whoever put women in corsets must have hated us especially in summertime a corset on a hot summer day she shuddered well you wouldnt have had to worry about the heat today her husband looked out the window the snows still coming down march is late in the year for a snowstorm flora said i wonder if what people say is true that the weathers been peculiar since the great war and that it made the weather peculiar hosea blackford laughed back in dakota i would have said may was late for a snowstorm but nothing sooner than that if you ask me the weathers always peculiar i have a suspicion its peculiar because its peculiar too and not because we made it that way i cant prove that but its what i think the weathers bigger than anything we can do even the great war i hope youre right she said on the platform a military band blared away flora didnt care for that it wasnt a proper socialist symbol even if it was a symbol of the presidency but if president sinclair wanted itand he didshe could hardly complain people called her the conscience of the congress but this wasnt a question of conscienceonly one of taste a limousine whisked the president and his wife to the white house another one brought the blackfords there the journey took only a few minutes when flora saw the washington monument she pointed its taller than it was when we came down here for roosevelts funeral you can really tell her husband nodded before president sinclairs term is up itll be back to its full height no mark on the sides to show how much of it the confederates knocked down either i think thats good so do i flora agreed no matter what the democrats say there can be such a thing as too much remembrance yes hosea sighed some people just cant see that why anyone would want to remember all the horror we went through during the great war well its beyond me beyond me too flora said try not to get into an argument with my brother tomorrow i wont argue if david doesnt her husband said ill try not to argue even if he does david hamburger had lost a leg in the last year of the war in spite of thator maybe because of ithed gone from socialist to conservative democrat since having paid so much he couldnt wouldnt believe that payment hadnt been worthwhile during president sinclairsand vice president blackfordsfirst inauguration flora had been a congresswoman yes but she hadnt been blackfords wife and hadnt been fully swept up into the social whirl surrounding the occasion now she went from one reception to another she found it more wearing than enjoyable when she said as much hosea blackford laughed are you sure youre a new york jew and not one of those gloomy protestants from new england no matter what they say theres nothing in the bible against having a good time i didnt say there was flora answered but it all seems soexcessive oh is that all youre worrying about hosea laughed again of course its excessive thats the point of it she gave him a disapproving look im sure louis xvi said the same thing just before the french revolution not fair hosea said maybe not flora didnt want to argue with her husband any more than she wanted him quarreling with her brother but she wasnt altogether convinced either she found believing him easier when inauguration day came when the socialists won the election in electricity had filled the air the democrats had dominated us politics since the election of some people had feared proletarian revolution some had looked for it it hadnt come politics had gone on as usualthe same song but in a different key flora supposed that was a good thing she still sometimes had a sense of opportunity missed though this second socialist inauguration seemed different now no one acted astonished the day had ever come people took it for granted in fact flora didnt know whether that was good or bad either she did know that up on the reviewing stand in front of the white house she wondered if shed freeze to death before her husband and president sinclair took the oaths of office for their second terms but having her family up on the stand with her made up for a lot her older sister sophies son yossel was very big nowhe was almost ten hed never seen his father whod been killed in action before he was born flora had hardly seen her younger sister esthers new husband a clerk named meyer katz she was also startled at how gray her parents were getting she wished her brother david hadnt worn his soldiers circle pin with a sword through the year of his conscription class only reactionaries did but he wore his purple heart next to it that and the stick he used and the slow rolling gait of a man who made do with an artificial leg after an abovetheknee amputation meant no one near him said a word about it his younger brother isaac had gone through his turn in the army after the great war his tour had been quiet uneventful he didnt wear a pin on his lapel in president sinclairs second inaugural address he talked about justice for the working man oldage pensions and getting along with our neighbors on this great continent the first two drew fierce applause from the crowd the third rather less memories of the war are still too fresh hosea blackford said when all the speeches and parades were over in another ten years people will look more kindly on the confederate states not everyone will david hamburger said he was only a tailor talking to the vice president of the united states but he spoke his mind his brotherinlaw frowned they were going to argue after all would you want your children to go through what you did do you think the confederates are mad enough to want their children to go through it again i hope theres never a war again flora said i hope the same thing david answered but hoping there wont be and staying ready in case there is are two different animals wed do better if wed made a just peace not the harsh one teddy roosevelt forced the csa to swallow hosea blackford said and were still trying to figure out what to do with canada you try giving away anything roosevelt won and youll lose the next election quicker than you ever thought you could david said i dont think so flora said if we arent a just nation what are we a strong one i hope her brother answered they eyed each other they both used english but they didnt speak the same language no one questioned the socialist partys agenda at any of the inaugural banquets and balls that night even the democratic congressmen and senators who made their appearance were smiling and polite they wouldnt show their teeth till congress went back into session up in philadelphia flora was just as well pleased to return to the de facto capital over the past eight years it had become home to her her husband teased her as the train pulled into broad street station youll be busier than i will the vice presidents main job is growing moss on his north side you knew that when you accepted the nomination the first time flora said he nodded well yes even so these past four years have really rammed it home but flora had trouble charging into the new session as she was used to doing she found herself sleepy all the time without the energy she usually took for granted before long she was pretty sure she knew why when she no longer had room for doubt she said hosea im going to have a baby his eyes grew very wide after a moment he started to laugh so much for prophylactics he blurted then he gave her a kiss and said thats wonderful news flora wished hed said that before the other i think so too she said the world hell see i know thats astonishing to think about hosea blackford ran a hand through his hair it was thick but gray i only hope ill see enough of it with him for him to remember me this is one of those times that reminds me im not so young as i wish i were youre not too old flora said slyly her husband laughed again even so the moment didnt quite turn out the way she wished it would have t he mcgregors wagon plodded toward rosenfeld the horses tail switched back and forth back and forth flicking at the flies that came to life in the springtime mary mcgregor felt like a turtle poking its head out of its shell all through the harsh manitoba winter shed stayed on the farm going into town then wasnt for the fainthearted her mother had done it for kerosene and other things they couldnt make for themselves but she hadnt wanted to take mary or julia along a ford whizzed past them the horse snorted at the dust the motorcar kicked up mary coughed too those things are ugly and noisy she said this one had been particularly uglyit was painted barn red so anyone could see it coming or going for miles they go so fast though julia said wistfully you can get from here to there in nothing flat and more and more people have em nowadays people who suck up to the yankees mary said her older sister shook her head not all of them not any more from the seat in front of them their mother looked back over her shoulder were not getting one any time soon maude mcgregor said and brushed a wisp of hair back from her face her voice was harsh and flat as it so often was these days hasnt got anything to do with politics either theyre expensive is what they are that silenced both mary and julia the farm kept them all fed but it could do no more than thator rather they could make it do no more than that if pa were alive and alexander wed be fine mary thought but there was always too much work and not enough time she didnt know what to do about that she didnt think anybody could do anything about it we ought to be coming up to the checkpoint outside of town pretty soon julia said weve passed it by now maude mcgregor said even more flatly than before its not up any more mary felt like bursting into tears two or three years before she would have now she faced life with a thoroughly adult bleakness the rebellions all over then she said and nothing more lived in her voice than had in her mothers it never had a chance julia said that was enough to rouse mary whose red hair did advertise her temper it would have she said if so many people hadnt sat on their hands and if there hadnt been so many traitors for some little while the clopping of the horses hooves the squeak of an axle that was getting on toward needing grease and the occasional clank as an iron tire ran over a rock in the roadway were the only sounds traitors is an ugly word mary thought but it was the only one that fit the americans had known the uprising was coming before it really got started the rosenfeld register the weekly newspaperhad even said a canadian woman with a name famous for patriotism helped with information about it because she was in love with a yank the only famous woman patriot mary could think of offhand was laura secord did she have descendants mary wouldnt have been surprised she didnt think the uprising would have had much of a chance anyhow with such handicaps it had had none all that was left now was punishing those whod done their best for their country maude mcgregor drove around a muddy crater in the road this one was new it didnt date back to the days of the great war mary hoped it had blown up something large and american before long julia pointed ahead and said there it is i see it mary mcgregor saw rosenfeld too like her sister she couldnt help getting excited rosenfeld had perhaps a thousand souls if two railroads hadnt come together there the town would have had no reason for existing but there it was it boasted a post office a general store the weekly newspaper a doctors office and an allegedly painless dentist hed filled a couple of marys teeth it hadnt hurt him a bit she wished she could say the same i suppose winnipegs bigger mary said but it cant be much bigger i wouldnt think so julia agreed neither of them had ever seen a town bigger than rosenfeld up in front of them maude mcgregor chuckled quietly mary wondered why regardless of whether there were towns bigger than rosenfeld it was quite crowded and bustling enough wagons and motorcars clogged its main street locals in city clotheswhite shirts neckties jackets with lapelsand us army men in greengray shared the sidewalk women wore city clothes too julia pointed again will you look at that she said deliciously scandalized mary lookedand gaped disgraceful her mother said grimly maude mcgregors skirt came down to her ankle as her skirts had done for as long as mary could remember but this woman showed off half her legs or so it seemed if its the style ma julia began her voice hesitant no her mother hesitated not at all i dont care what the style is no decent woman would wear anything like that no daughter of mine will several women in rosenfeld wore dresses and skirts that short were they all scarlet mary didnt know but she wouldnt have been surprised her mother had to pull off the main street to find a place to hitch the wagon as maude mcgregor got down to give the horse the feed bag mary pointed to a signboard plastered to a wall ma whats a bijou she knew she was probably mispronouncing the unfamiliar word its a motionpicture house her mother answered after reading some of the small print under the big name a motionpicture house in rosenfeld mary and julia exclaimed together julia went on this is the big city while mary asked can we go see something ma can we please she knew she sounded like a wheedling little girl but she couldnt help it i dont know here her mother wavered where shed been very sure about skirts the flyer says it costs a quarter each to get in and seventyfive cents is a lot of money wed only do it once ma its not like we come here every day mary said wheedling harder than ever julia added its a new business in town its not like those start up every day either wellall right maude mcgregor said mary clapped her hands but only this once understand you pester me about it every time we come to town and youll find out your backsides arent too big to switch we promise ma mary and julia chorused they looked at each other and winked theyd won that didnt happen very often a line snaked toward the bijous box office a lot of the people in the line were american soldiers mary ignored them the soldiers ignored her too though they plainly noticed her older sister and her mother julia and maude mcgregor paid no attention to the men in greengray three quarters slapped down on the counter mary heard her mother sigh the fellow behind the counter peeled three tickets off an enormous roll and handed them to her mother another young man at the door importantly tore the tickets in two inside the theater the smell of buttered popcorn almost drove mary mad along with the popcorn the girl behind the counter sold lemonade and more different kinds of candy than henry gibbon carried in his general store maude mcgregor led mary and julia past such temptations and into the theater itself both her daughters let out pitiful piteous sighs she took no notice of them she was made of stern stuff the maroon velvet chairs inside the theater swung down when you put your weight on them that proved entertaining enough to take marys mind off candy at least for a little while a couple of rows in front of her a little boy bounced up and down up and down up and down she wanted to spank him before too long his father did without warning the lights went dim a man at a pianoa man mary hadnt noticed up till thenbegan to play melodramatic music the curtains slid back from an enormous screen some sort of machine behind her began making noise the projector then the screen filled with light and she forgot everything else its photographs come to life she whispered to julia her sister nodded but never took her eyes away from the screen mary didnt either those enormous moving blackandwhite people up there held her mesmerized news of the world a headline read briefly interrupting the motion then she saw a man in a silly uniform and an even sillier hat waving to soldiers marching past kaiser wilhelm reviews troops returning from occupied parts of france another headline explained swarthy men many of them wearing big black mustaches fired rifles and machine guns at one another in a country that looked dry and hot scenes from the civil war in the empire of mexico the caption said mary stared entranced shed never been farther from the farm than rosenfeld but here was the whole world in front of her eyes two men in suits crossed a bridge from opposite sides and shook hands that was labeled president of usa premier of quebec meet in friendship all of a sudden mary wasnt so sure she wanted the whole world in front of her eyes and then she saw ruined city blocks explosions diving aeroplanes with machine guns blazing glum survivors grim prisoners with hands in the air overturned motorcars and dead bodies lying in the street and other bodies swinging from a gallows scenes from the rebellion in canada the explanatory sign said she hadnt seen much war it had swept through rosenfeld and stayed to the north and shed only been a little girl then she gulped this was what she wanted was it not even the main feature a melodrama with a car chase a chase through and on top of the cars of a train and an astonishingly handsome leading man who wed the astonishingly beautiful leading lady and gave her a tender kiss just before the lights came back up could take all those images of devastation out of her mind thats what theyre doing to our country she said as she and her mother and sister filed out of the theater they want us to know it too they want us to be afraid julia said they know how to get what they want too maude mcgregor said grimly come on lets buy what we need and get back to the farm they were on their way to henry gibbons general store when mary saw a scene from the rebellion in canada that wasnt what the americans whod made and approved the moving picture had in mind through the streets of rosenfeld came a column of prisoners on their way to the train station from god only knew where they were scrawny and holloweyed and wore only rags they must have been some of the last men captured for most of the rebels had given up weeks even a couple of months before the mcgregors bathed once a week or so like most farm families mary was used to strong odors the stench that came from the prisoners made her stomach want to turn over one of the men started to sing god save the king an american guard in greengray hit him in the head with a rifle butt blood streamed down his face the guard laughed the prisoner stumbled on tears stung marys eyes she didnt let them fall she kept her face still and vowed remembrance a bner dowling looked down at what had been a plate of ham and fried potatoes by god that was good he said yes sir said his adjutant a dapper young captain named angelo toricelli he had only about half of dowlings girth but hed worked similar execution on a beefsteak and a couple of baked spuds nothing wrong with the way the mormons cook dowling said blotting his lips on his napkin no sir captain toricelli agreed having spent a lot of time as an adjutant dowling recognized the younger mans resigned tone though he was resolved not to do so much to deserve resigned agreement as his own cross general custer had done thinking of a cross made him suspect he knew what was bothering toricelli does it bother you that i eat so much captain one of toricellis eyebrows twitched in surprise not really sir he said after a moment its none of my business i would never ask anyone to be anything hes not interesting way to put it dowling remarked then he laughed which set several of his chins jiggling laugh or not though he changed the subject how do you like being a gentile in utah me i think its pretty funny the mormons can say were gentiles toricelli answered you can go around saying all sorts of things that doesnt mean theyre true i suppose not dowling left a silver dollar on the table to cover their meals he got to his feet so did toricelli who hurried to open the restaurants front door for him that was one of the things adjutants were for as dowling knew only too well pretty day toricelli remarked as they came out onto the street it is isnt it dowling said spring was in the air snow had retreated up the slopes of the wasatch mountains to the east sea gulls wheeled overhead which dowling never failed to find strange so far inland and as always sounds of building filled the air salt lake city had surrendered to us forces nine years before dowling had seen photographs of it just after the mormon rebels finally yielded to superior force theyd fought till they couldnt fight any more the city had looked more like the mountains of the moon than anything that sprang from human hands and minds hardly one stone remained atop another the mormons had simmered resentfully under the harsh treatment theyd got from us authorities ever since the second mexican war when they rose during the great war theyd done a lot more than simmer now now on the outside everything here seemed calm salt lake cityand provo to the south and ogden to the northwere three of the newest shiniest towns in the usa most of the rubble had been cleared away most of the mormons whod survived the uprising were getting on with their lives on the surface utah seemed much like any other state when dowlings train first brought him to salt lake city hed wondered if his presence if the us armys presence was necessary hed been here more than a year now he no longer wondered as he and toricelli walked east along south temple street towards army headquarters no fewer than three peopletwo men and a womanshouted murderer at them one from a secondstory window one from behind them and one from a passing ford toricelli eyed the motorcar as it sped away then muttered something pungent that might not have been english under his breath i wasnt able to read the license plate he said if i had we could have tracked that son of a bitch down what difference does it make dowling said they all feel that way about us one more one lessso what it makes a lot of difference sir his adjutant said earnestly yes theyre going to hate us but they need to fear us too otherwise they start up again and we did all that for nothing to show what he meant by that he waved across south temple street to temple square no rebuilding there by order of the military administration the mormon tabernacle and the temple and the other great buildings of the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints remained as they had fallen during the federal conquest of salt lake city another reminder to the locals of the cost of rising against the united states rattlesnakes dwelt among the tumbled stones they were the least the occupiers had to worry about colonel dowling murmured a few lines from shelley my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair nothing besides remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away angelo toricelli gave him a quizzical look ive heard other officers recite that poem sir have you well im not surprised dowling said even fallen the gray granite temple inspired awe a gilded copper statue of the angel moroni had topped the tallest spire which the mormons had used as an observation post till us artillery knocked it down no american soldiers had ever found a trace of that statue persistent rumor said the mormons had spirited away its wreckage and venerated it as a holy relic as the crusaders had venerated pieces of the true cross dowling didnt know about that he did know there was an enormous reward for information leading to the capture of the statue or of any significant part of it no one had ever collected no one had ever tried to collect at the corner of temple and main captain toricelli said you want to be careful crossing sir for some reason or other mormons in motorcars have a devil of a time seeing soldiers yes ive noticed that dowling agreed his hand fell to the grip of the on his hip most places an officers pistol was a formality almost as archaic as a sword even more than in occupied canada dowling felt the need for a weapon here soldiers in machinegun emplacements protected by reinforced concrete and barbed wire surrounded us army headquarters in salt lake city sentries carefully checked dowling and toricellis identification cards theyd discovered the unfortunate consequences of not checking such things the mormons had army uniforms theyd taken during the great war and some of them would kill even at the cost of their own lives not much news of such assassinations had got out of utah but that made them no less real ohcolonel dowling a soldier said as dowling walked down the hall to his office general pershing is looking for you sir is he well hes just about to find me then dowling turned to his adjutant ill see you in a while captain of course sir angelo toricelli said i have a couple of reports to keep me busy if you cant stay busy in utah somethings wrong with you dowling agreed and off he went to see the commanding general john j pershing was in his midsixties he didnt look younger than his years so much as tough and wellpreserved for them his jaw jutted his gray kaiser bill mustachethe style was now falling out of favor with younger menadded to his bulldog appearance his icy blue eyes seized and held dowling hello colonel take a seat theres coffee in the pot if you care for some no thank you sir im just back from lunch dowling answered general custer would have been even money or better to make some snide crack about his weight pershing simply nodded and got down to business im worried colonel dowling this place is like a powder keg and im afraid the fuse is lit really sir dowling said in surprise i know utahs been a powder keg for more than forty years but why do you think itll go off now if the mormons were going to rise against us wouldnt they have tried it when the canucks did strategically that makes good sense pershing agreed but the trouble that may come here hasnt got anything to do with what happened up in canada you are of course aware how we hold this state yes sir by the railroads and by the fertile belt from provo up to ogden dowling answered past that theres a lot of land and not a lot of people so we dont worry very much exactly pershing nodded we just send patrols through the desert now and again to make sure people arent plotting too openly he sighed out in the desert maybe a hundred and seventyfive miles south of here theres a little noaccount village called teasdale a troop of cavalry rode through it a couple of weeks ago the captain in command discovered several families that were pretty obviously polygamous uhoh dowling said i couldnt have put it better myself pershing replied polygamy had been formally illegal in utah since the army occupation during the second mexican war it hadnt disappeared though dowling wished it had because more than anything else it got people exercised fearing he already knew the answer he asked what did the cavalry captain do sir he applied the law pershing said he arrested everyone he could catch and he burned the offending houses to the ground and he came out of this place alive im impressed teasdales a very small townsmaller still after he seized the polygamists pershing replied and he is an able young man or he would be if he had any sense to go with his tactical expertise naturally even though this happened in the middle of nowhere news got out right away and just as naturally even a lot of mormons who arent ardent polygamists are up in arms about it not literally i hope dowling said so do i colonel but we must be ready just in case pershing said ive asked philadelphia to send us some barrels to use against them at need if the war department decides to do it instead of reprimanding me for asking for something that costs money im going to put you in charge of them you became something of an expert on barrels didnt you serving under general custer and with colonel morrell during the war i became an expert on not getting myself courtmartialed on account of barrels is what i became dowling thought custer wanted to use them against war department doctrine and i had to cover for him does that make me an expert aloud he answered ill do whatever i can sir im sure of it pershing said this may all turn out to be so much moonshine you understand the war department may need a real rising from the mormons before they send in the weapons that would have overawed them and stopped the rising in its tracks and the powers that be may not send us anything even in case of rebellion theyre in a cheeseparing mood back there sure enough theyve stopped spending any money on improving barrels you know yes i do know that dowling replied i dont like it who would with a brain in his head pershing said but soldiers dont make policy we only carry it out and get blamed when it goes wrong i wonder how fast and how well the confederate states are rearming they arent supposed to be doing anything of the sort sir dowling said pershing tossed his head like a horse bedeviled by flies i know that colonel i wonder anyway a bullet cracked past jefferson pinkards head he ducked not that that would do him any good if the bullet had his name on it somewhere not far off rebel mexican machine gunners started firing at something they imagined they saw a field gun banged away flinging shells into the uplands town of san luis potosi like most confederates pinkard had thought of the empire of mexico as his countrys feebleminded little brotherwhen hed bothered thinking of it at all which wasnt very often in the comfortable days before the war the empire did as the confederacy asked the confederates after all shielded mexico from the wrath of the usa which had hated the empire since its creation during the war of secession the truth nowadays was more complicated the usa backed the rebels against the empire the csa couldnt officially back maximilian iii but freedom party volunteers like pinkard numbered in the thousandsand the freedom party wasnt the only outfit sending volunteers south to fight the yankees and their proxies that all seemed straightforward enough what jeff hadnt counted on was that there would have beenhell there had beenrebels even without us backing maximilian iii would never land on anybodys list for sainthood pinkard shrugged he may be a son of a bitch but hes our son of a bitch by god he muttered behind him another field gun this one on his side started answering the rebels piece it seemed to be firing as much at random as the enemy gun stupid bastards he thought not sure whether he meant the enemy or his own side none of them would have lasted long during the great war he was sure of that both sides were brave enough but neither seemed to know just what it was supposed to do they lacked the experience cs and us forces had so painfully accumulated another machine gun started rattling ammunition was tight both sides imported most of it that didnt keep gunners from shooting it off for the hell of it who was going to tell em they couldnt they had the weapons after all a mexican private came up to jeff like pinkards his cotton uniform was dyed a particularly nasty shade of yellowbrown it looked more like something from a dog with bad digestion than a proper butternut but all the greasers and the confederate volunteers wore it so jeff could only grouse when he got the chance he couldnt change a thing the mexican said buenos dias sergeant jeff it came out of his mouth sounding like heff the teniente he wants to see you all right manuel im coming pinkard pronounced the spanish name manyouwell he took that for granted though what the locals did to his never ceased to annoy him he walked bent over the mexicans built trenches for men of their size and he overtopped most of them by half a head the rebel snipers werent nearly so good as the damnyankees had been up in texas but he didnt want to give em a target he nodded to lieutenant hernando guitierrez what can i do for you sir en que puedo servirle again he made a hash of the spanish it didnt matter not here lieutenant guitierrez probably spoke better english than pinkard did he was every bit as tall too though not much more than half as wide through the shoulders by his looks he had a lot more spaniard and a lot less indian in him than did most of the men he commanded he said i have a job for you sergeant thats what im here for pinkard agreed eryes the mexican lieutenant drummed his fingers on his thigh jeff had a pretty good idea what was eating the fellow he was only a sergeant himself and hed never risen higher than pfc in the cs army but he got more money every month than guitierrez did and although he was only a sergeant it wasnt always obvious that his rank was inferior to the other mans why else were confederate volunteers down here if not to show the greasers the way real soldiers did things what can i do for you lieutenant jeff asked again not feeling like pushing things today guitierrez gave him what might have been a grateful look you are familiar sergeant with the machines called barrels uh yeah pinkard was familiar enough to start worrying even though the clanking monsters had been few and far between in texas during the great warespecially on the confederate side whats the matter the rebels going to start throwing em at us thats real bad news if they are no no no the mexican officer shook his head he had a sort of melancholy pride different from anything pinkard had known in his own countrymen we have three built in tampico by the sea and coming up here to the highlands by railroad i want you to lead the infantry when we move forward with them against the peasant rabble who dare to oppose emperor maximilian you people built barrels once hed said it jeff wished he hadnt sounded quite so astonished but that was too late of course lieutenant guitierrezs lips thinned yes we did but then he coughed he was a proud man but also an honest man i understand the design may have come from the confederate statesunofficially of course ah i get you jeff laid a finger by the side of his nose and winked the confederates couldnt build barrels on their own the yankees would land on them with both feet if they tried but what happened south of the border was a different story when does the attack go in and what are we aiming for we want to drive them from those little hills where they can observe our movements they are shelling san luis potosi from that forward position too guitierrez replied if all goes well this will be a heavy blow against them as for when the attack begins the morning after the barrels come into place he didnt say when that morning would be he was probably wise not to for one thing pinkard had already discovered what manana meant for another barrels no matter who built them broke down if you looked at them sideways pinkard grunted all right lieutenant soon as they get here ill lead your infantry against the rebels youll follow along yourself to see how its done right he wasnt calling guitierrez a coward hed seen the other man had courage and to spare and guitierrez nodded now claro que si sergeant of course that is why you are here to show us how it is done jeff grunted again in one sense the mexican lieutenant was right in another pinkard was here because his marriage was as much a casualty of the great war as a fellow with a hook for a hand he was here because he had a fierce restless energy and an urgent desire to kill something almost anything he couldnt satisfy that desire back in birmingham not unless he wanted to fry in the electric chair shortly thereafter three days laternot a bad case of manana all things consideredthe barrels came into position clanking and rattling and belching and farting every inch of the way pinkard wasnt surprised to find more than half their crewmen were confederate volunteers he was surprised when he got a look at the barrels themselves they werent the rhomboids with tracks all around that the csa following the british lead had used during the great war and they werent quite the squat hulking monsters with a cannon in the nose and machine guns bristling on flanks and rear the usa had thrown at the confederacy they did have a conning tower like that of a us barreltheir crewmen called it a turret it revolved through some sort of gear mechanism and carried a cannon and a machine gun mounted alongside it two more bowmounted machine guns completed their armament since the turret spins we dont need nothin else a crewman said means we dont have to try and shoehorn so many men inside neither sounds like somebodys been doing a lot of thinking about this business pinkard said reckon so the other man agreed now if the same somebody wouldve thunk about the engine too wed all be better off a good horse can still outrun these miserable iron sons of bitches without breathing hard during the great wareven the attenuated version of it fought out in texasa big artillery barrage would have preceded the barrels advance neither side in this fight had enough artillery to lay down a big barrage it didnt seem to matter the barrels rolled forward crushing the enemys barbed wire and shooting up his machinegun nests come on pinkard shouted to the foot soldiers loyal to maximilian iii keep up with em they make the hole an we go through it stick tight and the enemyll shoot at the barrels and not at you so much that was how things had worked during the great war in english and horrible spanish jeff urged his men forward forward they went too the only thing he hadnt counted on was the effect barrels even a ragged handful of barrels had on troops whod never faced them before the rebels or the braver men among them tried shooting at the great machines when their rifle and machinegun bullets bounced off the barrels armor they seemed to decide the end of the world was at hand some ran away the barrels machine guns scythed them down like wheat at harvest time others threw down their rifles threw up their hands and surrendered amigo they shouted hopefully jefferson pinkard had never had so many strangers call him friend in all his born days in texas the confederates had gone raiding to catch a handful of yankee prisoners here prisoners were coming out of his ears what do we do with em sergeant asked a soldier who spoke englishmaybe hed worked in the csa once upon a time we go the gesture he made wasnt the throatcutting one pinkard would have used but it meant the same thing for once jeffs blood lust was sated slaughter in the heat of battle was as fine as taking a woman maybe finer killing prisoners felt like murder maybe im still a christian after all nah theyve surrendered he answered well take em back with us wed better till those barrels break down theyre gonna keep bringin in plenty more si es verdad the soldier said and translated pinkards words for the other mexicans they all assumed he knew how to handle a flood of prisoners of war tooincluding the prisoners themselves who swarmed up to him to kiss his hands and even try to kiss his cheeks in gratitude for being spared cut that out he roared it made him wish he had ordered a massacre instead he led the captured rebelswho were even more ragged and sorrylooking than the mexican imperialistsback out of the fighting once he got them behind the line he had to figure out what to do with them next nobody else seemed to want to do anything that looked like thinking he commandeered some barbed wire and some posts to string it from after he herded the prisoners into the big square hed made he told off guards to make sure they didnt head for the high country then he had to yell to make sure they got somethingnot much but somethingto eat and drink and he had to go on yelling to make sure manana didnt foul things up by the time three or four days went by all the mexicans assumed he was in charge of the prisonerofwar camp before very much longer he started thinking the same thing himself c olonel irving morrell hated soldiering from behind a desk he always had as best he could tell he always would and he especially hated it when there was fighting going on and he found himself a thousand miles away the reports filtering north from the civil war in the empire of mexico struck him as particularly maddeningand all the more so because he couldnt get anybody else in the war department to take them seriously god damn it the imperialists are cleaning up with these new barrels of theirs he raged to his superior a stolid senior colonel named virgil donaldson he waved papers in donaldsons face has anybody besides me read this material by what its saying theyve got just about all the features we put on our fancy prototype at fort leavenworth but we built our prototype and said to hell with it those bastards have got a production line going in tampico colonel donaldson puffed on his pipe he had a big red face and a big gray mustache he looked more like somebodys kindly uncle than a general staff officer he sounded like somebodys kindly uncle too when he said take an even strain colonel morrell youll burst a blood vessel if you dont and then where will you be but sir morrell waved the papers again take an even strain donaldson repeated he liked the phrase before morrell could explode donaldson went on who cares what a bunch of goddamn greasers are up to anyway but its not just greasers sir morrell said desperately these barrels have confederate mercenaries as crew theyve got to have confederates designing them too and the confederate states arent allowed to build barrels the armistice agreement makes that as plain as the nose on my face a ceiling fan spun lazily a fly buzzed outside donaldsons window summer heat made the air shimmer the government building across the street from general staff headquarters might have belonged to some other world some other universe morrell laughed softly hed had that feeling about the general staff before with no tricks of the eye to start it going trying to come back to what he was sure was reality he said we ought to protest to richmond the confederate government is turning a blind eye toward what has to be several regiments worth of their veterans going south to fight on maximilians side that may not be against the letter of their agreements with us but its dead against the spirit after another puff on that pipe colonel donaldson said nice idea but dont hold your breath president sinclair is looking for good relations with the csa he doesnt want to bother richmond with trifles and he thinks anything this side of a confederate invasion of kentucky is a trifle morrell muttered something under his breath it wasnt that he thought donaldson was wrong no he feared his superior was right why did we bother to win the war if we wont make it count youd have to talk to president sinclair about that colonel morrell donaldson answered why isnt my job or yours either its for the civilians they decide what to do and they tell us doing it is our department i know sir the lesson had been drilled into morrell since his west point days during the war of secession us generals had spoken of overthrowing the republic and becoming military dictator then theyd gone out and lost the war so theyd never had the chance to do more than talk about it no one had wanted to take the risk of such things since though it was only now a lifetime later that the united states had to deal with the consequences of victory rather than defeat in fairness we could use some peace and quiet with richmond right about now donaldson said after all weve got germany to worry about too well yes morrell admitted reluctantly he knew why he was reluctant to admit any such thing too but if we ever do fight the kaiser thatll be the navys worry not the armys at least i have a devil of a time seeing how the germans could invade us or how we could land troops in europe it wouldnt be easy would it donaldson said but of course a lot depends on whos friends with whom the germans have the same worries about france and england as we do about the csa and god only knows whats going to happen to the russians even now theyre having more trouble putting down their reds than the confederates ever did during the war not our worry thank god morrell chuckled the puff of smoke donaldson sent up might have been a fragrant question mark morrell explained the russian reds make up the best names for themselves i especially like the two who are operating in that town on the volgatsaritsin thats the name of the place the red general is the man of steel and his secondincommand goes by the hammer the reds in the csa werent so fancy they were nothing but a bunch of coons donaldson said you cant expect much from them that made morrell thoughtful i wonder he said i do wonder sir when i was in the field i ran up against negro regiments a few times far as i could tell they didnt fight any worse than raw regiments of white confederate troops huh the older man sounded deeply skeptical but then he shrugged thats not our worry either thank god no sir morrell agreed are you sure theres no point to writing that report about the barrels down in mexico sir i really do think thats alarming donaldson sighed the sigh of a man whod been a cog in a bureaucratic machine for a long time you can write the report colonel if it makes you happy ill even endorse it and send it on but i can tell you what will happen the most likely thing is nothing itll go into a file here along with a million other reports thats what happens if youre lucky i dont call that luck morrell said compared to the other thing that could happen its luck donaldson told him believe you me its luck because the other thing that could happen is somebody reads the report and passes it on to somebody else somebody outside the general staff and it gets into the hands of one of those precious civilianssay somebody like n mattoon thomas the assistant secretary of war but hes just the manjust the sort of manwho ought to see a report like this one morrell said he thought well of the one i did on the mess in armenia well maybe but maybe not too armenias a long ways off you see the confederate states are right next door colonel donaldson said if youre lucky he reads it and then he throws it into a file in the war department offices different file but thats all right he held up a hand to silence morrell then went on if youre not so lucky he reads it and he thinks whos this smartaleck soldier trying to tell me how to do my job and if thats what somebody like n mattoon thomas thinks pretty soon youre not here in philadelphia any more youre commanding a garrison in the middle of nowhere alberta or utah or new mexico somewhere like that he spoke as if of a fate worse than death that was probably how he saw it that was how any soldier who was first of all a cog in a bureaucratic machine and only afterwards a fighting man would have seen it but morrell didnt want to be here in the first place getting back out into the field even somewhere in the back of beyond sounded pretty good to him yes it doesto you he thought then several beats later than he should have what will agnes think about it youve got a little girl now morrell do you want to haul mildred off to god knows where just because you couldnt stand to keep your big mouth shut he muttered unhappily colonel donaldson thought he was contemplating the horrors of life outside philadelphia dismissed donaldson said unhappily morrell left his superiors office even more unhappily he went back to his own where does your first loyalty lie to your wife and daughter or to the united states of america he cursed softly but he didnt need long to make up his mind agnes had been a soldiers widow before she met him dammit she knew what the price of duty could be if they had to go off to lethbridge or nehi or flagstaff shed take that in stride it might even end up better for mildred morrell nodded to himself he fed a sheet of paper into the typewriter that squatted on his desk like some heathen god he typed with his two index fingersa slower way of doing things than proper touchtyping but it got the job done well enough if the powers that be chose to ignore his report that was their business but he was going to make sure they saw what he saw he did warn his wife what hed done and what might happen as a result to his relief she only shrugged philadelphias a nice town she said but i got along well enough in leavenworth too he kissed her i like the way you think it isnt a question of thinking agnes said its a question of doing what you have to do mildred morrell didnt say anything she just kicked her legs and grinned up at her father from her cradle showing off her first two brand new baby teeth some of her babbles and gurgles had dada in them but she didnt yet associate the sound with him what will you think if you grow up in lethbridge or nehi instead of philadelphia morrell asked her mildred only laughed she didnt care one way or the other maybe just maybe her father said im fixing things so you dont have to go through a war when you grow up i hope i am anyway he was eating lunch the next day when lieutenant colonel john abell came up to him without preamble general liggetts adjutant said you do believe in cooking your own goose dont you colonel ah morrell smiled youve read it then yes ive read it the astringently intellectual general staff officer shook his head in slow wonder amazing how a man can analyze so brilliantly and be so blind to politics all at the same time after another bite of meat loaf morrell said youve told me as much before what am i being blind to today one and a half million dead men colonel and id think even you should notice them lieutenant colonel abell answered with a certain somber relish one and a half million dead men or a few more than thatall the reasons why theres no stomach in the usa for another war against the confederate states morrell winced his smile faded john abell was a snob that didnt mean he was a foolanything but dont you believe most people would rather fight a small war now if the confederates dont back downwhich i think they wouldthan fight a big one ten or twenty years down the road some people would a few people would but most abell shook his head no sir most people dont want to fight any war at all and theyll do almost anything to keep from fighting meaning no offense sir but i think youve just cooked your own goose with a shrug morrell said well even if i have i wont mind getting back in the field again lieutenant colonel abell looked at him as if hed spoken in hindustani or maybe choctaw like colonel donaldson abell was a creature of the general staff and didnt care to contemplate life outside it morrell did which gave him a certain moral advantage and how much good will that do you in lethbridge when the blizzards come he wondered and wished he hadnt t om colleton held out a package too well wrapped for him to have done it himself happy birthday sis he told anne oh for heavens sake she said in fond exasperation you shouldnt have she kissed him on the cheek but at least half of her meant every word of that the birthday in question was her thirtyninth and the only one she would have felt less like celebrating was her fortieth well whether i should have or not i damn well did her younger brother answered tom still had a few years to go before facing middle ageand forty meant less to a man than it did to a woman anyhow from forty a woman could see all too well the approaching end of too many things beauty among them from thirtynine too anne thought gloomily but tom was grinning at her go onopen it i will she said and she did tearing into the wrapping paper as she would have liked to tear into father time what on earth have you got here i found it the last time i was in columbia he said there now youve got it see its a book of photographs of marcel duchamps paintings anne exclaimed seeing as he exhibited at marshlands i thought youd like it her brother said and take a look at page one seventythree why whats he done there anne asked suspiciously toms grin only got wider and more annoying she flipped through the book till she got to page the painting especially in a blackandwhite reproduction resembled nothing so much as an explosion in a prism factory that didnt surprise anne when duchamp displayed his nude descending a staircase at marshlands just before the great war broke out the work had hung upside down for several days before anyone including the artist noticed but here tom looked over her shoulder to make sure shed got to the right page you see he said you see he pointed to the title below the photograph mademoiselle anne colleton of north carolina confederate states of america anne read she said something most unladylike and then for gods sake he doesnt even remember what state he was in im not surprised i supposeall he cared about while he was here was getting drunk and laying the nigger serving girls what do you think of the likeness her brother asked before the war anne had been a champion of everything modern life was harder now she had little time for such fripperies and im older than i was then she thought bleakly its harder to stay up to date and to stay excited about being up to date she took a longer look at mlle anne colleton it still seemed made up of squares and triangles and rectangles flying in all directions but lurking among them cunningly hidden were features that might have been her own slowly she said its not as bad as you make it out to be no its worse tom said when i was in the trenches i saw men who got hit by shells and didnt look this bad afterwards he brought his experience to the abstract painting just as anne brought hers that was bound to be what marcel duchamp had had in mind anne might have cared more if he hadnt made such a nuisance of himself while at marshlands and if he hadnt been such a coward about recrossing the atlantic after the war began and both sides submersibles started prowling as things were she only shrugged and said it is a compliment of sorts whatever he thought of me he didnt forget me once he got back to france nobody ever forgets you sis tom colleton said then he added something he never would have dared say before the war going into the army had made a man of him hed been a boy a comfortable boy till then he asked how come you never married any of the fellows who sniffed around after you there were always enough of em had he presumed to ask such a question before the great war she would have slapped him down hard now though she didnt like it she gave it a serious answer some of them wanted to run me and to run my money nobody runs me and i run the money better than most men could ive said that before and the others the ones who didnt care so much about the money she laughed a hard and bitter laugh they were sons of bitches just about all of them i recognize the breed id bettertakes one to know one people say almost fondly she remembered roger kimball the submarine officer had been a thoroughgoing son of a bitch hed also been far and away the best lover she ever had she didnt know what that said actually she did know but she didnt care to dwell on it but in the end kimball had chosen the freedom party over her and he was dead now shot by the widow of a us seaman whose destroyer hed sunk after the csa had asked for and been granted an armistice she waited for tom to give her a lecture but he only asked another question can you go on by yourself for the rest of your days i dont know anne admitted to keep from having to think about it she tried to change the subject what about you tom youre as single as i am yeah i know he said with a calm that surprised her but there are a couple of differences between us for one thing im a few years younger than you are for another im starting to look hard and youre not are you she said surprised you didnt tell me anything about that tom nodded almost defiantly well i am and yes i know i havent told you anything no offense sis but you like running peoples lives so much you dont like it when they try and run their own that held enough truth to make anne give him a wry nod in return he dipped his head acknowledging it and continued theres one more thing no offense a lot of ways when a man gets married matters a lot less than when a woman does and that was all too true as well in a fair just world it wouldnt have been but anne had never been naive enough to imagine the world either fair or just looks werent what kept a man but they were what lured him shed used her own blond beauty to advantage more times than she could count again turning thirtynine reminded her she wouldnt be able to do that forever if she wanted to have a baby or two she wouldnt be able to do that forever either she sighed well tom when youre right youre right and youre right dammit im going to have to do something about it her brother blinked hed probably been expecting a shouting match not agreement just like that he asked anne nodded briskly yes just like that or as close to just like that as i can make it or dont you think i can do what i set my mind to doing if he said he didnt he would have a shouting match on his hands but he only laughed anybody who thinks that about you is a damn fool sis now i may be a damn foolplenty of people have called me one and theyve had their reasonsbut im not that particular kind of a damn fool thank you kindly although anne laughed too she also gave him another nod good youd better not be she meant what she said as if to prove it she drove up to columbia a couple of days later she knew the eligible bachelors in little st matthews south carolina much too well to have the slightest interest in marrying any of them he was too old he was too dull he was too grouchy he couldnt count to twentyone without dropping his pants the pickings had to be better or at least wider in the state capital they would be better still down in charleston but columbia was a lot closer that made it more convenient both for her and for the battered ford she drove keeping the motorcar alive would probably let the local mechanic send his children to college but she had to let it keep nibbling her to death a bit at a time she couldnt afford a new one however much she wanted one before the warthat phrase againand even into it shed driven a powerful comfortable vauxhall imported from england confederate soldiers had confiscated it at gunpoint during the red uprising of almost ten years ago now she thought with slow wonder the ford now the ford was a boneshaker that couldnt get past thirtyfive miles an hour unless it went over a cliff and it was a yankee machine but it was what she had and it ran after a fashion she did like driving into columbia the towns gracious architecture spoke of the better days of the last century when the negroes rebelled here some houses some blocks had gone up in flames but most of the city remained intactand the damage at last was largely repaired she couldnt imagine a conflagration big enough to destroy the whole town columbia was too big for such disasters charleston had better hotels than columbia but the essex house only a few blocks from the green bronze dome of the state capitol would do the essex house also boasted a firstrate switchboard she had no trouble keeping up with her investments while away from home and she could even study dayold copies of the new orleans financial mercury and threedayold editions of the wall street journal since she kept most of her money in us rather than cs markets the latter did her more good but here she was more interested in men who might have investments of their own than in investments themselves dinner at the hotel restaurant the first night she got into town made her wonder if shed waited several years too long to make this particular hunting expedition before the war she couldnt possibly have eaten without shooing away anywhere from two to half a dozen men more interested in other pleasures than in those of the table here she enjoyedor didnt so much enjoysome very tasty fried chicken without drawing so much as a single eye i might as well be eating crow she thought as she rose unhappy from the table a visit to her assemblyman the next day was no more reassuring edgar stow was younger than she was he wore the ribbon for the purple heart in his lapel the three missing fingers on his left hand explained why because of those missing digits he had what she took to be a wedding band on the surviving index finger he was polite to anne but polite to anne as if she was an influential constituent true rather than a goodlooking woman false he also seemed maddeningly unaware of what she was trying to tell him parties banquets he shook his head its pretty quiet here these days maam the oldtimers the men whove held their seats since before the war they complain all the time about how dead it is but we get a lot more business done nowadays than they ever did stow sounded pleased with himself he had an ashtray on his desk made from the brass base of a shell casing with a couple of dimes bent into semicircles and welded to it to hold cigarettes hed surely made it or had it made while he was in the army anne wanted to pick it up and brain him with it his blindness stung but that maam hurt worse by the way he said it he might have been talking to his grandmother so what exactly can i help you with today maam he asked polite efficientand stupid anne didnt tell him why waste my time she thought as she left his office but she had to wonder if shed already wasted too much time americanempire thecentercannothold v s am carsten smeared zincoxide ointment on the bridge of his nose it wouldnt do him any good he was dolefully certain of that when summer came he got a sunburn hed got sunburned in san francisco which wasnt easy hell hed got sunburned in seattle which was damn near impossible the port of brest france toward which the uss obrien was steaming lay on the same parallel of latitude as seattle somebodyd told that to carsten but hed had to look it up for himself in an atlas before he would believe it the bright sunshine dancing off the oceanand off the green land aheadseemed almost tropical in comparison to what seattle usually got he patted the breech of the destroyers forward fourinch gun this here is one more place i figured id have to fight my way into he remarked yes sir nathan hirskowitz agreed the petty officer shrugged but weve got one thing going for us even on a little courtesy call like this you bet we do sam said we arent germans hirskowitz nodded he scratched his chin whiskers rasped under his nails though hed shaved that morning yes sir he said thats what i was thinking all right they just dont like germans here in france same as they just dont like englishmen in ireland carsten thought for a moment then went on and same as they just dont like us in the csawhat do you want to bet a ship from the kaisers high seas fleet gets the same sort of big hello in charleston as we do here i wont touch that one you got to be right hirskowitz said damn funny business though sam said we were at war with the froggies too same as kaiser bill was at war with the confederates but we didnt lick france same as the germans didnt lick the confederate states that makes all the difference hirskowitz added something in french what the hells that mean sam asked in surprise something like the better you know somebody the more reasons you can find to despise him the gunners mate answered well ive known you for a while and this is the first i knew you spoke any french nathan hirskowitz surprised sam again this time by looking and sounding faintly embarrassed its my old mans fault sir he came to the united states out of this little romanian village in the middle of nowherethats what he has to say about it anyway but hed taught himself french and german and english while he was still there thats pretty good sam said he taught you too eh yeah me and my brothers and my sister german was easy of course because we already used yiddish around the house and theyre pretty close but he made us learn french too so what does he do in new york city sam asked how come you arent too rich to think about joining the navy how come hirskowitz snorted ill tell you how come sir pop had a storing and hauling business but he liked horses better than trucks and so that went under hes smart but hes a stubborn bastard my old man is and since his business went under he hasnt done much of anything he sponges off the rest of my relatives thats all you listen to him talk hes too smart to work oh one of those carsten nodded hed met the type too bad any which way though i expect ill stick with you when we get shore leave always handy to have somebody along who knows the lingo sir youre an officer remember you got to find one of your own who speaks french you cant go drinking with a noaccount gunners mate sam cursed under his breath hirskowitz was right no doubt about it the trouble was carsten didnt like drinking with officers that was the bad news about being a mustang hed spent close to twenty years as an able seaman and petty officer himself his rank had changed but his taste in companions hadnt officers still struck him as a snooty lot but he would hear about it and in great detail if he fraternizedthat was the word theyd usewith men of lower rank up to the wharf came the obrien the skipper handled that himself disdaining the help of the tugboats hovering in the harbor if he made a hash of it hed have nobody but himself to blame but he didnt with all the frenchmen watchingand no doubt with some germans keeping an eye on the destroyer toohe came alongside as smoothly as if parking a car a french naval officer whose uniform save for his kepi didnt look a whole lot different from american styles came aboard the obrien welcome to la belle france he said in accented english we have been allies before your country and mine we are not enemies now it could be one day we shall ally again he didnt say against whom he had in mind he didnt sayand he didnt need to say the obrien s executive officer said something in french sam didnt want to go drinking with the exec the frenchman saluted the executive officer returned the salute he said we come to france on a peaceful visit and hope that peace will last forever with a very gallic shrug the french officer replied what lasts forever nothing in this world monsieur i need to say one thing to you a word of comment diton a word of warning yes your men are welcome to go ashore but they should use a certain a certain caution oui since the frenchman plainly wanted the obrien s crew to hear that the exec carried on in english what sort of caution sir political caution the local said the action francaise has no small power here in brest you know the action francaise mais un petit peu the executive officer said and then only a little even a little is too much the frenchman told him they are royalist they are catholicvery very catholic in a political wayand forgive me they oppose those who were the allies of the united states during the the unpleasantness not so long past they hate the germans guts carsten thought thats what he means but hes too polite to say so the obrien s executive officer nodded and said thanks for the warning we will be careful i have done my duty the french officer answered i wash my hands of the lot of you he might have said with another salute he went back over the gangplank up onto the pier and into brest carsten wondered if the skipper would keep his crew aboard the ship after a greeting like that but he didnt he did warn the men who got liberty to stick together and not to cause trouble sam hoped they would listen but sailors in port werent always inclined to he went ashore himself as much from simple curiosity as from any great desire to paint the town red brest wasnt the sort of place to which tourists thronged it was first and foremost a navy town that didnt faze sam the steep slippery streets were another matter brest sat on a ridge above the penfeld river and seemed more suited to mountain goats than to men mountain goats though didnt go into bars carsten did the first chance he got whiskey he told the bartender figuring that word didnt change much from one language to another but the fellow surprised him by speaking english the apple brandy is better seeing sams look of surprise he explained many times during the great warand sincesailors from angleterre come here all right thanks ill try the stuff when sam did he found he liked itcalvados was the name on the bottle he drank some more warmth spread through him a navy town had to have friendly women somewhere not too far from the sea after i drink some more ill find out about that he thought before he could though three or four french officers came in one of them noticed his unfamiliar uniform you areamerican he asked in halting english you are from the contretorpilleur new in the harbor yes from the destroyer sam agreed and what think you of brest the fellow asked nice town carsten said his mother had raised him to be polite and this calvados stuffthis is the cats meow the frenchman looked puzzled sam simplified its good i like it ah the cats meow the french officera toughlooking fellow in his forties a few years older than samfiled away the phrase would it please you monsieur to see more of brest thank you friend i wouldnt mind that at all sam answered thinking among other things that an officer ought to know where the officers brothels were and which of them had the liveliest girls but the frenchmanhis name turned out to be henri dimiertook him to the maritime museum housed in a chateau down by the harbor and then to the cathedral of st louis closer to the center of town maybe he was an innocent maybe he thought sam was or maybe he was subtly trying to annoy him if so he failed carsten found both buildings interesting even if neither was exactly what hed had in mind when they came out of the cathedral a whole company of blueuniformed policemen rushed up the street past them whats going on there sam asked i think it is the action francaise dimier answered his face hard and grim they are to have ahow do you saya meeting in the place de la liberte it is not far would you care to see well all right it wasnt what sam had had in mind it wouldnt be much fun but it might be useful and that counted too i suppose that counts too he thought mournfully the place de la liberte wasnt far from the cathedral only two or three blocks even before carsten and henri dimier got there the sound of singing filled the air a forest of flags sprouted inside the park some were the familiar french tricolor others covered with fleursdelys pointing sam asked what are those that is the old flag the royal flag of france dimier replied they want to ah return to his throne the king oh carsten wasnt sure what to make of that the mere idea struck him as pretty strange he tried another question what are they singing i translate for you the french officer cocked his head to one side listening here like this the german who has taken all who has robbed paris of all she owns now says to france you belong to us alone obey down on your knees all of you and here is thethe refrainis that the word no no france is astir her eyes flash fire no no enough of treason now would you hear more monsieur uhyeah if you dont mind i do need to know this we all need to know it dimier picked up the song again insolent german hold your tongue behold our king approaches and our race runs ahead of him back to where you belong german our king will lead us and the refrain one two france is astir her eyes flash fire one two the french are at home and once more tomorrow on our graves the wheat will be more beautiful let us close our ranks this summer we shall have wine from the grapevines with royalty do you understand being an american what all this means i doubt it sam answered do you before henri dimier could answer the men of the action francaise charged the police who were trying to hold them in the square for a moment clubs flailing the police did hold but then the ralliersthe rioters nowbroke through with shouts of triumph they swarmed into the streets of brest sam had a devil of a time getting back to the obrien after that though he understood or thought he understood a good deal that he hadnt before c larence potter was a meticulous man if he hadnt been he couldnt very well have had a successful career in intelligence work during the war that habit of precision was one reason why he had no use for the freedom party to his way of thinking jake featherston and his followers only wanted to smash things up with no idea what would replace them he stood in marion square in charleston listening to a freedom party congressional candidate the fellows name was ezra hutchinson he was a rotund man who put potter in mind of a hand grenade in a white summer suit he exploded like a hand grenade too unlike a hand grenade though he kept doing it over and over now hear me friends he thundered pumping a fist in the air atop the portable platform on which he stood hear me weve turned the other cheek to the usa for too long its high time we took our place in the sun again our own selves were a great country we ought to start acting like it by god some of the people in the little crowd in front of the platform clapped their hands ezra hutchinson didnt stand up there alone a dozen freedom party hardnoses in white shirts and butternut trousers backed him they all applauded like machines whenever he paused a little longer than usual they barked out freedom in sharp unison freedom echoed several voices from the crowd were a great country hutchinson repeated but who remembers that here in the csa the radical liberals hell notheyd rather be yankees the whigs oh they say they do but theyd rather suck up to the yankees i tell you the truth friends the only party that remembers when the confederate states had men in them is the freedom party that gave clarence potter the opening hed been waiting for he shouted the only party that shoots presidents is the freedom party people stirred and muttered wade hampton v was only a couple of years dead but a lot of folks didnt seem to want to remember how hed died the freedom party sure as hell didnt want people to remember how hed died it was doing its best to act respectable as far as potter was concerned its best could never be good enough some of the goons on the platform turned their heads his way more goons were sprinkled through the crowd some in the partys nearuniform others wearing their ordinary clothes but ezra hutchinson only smiled where were you during the war pal he asked freedom party men often believed they were the only ones whod done any fighting i was in the army of northern virginia potter answered loudly and distinctly where were you you fat tub of goo hutchinsons smile disappeared hed been a railroad scheduler during the great war and never come within a hundred miles of a fighting front but then he stuck out his chins and tried to make the best of it i served my country nobody can say i didnt serve my country he waited for potter to make some other gibe so he could give a sharper comeback but potter said nothing more he just let the candidates words hang in the air when hutchinson did try to go back to his speech he seemed flat uninspired several freedom party men started working their way back through the crowd toward potter he was there by himself he carried a pistolhe always carried a pistolbut he didnt want to use it unless he had to he slipped away and around the corner before any of the goons got a good look at him hed done what hed set out to do but in a way the freedom party men had done what theyd set out to do too theyd made him retreat and they would make it hard for other candidates to speak they werent shy about attacking their rivals gatherings jake featherston damn him had turned confederate politics into war who knows where featherston would be now if that grady calkins hadnt gone and shot president hampton potter thought but snipers were part of war too a part that had upped and bit the freedom party potter discovered the real problem at a whig meeting a few days later everything there was stable orderly democratic speaker yielded politely to speaker no one raised his voice no one got excited and potter was convinced no one could possibly have hoped to influence the voters or make them give a damn about keeping the whigs in power in richmond he threw his hand in the air and was in due course recognized i have a simple question for you mr chairman he said where are our hooligans to break up freedom party rallies the way featherstons bastards work so hard to break up ours people started buzzing you didnt often hear such questions at a gathering like this the chairmans gavel came down once twice three times robert e washburn was a veteran of the second mexican war he wore a big bushy white mustache and both looked and acted as if the nineteenth century had yet to give way to the twentieth you are out of order mr potter he said now i regret to state that i have had to point this out to you at previous gatherings as well heads bobbed up and down in polite agreement with washburns ruling too many of those heads were gray or balding the whigs had dominated confederate politics for a long time as the democrats had in the usa the democrats had got themselves a rude awakening potter feared the freedom party would give the csa a worse shock than the socialists had given the united states he said i am not out of order mr chairman and its a legitimate question when the damnyankees started using gas during the war we had to do the same or else leave the advantage with them if we dont fight featherstons fire with fire what becomes of us now down came the gavel again you are out of order mr potter washburn repeated your zeal for the cause has outrun your respect for the institutions of the confederate states of america he seemed to think that was plenty to quell potter if not to make him hang his head in shame but clarence potter remained unquelled featherstons got no respect for our institutions he pointed out if we keep too much were liable not to have any institutions left to respect after a while now heads went back and forth people didnt agree with him hed run into that before it drove him wild hed seen a plain truth and he couldnt get anyone else to see it jake featherston had come much too close to smashing his way to a victory in and he would be even more dangerous now if that calkins maniac hadnt shown up the freedom party for what it was potter felt like knocking these placidly disagreeing heads together that brought him up short im not so different from featherston after all am i robert e washburn said we rely upon the power of the police to protect us against any further uh unfortunate outbursts that was an answer of sorts but only of sorts and how many coppers start yelling freedom the minute they take off their gray suits potter asked how well do you think theyll do their job he did make the buzz in the room change tone a great many policemen favored the freedom party that was too notorious a truth to need retelling it had caused problems in and again in though the freedom party men had been on their best behavior then how could anybody think it wouldnt cause problems in the upcoming congressional election the local chairman was evidently of that opinion thank you for expressing your views with your usual vigor mr potter washburn said if we may now proceed to further items of business and that was that they didnt want to listen to him and what the whigs didnt want to do they didnt have to do more than sixty years of confederate independence had taught them as much and confirmed the lesson again and again what would teach them otherwise he wondered the answer to that seemed obvious enough losing to the freedom party as the charleston whigs droned on potter got to his feet and slipped out of their meeting nobody tried to call him back everybody seemed glad he was going they didnt want to hear their grip on things was endangered they deserve to lose by god he thought as he went out into the heat and humidity of a charleston summer but then remembering jake featherstons burning eyes as hed seen them again and again during the great war potter shook his head they almost deserve to lose no one deserves what those freedomshouting yahoos would give us if they won pigeons strutted along the street cooing gently they were slow and stupid and ever so confident nobody would bother them why not theyd proved right again and again and again this one stranger in their midst wouldnt prove any different would he clarence potter laughed he threw his arms wide some of the pigeons scurried back from him one or two even spread their wings and fluttered away a few feet most most kept right on strutting and pecking and paid him no attention whatsoever you goddamn dumb sons of bitches he told them laughing though it wasnt really funny you might as well be whigs the birds went right on ignoring him which proved his point he wondered whether the radical liberals would take him seriously odds were they would the freedom party after all was replacing them as the whigs principal opposition but then he wondered if it mattered whether the rad libs took him seriously it probably didnt no one except a few dreamers had ever thought the radical liberals could govern the csa they gave the states of the west and southwest a safety valve through which they could blow off steam when richmond ignored them as it usually did closer to the heart of the csa the radical liberals let people pretend the country really was a democratic republicwithout the risks and complications a real change of power would have entailed why do i bother potter wondered as he strode past the pigeons that fat and happy and brainless went on pretending he wasnt thereor if he was that he couldnt possibly be dangerous easier just to sit back and let nature take its course but he knew the answer to that it was simple enough he knew jake featherston ten years now since i walked into the first richmond howitzers encampment ten years since he told me jeb stuart iiis body servant might be a red and since jeb stuart iii being iii of an important family made sure nothing would happen to the nigger jeb stuart iii was dead of course hed looked for death when he realized hed made a bad mistake hed had plenty of oldfashioned confederate courage and honor but hed taken however many yankee bullets he took without having the faintest conception of just how bad a mistake hed made the whole confederacy is still finding out just how bad a mistake you made captain stuart clarence potter muttered a young woman coming the other waya young woman in a shockingly short skirt one that reached so high it let him see the bottom of her kneecapgave him a curious glance as she went by potter was by now used to garnering curious glances he wasnt nearly so used to women showing that much leg he looked back over his shoulder at her for a little while at least he forgot all about the freedom party w hen the steam whistle announcing shift change blew chester martin let out a sigh of relief it had been a good day on the steelmill floor everything had gone the way it was supposed to nobodyd got hurt you couldnt ask for more than that not in this business instead of heading straight home he stopped at the socialist party hall not far from the mill a good many men from his mill and others nearby sat and stood there talking steel and talking politics and winding down from the long hard weeks theyd just put in hows it going chester somebody called martin mimed falling over in exhaustion which got a laugh somebody else said they dont work us as hard as they worked our fathers only goes to show what you know albert chester retorted my old mans got one of those soft foremans jobs he hardly even has calluses on his hands any more except from pushing a pencil they work me a hell of a lot harder than they work him sold out to the people who own the means of production has he albert bauer saidhe was and always had been a socialist of the old school before chester could answer that someone else did it for him oh put a sock in it for christs sake were starting to own the means of production at least ive bought some shares of stock and ill bet you have too go on tell me im a liar bauer said not a word in fact so many people said not a word that something close to silence fell for a moment have that many of us bought stocks chester wondered he had a few shares himself and knew his father had more than a few stephen douglas martin had been picking up a share here a share there ever since he started making good money when he wasnt conscripted into the great war funny martin said the party talks about government owning the means of production but it never says much about the proletariat buying em up one piece at a time marx never figured anything like that would happen someone said neither did lincoln back when they lived you couldnt make enough money to have any left over to invest as long as wall street keeps going up and up though youd have to be a damn fool not to throw your money that way somebody else said its like stealing only its legal and buying on margin makes it even easier nobody argued with him even now most of the men who left their jobs at the steel mills left only because they were too old or too physically worn or too badly hurt to do them any more those were the people for whom the socialists were trying to push their oldage insurance policy through congress but if you could quit your work at sixtyfive or even sixty and be sure you had enough left to live on for the rest of your days thanks to what youd done for yourself while you were working if you could manage that the whole country would start looking different in twenty or thirty years ill turn sixtyfive in martin thought it didnt seem so impossibly far awaybut then he had just put in that long long day at the mill he rode the trolley home ate supper with his parents and his sister and went to bed when the windup alarm clock next to his head clattered the next morning he just turned it off he didnt have a moments sleepy panic thinking it was some infernal device falling on his trench ive been home from the great war for a while now he thought as he put on a clean work shirt and overalls but he would take a couple of puckered scars on his left arm to the grave as it had on so many the war had left its mark on him when he went into the kitchen his father was already there smoking his first cigar of the day his mother fried eggs and potatoes in lard she used a woodhandled iron spatula to flip some onto a plate for him heres your breakfast dear she said do you want some coffee please he said and she poured him a cup his father said saturday todayonly a half day chester nodded as he doctored the coffee with cream and sugar thats right you know i wont be home very long thoughim going out with rita stephen douglas martin nodded you already told us yeah his mother gave him an approving smile have a good time son i think i will chester dug into the hash browns and eggs so he wouldnt have to show his amusement his folks had decided they approved of rita habicht or at least of his seeing her they must have started to wonder if he would ever see anybody seriously but he wasnt the only great war veteran in no hurry to get on with that particular part of his life plenty of men he knew whod been through the mill and as a steelworker he understood exactly what that phrase meant were still single even though theyd climbed into their thirties it was as if theyd given so much in the trenches they had little left for the rest of their lives he took the trolley past the halfscale statue of remembrancewho would have looked fiercer without half a dozen pigeons perched on her sword armto the mill where he put in his four hours then he hurried back home washed up shaved and changed from overalls work shirt and cloth cap to trousers white shirt and straw hat im off he told his mother you look very nice louisa martin said he would have been happier if she hadnt said that every time he went anywhere but stillyou took what you could get he rode the trolley again this time to the block of flats where rita lived she had one of her own shed got married just before the war started her husband had stopped a bullet or a shell in one of the endless battles on the roanoke front martin had fought there too till he got wounded hed never met joe habicht but that proved exactly nothing rita had had a baby too and lost it to diphtheria the day after its second birthday women fought their own battles even if not with guns through everything though shed managed to hang on to the apartment she didnt keep chester waiting when he knocked on the door his heart beat faster as she opened it hi he said a big silly grin on his face how are you fine thanks she patted at her dark blond hair it was a little damp she must have washed after getting back from her saturday half day too its good to see you its good to be here he said and leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek you look real pretty rita smiled you always tell me that i always mean it too but martin started to laugh when she asked him what was funny he wouldnt tell her ill be damned if i want to admit i sound just like my mother he thought instead he said shall we go on over to the orpheum sure she said whos playing there today those four crazy brothers from new york are heading the bill he answered oh good they are funny rita said i was in stitches the last time they came through toledo that had been a couple of years before she and chester hadnt known each other then he wondered with whom shed seen the comics that she had a past independent of him occasionally bothered him though hed never stopped to wonder if his independent past bothered her but neither of them had seen anybody else for several months now that suited chester fine and seemed to suit rita pretty well too they held hands at the trolley stop an old lady clucked disapprovingly but they paid no attention to her things were looser now than they had been when she was a young woman as far as chester martin was concerned that was all to the good too he was sorry when the trolley car came clanging up so soon he slid a silver dollar to the tickettaker at the orpheum and got back a half dollar and two yellow tickets he and rita went up to the first balcony and found some seats he took her hand there too she leaned her head on his shoulder when the house lights went down he gave her a quick kiss a girl singer and a magician led off the show as far as martin was concerned the magician couldnt have disappeared fast enough a traineddog act ended abruptly when the dog which could jump and fetch and even climb ladders to ring a bell at the top proved not to be trained in a much more basic way he got an enormous laugh but not one of a sort the fellow in black tie who worked with him had in mind the dancer who came on next got another laugh by softshoeing out holding his nose i wouldnt have done that rita said even though shed laughed too now hell squabble with the man with the dog all the way to the end of the tour chester wouldnt have thought of that for himself once she said it he realized she was bound to be right at last after a couple of other acts martin knew he wouldnt remember ten minutes after he left the orpheum the engels brothers came out along with the tall skinny dreadfully dignified woman who served as their comic foil they were all young men not far from chesters age but got their name from the enormous fuzzy beards they wore one of the beards was dyed red one yellow one blue and the fourth left black from the balcony martin couldnt tell if the beards were real or fakes for the comics sake he hoped they were phony the brother with the undyed beard talked enough for any three men the one with the yellow beard didnt talk at all but was so limber he seemed to have no bones the one with the blue beard tried to slap everybody else into line the one with the red beard spent all his time chasing the tall skinny woman who seemed more bewildered than flattered by his attentions at one point they all started pelting one another with oranges it might have been trench warfare up thereby the way the engels brothers dodged around the prop furniture theyd been in the trenchesexcept that the woman kept standing up and getting nailed by the time theyd finished the stage was a worse mess much worse than it had been after the dog act but this was a lot funnier too the engels brother with the black beard proved the sole survivor he looked out at the audience and said orange you glad you arent up here the curtain came down that was i dont know exactly what that was but i dont know when ive laughed so hard either rita said as she got up and made her way toward the exit since chester martin was rubbing at his streaming eyes with his handkerchief he couldnt very well argue with her they had supper at a diner across the street from the orpheum then took the trolley back to ritas block of flats i had a wonderful time she said as she fumbled in her handbag for the key i always have a terrific time with you rita chester hesitated then asked can i come in for a minute please she hesitated too she was careful of her reputation hed seen that from the first time he took her out he liked it she said youre not going to beyou knowdifficult are you he would have liked nothing better than to be difficult but he solemnly shook his head cross my heart he answered and did all right rita opened the door and flipped on a light the place is a mess it was to martins eye perfectly neat rita sat down on the overstuffed sofa she patted the upholstery next to her asking what have you got in mind instead of sitting there chester awkwardly went to one knee in front of her her eyes got very big tongue stumbling heart pounding he repeated i always have a terrific time with you i dont think id ever want to be with anybody else will youwill you marry me rita he took a velvet jewelry box from his pocket and flipped it open to show her a ring set with a tiny chip of diamond she stared at him i wondered if you were going to ask me that tonight she whispered and then the ring is beautiful youre beautiful he said will you of course i will she answered afterwards he wasnt quite sure who kissed whom first when he came up for air he gasped you never kissed me like that before well you never asked me to marry you before either rita answered he laughed they kissed again heart pounding he asked what else dont i know youll find out she said after the wedding s cipio paid five cents for a copy of the augusta constitutionalist in one way that struck him as a lot of money to shell out for a newspaper in another considering that he would have paid millions if not billions of dollars when the currency went crazy a couple of years before it wasnt so bad thanks uncle said the white man who took his money he didnt answer he just opened up the paper and read it as he hurried towards erasmus fish market and restaurant had he answered what would he have said angry at himself for even wondering he shook his head as he walked along white men never called black men mister not in the confederate states of america they didnt if he held his breath till they started to hed end up mighty mighty blue the fellow with the pile of papers at his feet would just have called him an uppity nigger or maybe a crazy nigger if hed complained maybe the worst of it was the white man had been trying to be polite i cant win scipio thought why do i bother imagining i could even more to the point he wondered why hed wasted any money on the paper the headline screamed about a lurid love triangle that had ended in an axe murder it would have been made to seem a lot more lurid had the parties involved been colored or on the other hand it might not have made the paper at all in that case a lot of whites expected negroes to act that way and took it for granted when they did much smaller stories talked about congressional candidates latest promises scipio wondered why he bothered even glancing at those it wasnt as if he could vote but the remarks of eldridge p dinwiddie the freedom party candidate in augusta did make his eyes widen as if hed just poured down a couple of cups of erasmus strong chicorylaced coffee too many red rebels are still hiding in plain sight dinwiddie was quoted as saying the whigs have forgotten all about them going after them would remind people of how badly the party thats in power bungled the war effort but if you elect me ill make sure they arent forgotten and are brought to justice i aim to see all those nigger traitors hang mr dinwiddie wrote the reporter whod listened to him received prolonged and vociferous support for his suggestion hell wid mistuh dinwiddie scipio muttered under his breath being one of those fugitive reds himself he didnt care for the notion of getting hunted down and hanged here and there faded posters still offered a reward for his capture but that was in another country and besides the wench is dead every so often a phrase from the education anne colleton had made him acquire floated up out of his memory this one fit south carolina might have been another country the name on his passbook here in georgia was xerxes everyone here even his wife knew him by that name and no other anne colleton though wasnt dead if she ever saw him he would be and in short order like most late summer days in augusta this one was hot and muggy scipio shivered even so foreign news got shoved onto page three thered been another battle in the endless mexican civil war imperial forces claimed victory the rebels werent calling them liars too loudly so maybe theyd actually won venezuela and colombia were talking about going to war with each other the paper said the united states had sent the kaiser a note warning him against arming or encouraging the venezuelans and that hed denied doing any such thingand warned the usa against encouraging or arming the colombians a party called french action had caused riots in paris at the same time as the french government claimed it was two years ahead of schedule in paying reparations in germany japanese aeroplanes had bombed a town somewhere in china he was so engrossed in the article about allowing the forward pass in footballsome people condemned it as a damnyankee innovation while others claimed it added excitement to the gamehe almost walked past erasmus place mornin xerxes his boss said when he came in mornin scipio answered how you is tolerable erasmus said little bettern tolerable mebbe hows your ownself scipio shrugged not bad is gettin by cant ask much moren that not till judgment day anyways erasmus raised a saltandpepper eyebrow you saved xerxes how do i answer that scipio wondered his education had weakened his faith and he discovered so had his time with the red rebels all of whom had been as passionate in their disbelief as a lot of christians were in their belief he hadnt thought the marxist ideology had rubbed off on him but it seemed to have after all after a moments thought he said hope so should ought to be able to say bettern that erasmus said but then to scipios relief he let it go pointing to the constitutionalist he asked you done with that done wid it now yeah scipio answered the only thing he could have said erasmus didnt put up with reading on the job that wasnt because he couldnt read a newspaper himself though he couldnt it was because when you worked for erasmus you worked for erasmus throw it on the fishwrappin pile then erasmus said as scipio did he asked what you think bout de forard pass boss bunch o damn foolishness you ask me erasmus answered anybody got the time to git all hot and bothered about it gots too goddamn much time an dats the lords truth devil fill up your time just fine you bet forward pass he rolled his eyes might as well worry over that other damnfool damnyankee gamewhat the hell they call it baseball dats the name scipio had never seen a baseball game or even a baseball in his life because he wasor rather had beenwidely read he knew the sport was played in the northeastern part of the united states but it had never caught on all across the usa the way football had and it certainly hadnt caught on in the confederate states erasmus eyed him you got any more ways o wastin time fore you starts earnin what i pays you only one scipio said with a grin he grabbed a mug and poured it full of coffee from the big pot on the stove then added cream and sugar but he didnt sit down to drink it he carried it with him as he started sweeping and tidying up erasmus had a steaming mug at his side too as long as scipio worked hard the older man didnt mind coffee or things like that the first breakfast customer came in a couple of minutes later mornin aristotle scipio said how you is by now he knew dozens of regulars by name and preferences you wants de usual sure enough do aristotle answered scipio turned to erasmus who was already doing up a plate of ham and eggs and grits erasmus knew his customers even better than scipio did they were his after all after the breakfast rush petered out scipio washed a young mountain of dishes and silverware then dried them and stacked them neatly to get ready for lunch which would be even more hectic once hed done that he helped erasmus clean catfish and crappie the proprietor would fry a lot of them during lunch and even more during dinner erasmus was a wizard with a knife every cut he made was perfect and he moved as fast as any slicing machine scipio you makes me shamed scipio said for erasmus could clean three fish to his one and do a neater better job on them to boot watchin you makes me shamed shouldnt ought to erasmus answered you is doin the best you kin good lord dont want no moren dat from nobody i been cuttin up fish for a livin since i was ten years old maybe you went fishin couplethree times a year gutted what you cotched it make a difference it surely do mebbe scipio would have thought erasmus was humoring him but erasmus had no sense of humor when it came to work none at all and now his boss said yous bettern you was too an dats a good thing you didnt get no better dont reckon id let you mess around with knives no more scipio looked at his hands he had a couple of cuts along with several scars hed picked up earlier seeing what he was doing erasmus held out his own hands he had more scars than scipio could count a maze a spiderweb of scars new old short long and in between do jesus scipio said softly erasmus only shrugged aint nobody perfect xerxes aint nobody even close to perfect yeah is pretty damn good but i been doin this goin on fifty years now every so often the knife is gonna slip uhhuh scipio couldnt take his eyes off those battered hands hed noticed them but he hadnt really studied them they repaid study like so many who did something supremely well erasmus had suffered for his art scipio kept looking at them till a fat woman came in and asked erasmus for three pounds of crawdads what have i got that shows what ive done with my life scipio wondered only one thing occurred to him the way he talked or could talk if doing so wouldnt put him in mortal danger he felt smarter when he talked like an educated white man than he did using the thick congaree river negro dialect that was his only other way of putting his thoughts out for the world to know he didnt suppose he actually was smarter but the illusion was powerful and it lingered erasmus wrapped the crawdads in the augusta constitutionalist scipio had been reading that morning the woman paid him said thank you kindly and left i been tellin you and tellin you erasmus said you ought to save your money and git yourself your own place you end up doin a lot better working for your ownself than you do when you works for me dont like tellin folks what they gots to do scipio answered not for the first time reckon i kinif hed run marshlands for anne colleton he could surely manage a little cafe for himselfbut i dont like it none you gots to have some fire in your belly to do a proper job erasmus agreed but you gots to have some fire in your belly to git ahead any which way he eyed scipio speculatively scipio concentrated on cleaning a catfish he was better at doing what others told him than at telling others what to do back at marshlands hed had annes potent authority behind him if he started his own business hed be the authority no he didnt care for that still feeling erasmus eye on him he said i gits by he sounded defensive and he knew it erasmus said any damn fool can get by you could do better an you should ought to scipio didnt answer before too long the first dinner customers started coming in he hurried back and forth from the stove to the tables out front the sizzle and crackle of fish going into hot oil filled the place he served and took money and made change and then did endless dishes getting ready for the next morning when he finally left erasmus stayed behind still busy and when he got back to his flat bathsheba was waiting at the door to give him a kiss her eyes glowed scipio hoped he knew what she had in mind and hoped that after a long hard day he could perform he turned out to be wrongor at least not exactly right she took his hand and set it just above her navel we gonna have us a young un she said all of a sudden scipio discovered he might have fire in his belly after all h ipolito rodriguez knew he should have counted himself a lucky man for one thing hed come through the great war without a scratch if that by itself wasnt enough to make him light candles in the church in the little mining town of baroyeca he couldnt imagine what would be and for another baroyeca lay in the confederate state of sonora not in the empire of mexico farther south it was close enough to the border to hear the echoes of the civil war that convulsed the country of which sonora had once been a part but not close enough to have let any of the fighting come near nothing bothered baroyeca very much a couple of men hadnt come home from the war in the north a few others had come home but maimed mostly though days went on as they always had rodriguezs farm outside of town yielded no better crops than it ever had but he managed to keep his wife three sons and two daughters fed and every so often he had enough money left in his pocket to go into town and spend some time at la culebra verde the green snakethe cantina across the street from the church where he lit candles to thank god for his salvation having been preserved alive didnt he have the right to enjoy himself every once in a while why not carlos ruiz said when he posed the question out loud one day carlos was his age and had fought in tennessee where things had been by all accounts much worse than his own experience in texas ruiz asked his counterquestion in english not spanish si why not rodriguez agreed the last two words also in english he dropped back into spanish to continue my children speak as much of the new language as of the old ten million devils from hell take me if i know whether to be glad or sorry if you want them to stay here and be farmers or marry farmers spanish is good enough ruiz saidin spanish if you hope they try to make money english is better he was a farmer himself and wore the ribbon for a purple heart on his baggy cotton shirt had he been a rich man or a townsman or even someone who hadnt also fought in the north hipolito rodriguez might have got angry especially since hed been drinking for a while as things were he only shrugged and said how much good will english do people who look like us carlos like ruiz like almost everybody in baroyeca he was short with redbrown skin and hair blacker than moonless midnight even with english what are we but a couple of damn greasers the last five words were in the official language of the confederacy we may be greasers ruiz said also in english but we aint no niggers mallates he added in spanish in case rodriguez didnt understand him then back to english in the law were the same as anybody else that was true the people of sonora and chihuahua were confederate citizens not merely residents of the csa they could vote they could run for office they couldif they were rich enough which some few weremarry whites from the other states in the confederacy they could and yet rodriguez sighed and took another pull at the beer in front of him the law it means only so much that was also true if it werent for negroes sonorans and chihuahuans would have been at the bottom of the pile most confederates who called themselves white looked down their noses at them rodriguez had seen as much during the war the first time hed ever had much to do with ordinary whites when the election comes who will you vote for ruiz asked rodriguez shrugged my patron is a radical liberal ever since sonora and chihuahua came into the csa small farmers like him had voted as the great landowners in the area wanted them to vote but like so many things that wasnt quite as it had been before the great war rodriguez didnt want to say as much out loud though what he didnt say couldnt get back to anyone he lifted his cup emptied it and asked the same question of carlos ruiz ruiz gave back the same shrug don joaquin is a radical liberal too hipolito rodriguez nodded the radical liberals had been strong in the confederate southwest for years voting for them had always been a way to show richmond the people here werent happy with the neglect the whigs gave them id better go home rodriguez said setting his mug on the table in front of him if i go now magdalena wont yell at me so much he got to his feet the room swayed slightly but only slightly im not drunk he thought of course im not drunk hasta luego amigo ruiz said by the way he sat he wasnt going anywhere for quite a while luego rodriguez answered he walked to the doorsteadily enough all things consideredand left la culebra verde the cantina had thick adobe walls that kept out the worst of the heat when he went out into the street it smote full force his broadbrimmed straw hat helped some but only some he sighed as he drew in a lungful of bakeoven air hed known it would be like this it always was baroyeca looked a lot like any other little sonoran town the main street was unpaved dust hung in the air horses and a few motorcars stood in front of shops like the cantina most of the rest of the buildings were of adobe some had roofs of halfround red tiles some of thatch a few of corrugated tin a roadrunner trotted down the street as if it owned it the bird held a stillwriggling lizard in its beak when a stray dog came towards it it flapped up into the branches of a cottonwood tree and gulped the lizard down the dog sent a reproachful stare after it as if to say thats not fair lifes not fair rodriguez muttered both dog and roadrunner ignored him advertising slogans were painted on the whitewashed fronts of the shops here and there signs and posters added to the urge to sell rodriguez remembered his father saying there hadnt been so many of those when he was young posterswell printed in both spanish and englishextolled the virtues of horacio castillo who was seeking a fourth term in the confederate congress castillo his pictures showed was a plump man with a neat thin mustache for progress and security vote radical liberal his posters said a few posters also touted the whig candidate vicente valenzuela wouldnt win but hed put up a respectable showing and then there were the scrawls on the walls again in both spanish and englishlibertad some said while others shouted freedom rodriguez eyed them thoughtfully the freedom party had never been strong in sonora up till this election it probably wouldnt win now either but it was making itself known in ways it hadnt before most of what rodriguez knew about the freedom party was that it wanted another go at the usa and wanted to keep black men in their place he didnt like the usa either and if black men werent on the bottom in the csa he would be so he wanted them kept down but a freedom party man had murdered the president of the confederacy rodriguez scowled that was no way to behave he sighed it was too bad if people could only forget that he sighed again and headed for his farm a horsedrawn wagon coming into town kicked up more dust a yellowgray cloud of it a couple of men with rifles rode atop the wagon they gave rodriguez a hard watchful stare as it rattled past he sighed yet again he was no bandido and even if he were a bandido it wasnt as if the silver mines in the hills outside of baroyeca yielded enough precious metal to be worth stealing fewer than half as many miners as before the war went down into those dark shafts if the mine ever failed altogether what would become of baroyeca he didnt like to think about that either high up in the sky several vultures wheeled riding the columns of hot air that rose from the baking ground if baroyeca dried up and blew away even the vultures might not find enough to eat in this valley after not quite half an hour rodriguez got back to his farm he raised corn and beans and squashes and chickens and pigs a sturdy mule one of the best for miles around did the plowing and hauling he raised almost all his own food but if baroyeca fails what will i do for salt and nails and cotton cloth and coffee and all the other things i cant make for myself he clicked his tongue between his teeth he had no idea a scrawny dog ran toward him growling and baring its teeth callate maximiliano rodriguez shouted the dog skidded to a stop about ten feet away it whined and wagged its tail as if to say well you might have been someone dangerous and i was on the job rodriguez wasnt fooled hed had maximiliano for three years now and had never seen a stupider dog hed known exactly what he was doing when he named the beast for the emperor of mexico on the other side of the border naming a dog for the emperor might have got him stood up against a wall and shot for a rebel all things considered he was just as glad to be where he was his older daughter guadalupe carried a hen by the feet toward the chopping block by the house spit flooded into rodriguezs mouth at the thought of chicken stew or any of the other interesting things magdalena his wife could do with the bird he waved to guadalupe she was eleven now shed been born just before he got conscripted it wouldnt be more than another year or two before she started having a real shape before boys began sniffing around and before life began wheeling through a new cycle the thought made him feel old though hed just passed thirty in the house miguel and jorge were wrestling they were less than a year apart seven and six and jorge the younger was big for his age so the match was pretty even susana who was five watched them with her thumb in her mouth probably glad they werent picking on her rodriguez didnt see pedro the youngest he was probably taking a nap hola rodriguez said to magdalena who sat patting tortillas into shape his mouth watered again as far as he was concerned she made the best tortillas in the whole valley hola she answered cocking her head to one side to study him como estas he recognized that gesture and straightened up in indignation im not drunk he declared magdalena didnt answer right away after shed finished studying him though she nodded no youre not she admitted good and whats new in town its still there he said which given the state of the silver mine wasnt altogether a joke he added a wagon came into town from the mine while i was walking home yes i saw it go by magdalena said who was at the cantina whats the gossip i was mostly talking with carlos he answered we were going on about how you hear more and more english these days he spoke in spanish magdalena was far more comfortable in it than in the other language she nodded even so the way the older children bring it back from school i wonder if their children will know any spanish at all its good they go to school in english or spanish rodriguez said maybe then they wont have to break their backs and break their hearts every day the way a farmer does magdalena raised an eyebrow rodriguez felt heat under his swarthy skin he hadnt broken his back today he spread his hands as if to say you want too much if you expect me to work hard every day his wife didnt say anything she didnt have to the eyebrow had already done the job rodriguez said and we talked politics ah magdalena perked up what will you do here in sonora womens suffrage was a distant glow on the horizon if that she couldnt vote herself but that didnt keep her from being interested i dont know yet rodriguez answered i dont know but i think i may just vote for the freedom party b rakes squeaking a little the birmingham pulled up in front of the freedom party offices in richmond jake featherstons guards fanned out and formed a perimeter on the sidewalk they were well armed and alert they might have been about to clear the damnyankees out of a stretch of trench featherstons enemies inside the csa werent so obvious as us soldiers in greengray but they probably hated him even more than the yankees had hated their confederate foes soldiering sometimes was just a job jake had also discovered politics was a serious business one of the guards nodded and gestured as jake came forward from the building another guard opened the curbside door for him freedom the man said as he got into the motorcar freedom henry featherston echoed he settled himself on the padded seat this beat the hell out of life as an artillery sergeant any way you looked at it freedom the driver said putting the birmingham in gear freedom virgil featherston answered everything ready at the other end far as i know sarge virgil joyner made that sound as if he were addressing a general not a noncom yes this was a pretty good life all right they went only a few blocks when the driver pulled to a stop featherston scowled what the hell he said angrily a squad of freedom party guards were arguing with some richmond policemen in oldfashioned gray uniforms several reporters scribbled in notebooks a photographers flash immortalized the moment featherston got out of the motorcar in a hurry whats going on here he demanded this is a polling place one of the cops said no electioneering allowed within a hundred feet far as im concerned they sure as hell count as electioneering he pointed to the armed guards were just here to protect mr featherston one of the men in notquiteconfederate uniform insisted he sounded ready for business the policemen looked nervous well they mightthe freedom party guards outgunned them and had proved to the csa they werent shy about mixing it up with the police or with anyone else they didnt like here though jake judged it a good time to walk soft its all right boys he said as genially as he could dont reckon anybodyll take a shot at me while i go and vote he walked past the policemen and toward the doorway above which the stars and bars fluttered the guards didnt look happy like watchdogs they wanted to stay with their master all the time but once hed decided they didnt argue the cops didnt bother hiding their relief who you gonna vote for mr featherston a reporter shouted freedomthe straight ticket jake answered with a wave and a grin despite that cocky grin he remained alert as he went to the polling place if anybody wanted to take a shot at him this was a hell of a good place to do it if a rifle muzzle came out of that building where would he jump or from that one or that one he hadnt fought in the trenchesthe first richmond howitzers had been in back of thembut hed had plenty of bullets whip past his head he knew everything that needed knowing about diving for cover no shots rang out he strode into the polling place with grin intact a man coming out of a curtained booth recognized him did a double take and grinned a grin of his own a big delighted one freedom the fellow blurted freedom featherston said somber disapproving coughs from the officials at the polling place four or five graybeards who might have fought in the second mexican war or maybe even the war of secession but surely not in the great war one of them said no electioneering gentlemen if you please right jake said he was doing this by the rules he scrawled his name and address in their registry book and went into the booth the fellow whod recognized him had vacated as hed told the reporter he would he put an x by the name of the freedom candidates for congress for the virginia assembly and state senate and for the richmond city council the last race was nominally nonpartisan but everybody knew better with the whigs and radical liberals pretty evenly split in the district he thought the freedom party man had a decent chance of sneaking home a winner too after finishing the ballot he went out and presented it to the election officials one of them folded it and put it into the ballot box jacob featherston has voted he intoned solemnly jacob featherston is a murdering son of a bitch said a man whod come out of his voting booth a moment after jake emerged from his more coughs from the old men none of that here one of them said another took the ballot oscar herbert has voted he declared a few years earlier when the freedom party was just getting off the ground jake featherston would have mixed it up with herbert right outside the polling place or maybe here inside it he was no less angry now but he was shrewder than he had been some day soon pal somebodys gonna pay you a little visit he thought your names oscar herbert and you live in this precinct well find you you bet we will herbert went one way featherston the other he walked through the cops and out to his guards with audible sighs of relief they closed in around him photographers took more flash pictures he waved to them how many seats do you expect to lose this time a reporter called whats that jake cupped a hand behind his ear as he got into the birmingham spent too long in the artillery and my ears arent what they ought to be he slammed the car door before the reporter could finish the question again he had lost some hearing during the war but not so much as that still artillerymans ear came in handy for avoiding questions he didnt want to answer back to headquarters sarge the driver asked you bet featherston answered the car pulled away from the curb on the short ride over to party headquarters jake contemplated the question hed pretended not to hear he liked none of the answers he came up with his best guess was that freedom would lose seats in the house of representatives he hoped the party would hold its own but he didnt believe it and if he lost seatshe took everything personally as he always hadhow long would people keep finding him a force to be reckoned with we were so close he muttered so goddamn close whats that virgil joyner said nothin not a thing jake lied without hesitation when he got back to freedom party headquarters he wished he hadnt gone and voted so soon he had nothing to do but sit around and wait and stare at the banks of telegraph clickers and phones and wireless sets that would bring in the election results when there were election results to bring in that wouldnt be for a while yet polls in virginia didnt close till seven pm and those farther west would stay open a couple of hours longer than that meanwhile meanwhile he did some more scribbling in over open sights hed fiddled with themaybe journal was the right name for itnow and again in the days since the great war but hed never quite managed to recapture the heat hed known while writing it in the odd moments when he wasnt throwing threeinch shells at the damnyankees one of these days he told himself one of these days ill be ready to put it out and people will be ready to read it ill know when im sure ill know when but the time isnt ripe yet he fiddled with the pile of gray eagle scratchpads in lieu of twiddling his thumbs and accomplished about as much as he would have twiddling them he changed a word here took out a couple of words there added a phrase somewhere else it all added up to nothing and he knew that too his secretary stuck her head into the office can i get you something to eat mr featherston she asked as if she were his mother he wouldnt have taken that from anyone elsecertainly not from his real mother were she still alive but he nodded now thank you kindly lulu he said some fried chickend go down mighty nice about now ill take care of it she promised and hurried away take care of it she did as she always did jake ate like a wolf no matter how much he ate his gaunt form never added an ounce he ate as much from duty as from hunger his stomach would pain him no matter what when he watched the returns coming in but it would pain him less with food in there a little before seven freedom party leaders and telegraph operators gathered at the headquarters featherston made himself greet them made himself shake hands and smile and slap backs the way hed made himself eat it needed doing so he did it but it was a distraction he could have done without polls are closing said somebodysomebody with a gift for the obviousas church bells all through richmond chimed seven times a minute or so later the very first returns began coming over the wire they meant as little as the changes jake had made in over open sights earlier in the day but everybody exclaimed over them even so featherston did a little exclaiming himself when a freedom party candidate jumped into an early lead in a virginia district hed been sure was safely whig maybe the people are wising up he said i hope they are god damn it in the first days of the great war hed thought the confederate army would drive everything before it too hed taken unholy glee in shelling washington and hed delighted in swarming up into pennsylvania and toward philadelphia if the de facto capital of the usa had fallen along with the de jure one but philadelphia had held and inch by painful inch the cs army had been driven back through pennsylvania and maryland and into virginia itself if the niggers hadnt risen up and stabbed us in the back but he knew they had however much white men nowadays tried to pretend otherwise on one of the competing wireless sets an announcer said if this trend holds up it looks like the third district in south carolina will be coming back to the whigs in the next congress after staying in freedom party hands these past two terms curses ran through the headquarters featherstons loud among them the party had held that seat in the debacle of hed counted on holding it again maybe the people werent wising up after all maybe they were an even bigger pack of damned idiots than hed thought a colored waiter hired for the occasion brought around a tray of drinks featherston took a whiskey the negro nodded respectfully as he did jake tossed back the drink his mouth tightened where were you in the uprising you sorry black son of a bitch you didnt have a penguin suit on then i bet probably just another goddamn red if wed shot a few thousand bastards like you before you got out of line we wouldnt have had any trouble like we did he had some sharp things to say about that in over open sights another freedom party seat this one from arkansas went down the drain amid more curses somebody said well we didnt elect any senators till so we dont have to worry about them for another couple o years that was exactly the wrong attitude to take as far as jake was concerned were playing this game to win dammit he snarled we dont play not to lose we dont play safe were playing to win and were gonna win remember it damn you all nobody argued with him not out loud but nobody seemed anything close to convinced either that meant he got to crow extra loud when out of a clear blue sky the freedom candidate won a tight threeway race for governor of texas and then in the wee small hours of the morning when a new freedom congressman came in from of all places southern sonora see boys featherston said around a yawn we aint dead yet not even close i hope not even close anyhow americanempire thecentercannothold vi d uring the great war nellie jacobs had heard more aeroplane motors above washington dc than shed ever wanted to aeroplane motors back in those days had always meant trouble either observers were over the city taking photographs to guide bombers and artillery or else the bombers themselves paid calls raining destruction and death down on the confederate occupiers later confederate bombers had tried to slaughter us soldiers in washington neither side cared much about civilians nellie had needed years after the war to stop wanting to duck whenever motors droned overhead now though she and her husband stood in the street on the bright crisp new years day of staring into the blue sky pointing and exclaiming in excitement like a couple of children look there it is hal jacobs said pointing again i see it nellie answered looks like a big old fat cigar up there in the sky doesnt it it certainly does hal said that is just what it looks like i think clara tugged at nellies skirt ma i have to go potty she said well go on in and go nellie said impatiently your dad and me were going to stay right here and watch the zeppelin a while longer clara made the beginnings of a whimper go on nellie told her go on or ill warm your fanny for you youre going to be six this year you dont need me to hold your hand any more when you go tinkle her daughter ducked into the coffeehouse nellie kept staring up at the kronprinz friedrich wilhelm as it neared the mooring station that had been set up at the top of the newly refinished washington monument can you believe it hal said it flew all the way across the atlantic all the way across the ocean without stopping once what an age we live in paper says the crown prince himself is in there nellie tried to point to the little passenger gondola hanging beneath the great cigarshaped gas bag on a state visit to president sinclair as clara came back hal nodded his voice was troubled we fought side by side with kaiser bill all through the great war sad we should squabble with germany now i hope friedrich wilhelm can patch things up thatd be good nellie agreed dont want to worry about little armstrong going off to war one of these days she doted on her grandson not least because her daughter edna had to take care of him most of the time ednas half sister clara on the other hand had been a not altogether welcome surprise and was an ungodly amount of work for a woman well into middle age she would thank god be going back to kindergarten in a few more days suddenly the zeppelins engines stopped buzzing theyve got it hal said as if he personally had been the one to moor the kronprinz friedrich wilhelm to the white stone tower he sounded delighted to repeat himself what an age we live in when my father was born there was no telegraph and hardly any railroads and now we have these wireless sets andthis he pointed toward the washington monument again its something all right nellie agreed but then perhaps incautiously she went on i dont know that its all to the good not all to the good her husband looked indignant what do you mean what could be grander thanthat oh itsswell the young people say now nellie brought out the slang selfconsciously like anyone of her generation she was much more used to bully but when your pa was born hal this here was all one country too you know weve spilled an awful lot o blood since on account of it aint any more well yes of course he said the two of them in conquered and reconquered washington had seen more spilled blood than most civilians he sighed and breathed out a big puffy cloud of steam i cant imagine how things could have been any different though you might as well talk about us losing the revolution and still belonging to england i suppose youre right nellie sighed hal was the sensible one in the family he was as far as she was concerned sometimes sensible to a fault clara came back out nellie absentmindedly ruffled her hair then she decided to be sensible too and said now weve seen it lets go inside its cold out here oh ma nobody had ever accused clara of being sensible but hal said your mother is right if you stay out here too long you could catch pneumonia and then where would you be id be out here having a good time clara answered pneumonia was just a word to her not one of the many diseases that could so easily kill children come on in nellie said she knew what pneumonia was all right edna and uncle merle and cousin armstrong are coming over in a little while that did get clara back inside at the price of continual questionswhen will they come why arent they here yettill her half sister ednas husband and their son arrived half an hour later armstrong pulled claras hair she squalled like a cat that had had its tail stepped on then stamped on his foot hard enough to make him wail even louder he got little sympathy from his mother serves you right edna said i saw what you did to clara happy new year merle grimes said above the wails of the two irate children behind his goldrimmed spectacles irony glinted in his eyes well i do hope the rest of itll be happier than this godawful racket nellie said maybe the crown prince will bury the hatchet once and for all hed like to bury it in our backs i think grimes said one of these days we really will have to worry about germany the germans are worrying about us right this minute and you can bet your bottom dollar on that hal handed him a whiskey after they clinked glasses and toasted nellies husband said well have a hard time worrying about germany when we dont even worry about the csa i know grimes said well good old kaiser bills got other worries besides us too and thats not bad nellie raised her glass for a toast of her own heres to no more war anywhere she said once shed caught everybodys eye havent we had enough amen her husband said and drank i know ive had enough enough and then some her soninlaw said he drank too wasnt for those miserable confederateshe didnt swear around women but hed come close therei wouldnt limp for the rest of my days edna also drank i hope they never ever come anywhere near washington again she said nellie eyed her daughter edna looked back defiantly but couldnt help turning red shed nearly married a confederate officer in fact she would have married him if a us shell hadnt killed him on his way to the altar almost ten years ago now nellie thought amazed wondering where the time had gone as far as she knew merle grimes had no idea nicholas h kincaid had ever existed that was ednas worry not her own she had secrets in her past too secrets she wanted to stay buried till they shoveled dirt over her her husband reminded her of those secrets by pouring everyones glass full and proposing a toast of his own heres to our missing friends gone but not forgotten oh god yes merle said and gulped that drink down his mouth tightened harsh lines sprang out at its corners too many good fellows dead for no reason ernie and clancy and bob and otis and behind his spectacles tears glinted and bill reach too hal jacobs sounded as maudlin as his stepdaughters husband he was worth a division maybe more in getting the confederates out of washington i wish hed lived to see this day with an american empire stretching north to south east to west he sighed he should have too just bad luck now edna eyed nellie now nellie flushed and had trouble meeting her daughters eye she didnt reckon bill reach a missing friend reach had mortified her during the war drunkenly taking her for the strumpet shed been a long time before shed never been able to tell edna anything since not hoping to be taken seriously but not even edna knew how bill reach had died no one but nellie knew that which was just how she wanted things shed been foraging for supplies when he tried to rape her counting on a broken bottle to intimidate her into cooperating but shed carried a butcher knife and shed been sober bill reachs body was one of god knew how many hundreds or thousands from the time of the us bombardment the time before the confederate army finally and sullenly pulled out of the us capital so far as she knew nobodyd ever found it i hope nobody ever does either she thought savagely i hope he rots in the ground and burns in hell forever itd serve him right by god her husband had said something to her but she had no idea what im sorry hal she said i mustve been woolgathering its all right sweetheart hal said with a tender smile he did love her she knew that she was absently fond of him too not least because being a long way from young he didnt try to make love to her very often shed had more than enough of that now he went on i said i know you feel the same way about poor bill as i do he always praised the information you got to the skies he did like the bottle a bit too much but he was a fine man a firstclass patriot nellie managed a nod and a glassy smile they sufficed edna made a small noise that might have been the start of a snicker but did stop at nellies glower and then they all got distracted for clara came in shouting ma ma armstrong went and put somethin down the potty and then he flushed it and now theres water all over everything come quick oh for gods sake nellie sprang to her feet as did the other grownups getting out the pair of long johns and mopping up the water didnt take long for merle grimes to wallop armstrongs backside with a hairbrush didnt take long either armstrongs howls needed some little while to subside so did nellies temper hes only a little boy sweetheart hal said boys nellie snorted in the tone she usually reserved for men youd never see a little girl doing something like that you tell em ma edna said she and nellie argued whenever they got a chance but she would back her mother in a quarrel against the other half of the human race except there was no quarrel hal jacobs and merle grimes looked at each other as if wondering who would bell the cat at last hal said well nellie you may be right if the world held nothing but women we probably wouldnt have fought the great war merle chuckled oh i dont know if id go that far they wouldnt have fought it over serbia thoughi am sure of that more likely over which was better macys or gimbels he laughed so did hal and so did edna betraying her sex after all nellie glared at heryes they would squabble over anything defensively edna said oh come on mait was funny well maybe nellie said with the air of one making an enormous concession she was so obvious about it her husband and soninlaw started laughing again peace merle grimes said when he could speak at last peace its and weve already drunk to peace lets keep it for as long as we can not even nellie could find anything to argue with there j onathan moss got to his feet in the courtroom may it please your honor he said wearily but i must object to the prosecutions speaking of my client as the guilty party the purpose of a trial is to find out whether or not he is guilty his honor was a us army colonel named augustus thorgood down came the gavel overruled he nodded to the prosecutor a us army major named sam lopat you may proceed thank you your honor lopat replied as i was saying stubbs there is plainly guilty of insurrection against the military government of the united states in the former province of ontario as defined in occupation administrative code section subsection horace stubbs moss client leaned toward him and whispered thanks for trying were not out of it yet moss whispered back but he was whistling in the dark and he knew it major lopat went on before witnesses the defendant said the united states deserved to be booted out of canada on their backside his very words your honor his voice trembled with indignation objection moss got to his feet again no witnesses have been produced before the court to show my client said any such thing we have the testimony lopat said smugly but no witnesses moss persisted testimony can come from a man with a personal grudge or from one out for a profit how do we know unless we can crossexamine a witness this is not an ordinary criminal proceeding mr moss as you know perfectly well colonel thorgood said testimony from certified informants may be admitted without their being liable to appear in open court for fear of reprisal against them from the unreconciled how can you possibly hope for justice under such conditions moss asked we aim to stamp out rebellion the military judge said we will too yes your honor no doubt your honor moss turned thorgoods title of respect into one of reproach but sooner or later ignoring the needs of justice and caring only for the needs of expedience will come back to haunt you as ben franklin said your honor they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety hed pulled that quotation out of his bartletts hoping he wouldnt have to use it if he did his client would be in trouble well stubbs was in trouble and moss like any lawyer worth his pay used whatever weapons came to hand and this one struck home colonel thorgood turned red major lopat jumped to his feet now i object your honor incompetent irrelevant and immaterial sustained thorgood thumped the gavel the record will be stricken exception moss said if youre going to railroad an innocent man at least be honest about what youre doing bang the gavel came down again this inflammatory speech will also be stricken colonel thorgood declared he nodded to lopat carry on major carry on lopat did with soldierly precision the case against horace stubbs was strongwas in fact airtightas long as one believed what informants said about him moss was convinced the informants were lying through their teeth but he doubted whether colonel thorgood cared one way or the other thorgoods job was to keep canada quiet if he had to shoot every canuck in sight to do that job he would and go to dinner with a hearty appetite five minutes later when major lopat finished the military judge nodded to moss now counselor you may have your say thank you your honor moss fought to keep sarcasm from his voice he thought he still had some small chance not of getting his client offthat was plainly hopelessbut of earning him a reduced sentence further affronting colonel thorgood wouldnt help there he set forth the evidence as best he could finishing may it please your honor the only people who claim mr stubbs was in any way involved with recent unfortunate events in ontario are those whose testimony is inherently unreliable and who have a vested interest in giving him the appearance of guilt regardless of whether that appearance is in any way justified he sat down from the prosecutions table major lopat muttered something about a damn canucklover moss sent him a hard look the military prosecutor gave back a stare colder than any canadian winter had he worked in the csa rather than the usa he would surely have muttered about a damn niggerlover instead but to moss surprise colonel thorgoods gavel came down again that will be quite enough of that major the judge said i beg your pardon your honor lopat said politely he didnt beg moss pardon though very well major do keep your remarks to the business at hand having said as much to mr moss i can hardly fail to say the same to you thorgood looked down at the notes on his desk he picked up a pen and scribbled something then said horace stubbs rise to hear the verdict of this court with a sigh stubbs got to his feet he could see the writing on the wall as plainly as could moss he was a small thin middleaged man on looks alone he made an unlikely insurrectionist horace stubbs colonel thorgood said i find you guilty of the crime of participating in rebellion against the us occupying authorities in the former province of ontario stubbs shoulders slumped the military judge scribbled something else he continued due to the unusual nature of this case i sentence you to six months imprisonment and to a fine of failure to pay the latter will result in a further six months imprisonment bang went the gavel this court is adjourned a couple of husky us noncoms strode forward to take horace stubbs off to jail just a minute he told them just one damn minute he grabbed jonathan moss hand hard enough to hurt thank you sir he said everything they told me about you it was all true and then some god bless you youre welcome moss said in slightly dazed tones as the noncoms took charge of his client and led him away hed hoped colonel thorgood would go easy on stubbs never in his wildest dreams had he imagined thorgood would go this easy six months and from a military court that was hardly even a slap on the wrist major lopat must have felt the same way as he put papers back into his militaryissue briefcase he sent moss a sour stare well clarence darrow you pulled a rabbit out of the hat this time he said oh come on moss saidhe was damned if hed admit surprise to the other side you didnt have a case and you know it lopat didnt even bother arguing with him all the military prosecutor said was yeah so what look where we are canadians deserve justice too moss said oh yeah since when says who having fired three cliches like an artillery barrage major lopat added and a whole fat lot youd care too if you werent sleeping with a canuck gal that might even have been true even so to moss it had only one possible answer and he used it screw you sam he packed his own papers in his briefcase and left the courtroom grabbing his overcoat as he went the calendar said spring had started three days earlier but berlin ontario paid little attention to the calendar snow whitened streets and sidewalks with more falling even as moss walked along the street he paused thoughtfully in front of a sign that said empire groceries below the words a large americanlooking eagle was painted maybe the storekeeper meant the american empire the one that stretched from the arctic ocean to the gulf of california from the atlantic to the pacific but maybe too it was meant to call to mind the name berlin had briefly borne during the great war when its citizens decided living in a town named for an enemy capital was unpatriotic moss chuckled laura secord still refused to call the town anything but empire as far as she was concerned the occupying authorities had no right to change back the name there were no canadian patriots more fiery than laura and yet shed warned him the uprising was imminent he still didnt fully understand that and she refused to talk about it now his best guess was that she hadnt thought the revolt had any chance to succeed and so she wasnt committing treason by talking about it but that was only a guess and he knew it he stopped at a diner a few doors down from empire groceries a waiter brought him a menu the man walked with a limp hed taken a bullet in the leg trying to hold back the us army he knew moss had flown aeroplanes for the usa but didnt hold it against himmuch case over he asked as moss sat down at an empty table thats right moss answered let me have the corned beef on wheat and coffee to go with it as the waiter scribbled on a pad he asked another question they going to let horace live six months in jail and moss said exultantly the waiter dropped his pencil be damned he said grunting in pain as he bent to pick it up he called back to the cook who was also the owner hey eddie this fasttalking yank got horace off easy whats easy eddie called back twenty years ten six months the waiter answered sounding as excited as moss and be damned eddie said as the waiter had that impressed him enough to make him come out front he had on a cloth cap in lieu of the toque a cook at a fancier place might have worn he tipped it to moss lunch on the house pal thanks moss told him you did it eddie said seems like our own barristers havent had much luck in yankee courts maybe it takes one to know one that wasnt exactly praise though the cook no doubt meant it as such it also wasnt so or not necessarily with a sigh moss said that fellow they said was a bomber they threw the book at him no matter what i did enoch dupree you mean the waiter said moss nodded thats right the waiter and eddie looked at each other after a long pause eddie said hate to tell you but enoch he was a bomber i happen to know it for a fact on account of his brotherinlaws married to my cousin i i dont want to hear about it moss held up a hand to show he really meant it my job is to give people the best defense they can get regardless of whether theyre guilty or not dont know i much fancy that the waiter said shouldnt be guilty people running around loose just cause theyve got smart lawyers well your other choice is to send innocent people to jail moss answered how do you like that i dont much the canadian answered but i thought it was what you yanks call justice sure has looked like that since you came you shouldnt blame him eddie said hes done everything he could for us ever since he hung out his shingle here thats so the waiter admitted and moss felt good till the fellow added sure as hell wish he could do a lot more though l ucien galtier sighed as he and marie and georges and jeannethe last two children left at homegot into his chevrolet for the sunday trip to riviereduloup id sooner go to mass in stantonin or stmodeste he said but sometimes theres no help for it doing this is wise his wife said as long as we come to church every so often and let bishop pascal see us everything should be fine we dont want to give him any reason to complain about us to the americans no lucien agreed but the republic of quebec is free and independent georges said and if you dont believe me just ask the first american soldier you see georges always liked to sound as if he were joking sometimes he was sometimes lucien had learned an english expression kidding on the square that summed things up better than anything in quebecois french youre getting pretty good at this driving business georges went on as they rolled up the paved road past the hospital and toward the town on the southern bank of the st lawrence anyone would think youd been doing it all your life he chuckled theyd hardly even invented horses when you were a boy eh papa let alone motorcars they hadnt invented such smart alecks ill tell you that lucien said his younger son preened as if at praise the eglise saintpatrice in riviereduloup was called a cathedral these days though it was the same building it had always been quite a few motorcars parked nearby times were lucien wouldnt say they were good but he thought it now and again as people filed into the church being the stubborn quebecois farmer he was galtier refused to think of it as a cathedral no matter what bishop pascal declared some of them talked about the stocks theyd bought and about how much money theyd made from them lucien felt maries eyes on him ever so slightly he shook his head hed stayed away from the bourse and intended to go right on staying away from it it struck him as being much more like gambling than any legitimate way to make money gambling now gambling was all very wellso long as you knew you could lose as easily as you could win he was almost to the door when he heard the word scandal for the first time now he and his wife looked at each other he shrugged marie did the same a moment later he heard the word again something juicy had happened and ive been on the farm minding my own business and so i havent the faintest idea what it is he thought regretfully tabernac he muttered the look marie sent him this time was definitely reproachful he pretended not to notice it wasntquiteas if hed cursed on holy ground the other side of the door it would have been a different business no sooner had he gone inside than someone elsea womansaid scandal and immediately started giggling whats going on mon pere georges asked scandalespecially scandal that might be funnydrew him the way maple syrup drew ants a young priest named father guillaume stood by the altar in bishop pascals place as lucien took his seat in the pews he asked the fellow next to him a townsman wheres the bishop why with the children of course the man answered and started to laugh lucien fumed he didnt want to admit he didnt know what was going on that would make him look like a farmer who came to town only to sell things and to hear mass of course he was a farmer who came to town only to sell things and to hear mass but he didnt want to remind the world of it his eldest daughter nicole her husband the american doctor named leonard odoull and their son lucien sat down behind his family he started to lean back and ask them what was so delicious but father guillaume began speaking in latin just then so he had to compose himself in patience he dared hope the priests sermon would enlighten him but it only left him more tantalized and titillated than ever father guillaume talked about those without sin casting the first stone he praised pascal and wished him good fortune in whatever he chose to do with the rest of his life lucien wiggled like a man with a dreadful and embarrassing itch what ever the scandal was it must have got bishop pascal hed never cared for pascal the man was too pink too clever too too expedient to suit him but pascal had always come up smelling like a rosetill now and i dont even know what he did galtier thought in an agony of frustration he went up and took communion from father guillaume he swallowed the wafer as fast as he could he didnt want to speak of scandal with the body of christ still on his tongue but then he made a beeline for his soninlaw what you dont know oh for heavens sake dr odoull exclaimed hed come to quebec during the war speaking tolerably good parisian french after ten years here his accent remained noticeable but only a little he sounded more as if hed been born in la belle provincela belle republique nowevery day no i dont know galtier ground out since you are such a font of knowledge suppose you enlighten me mais certainement mon beaupere odoull said grinning bishop pascals lady friend just had twins twins lucien said le bon dieu god was indeed good to bishop pascal wouldnt you agree his soninlaw said and laughed out loud i should say to former bishop pascal for he has resigned his see in light of this interesting development father guillaume will serve the spiritual needs of riviereduloup until the see has a new bishop twins galtier repeated as if hed never heard the word before yes i can see how he would have to resign after that no one was surprised when priests had lady friends they were men of the cloth yes but they were also men a lot of women down through the years had sighed over father later bishop pascal lucien didnt understand it but hed never been a woman either and few people were astonished if the lady friends of priests sometimes presented them with offspring that too was just one of those things life went on people looked the other way and the little bastards were often very well brought up but twins lucien said you cant look the other way at twins by the nature of things a bishops twins are a scandal exactly so mon beaupere leonard odoull said and that is why bishop pascal is bishop pascal no more but plain old pascal talon pascal talon galtier exclaimed thats rightthat is his family i hadnt thought of his family name in years though no one has im sure of course not not when he belonged to the church for all those years dr odoull said thats what belonging to the church means thats what it does it takes you away from your family and puts you in gods family he laughed again but now that hes gone and made gods family bigger galtier laughed too he asked since you are in town and hear all these things the moment they happenand since you dont bother telling your poor country cousins about themcould you tell me what m pascal talon plans to do now that he is bishop pascal no more whatever it was he had the nasty feeling the man would make a great success of it and sure enough his soninlaw said i understand hes decided riviereduloup is too small a place for a man of his many talents he will be moving to quebec city they say where he can be appreciated for everything he is a snake a sneak a worm a collaborator a philandereryes in the capital of the republic he should do well for himself galtier thought he found some more questions and what of the twins are they boys or girls by the way and what of their mother is pascal now a married man theyre a boy and a girl very pretty babiesive seen them odoull replied being a doctor hed seen a lot of babies if he said they were pretty lucien was prepared to believe him he went on i am given to understand that suzette is now mme talon yes but i dont think shell be going to quebec city with her new husband marie heard that and let out a loud sniff he made himself a member of gods family if he cheated on his vows to the lord how can anyone think he wont cheat on his vows to a woman poor suzette yes very likely pascal will cheat on her but she must have known he cheated when she first started her games with him lucien said why do you always blame the woman his wife demanded why do you always blame the man he returned also heatedly excuse me dr odoull made as if to duck im going somewhere saferthe trenches during the war were probably safer it will be all right galtier said weve been married this long we can probably last a little longer marie didnt argue but her expression was mutinously eloquent and as a matter of fact galtier wondered why he did take the former bishop pascals side it wasnt as if he liked the man he never had hed never trusted him either pascal had always been too smooth too rosy to be reliable that was what lucien had thought at any rate plainly a lot of people had had a different opinion but was suzette the new mme talon such a bargain galtier also had his doubts about that after all if shed let pascal into her bed what did that say about her taste nothing good certainly lets go home he said all right marie answered her voice had no well come back to this later in it so he supposed this wouldnt be a fight that clouded things between them for days at a time theyd had a few of those but only a few one reason they still got on so well after thirty years and a bit more besides why do you dislike bishop pascal so much jeanne asked on the way back to the farm well just for starters because he tried to get us to collaborate with the americans during the war and when we wouldnt do it he got them to take away our land and build the hospital on it galtier replied you were just a little girl then so you wouldnt remember very well but he alienated our patrimony but his youngest daughter seemed to have trouble putting her thoughts into words at last she said but my sister married an american were paid rent and a good one for the land the hospital sits on georges laughed how do you answer that one papa that was a good question galtier did the best he could saying at the time what father pascal did seemed wrong it worked out for the best i cant quarrel with that but just because it worked out for the best doesnt mean pascal did what he did for good reasons he did what he did to grab with both hands suppose the americans had lost the war marie added what would have happened to pascal then he would have come out ahead of the game and convinced everyone everything was somebody elses fault georges replied at once he was probably right even if that wasnt the answer his mother had been looking for lucien sighed the farmhouse wasnt far now quebec city had better watch out he said and drove on s ylvia enos stood in the kitchen of her flat glaring at her only son she had to look up to glare at him when had george jr become taller than she some time when she wasnt watching surely he looked unhappy now twisting his cloth cap in his hands but ma he said its the best chance ill ever have nonsense sylvia told him the best chance youll ever have is to stay in school and get as much learning as you can his faceachingly like his dead fathers though he couldnt raise a mustache and they were falling out of style anyhowwent closed and hard suddenly a mans face and a stubborn mans at that not a boys i dont care anything about school i hate it and im no good in it anyhow he wouldnt say damn not in front of his mother sylvia had done her best to raise him right you dont want to go to sea at sixteen sylvia said oh yes i do he said theres nothing i want more till you meet a girl then youll find something you want more but sylvia didnt say that it wouldnt have helped what she did say was if you go to sea at sixteen youll be doing it the rest of your life whats wrong with that he asked what else am i going to be doing the rest of my life thats why you go to school sylvia said to find out what else you could be doing but i dont want to do anything else george jr said exactly as his father might have i just want to go down to t wharf and out to sea the way pop did all the reasons he wanted to go to sea were all the reasons sylvia wanted him to stay home look what going to sea got your father in the end she said fighting to hold back tears that was the navy ma now george jr just sounded impatient im not going into the navy i just want to catch fish do you think nothing can go wrong when youre out there in a fishing boat if you do youd better think again son plenty of boats go out from t wharf and then dont come home again storms fog who knows why but they dont even if they do come home they dont always bring back everybody who set out if youre tending a line or hauling in a net and a big wave comes by do you really want the crabs and the lobsters and the flatfish fighting over who gets a taste of you most fishermen had a horror of a watery death and of the creatures they caught catching them but her son only shrugged and answered if im dead what difference does it make he was sixteen he didnt really think he could die so many sailors had but he wouldnt just listening to him sylvia could tell he was sure of it with a sigh she asked well what is this big chance youre talking about son i ran into fred butcher the other day ma george jr said hes got fat the last few years hasnt he sylvia said george jr grinned he sure has but hes got rich the last few years too he doesnt put to sea any more you know he hires the men who do i know that sylvia nodded hes one of the lucky ones there arent very many you know butcher wasnt just lucky hed always driven himself like a dray horse and he had a head for figures sylvia wished she could have said the same about her son but as hed said himself he didnt like school and hed never been an outstanding scholar i dont care i want to go to sea he said now and mr butcher he said hed take me on for the cuttlefish shes one of the new ones ma one of the good ones diesel engine electricity on board a wireless set a fishing run on a boat like that its almost like staying ashore its so comfy sylvia laughed in his face he looked very offended she didnt care you tell me that after youve put to sea and ill take you seriously till then she shook her head and laughed some more but shed yielded ground and her son took advantage of it let me find out then ill tell you everything once i get back mr butcher he says hell pay me like a regular sailor not a firsttimer on account of he was friends with pop that was generous sylvia couldnt deny it she wished she could have for she would tears came to her eyes again she was losing her little boy and saw no way to escape it there before her stood someone who wanted to be a man and who was ever so close to getting what he wanted she sighed all right george if thats what you care to do i dont suppose i can stop you his jaw dropped enough boy lingered in him to make him take his mothers word very seriously thank you oh thank you he exclaimed and gave sylvia a hug that made her feel tiny and short ill work as hard as pop did i promise and save my money and everything he ran out of promises and imagination at the same time i hope it works out george i pray it works out when a tear slid down sylvias face her son looked alarmed she waved him away youre not going to get me not to worry so dont even try i worried about your father every day he was at sea and ill worry about you too everything will be fine ma george jr spoke with the certainty inherent in sixteen sylvia remembered how shed been when she was that age and it was worse with boys they thought they were stallions and had to paw the ground with their hooves and neigh and rear and show the world how tough they were the world didnt care most of them needed years to figure that out some never did figure it out the world rolled over them either way it ground them down and made them fit into their slots if they wouldnt grind down and wouldnt fit it broke them sylvia didnt think it intended to but what it intended and what happened were two different beasts it had rammed her into a slot all right here she was coming up on middle age living from day to day wondering how shed get by worrying because her only son was quitting school and taking up a dangerous trade if there werent ten thousand others just like her in boston shed have been astonished but then savage anger and pride shot through her i killed the son of a bitch who sank the ericsson i shot him dead and im walking around free how many others can say the like not a one shed take that to the grave with her most of the time it wouldnt do her one damn bit of good not when it came to things like catching a streetcar or dealing with the coal board or going to the dentist but it was hers nobody could rob her of it for one brief moment in her life shed stepped out of the ordinary george jr brought her back into it saying ill go right on giving you one dollar out of every three i make too ma i promise itll be the same with this as its always been with the odd jobs ive been doing ill pay my way honest all right george she said he was a good boy she didnt think of him as a man she wondered if she ever would down deep where it counted she had her doubts he asked what do you think pop would say about what im doing that was a good question after some thought sylvia answered well he always did like going to sea god only knew that was the truth whenever the ripple went out shed felt as if she were giving him up to the arms of another womanthe atlantic had that kind of hold on him she went on i think hed have wanted you to stay in school too but if you got this kind of chance i dont think hed have stood in your way his face lit up thanks almost as fast as it had appeared that light faded i wish i would have known him better i wish i could have known him longer i know sweetheart i wish you could have too and i wish i could have on the whole sylvia meant that shed never quite forgiven her husband for having been about to go to a tennessee brothel with a colored whore even if he hadnt slept with the woman and even if being about to had saved his life if he hadnt been on his way to the whorehouse if hed gone back aboard his river monitor instead he would have been on it when confederate artillery blew it out of the water but if hed come home from the war if hed been around every dayor half the time as fishermen usually wereand if hed kept his nose clean she supposed she would have george jr started for the door id better go find mr butcher and tell him i dont know how long hell hold the job for me go on then dear sylvia said half of her hoping fred butcher wouldnt hold the job the door opened it closed her sons footsteps receded in the hallway then they were gone sylvia sighed she muttered something she never would have let anyone else hear that helped but not enough she pulled a whiskey bottle out of a kitchen cabinet a fair number of states had made alcohol illegal but massachusetts wasnt one of them she poured some whiskey into a glass then added water and took a drink whiskey had always tasted like medicine to her she didnt care not now she was using it for medicine shed medicated herself quite thoroughly when the front door to the flat opened she hoped it would be george jr coming back all crestfallen to tell her fred butcher had given someone else the berth but it wasnt her son it was mary jane back from helping her teacher grade younger students papers sylvias daughter even got paid a little for doing it she made a better scholar than her brother that would have been funny if it hadnt been sad a boy could do so many more things with an education than a girl could but mary jane seemed to want to learn while george jr couldnt have cared less hello ma mary jane said now and then as she got a better look at sylvias face ma whats wrong your brothers going to sea thats what without the whiskey in her sylvia might not have been so blunt but that was the long and short of it mary janes eyes got wide but thats good news not bad its what hes always wanted to do if hed always wanted to jump off a cliff would it be good news that hed finally gone and done it sylvia asked but its not like that ma mary jane protested she didnt understand any more than george jr did he needs a job and thats a good one a good job is a shore job a job where you dont have to worry about getting drowned sylvia said if hed gotten one of those id stand up and cheer this she shook her head the kitchen spun slightly when she did yes she was medicated all right hell be fine mary jane was fourteen she also thought she was immortal and everybody else too she hardly remembered her own father and certainly didnt care to remember hed died at sea she went on things are a lot safer than they used to be the boats are better the engines are better and they just about all have wireless nowadays in case they run into trouble every word of that was true none of it did anything to reassure sylvia whod seen too many misfortunes down by t wharf she said i want him to have a job where he doesnt need to worry about running into trouble wheres he going to find one mary jane asked if he goes into building somebody could drop a brick on his head if he drives a truck somebody could run into him you want him to be a clerk in an insurance office or something like that but hed be lousy at clerking and hed hate it too every word of that was true too sylvia wished it werent mary jane was right she did want george jr in a whitecollar job but mary jane was also right that he wouldnt be good at one and wouldnt like it that didnt stop sylvia from wishing he had one she knew the sea too well ever to trust it w hen jefferson pinkard went down to the empire of mexico he never dreamt hed stay so long he never dreamt the civil war would drag on so long that he realized now that he understood things here a little better had been naive on his part the mexican civil war had started up not long after the great war ended the usa fed the rebels money and guns the csa sent money and guns andunofficially of coursecombat veterans to prop up the imperialists off in the distance artillery rumbled jeff took a sip of strong black coffee the coffee had been improved corrected they said hereaboutswith a shot of strong rum alabama was officially dry the mexicans laughed at the very idea of prohibition some ways they were pretty damn smart he finished the coffee as the artillery barrage went on the front line ran quite a ways west of san luis potosi these days mexicanbuilt barrels had driven back the rebels and the damnyankees didnt seem to be helping their pet mexicans build armored vehicles maybe they would one of these days or maybe theyd just import some from the usa if they did a lot more greasers would end up dead the front line would stabilize or start going back and the civil war might last forever a mexican soldier in the yellowish shade of butternut they wore down here politely knocked on pinkards open door yeah pinkard said and then si mateo todo esta listo mateo said and then in english as rudimentary as pinkards spanish everyting ready sergeant jeff all right then pinkard heaved himself to his feet he towered over mateo as he towered over almost everybody down here lieutenant guitierrezno he was captain guitierrez these dayswas an exception but jeff could have broken him over his knee like a stick he left the little wooden shack that served him as an office and strode out into sunlight bright and fierce enough to make what hed got in birmingham seem as nothing by comparison summer down here was really a son of a bitch it was bad enough to make him understand just how the spirit of manana had been born standing out there in the broiling sun were several hundred rebel prisoners drawn up in neat rows and columns they all stiffened to attention when pinkard came into sight he nodded and they relaxeda little some of them wore uniforms of a darker shade than those of maximilian iiis soldiers more though looked like peasants whod chanced to end up in a place where they didnt want to bewhich was exactly what they were pinkard inspected them as if they were men he would have to send into battle not enemies of whom he was in charge while they stood out in the open he strode through their barracks making sure everything was shipshape and nobody was trying to tunnel out of the camp he wished he had a proper fence not just barbed wire strung on poles but he made the best of what there was guards on rickety towers at each corner of the square manned machine guns jeff waved to each of them in turn everything good he asked and then in what passed for spanish todo bueno he got answering grins and waves and nods as far as the guards were concerned everything was fine they had easy duty duty unlikely to get them shot and they got paid for itas often as anybody except confederate mercenaries got paid the mexicans didnt stiff the men from the csa the way they did their own people for a while jeff had wondered why the devil any mexican would fight for maximilian iii then from interrogating prisoners hed found out the rebels cheated their soldiers every bit as badly as the imperialists cheated theirs nobody down here had clean hands nobody even came close he went back up in front of the prisoners dismissed he shouted mateo told them the same thing in spanish they all saluted he thought they meant it too as long as they did what he told them to he treated them fairly nobodyd ever treated a lot of them fairly before and they responded to it even from the fellow in charge of a prison camp if they got out of line they were liable to earn a kick in the nuts as far as pinkard was concerned that was fair too as the prisoners went back to the barracks to get out of the ferocious sun mateo asked sergeant jeff how you know so much aboutthis hisorderly pinkard supposed the word waswaved around at the camp in confederate states you policia policeman jeff laughed like hell me a cop jesus god no i was a steelworker a damn good steelworker before i came down here getting across what a steelworker was took a little while when mateo finally did figure it out he gave pinkard a peculiar look you do work like that mucho dinero eh why you leave on account of i couldnt stand it any more jeff answered that plainly made no sense to the mexican pinkard tried again on account of woman troubles that wasnt the whole story but it sure was a big part if emily hadnt decided she wasnt going to wait for him to come back from the war well he didnt know how things would have been but he sure knew they would have been different ah mateo got that one right away what man wouldnt have si mujeres he rattled off something in spanish then made a stab at translating it no can live with no can live without neither by god buddy you got that one right pinkard burst out even now when he thought about emily he did his best not to think about emily but sometimes his best wasnt good enough you no policia how you know what to do with mateo waved again as he came back to what he really wanted to know pinkard answered him with a shrug just another job god damn it somebody had to do it remember when we took all those prisoners after the barrels came up from tampico hed lost his orderly and backtracked in clumsy halting spanish to let the other man catch up when mateo nodded jeff went on like i say somebody had to do it otherwise they probably all wouldve died so i took charge of the poor sorry bastardsand ive been in charge of prisoners ever since he wasnt altogether sorryfar from it the distant mutter of artillery reminded him why he wasnt sorry if he werent doing this hed have been up there at the front and then some of those shells might have landed on him hed seen enough combat in the great war to be glad he was part of an army but not part in any immediate danger mateo said you do good nobody never hear of nothing like how you do with prisoners everybody now try do like you even rebels now they try do like you there was praise if you liked when the enemy imitated you you had to be doing something right a couple of days later pinkard decided to do something right for himself he grabbed a ride on a supply truck and went north to the village of ahualulco where maximilian iiis army had a supply dump that kept the prisoners eating ahualulco wasnt anything much it wouldnt have been anything at all if two roadswell two dirt trackshadnt crossed there redwhiteandgreen flags fluttered everywhere both sides in the civil war flew those colors which got as confusing as the stars and bars and the stars and stripes had during the great war for maximilians side they were also the colors of austriahungary from which his ancestors had come pinkard was damned if he knew why the rebels also flew those colors but hed never been curious enough to find out the fighting was the biggest thing that had happened to ahualulco since maybe since forever a couple of new cantinas had opened and a whorehouse and a field hospital jeff went into one of the cantinaswhich had a picture of the mexican emperor cut from some magazine tacked to the front doorand ordered a beer mexican beer was surprisingly good even if they didnt believe in keeping it cold he lit a cigarette found a table and settled down to enjoy himself hed just started his second beer when the door flew open in came a couple of big men talking english one of them looked his way waved and called freedom freedom jeff echoed who the hell are you boys where yall from one of them a blond was named pete frazee the other who sported a fiery red mustache called himself charlie maccaffrey they sat down by him frazee got a beer maccaffrey ordered tequila how do you drink that stuff pinkard asked him tastes like cigar butts you ask me yeah but itll get me drunk fastern that horse piss you and pete got maccaffrey answered he knocked it back and waved for more he was from jackson mississippi frazee from the country not far outside of louisville the kentuckian said they told me i couldve gone back after the war but i was damned if i wanted to live in the united states i spent three years tryin to kill those damnyankees screw me if i wanted to be one myself oh hell yes pinkard said howd you find out about the party heard one of their people talkin on a street corner in chattanooga where i was at frazee answered with a reminiscent smile soon as i did i decided that was for me havent looked back since he nudged the fellow whod come in with him how about you charlie i like bustin heads maccaffrey said frankly plenty of heads need bustin in mississippi too we got as many niggers as white folks and some o them bastards even got the vote after they went into the army i dont cotton to thatno way nohow whigs and rad libs let em do it soon as i found me a party that didnt like it i reckoned that was for me howd you come down here jeff asked maccaffrey made a face ever since that stupid bastard plugged wade hampton v we pulled in our horns like a goddamn snail wasnt hardly any fun any more i still got more asskickin in me than that how about you jeff shrugged didnt like what i was doin didnt have nothin holdin me in birmingham i thought why the hell not and here i am youre the fellow with the prisoners of war aint you pete frazee said suddenly pinkard nodded so did frazee in a thoughtful way he went on heard about you from what everybody says youre doing a hell of a job thank you thank you kindly pinkard answered he paused till the barmaid got him another beer then chuckled and said wasnt what i came down here to do but it hasnt worked out too bad he spent most of the afternoon drinking with the other party men and enjoying the chance to speak his own language then despite a certain stagger he made his way to the brothel and laid down enough silver for a quiet room and the company of a girl named maria not that half the women down here werent named maria far and away the prettiest one in the place hed drunk enough to have some trouble rising to the occasion hed paid enough to have her slide down the bed and start to help him with her mouth he enjoyed it for perhaps half a minute then he remembered emilys mouth on him after hed found her with bedford cunningham who had been his best friend no goddammit he growled and pulled away what maria had no idea what the trouble was no i said he scrambled onto her shed got him hard enough so he could manage he did and then got back into his clothes and left in a hurry maria shook her head loco she muttered and tapped a finger against her temple c larence potter said my trouble is i want to see the freedom party dead and buried not just weak he sipped at his whiskey in the charleston saloon that makes me as much a fanatic as jake featherston i suppose the freedom party was weak nowadays and weaker in south carolina than it had been before the previous years congressional election even so in most saloons a comment like that would have been good for starting a fight not in the crows nest though not on a tuesday night the whig party faithful met at the odd fellows hall across the street and then a lot of them were in the habit of coming over and hashing things out with the help of the lubricants the saloon provided braxton donovan was a prominent charleston lawyer he was also at the moment slightlybut only slightlydrunk he said only thing thatd put those knownothing peckerheads into power is a calahamitya calahamity i tell you a calamity you mean potter asked thats what i said isnt it several of the chins beneath donovans neat gray goatee wobbled as a matter of fact no potter answered relentless precision had brought him into confederate army intelligence and later into investigative work well its what i meanta calahamity is the lawyer held up his glass the colored bartender hastened to refill it braxton donovan nodded regally thank you kindly ptolemy youre welcome suh ptolemy said professionally polite professionally subservient tell me ptolemy donovan asked in his rolling baritone what is your view of the freedom party he might have been encouraging a friendly witness on the stand dont like em for hell suh ptolemy said at once somebody should ought to do somethin about em you wants to know what i thinks he polished the top of the bar with a spotless white towel this country is in a bad way when some not so small fraction of the electorate cant see whats obvious to a nigger bartender braxton donovan said he took a pull at his freshened drink still and all better a not so small fraction than a large fraction as was so a few years back yes potter agreed and i believe ptolemy here really does have no use for the freedom partyits in his interest not to after all when you think about what featherston has to say about blacks but even so jeb stuart iii had a colored servant whose name if i remember right was also ptolemy jake featherston suspected the fellow was a redhe was serving under stuart in the first richmond howitzers he told me about this servant not so long before the uprisings began and so donovan asked your point is jeb stuart iii pulled wires with his father to make sure that ptolemy didnt have any trouble clarence potter finished his whiskey at a gulp and he was a red dammit as became abundantly clear when the pot boiled over young stuart died in combatlet himself be killed they say so he wouldnt have to face the music his fathers revenge was to make sure featherston never rose above the rank of sergeant petty i suppose but understandable why are you telling me this the lawyer asked a couple of reasons potter answered for one we can trace the rise of the freedom party to such small things and for another a white mans a fool if he takes a negros word at face value look what happened to jeb stuart iii he swung around on the stool so that he faced the bartender ptolemy yes suh nother drink suh the black man asked in a minute potter said first tell me somethingwhat were you doing when the rebellion came in me suh for all they showed ptolemys eyes might have been cut from stone nothin suh stayin home mindin my business uh huh potter knew what that meant it meant the bartender was lying through his teeth every negro in the csa claimed to have stayed at home minding his own business during the red rebellion if all the blacks who said they had actually had stayed at home there would have been no rebellion in the first place ptolemy said suh it was a long time ago nowadays an its all over an done with aint no way to change what happened onliest thing we can do is pick up the pieces an go on hes right braxton donovan said potter found himself nodding the confederate states and everybody in them did have to do that saying it though was easier than doing it donovan took a half dollar out of his pocket and slid it across the bar to ptolemy here you are buy yourself a drink a few hundred years before kings had tossed out largess to peasants with that same sort of offhanded generosity thank you suh ptolemy made the coin disappear he did fix a drink for himself by its pale amber color it held a lot more water than whiskey and the bartender nursed it raising it to his lips every now and then but not doing much in the way of real drinking potter had known very few men who worked behind a bar and did much in the way of pouring down what they served too easy he supposed for a man who worked around whiskey all the time to come to like it too well having been generous to one beneath himor so he plainly feltbraxton donovan swung his attention back to potter i have a question for you sir he said speaking of the freedom party ask it then potter answered ive heard you knew roger kimball while he was still alive the lawyer said clarence potter nodded and so i did thats the best time to get to know a manwhile hes still alive i mean indeed and in fact donovan nodded grandly now sir the question while he was still alive did kimball ever hint to you that hed torpedoed the uss ericsson after wed yielded to the damnyankees never once never in the slightest way potter replied at once we were acquaintances you understand not friendshe liked jake featherston as much as i loathe the man but i would say he didnt tell his friends either he was in my opinion a firstclass son of a bitch but he knew how to keep a secretby keeping it at all times and everywhere if his exec hadnt spilled the beans i dont think anyone would ever have known poetic justice what he got donovan said yes i think so too potter agreed if he hadnt come to a sudden demise he would have been a sore spot between us and the usa and we cant afford to give them excuses to kick us around theyre too liable to do it even without excuses though sinclair has taken a milder line than teddy roosevelt did i quite agree donovan said i despise the socialists and all they stand forthey set a bad example for our people at the very leastbut their foreign policy is well as you said gentler than roosevelts now i have a question for you potter said braxton donovan looked cautious but could hardly do anything but nod potter asked why are you so interested in the late unlamented roger kimball idle curiosity donovan answered shit potter said crisply all of a sudden his metalframed spectacles didnt make him seem mild and ineffectual any more when he went on i deserve a straight answer the implication was that hed do something unpleasant if he didnt get one braxton donovan could have bought and sold him donovan owned enough property that the disastrous postwar inflation hadnt wiped him out they both knew it most of the time in the classconscious confederate states it would have mattered a great deal now somehow it didnt the lawyer flinched muttered something under his breath and gulped his drink fill it up he told the bartender yes suh ptolemy did ice clinked as he built donovan a fresh one the lawyer sipped from the new whiskey clarence potter waited patient and implacable as a father waiting up for a son out too late at last donovan said you know anne colleton personally no potter said but i know of her who doesnt in this state whats she got to do with anything she and kimball were friends during the war and for a while afterwards braxton donovan answered suggesting by the pause that theyd been more than friends any dirt i can get on him will stick to her wait a minute potter held up a hand wait just a minute didnt she help get the yankee woman who punched kimballs ticker for him out of jail and back to the usa oh yes donovans silver pompadour was so securely in place it didnt stir a hair as he nodded they broke up unpleasantly i think it was over politicshe stayed in the freedom party and she was one of the rats who left the sinking ship his lip curled why tar her then potter asked if shes back to being a whig dont you want her to keep on being one if you drive her into featherstons arms again arent you just asking for trouble shes a highpowered woman no two ways about it thats the point donovan said shes talking like a whig again yes but shes trying to pull us to the right till you cant tell us from the yahoos in white shirts and butternut pants who run around yelling freedom she wants to have another go at the united stateswants it so bad she can taste it potter pondered that wed have to be damn lucky to win it they beat us and they hurt us and even if we do lick them that just sets up another war ten twenty thirty years further down the line i wish i could say something elsei fought those bastards from the very first day to the very last and idve kept on fighting if we hadnt folded up but come on donovan a good big man wont always lick a good little one but sure as hell thats the way to bet and i dont think we can afford to lose again i dont want to fight them again either donovan said i fought plenty in the last war too and i am plumb satisfied and i dont want her voice in the whig party there may be something to that potter allowed on the other hand there may not you want to think twice about going after her maybe you want to think three times i know what im doing braxton donovan certainly sounded confident potter wondered if that was the whiskey talking he also wondered how donovan not only didnt fall over but kept on sounding coherent the man had to have a sponge in place of a liver donovan went on shes not quite the force she used to be anyhow on account of shes ten years older than she used to be same as the rest of us but it hurts women more he finished the latest drink one more of the same ptolemy comin right up suh the negro said as he made the next whiskey potter studied him and covertly donovan he wondered if the lawyer really knew as much as he thought he did not too many people came away happy after they bumped up against anne colleton which meant potter finished his own drink he didnt ask for a fresh one not right away instead he did some quiet thinking he came closer to agreeing with donovan than with anne colleton nothing was stupider though than backing a loser which he judged donovan likely to be how much of a deal can i cut he wondered and should i americanempire thecentercannothold vii a s far as cincinnatus driver was concerned the worst part of prison was getting used to it after a while luther bliss stopped interrogating him which meant he didnt get beat up very much any more hardly anything happened to him any more in fact he sat in his cell with nothing to do except for the one hour a week when he was led out to exercise as a beast might have been outside the gray stone walls of the prison time was passing what did elizabeth think back in des moines what did achilles think how big was the boy these days cincinnatus struggled to remember his face did amanda remember him at all he was starting to doubt it only the weather told him the season of the year he never saw a newspaper or anything else with print on it he began to wonder if he still remembered how to read and write that thought provoked him to bitter laughter read and write hell im startin to wonder if i still recollect how to talk days at a time would go by when he never said a word to anyone the guards did not encourage conversation which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along when they gave orders it was always come here nigger go there boy or stand aside nigger they didnt want to hear cincinnatus say yes suh they just wanted him to do as he was told he did it hed tried not doing it a couple of times the results of that had proved more painful than they were worth hed also tried protesting that he was a citizen of the united states and nobody not even luther bliss and the kentucky state police had any business holding him like this the results of that had proved even more painful than those of the other if i wasnt colored they wouldnt be able to get away with it no matter what they think i done that had run through his mind more times than he could count he did his best not to dwell on it its truth was all too obvious hed thought things would be better in the usa than they had been when kentucky was part of the csa maybe not but in spite of all this maybe in the confederate states negroes who made trouble often just stopped living however much luther bliss wanted cincinnatus on ice he hadnt dug a hole and put his body in it sometimes cincinnatus wondered why not on a hot muggy afternoon in what he reckoned was the middle of summer three guards came to his cell door two of them drew pistols and pointed them at him while the third turned a key in the lock and opened the cell then that fellow jumped back and yanked his pistol from its holster too come along with us one of the guards said where cincinnatus voice creaked with disuse and with fear this wasnt exercise time or mealtime maybe that hole in the ground waited for him after all dont give us no back talk boy or youll be sorry for it the guard snapped get moving cincinnatus did thinking they can kill me here as easy as anywhere else and then take my body wherever they need to he wanted to run his legs had that lightasafeather feel panic could bring he was sure he could outrun these three bigbellied white men but he was also sure it would do him no good nobody outran a bullet they took him not to the room where theyd questioned him before but to an office in one of the prisons corner towers he supposed it was the wardens office but the man behind the desk was inevitably luther bliss bliss had light brown eyes like a hound dogs at the moment those eyes were as sad as a hound dogs too when cincinnatus came in the chief of the kentucky state police turned to the other man in the room an older fellow who sat in a chair off to one side see mr darrow here he is sound as a dollar whose dollars are you talking about bliss the old mandarrowdemanded the confederates after the war oh sweet jesus cincinnatus thought bliss is going to lock him up and throw away the key but bliss didnt do anything except drum his fingers on the desktop if he was angry he didnt show it past thatwhich made cincinnatus take another long look at the man named darrow he had to be close to seventy his skin was grandfatherpink his jowls sagged he combed thinning irongray hair over the top of his head to make it cover as much ground as it could but his grayblue eyes were some of the sharpestand some of the nastiestcincinnatus had ever seen after coughing a couple of times he pulled his wallet from a vest pocket he looked down at a photograph in it then over to cincinnatus you are cincinnatus driver he said sounding surprised i wouldntve put it past this sneaky son of a bitchhe pointed to luther blissto try to sneak a ringer by me but i guess he figured id spot it again the world didnt end all bliss said was i resent that mr darrow go right ahead the other white man said cheerfully i intended that you should plaintively cincinnatus said will somebody please tell me whats going on my pleasure said the old man with the ferocious eyes im clarence darrow im a lawyer ive got a writ of habeas corpus with your name on it that means you get out of jail if youve got any brains it also means you get the hell out of kentucky my god cincinnatus understood the words but he wasnt sure he believed them he wasnt sure he dared believe them he said i didnt think nobody could get me out of here sonny theres something you have to understand im a good lawyer darrow spoke with a calm certainty that compelled belief im a damn good lawyer matter of fact this petty tyrant herehe pointed at luther bliss again and again bliss didnt rise to itkept thinking i wasnt but hes not so smart as he thinks he is i know whos my countrys friend and who aint bliss said what do i need to know besides that how to live by the rules you say youre protecting clarence darrow answered the head of the kentucky state police snapped his fingers to show how little he cared about them darrow had been blustery before now he got angry really angry whats the point of having a country with laws if you get around em any time you happen not to care for em eh answer me that but luther bliss was not an easy man to quell this heres kentucky mr darrow if we played by the rules all the time the bastards who dont would get the jump on us pretty damn quick and you can bet on that half the people in this state are confederate diehards and the other half are reds he exaggerated from what cincinnatus remembered of the days before hed moved north he didnt exaggerate by much darrow said if nobody in this godforsaken place wants to live in the usa why not give it back to the confederates cincinnatus gapedhed never heard anyone except a diehard say such a thing mildly bliss replied you know mr darrow advocating return to the csa is against the law here wouldnt be surprised darrow said wouldnt be one bit surprised the law its against is unconstitutional of course not that you care about the constitution of the united states heres your nigger mr darrow bliss air of calm frayed at last take him and get the hell out of here or dont you think i could fix up a cell with your name on it right next to his im sure you could darrow said and im sure you could make it very unpleasant for me but im sure of something else tooim sure i could make it even more unpleasant for you if you did by the sour look on luther bliss face he was sure of the same thing it didnt make him very happy get out he repeated come along mr driver clarence darrow said lets get you back to civilization or what passes for it in the united states these days he grunted with effort as he heaved himself to his feet cincinnatus needed a heartbeat to remember the surname belonged to him he hadnt grown up with it and people didnt use it very often and nobodyd called him by it since hed landed here dazedly he followed the white lawyer not till they got into the motorcar that had brought darrow to the prison and the driver was taking them away did cincinnatus turn to the lawyer and say god bless you suh for what you done there i dont believe in god any more than i believe in mother goose darrow said foolish notion but i do believe in justice and you deserve that everyone deserves that cincinnatus had known some reds who said they didnt believe in god with them hed always thought that was a pose or that they substituted marx for god with clarence darrow it was different the man spoke as if he needed no substitute for the deity cincinnatus sensed that but couldnt fully fathom it he said well god believes in you whether you believe in him or not darrow gave him an odd look youve got grit son if you can joke after you get out of that place i wasnt jokin suh cincinnatus said they eyed each other in perfect mutual incomprehension cincinnatus asked howd you even know i was stuck there suh to come and get me out your wife finally raised a stink that was big enough for me to notice it darrow answered it took her a while because people in the usa dont want to notice a colored woman even when shes screaming her head off but she kept at it remarkable woman stubborn as a missouri mule yes suh cincinnatus said happily god bless elizabeth too clarence darrow let out a long rasping sigh cincinnatus took no notice of it he went on but even if you knew i was in trouble howd you get luther bliss to turn loose o me thats one ornery man thats one firstclass son of a bitch is what that is darrow said even after i got the court order he kept denying hed ever heard of you but i managed to persuade a judge otherwiseand here you are here i am cincinnatus agreed seeing farms and woods out the window not stone and concrete and barbed wire made him feel like a new man but the new man had old problems what do i owe you suh lawyers didnt come cheap he knew that even so whatever it is i pays it may take me a while you understand but i pays it darrows grin displayed crooked tobaccostained teeth your wife told me youd say that you dont owe me a dimei did your case pro bono publico he saw the latin meant nothing to cincinnatus and added for the public good thats mighty kind of you suh but it aint right cincinnatus said i want to pay you back i owe you your wife said youd say that too clarence darrow told him but theres no needill make more from publicity than you could pay if you must pay the favor forwarddo something good for someone else bargain yes suhso help me god cincinnatus said more of that claptrap darrow sighed well never mind i hope you know better than to stick your nose back into kentucky again long as my folks aint poorly for true sure cincinnatus answered thats what got me here before i be more careful bout the message nowadays but if i reckon its so what choice have i got but to come clarence darrow gave him a long measuring stare the lawyer delivered his verdict in one word fool c oal smoke pouring out the stack the train hurried toward the salt lake city station sparks flew as the brakes ground its iron wheels against the iron rails that carried it colonel abner dowling would rather have been somewhere anywhere else than on the platform waiting for that train to pull in by the expression on his mustachioed face general pershing felt the same way no help for it though dowling murmured more than half to himself he hadnt been quiet enough but pershing only nodded and said he has earned the right to do as he pleases i know that sir dowling answered i just wish he would have pleased to do somethinganythingelse yes pershing nodded again there is that isnt there the train stopped right at the platform dowling had irrationally hoped against hope that it wouldnt but would keep right on going the leader of the military band gathered on the platform caught pershings eye pershing looked as if he wished the fellow hadnt at last reluctantly he nodded the band leader either didnt notice the reluctance or thought it wise to pretend he didnt with a proud flourish he began to wave his baton the band struck up the stars and stripes forever no sooner had the vaunting music begun to blare forth than the door to one of the pullman cars opened out came a bent ancient whose mustache and what dowling could see of his hairhe always wore a hat to keep the world from knowing he was baldwere a peroxided gold defying time a woman of about the same years followed him onto the platform well autie she sniffed they are giving you a proper welcome anyhow whats that libbie the old man cupped a hand behind his ear i said theyre giving you a proper welcome she repeated louder this time cant hear a thing over that music at least theyre giving me a proper welcome colonel dowling and general pershing both stepped forward they both saluted they chorused welcome to utah general custer dowling was lying in his teeth he would have bet pershing was doing the same thank you thank you both custer said he stiffly returned the salute even though having at last retired from the us army after more than sixty years of service he wore a somber black suit and homburg three years before hed been as vigorous as a man in his eighties could be now dowling found himself surprised dismayed and surprised at being dismayed hed always thoughtsometimes despairinglythat george armstrong custer was the one unchanging man on the face of the earth here at last he saw it wasnt so the retired general was visibly slower visibly more feeble some spark had gone out of him since his retirement and he seemed to know it libbie custer by contrast remained as she always had hello colonel dowling she said with a smile that showed white false teeth its good to see you again now that autie and i are civilians may i call you abner of course dowling answered though hed always hated his christian name meanwhile general pershing was shaking hands with custer and exchanging polite and no doubt insincere compliments during the great war pershings command had been just to the east of custers pershings second army had captured louisville and generally pushed south faster than custers firsttill custer decided he knew more about barrels than anyone in the war department and against all odds turned out to be right from things pershing had said since abner dowling came to utah he still couldnt figure out how custer had pulled that off at the time dowling had been sure custers lies to philadelphia would get the generaland not so incidentally himselfcourtmartialed and sent to leavenworth to do hard labor for the rest of their lives instead his superior had ended up the usas greatest military hero since george washington and dowling by reflected glory had ended up a minor hero himself custer said are you keeping the mormons here on a tight rein general i hope to heaven you are because they will cause trouble if they get half a chance things have been tolerably quiet anyway pershing answered they dont shoot at our men any more taking hostages worked pretty well for the germans in belgium and for us in canada and the csa and it works here too the mormons may want us dead but they dont want their friends and neighbors and sweethearts going up against a wall with a blindfold and a cigarette custer added automatically but he shook his head before anyone could correct him no the mormons dont even have that to console themselves poor devils nothing wrong with tobacco libbie sniffed custer had been smoking and drinking and cursing ever since the disappointments of the second mexican war and she still hated all three it does work cigarette or no pershing said we even quelled trouble with polygamists down in teasdale by taking several hundred hostages and making it ever so clear wed do what we had to do if trouble broke out dowling wanted to wipe his forehead with the back of his hand and go whew because of that he didnt but he wanted to instead he said general mrs custer your limousine is waiting just outside the station if youd be kind enough to come with me they came they didnt remark uponperhaps they didnt noticethe sharpshooters on the roof of the station more riflemen were posted in the buildings across the street custer had served as general popes right arm in the us occupation of restive utah during the second mexican war mormons had long memories as everyone had found out in their uprising during the great war someone might still want to take a potshot or two at custer for what hed done more than forty years before no matter how many hostages lives it cost his people the limousine carried more armor than an armored car even the windows were of glass allegedly bulletproof that was one more thing dowling didnt want to have to put to the test as they drove along the southern perimeter of temple square custer pointed to the ruins there and said thats a bully sighttheir temples to their false gods pulled down around their ears may they never rise again er yes dowling answered wondering when hed last heard anyoneanyone but custer that issay bully hardly at all since the great war ended he was sure of that the old slang was dying out with the people whod used it custer still lingered now though dowling could see he wouldnt go on forever after all as old men will custer still dwelt on the past do you know what my greatest regret is he asked no sir dowling said as general pershing shook his head my greatest regret is that we didnt hang abe lincoln alongside the mormon traitors he was consorting with custer said he deserved it just as much as they did and if wed stretched his skinny neck the socialists never would have got off the groundim sure of that i suppose wed have republicans instead pershing said theyd be just about as bad or i miss my guess he was twenty years younger than custer which meant hed been a young man the last time the republican party had amounted to anything much it was a sad shadow of its former self and had been ever since abraham lincoln took a large part of its membership left into the socialist camp at the end of the second mexican war custer sniffed and coughed and rolled his eyes plainly he disagreed with general pershing for a wonder though he didnt come right out and say so abner dowling scratched his head in bemusement had custer learned tact or some semblance of it at the age of eightysix there might have been less likely things but dowling couldnt think of any offhand odds were that libbie had poked him in the ribs with her elbow when dowling didnt notice as the great mans longtime adjutant dowling had long since concluded libbie custer was the brains of the outfit george put on a better showlibbie in public was selfeffacing as could bebut she was the one who thought straight outside general pershings headquarters guards meticulously checked the limousine front to back top to bottom at last one of them told the driver youre all right go on through thanks jonesy the driver said and put the motorcar back into gear still as bad as that custer asked will they blow us to kingdom come if we give them half a chance we hope not pershing said still and all wed rather not find out they dont love us and thats a fact dowling added good custer said if they loved us that would mean we were soft on them and wed better not be soft if we let them up for even a minute the mormons will start conspiring with the limeys or the rebs same as they did in the last war and same as they did fortyodd years ago too there was another obsolete word only men of custers generation still called the confederates rebels and men of custers generation these days were thin on the ground the armored limousine stopped once more this time inside the secure compound a company stood at stiff attention awaiting custers inspection the retired general didnt notice them till a soldier held the door for him and he got out of the automobile when he did he tried to straighten up as he made his slow way over to them he reminded dowling of a fire horse put out to pasture that heard the alarm bell once more and wanted to pull the engine again around soldiers he came alive most of the men there in the courtyard were conscripts too young to have served in the great war they still responded to custer though grinning at his bad jokes and telling him their home towns when he asked in a low voice general pershing said he looks like he wishes he were still in uniform im sure he does sir dowling answered also quietly the socialists practically had to drag him out of it he clicked his tongue between his teeth remembering that was an ugly scene those people pershing shook his head its not for us to meddle in politics and i know thats a good rule but there are times when im tempted to say exactly whats on my mind yes sir dowling said at the banquet that evening custer ate with good appetite and drank perhaps two glasses of white wine too many afterwards libbie told him time to get to bed autie she might have been talking to a child that had stayed up too late in a moment my dear custer answered before struggling to his feet once more he turned to dowling and said do you know major there are times since they took the uniform off me when i simply feel adrift on the seas of fate once upon a time i mastered the helm but no more major no more this is what the years have done dowling couldnt blame custer for forgetting his present rank and using the one hed had when they served together during the war yes sir he said and then im sorry sir to his amazement tears stung his eyes custer had lived too long and knew it could any man suffer a worse fate dowling shook his head he doubted it god bless you major custer said he let his wife still competent as always lead him out of the dining hall one of those tears slid down dowlings cheek he would have been more embarrassedhe would have been mortifiedif he hadnt seen that general pershings face was wet too i n a way sitting in the socialist party offices in new yorks fourteenth ward took flora blackford back to the days when shed been flora hamburger waiting for the latest batch of election returns made her remember how nervous shed been when her name first appeared on the ballot ten years before in another way though coming back reminded her how much things had changed she didnt get back from philadelphia all that often even though the two cities were only a couple of hours apart by train she didnt hear yiddish spoken all that often any more either she had to stop and think and listen to understand what had been her first language was now on the way to becoming foreign to her a telephone rang herman bruck picked it up hed been sweet on flora while she still lived in new york city and maybe his smile had a wistful quality to it when he looked at her now on the other hand maybe it didnt he had a fouryearold of his own and a twoyearold and a sixmonthold besides that was bound to be more than enough to keep anybody busy he scribbled something on a pad on his battered old desk latest returns in our districthamburger uh blackford cantorowicz cheers filled the office the democrat abraham cantorowicz wasnt quite a token candidate but he hadnt had any great chance of winning either the congressional district whose borders roughly corresponded to those of the fourteenth ward had been solidly socialist since before the turn of the century on floras lap joshua blackford began to fuss he was sleepy at not quite one he was up well past his bedtime and in a strange place besides she was surprised he hadnt started making a racket before this the telephone rang again again herman bruck picked it up then he laid his palm against the mouthpiece and said flora its for you its cantorowicz more cheerseveryone knew what that had to mean flora passed her son to her husband heremind him for a few minutes please she said hosea blackford took the toddler this is what the vice president is for he said with a laugh he takes over so somebody else can go do something important that got two waves of laughterone from those who followed it in english and another after it got translated into yiddish flora made her way to the telephone this is congresswoman blackford she said and youll have two more years of being a congresswoman abraham cantorowicz told her i dont see how i can catch you and whats the point in waiting to make this call after the handwriting goes up on the walls another election another democrat calling to concede congratulations thank you very much thats gracious of you flora said you ran a strong campaign hed run as well as a democrat in this district could someone had to be the sacrificial lambwe werent about to let you run unopposed cantorowicz answered we will keep fighting for this district and well win one of these days not soon i dont think flora answered maybe sooner than you think her defeated opponent answered will you run for reelection when your husband runs for president flora sent hosea blackford a look half startled half thoughtful she knew perfectly well he was thinking of running in upton sinclair almost certainly wouldnt seek a third term the only president whod ever run a third time was theodore roosevelt hed won the great war made himself twice a national heroand lost anyhow the united states werent ready for one man ruling on and on you arent saying anything cantorowicz remarked no im not flora told him we still have a couple of years to worry about that maybe you should run anyway the democratic candidate said if he loses and you win youd still be able to support your family i dont think wed have to worry there flora answered coolly she wasnt kidding hosea blackford was a talented lawyer with years of government connections he would have no trouble making his way even ifgod forbidhe lost the election flora wasnt sure she liked that in the abstract whom a man knew shouldnt have mattered so much as what he knew but that didnt change reality one bit when i first went into congress i would have tried to change reality i did try to change reality and i even had some luck she thought she took pride in being called the conscience of the house but ten years there had taught her some things were unlikely to change in her lifetime or her sons or his sons either if he had a son cantorowicz said well i hope you have to worry about it but you dont want to listen to that right now you want to celebrate and youve earned the right good night good night flora told him the line went dead silence had fallen in the socialist party office everyone was looking at her she put the phone back on the hook and nodded hes conceded she said cheers and whoops shattered the silence people came up and shook floras hand and thumped her on the back as if she were a man the racket woke up joshua whod fallen asleep in hoseas lap the little boy started to cry hosea comforted him before long he fell asleep again his thumb in his mouth someone knocked on the door eventually one of the men in the office heard the noise and opened it there stood sheldon fleischmann who ran the butchers shop downstairs he looked a lot like his father max the elder fleischmann had quietly fallen over behind his counter one day and never got up again like his father sheldon was a democrat flora doubted hed voted for her even so he was carrying a tray of cold cuts as max had done more than once on election nights you dont need to do that flora scolded him youre not even a socialist i try to be a good neighbor though fleischmann answered thats more important than politics if everyone thought that way wed hardly need politics hosea blackford said his flat great plains accent stood out among the sharp often yiddishflavored new york voices in the office sheldon fleischmanns gaze swung to him in momentary surprise then the butcher realized who he had to be youre right mr vice president he said giving blackford a respectful nod but too many people dont no they dont blackford agreed i did say if yes you did fleischmann allowed mazeltov congresswoman he chuckled ive been saying that so long it starts to sound natural and why shouldnt it challenge rang from floras voice had the butcher said something about women having no place in congress flora would have exploded she was ready to do it even now but his answer was mild only because there are a lot of men in congress maam and just a couple of women you do say what youre used to flora couldnt very well argue there however much she might have wanted to she nodded all right she said i suppose ill let you get away with that by the relief on sheldon fleischmanns face he felt as if he had got away with it mazeltov again he said and went downstairs once more in the office herman bruck was talking with maria tresca maria was one of the few italians in the overwhelmingly jewish fourteenth ward shed also been a thoroughgoing radical even before her sister was killed in the remembrance day riots of for as long as flora could remember maria had stood foursquare for the proletariat and against the power of big capitalists now though she listened attentively as bruck said amalgamated mills is a very solid firm they make finequality goods and i think their stock is going to go straight through the roof i got fifteen shares when it was at thirtytwo last month and its already gone up five and a half points when it came to cloth he knew what he was talking about he was a master tailor from a family of tailors and always dressed as if he made five times as much as he really did flora wasnt much surprised when maria tresca gave back a serious nod but she was surprised when strongly socialist maria offered a stock tip of her own i just bought five shares of central powers steel in toledo they landed that new contract for the great lakes fleet and they may split two for one soon central powers steel eh herman brucks round face grew alert ill have to look into that youre both buying shares in the stock market flora knew she sounded amazed she managed to keep from calling it speculating though that was what it was bruck looked faintly embarrassed but he said ive made a lot of money the last year and a halfthats how long ive been in and you only need to put up ten percent of the money when you buy on margin so its a lot cheaper than it seems its a lot cheaper as long as the market goes up flora said if it comes down you need to pay more money or lose your shares its gone up for a long time now bruck replied i dont see why it should do anything else all of a sudden flora wasnt sure how to answer that or even if it had an answer she turned to maria tresca youre putting money into wall street you of all people yes some maria answered defiantly if capitalism can make a secretary rich lets see it happen i hope it can and if it cantshe shruggedim not putting in more than i can afford to lose well thats good flora said i can think of a lot of people who arent being so careful though what we need is more regulation of the market to keep cheats and swindlers from having their way with people maria tresca said i dont know too much about what goes on in the stock market but that looks pretty clear to me some of those people will yank the shirt off your back and then sell it to you sadly flora answered i think youre right but getting the legislation through congress is a different story the democrats are against it and so are the republicans and more than a few socialists have made so much money in the market they think its the goose that lays golden eggs too she looked over at her husband he held their sleeping son all his attention for the time being resting on the little boy but flora knew hosea also had money invested in wall street she didnt know exactly how much hed never talked much with her about that socialism in dakota was altogether a milder thing a more natively american thing than it was here in new york city what was shocking from herman and maria would have been nothing out of the ordinary for hosea blackford though he and they belonged to the same party hed never cared to rub floras nose in the ideological differences between them but if even thoroughgoing socialists were buying and selling stocks where had those differences gone would you use your own money to try to make a killing in the market flora asked herself she didnt think so even now but she admitted to herself that she wasnt sure are you a capitalist do you want to be a capitalist it was like asking herself if she wanted to become a christian very much like that she realizedsocialism was about as much an article of faith with her as was judaism and yet if i can provide for my family why not but that was the question could she one thing shed learned in school still seemed truewhat went up had to come down herman bruck didnt seem to believe that any more for his sake and the sake of many more like him flora hoped the rules had changed since shed got out of public school number r ain pattered down on hipolito rodriguezs farm outside of baroyeca here in the south of sonora winter rains were less common than those that came off the gulf of california in the summertime rain at any season came seldom were it not for the streams and ditches bringing water down from the mountains into the valley near whose edge baroyeca sat the town the farms around it and the silver mine close by couldnt have survived chickens hopped in surprise when raindrops hit them they pecked at the puffs of dust the raindrops kicked up maybe they thought those puffs were bugs rodriguez wasnt sure what if anything went through their minds he could think along with the rest of the livestock the mule though a powerful animal was as evil as any beast ever born but trying to think like a hen was more trouble than it was worth the pigs seemed brilliant next to hens dark gray clouds rolled down from the northwest the day was chilly as chilly as it ever got near baroyeca rodriguez was glad to stand close by the fire in the kitchen his wife patted cornmeal into tortillas looking up from her work magdalena said do you know what we need hipolito no what rodriguez answered we need a stove his wife said most of their conversation was in spanish but the key word came out in english she went on a good iron stove would cook better than i can with an open fire it would pay for itself too because it would save fuel it would even keep the kitchen warm on days like this because less heat would go up the chimney and i think we can afford one a stove rodriguez also said it in english he scratched his head magdalena had always cooked over an open fire so had his mother so had everyone he supposed for as long as his ancestors had lived in baroyeca but times werent what they had been back in the old days he knew that cautiously he asked how much would a stove cost twentyseven dollars and sixty cents magdalena said without a moments hesitation i saw just the one i want in the henderson and fisk catalogue henderson and fisk was a leading confederate mailorder house and had been since before the great war only after the currency stabilized again though had its catalogues started coming to places as remote from the concerns of most of the csa as baroyeca magdalena went on its called the southern sunshine cook stove and it will do everything i need again the name of the stove came out in english a stove rodriguez said musingly id bet a lot of women in baroyeca itself dont cook on stoves changes filtered down to southern sonora more slowly than almost anywhere else in the csa and the confederate states had been founded on the principle that change was a bad idea im sure youre right his wife agreed but i dont care we have the money we even have the money for the stovepipe to take the smoke outsideanother eightyfive cents if she said they had it they had it she kept track of finances with an eye that watched every penny even when the money went mad after the great war when a billion dollars had been nothing much magdalena had stretched things as far as they would go the patron had never had cause to complain about the rodriguezes the patron does don gustavos wife cook on a stove rodriguez asked magdalena let out a dismissive snort dona elena doesnt cook at all they have a cook of their own as you know perfectly well but it was a serious question if the patron didnt have an iron stove in his house what would he think of a peasant familys getting one seeing the worry on hipolito rodriguezs face magdalena said dont worry i found out dona elenas cook does use a stove all right good very good rodriguez didnt try to hide his relief things werent so rigid in the csa as they were down in the empire of mexico and they werent so rigid now as they had been in his fathers day but he didnt want to offend don gustavo even so better safe than sorry he told himself to his wife he said next time i go to town ill send the order to henderson and fisk good yes magdalena nodded and then the railroad will bring the crate and then we will have a stove a hamlet like baroyeca would never have had a railroad connection if not for the mine close by in plenty of places in sonora and chihuahua the last leg of the journey from merchandiser to customer would have been by rattling wagon or possibly these days by rattling truck but not here the trains that took out precious metal could bring in a stove from birmingham the mine also meant baroyeca boasted a post office a few doors down from la culebra verde the stars and bars floated above the whitewashed adobe building when rodriguez went in jose cordero the postmaster put aside the newspaper hed been reading he was a plump man with a small mustache and with his hair parted on the right and greased immovably into place and what can i do for you today he inquired postage stamps no senor i have some rodriguez replied politely by virtue of his office the postmaster was a person of consequence i wish to purchase a postal money order and to send the money to henderson and fisk he spoke with a certain amount of pride not every farmer could scrape together the cash for such a purchase corderos answering nod was grave for he recognized as much he made a small ceremony of taking out the book of money orders what is the amount thirtyone dollars and seventysix cents rodriguez said that included the stove the stovepipe and thirdclass freight he set banknotes and coins on the counter till he had exactly the right amount the postmaster counted the money then nodded again yes that is correct for the order itself he said he filled out the money order then added you must also know of course there is a fee of thirtytwo cents for the use of the order rodriguez winced he hadnt sent a money order in so long hed forgotten that onepercent fee he fished in his pockets he had some change lurking there hed intended to visit la culebra verde after sending away for the stove he found a quarter and a dime jose cordero solemnly gave him back three cents he sighed he couldnt buy a beer for that then he found another dime he brightened he could go to the cantina after all how long will the stove take to come he asked ah is that what youre getting good for you the postmaster said how long he looked up at the ceiling as he made mental calculations my best guess would be three weeks or a month you should light a candle for every day sooner than three weeks gracias senor rodriguez said that was about what hed thought now he could use corderos authority when he told magdalena el gusto es mio cordero replied rodriguez didnt think the pleasure really was his but he always spoke politely he went on i hope your wife gets much use and much enjoyment from it my own ana has had a stove now for several years and she would never go back to cooking over an open fire the stove is much cleaner too i had not thought of that but im sure it would be rodriguez hid a smile hed done a little bragging and the postmaster had responded with some of his own that was the way life worked it is cordero said positively youve spent a lot of money but you wont be sorry for it he sounded as if he were giving a personal guarantee without doubt you have reason rodriguez inked a pen scrawled the name of the mailorder form on the envelope put in the order form and the money order and handed cordero the envelope the postmaster looked embarrassed personally i would gladly send it for nothing you understand though i cannot be my own man in this matter i am but a servant of the confederate government i must ask you for five cents more for the stamp that shows you have paid me postage with a sigh rodriguez realized he hadnt brought a stamp of his own along he passed cordero the dime hed found but eight cents wouldnt let him go into the cantina before the war beer had been five cents but it was a dime nowadays no help for it though he watched the postmaster put the envelope in the bin of mail that would leave baroyeca once it was there he left the post office standing on the board sidewalk he sighed again no point in going into la culebra verde when he had no money to buy he thought little of men who sat around in there hoping to cadge drinks from their more prosperous friends and neighbors he didnt want to be one of those freeloaders himself but he didnt want to turn around and head straight back to the farm either what point to that he didnt escape from it often enough to care to go home as fast as he could what to do then he looked up and down baroyecas main street calle de los estados confederados wondering which shops he could visit without drawing sneers from the proprietors a man with eight cents in his pocket couldnt buy much he jingled the coins because of the pennies they did sound like more his eyes snapped back to a building at the far end of the street it had stood empty since the weekly newspaper folded in the middle of the great inflation now he saw it was empty no more a couple of bright new words were painted on the front window from his angle he couldnt make out what they were he ambled toward the building still jingling his few paltry coins before long he could read the words he stopped in surprise and pleasure a grin spreading over his face freedom the window shouted and below that in slightly smaller letterslibertad as he got closer still he could make out the much smaller words under the big ones freedom party headquarters baroyeca sonora everyone welcome everyone welcome hipolito rodriguezs grin got wider he stopped fooling with the coins and went in inside a blond man with his hair cut short like a soldiers clattered away at a typewriter rodriguez didnt scowl but he felt like it from what hed seen in the army a lot of white confederates looked down on sonorans and chihuahuans almost as much as they did on negroesunless the sonorans and chihuahuans had money of course he laughed a sour laugh the eight cents in his pocket didnt qualify but this fellow startled him buenos dias como esta usted he said in pretty good spanish it plainly wasnt his first language but he managed more than well enough me llamo robert quinn he went on represento el partido de libertad en baroyeca en que puedo servirle hello mr quinn rodriguez said in english to the man who represented the freedom party in baroyeca i do not know what you can do for me i came in because i saw you were here and i wanted to find out why bueno excelente quinn continued in spanish como se llama senor rodriguez gave his name he added why does the freedom party have an office here he couldnt imagine the radical liberals or the whigs opening a headquarters in baroyeca the town simply wasnt big enough but quinn said para ganar elecciones having an office here will help you win elections rodriguez returned to spanish since the freedom party man seemed comfortable in it how we did well here in we elected a congressman from this district robert quinn replied in the same language we intend to do better still this year after all in we will elect a president with gods helpand some from the votersit will be jake featherston i have only eight cents right now rodriguez said not mentioning the thirtyodd dollars hed just sent to birmingham he kept quiet about that on purpose was this truly a party that might do a poor man some good hed find out with eight cents how can i help you quinn didnt laugh at him or tell him to go away instead seriously and soberly he began to explain exactly what rodriguez could do for the freedom party and what the party might do for him he talked for about ten minutes by the time he finished rodriguez was sure he would go on voting freedom as long as he lived that wasnt all he was sure of either he would go out and preach for the party too he felt like one of the very first christians in ancient days hed met a disciple and now he was a disciple himself c olonel irving morrell hadnt heard the garrison in kamloops british columbia so animated so excited since hed got there from philadelphia more than a year before he would have been happier though had something military sparked the excitement but all the gossip centered on chevrolets proposed acquisition of the white motor company white as far as morrell was concerned made the best trucks in the world no one seemed to care about that what people were talking about was what the acquisition would do to the stock prices of the two companies by midafternoon morrell had had as much of that as he could take god forbid we should have to fight a war on a day when the market goes down he said he was a colonel which meant he outranked everyone who sat in the mess hall with him at last though a captain named david smith said well sir you never can tell it might make us meaner silence fell people waited to see how morrell would take that ever since hed come west from general staff headquarters hed made a name for himself as a man no one sensible would trifle with but smiths line was too good to make him angry he grinned and said heres hoping anyhow the mess hall relaxed he could almost feel the soft sighs of relief that came from just about everyone in philadelphia a lot of soldiers had spent a lot of time laughing at him the officers here took him seriously his record was too good to ignore and a colonels eagles carried a lot more weight in kamloops than they had back at general staff headquarters that wasnt why hed been so eager to get out of philadelphia hed never cared one way or the other about being a big fish in a small pond all he wanted were a job he liked and the chance to do it without anybody looking over his shoulder he hadnt had those in philadelphia he did here captain smith decided to push it a little adding besides sir well never get rich on army pay if were going to wouldnt you rather have us playing the market than knocking over a bank that went too far morrell got to his feet he carried his tray of dishes toward the waiting cooks over his shoulder he answered if you want to get rich you dont belong in the army in the first place and if youre not in the army i dont give a damn what youre doing no one held a gun to your head to make you put on this uniform captain if you want to resign your commission ill be glad to help you with the paperwork smith turned very red he said no sir i dont want to do that i dont want to do that at all morrell handed the tray to a man in an apron whod drawn kitchen duty everyone eyed him wondering how he would reply he didnt want to get any deeper into the argument so all he said was remember why you did join then captain as he left the hall that silence returned his leg twinged it hadnt for a while hed been wounded when the great war was young and that was lord he thought in surprise thats heading toward thirteen years ago now wheres the time gone he took his thick wool overcoat from its hanger and wrapped it around himself kamloops lay where the north and south branches of the thompson river came together in a valley near the foot of the canadian rockies even in philadelphia morrell would have been glad to have an overcoat on most february days there were daysand more than a few of themin kamloops when he would have been glad to have two of them cold slapped his face when he went outside he shoved his hands into the overcoats pockets to keep them from freezing the rolling country around the town was in summer a near desert of tumbleweed and sagebrush snow painted it white at this season of the year and white it would stay for another couple of months morrell sighed his breath smoked as if hed exhaled after a drag on a cigarette the flat land would have been ideal for testing barrels hed said so too in the very first report he sent back to philadelphia he wondered if anybody had read that report or even bothered to take it out of its envelope he had his doubts no one certainly had acted on the suggestion or even acknowledged it so far as he knew no one in the usa was testing barrels anywhere else either he kicked at the snow which flew up from his boots down in the empire of mexico the machines the confederatebacked imperialists used were at least as good as the ones hed been experimenting with back at fort leavenworth before budget cuts shut down the program the rebels didnt have barrels that could match them and the rebels by now had just about lost the civil war he kicked at the snow again the ottoman turks werent massacring armenians these days the way they had a few years before but american intervention had nothing to do with that kaiser wilhelmwho wasnt good old kaiser bill any morehad ignored us protests and so had abdul majid the ottoman sultan theyd figured the united states had more urgent things to worry about closer to home and theyd been right they made us look like a bunch of chumps is what they did morrell thought as he walked toward his office a horsedrawn garbage wagon rattled up the road toward him he nodded to the men aboard it the canadian white wings pretended he didnt exist they took money from the american occupiers but that didnt mean they wanted anything else to do with them yes the us army had snuffed out the latest uprising a couple of years before but it didnt seem to matter the canucks were going to stay sullen for a long long time to come how do we keep them from causing more trouble next year or five years from now or fifteen years from now or fifty years from now morrell wondered he wished he could talk to some german officers even if things between the two greatest powers left in the world werent so friendly as they had been up till the war ended the kaisers men were occupying a hostile belgium now and theyd been occupying a hostile alsace and lorraine for more than fifty years they had lots of practice at ruling territory that didnt want to be ruled seldom had morrell had a wish so promptly granted when he got to the office building his aidedecamp a lieutenant named ike horwitz said sir theres a german officer waiting to see you said you saw action together during the war captain guderian by god morrell exclaimed in delight he was an observer with my unit when we were fighting over by banff just a couple of hundred miles from here yes sir horwitz said only hes a lieutenant colonel now if i remember german rank markings straight ohand hes got an orderly with him a sergeant something in horwitzs voice changed morrell needed a second to realize what it was you dont like the orderly no sir horwitz said with more of that same stiffness why not morrell asked curiously he figured out i was a jew horwitz answered it probably hadnt taken much figuring morrells aidedecamp looked very jewish indeed with a nose of impressive proportions he didnt think i spoke any germanand i dont not really but yiddish is close enough to let me understand it when i hear it oh morrell said well to hell with him guderians not like that i can tell you for a fact he doesnt care one way or the other lieutenant horwitz nodded he told his orderly to keep quiet and mind his own business i just sat here and minded mine good for you ike i wanted to punch the bastard right in the nose dont blame you a bit but you didnt and that makes you a good soldier horwitzs snort said he would sooner have been a bad soldier morrell went into his office heinz guderian bounded up from a chair to shake his hand sure enough the energetic german had a single gold pip on each fancy shoulder strapa lieutenant colonels insignia his orderly sprang to his feet too and gave morrell a crisp salute the fellow wore an iron cross first class that gave morrell pause it hadnt been easy for a noncom to win that medal second class yesfirst no the man might be a son of a bitch but hed done something special during the war he spoke in german excuse me sir but i know no english its all right morrell replied in the same language i can get along in german his voice hardened a little and so can my aidedecamp lieutenant colonel guderian grimaced his orderly was unabashed so he knows what i think of his kind does he well too bad the world would be a better place if we got rid of the lot of them nonsense morrell said sharply he thought damn fool sounds like jake featherston except hes riding a different hobby horse the sergeant might have replied but guderian held up a hand and said enough his orderly had discipline he fumed but he subsided then guderian switched to english this is not why i came to talk to you colonel morrell well what can i do for you then morrell asked i was wondering if you could arrange for me a tour of occupied western canada the german officer said we are interested in the methods you americans use to control the lands you have won what is so funny colonel ill tell you whats funny morrell answered when he got done laughing whats funny is i was just wondering how you germans held on to belgium and alsacelorraine what weve been doing here hasnt worked out so well as wed have liked the canadians still hate our guts we smashed their last uprising but theyre liable to rebel again any old time if you know a trick for keeping people quiet i wouldnt mind learning it what does he say sir guderians orderly asked with the air of a man humoring a subordinate who didnt really deserve it guderian translated the sergeant made an almost operatic gesture of contempt its simple he declared kill enough and youll frighten the rest into giving in guderian sighed spater spater he said and turned back to morrell thats the only answer he knowskill everything in sight you dont get any arguments that way anyhow morrell observed no nor any chance to put things right later the german said so you americans have no sure answers for this either then im afraid not ill be glad to set up your tour for you but i dont think youll see anything very exciting morrell answered ill make damn sure you dont see anything too very exciting as a matter of fact he thought if youre looking for ideas from us that means you need em badly and if you dont get em youll have more trouble holding down your subjects if you ever wind up in a scrap with us thank you i should perhaps let you know certain american officers are in belgium now trying to learn from us guderian smiled and shrugged between us your country and mine share the problems of the strong nicht wahr yes morrell said and i bet our boys dont learn one damn thing from you either except where the officers brothels are he wagged a finger at the german nobodys looking at what youre doing in the east in poland and the ukraine heinz guderian shook his head no colonel no one looks thereand it is as well that no one does too his eyes swung toward his toughtalking orderly in the east his methods prevail poland pretends to be a kingdom the ukraine he shook his head after all theyre only slavs he might have been a confederate saying after all theyre only niggers morrell smiled with half his mouth either way god help the poor bastards on the receiving end a t seventeen mary mcgregor had got used to being taller than her mother her father after all had been a big man she remembered that very well though these days she had trouble calling up the memory of just what his voice had sounded like she also remembered when her mothers hair had been the color of a bright new penny now she couldnt help noticing how much gray streaked that oncebright hair she hadnt noticed it as it spread one day it seemed that gray had simply appeared as if by magic but magic is supposed to be good mary thought looking out across the fields she and her mother and her sister and whatever hired man they got for the spring would be planting soon soon but not yet snow a deeper blanket than usual still covered those fields winter had been hard even for manitoba mary clenched her fists so that her nails dug into her palms this far north the growing season was short enough anyhow a late spring could make harvest touchandgo before frosts came again in early fall if they didnt get a good crop well so what mary thought and went out to tend the horse and the cow and the rest of the livestock in the barn what if weve got no money and they throw us off the farm she knew the family had relatives back in ontario her father had come west to manitoba when he was a boy but the mcgregors werent close to any of those kin maryd never met a one of them would they take us in times were supposed to be even harder back there than they were herenot only had ontario been fought over harder than manitoba the rebellion there had been worse were on our own nobody cares whether we live or die mary shook her head that wasnt true the americans hoped the mcgregors died theyd killed her brother alexander theyd killed her father too oh yes his own bomb meant for general custer had been the actual means of his death but he never would have become a bomber in the first place if the stinking yanks hadnt decided alexander was plotting against them and stood him against a wall some of those dark thoughts faded away when mary went into the barn it was warmer in there with the walls holding out the wind and holding in the animals body warmth somebody from the city might have wrinkled his nose at the odor mary took it for granted shed smelled it all her life and the work distracted her she gave the horse and cow and sheep hay and put down corn for the chickens then she mucked out the stalls the manure would go on the garden and on as much of the fields as it would cover she handled pitchfork and shovel with matteroffact skill her hands had thick bands of callus across the palms her nails were short and blunt and dirty a dozen scars seamed her fingers and the backs of her handsanyone who did a lot of work with sharp tools had accidents now and then every once in a while she thought wistfully of a manicure but how much good would it do a day after she got it shed be back in the barn and out in the fields once more hens squawked and tried to peck as she lifted them off their nests so she could gather eggs one of them did more than try the birds beak drew blood she gave it a baleful stare chicken and dumplings she whispered fried chicken chicken soup the bird looked back out of beady little eyes it was too stupid to be afraid it was only indignant at having its nest robbedand being a hen would forget about that in short order instead of taking the basket of eggs straight back to the house mary sat down for a moment to rest she leaned back against an old wagon wheel that had been sitting in the barn ever since she was a little girl the iron tire on the wheel showed red streaks of rust the wheel had a couple of broken spokes not for the first time she wondered why her father had left it there instead of either repairing it or getting what use he could from the wood and the iron letting things lie idle wasnt like him she shrugged shed never get the chance to ask him now if she ever needed anything that wheel could provide she wouldnt hesitate to take it or if she had to she thought she could fix it she hadnt tried her hand at carpentry till her father died as with so much else shed had to learn the hard wayseveral of the scars on her hands came from slips but she could do things nowadays that would have amazed her a few years before with a sigh she climbed to her feet again picked up the basket and headed back to the farmhouse she blinked in surprise when she saw a buggy by the house people didnt visit the mcgregors very often she walked faster curious to see whod broken the unwritten rule a couple of fords sped past on the road that led to rosenfeld one was painted greengray which meant it belonged to the us army the other was the more usual black all the same odds were it had a yank inside even now almost ten years after the war ended not many canadians could afford a motorcar and most of the ones who can are a bunch of damned collaborators mary thought she opened the kitchen door her mother sat at a table drinking tea with another woman of about her own age who was saying i tell you maude its a disgrace im sure she and that yank she broke off and smiled hello mary how are you im fine mrs marble thank you mary laughed at herself thinking she should have recognized the buggy tell me more beth her mother said you can be sure mary wont let it get to the wrong ears well i didnt expect she would beth marble answered sipping her tea she was a couple of inches shorter than marys mother with shoulderlength brown hair blue eyes rather flat features and a habitual expression of good humor after picking up a shortbread wafer from the plate on the table she did go on with her story one more tale of a canadian girl whod lost her virtue to a fasttalking american with a fancy motorcar and with money in his pocket mary listened with only half an ear she hardly knew this girl who lived even farther from the mcgregors than did the marbles and shed been hearing such stories ever since the days of the great war only the details varied the american conquest of canada continued on many different levels soldiers occupied the land american men seduced canadian women newspapers printed only what the conquerors wanted the conquered to read films pounded home the same messages as shed seen at the bijou so did the wireless not that shed ever heard it canadian schools taught the us view of historya pack of lies as far as mary was concerned her parents had pulled her and julia out of school when the yanks changed the curriculum most children though had kept on going and the americans had been in charge of such things for quite a while now how long till a whole generation forgot what being canadian meant mary put the eggs shed gathered on the counter she went over to the table may i have a wafer mother she asked and took one when maude mcgregor nodded such lovely manners beth marble said and beamed at marys mother both your daughters are so sweet and charming maude do you know me at all mary wondered as she nibbled at the shortbread i dont think so in her own mind she was as much a fighter against the american occupation as her father had been more of a fighter than her brother had beeneven if the yanks had murdered him for his opposition to their rule sweet charming she felt like pouring a cup of tea and then spilling it on their visitor even if mrs marble had meant well as she surely had as much to make a point as because she really wanted it mary took another shortbread wafer this time without asking permission mrs marble engrossed in another bit of gossipshe did like to talkfailed to notice marys mother did and wagged a finger at her from behind beth marbles back mary stuck out her tongue her mother raised her teacup to her mouth to hide a smile but her eyes danced above it carrying that second piece of shortbread away as booty mary went into the parlor two steps in were more than enough to show her shed made a mistake her older sister sat on the rocking chair in there and beth marbles son kenneth on the sofa close by more plainly than words julias look said the two of them didnt want any company face heating mary mumbled i i guess ill go upstairs now hello kenneth hello mary kenneth marble answered politely but he kept his eyes on julia as he spoke hed been coming to call for most of a year now sometimes with his mother sometimes without he was the first young man whod come to call on julia since ted culligan broke off their engagement after her fathers death there were times over the past few months when julia had got all dreamy and absentminded mary didnt take that for a good sign up the stairs she went fast as her legs would carry her when she turned around and looked back julia and kenneth were leaning towards each other she sighed she didnt know what julia saw in him he was only an inch or two taller than she and to marys eyes nothing much to look at some actress had got a reputation as the girl with it in julias eyes plainly kenneth marble had it mary still found it more bewildering than exciting she flopped down on her bed and started reading a copy of the ladies home journal shed got the last time she went into rosenfeld the magazine showed her a whole different world and not just because it came from the usa skinny girls in short dresses strode city streets rode in motorcars listened to the wireless lived in apartments used electric lights and telephones and did all sorts of other things mary thought herself unlikely ever to do even more than what they did that they took it so completely for granted was daunting if it werent for the recipes and patterns the journal included marys mother probably wouldnt have let it come into the farmhouse nothing could have been better calculated to make someone on a farm discontented with her life this issue even had a story about flying to california for a holiday flying for pleasure the only aeroplanes mary had even seen were the fighting scouts and bombers that had buzzed above the farm during the great war she couldnt imagine wanting to get into one of those the journal also had an article about a journey on an ocean liner mary couldnt decide whether she found stranger the idea of a liner or that of the ocean itself shed never seen it and didnt expect she ever would before she could read much of the article a commotion broke out downstairs julia and their mother and beth marble sounded even more excited than the hens had when mary rifled their nests she flipped the magazine closed and hurried down to see what had happened she found her older sister in tears with their mother and mrs marble both embracing her kenneth marble stood off to one side a sickly grin on his face mary stared at him had he tried to with his own mother and julias in the next room he couldnt have been that stupid could he then mary noticed both her mother and beth marble were crying and smiling at the same time maude mcgregor said kenneth just asked julia to marry him and she said yes oh mary couldnt have said anything more if she tried she felt as if shed been punched in the pit of the stomach even breathing was hard the first thought that went through her mind was how will we do the work if julia moves away even with all three of them working flat out it barely got done despite her mothers smile maude mcgregor looked worried too mrs marble seemed oblivious to the glance that went between mary and her mother it wasnt her trouble after all this is the happiest day of my life julia said beth marble burst into tears again mary congratulated her sister what a liar i am she thought americanempire thecentercannothold viii t o anne colletons ears jbh norris drawl sounded harsh and ignorant but the texas oil man had proved a sharp operator in spite of that backwoods accent hope youll see fit to invest in our operation here maam he said tipping his hat to her the stetson with its high crown and wide brim also told her she wasnt in south carolina any more she was near the banks of the brazos river northwest of fort worth and she had questions that went beyond profit and loss she pointed west that new yankee state of houston isnt very far away what happens if theres another war how are you going to keep us soldiers and aeroplanes from wrecking everything youve got maam youd do better asking richmond about that than me norris answered if they hadnt given up so much last time we wouldnt need to fret about it now yes but they did and so we do anne slapped at something the mosquitoes were coming out early this afternoon it wasnt quite so muggy as it would have been back home but it would do jbh norris said dont quite know what to tell you about that except i dont think a wars coming any time soon no anne said bleakly i dont either were too weak thats about the size of it norris agreed at least president mitchel has the sense to see it that featherston maniac would get us into a fight we cant hope to win i used to like him better than i do now but he hasnt got any real chance of getting elected anyway anne said so im a whig again some people dont much like that but ive never much cared for what people like or dont like she changed the subject but only a little what do you think of the supreme court ruling that lets mitchel run again well the constitution says a president serves the sixyear term hes elected for and then hes done norris shrugged president mitchel didnt run for the jobhe got it when that calkins bastardpardon me maamkilled president hampton so i suppose its only fair to let him try and win it again on his own and calkins was one of those freedom party fools so im not surprised the supreme court gave it to featherston right between the eyes yes that occurred to me too featherston frightened peoplepowerful peoplea few years ago now theyre going to make him pay for it anne colletons smile had a certain predatory quality enough so that jbh norris flinched when she turned it on him rather than the world at large she went on i do thank you for showing me around youve given me a lot to think aboutmore than i expected when i came out to texas in fact i may well put some of my money here once i get home norris beamed thatd be wonderful we can use the capital and im not lyin when i tell you so he scratched his cheek with his left hand only then did anne notice his ring finger was just a stump a war wound probably a lot of men had such small mutilations he added if youre heading back east youd better not waste a lot of time from what the papers say the flood in the mississippi valley just keeps gettin worse and worse i know anne had been reading the papers too anger roiled her voice and its hurt us so much worse than it hit the damnyankees if they hadnt stolen kentucky and that piece of arkansas from us it wouldnt have hurt them much at all cairo illinois got flooded she rolled her eyes cairo illinois never was any sort of a place to begin with but weve had memphis and little rock just drowned and the levees in new orleans were holding by this muchshe held thumb and forefinger close togetherwhen i went through louisiana on my way here may not be so easy gettin back norris warned why not anne said most of the bridges over the mississippi are still standing yes maam the oil man nodded again the bridges over the mississippi are still good theyre the big strong ones and they were built to take whatever the river could throw at em but what about the bridges on the way to the mississippi an awful lot of themll go down i bet i may be wrong but thats sure enough how it looks to me anne muttered something under her breath it wasnt quite far enough under for jbh norris gingery eyebrows leapt upwards hell never think of me as a lady again anne thought and did her best not to giggle well fair enough because im damn well not worry wiped out the temptation to laugh youre dead right mr norris and i wish id thought of that myself please take me back to my hotel i cant afford to waste much time can i no i dont reckon you can norris said wish i could see more of you but i know how things are cars right over there he pointed to a middleaged birmingham outside the shack that did duty for an office how does he mean that anne wondered spend more time with me or see me with my clothes off ten years even five years before she would have had no doubt but she wasnt so young as she had been im just as picky as i ever was though maybe pickier thats likely why i havent got a husband yet nobody suits me maybe tom was right ive been on my own too long the ride back to fort worth took close to three hours a blowout halfway there didnt help jbh norris fixed it with the aplomb of one whod done it many times beforeand what driver hadntbut it still cost a half hour anne wished she could have got back she checked out of the dandridge as soon as norris stopped the motorcar in front of the hotel then she hurled her luggage into a cab and made for the train station across town before the war she would have had a colored servant or more than one taking care of her no more and she didnt miss them either shed discovered she was more efficient than anyone whose main aim was to do as little as possible that had proved oddly liberating where she would have expected losing servants to do just the opposite but the time lost to the blowout rose up to haunt her at the station sorry maam but the eastbound express pulled out of here about twenty minutes ago the clerk in the ticket window said next one doesnt leave till ten tonight damnation anne said can i take a local and connect with another express east of here sooner than that i do want to beat the flood if i can i have to get back to south carolina i understand maam lets see what i can do the clerk flipped through schedules so complex god would have had trouble understanding them people in line behind anne surely fumed at the delay she would have had she been back there and not at the front at last with an unhappy half smile he shook his head sorry maam but no and ive got to tell you theres no pullman berths left on the ten oclock train youll have to take an ordinary seat ill refund the difference of course damnation anne said again this time with more feeling shed be a frazzled wreck by the time she finally got back to st matthews but if she didnt leave as soon as she could heaven only knew when she would get back give me whatever you can then sure will the clerk handed her a ticket and several brown confederate banknotes your train will be leaving from platform w its over that way he pointed follow the signstheyll take you straight to it hope everything turns out all right for you thanks anne waved for a porter to handle her suitcases the colored man put them on a wheeled cart and followed her to platform w she bought food there and a cheap novel to while away the time till the train got in it was late by then anne had stopped expecting anything else it didnt arrive till half past one shed put the novel aside an hour earlier and was trying without much luck to doze in a chair the car to which she was assigned didnt even have compartments only row after row of seats bolted to the floor the man who sat down next to her was so fat he encroached on her without meaning to he hadnt had a bath any time recently she gritted her teeth nothing she could do about it though as soon as the train pulled out of fort worth the fat man threw back his head fell asleep and began snoring like a thunderstorm that added insult to injury anne felt like jabbing him with a pin unable to sleep herself she stared glumly out the window at the night only blackness met her eye blackness and an occasional handful of lights burning in the small towns at which the express didnt stop she almost resented the lights which put her in mind of fireflies blackness suited her mood much better the express did stop at dallas anne understood the need but hated the delay the fat man beside her scarcely stirred he didnt wake up after what seemed forever but was by her watch fortyfive minutes the train rumbled east again presently anne had to use the toilet she took more than a little pleasure in waking her seatmate to get by though she sounded polite by the time she returned he was snoring again she woke him once more it did no good to speak of he fell back to sleep while she stayed awake marshall was the next stop near the louisiana border by the time the train left the sky ahead was getting light morning had come by the time the express got into shreveport on the red river the red was flooding too but not enough to delay the train any worse monroe louisiana on the ouachita was the next scheduled stopby then anne had the schedule all but memorized but the express didnt make it to monroe first anne saw tent cities on high ground where people whod escaped the floodwaters were staying till someone did something more for them then as the ground got lower mud and water covered more and more of it the air was thick and humid and full of the stink of decay at last the train had to stop for the simple reason that going forward would have meant going underwater the tracks were laid on an embankment that raised them above the surrounding countryside but that finally stopped helping what do we do now anne asked the conductor dont rightly know maam he answered i reckon well back up and try and find a way aroundif there is one dont rightly know about that either only other thing we can do is wait for the water to go down and lord only knows how long thatd take trying to hold in her anger she snapped why didnt you find out in shreveport that the way would be flooded on account of it wasnt when we left shreveport the conductor said maam this here is a heck of a bad flood worst anybodys seen since hector was a pup an it just keeps gettin worser an worser hed fought not to swear in her presence now she fought not to swear in his after what seemed a very long time the train shuddered into motionbackwards it crawled that way till at last it came to a cross track anne felt like cheering when it started moving ahead once more but it didnt go far before long the encroaching floodwaters blocked its path again this time anne did curse and didnt care who sent her shocked looks by the time the train had made three or four false starts everyone in the car was swearing it didnt help yet another tent city sprouted like a forest of giant toadstools outside the whistlestop hamlet of anabell louisiana where the express was balked again how are those people going to eat someone asked if trains have trouble getting through it was a good question it got an answer even as anne watched an aeroplane landed in a field only a couple of hundred yards from the train the pilot started throwing out sacks of flour and flitches of bacon a great light blazed in annes mind let me off the train she told the conductor this instant do you hear me what about your luggage he asked blinking to hell with my luggage she said the conductor tapped the side of his head with his index finger but did as she asked she ran over to the aeroplane waving and calling can you fly me over the mississippi and past the floods to where i can catch another train east maybe i can lady the pilot answered shifting a plug of tobacco in his cheek why the devil should i ill pay you three hundred dollars she said half now half when we land that wad of tobacco shifted again she wondered if hed swallow it but he didnt lemme finish unloading he said around it then you got yourself a deal half an hour later the biplane bumped across the soggy field and threw itself into the air anne colleton whooped with delight shed never flown before and wondered why not three hundred dollars was a small price to pay for this kind of funand for the money she hoped to make when she got home f loodlights glared into jake featherstons face so that he couldnt see the crowd in the new orleans auditorium he didnt care hed made enough speeches so that he didnt need to see the people out there to know what they were thinking good to be back here he said this is the town where i was nominated six years ago we did pretty good then we did and well do better this time you just wait and see if we dont freedom the roar came from over a thousand throats featherston grinned fiercely that sound hit him harder than a big slug of hooch its absence was the one thing he hated most about making speeches on the wirelessit felt as if he were shouting at a bunch of deaf men and he couldnt tell if he was getting through or not this speech was going out over the wireless too and it would go complete with shouts of approval and excitement from the crowd this is the way it ought to be he thought and resumed people say were gonna have trouble electing me people say that but they dont always know what the devil theyre talking about and you tell me friendshavent the confederate states got themselves enough trouble already yes people shouted and hell yes and you bet one woman cried oh jake as if they were in bed together and hed just given her the best time shed ever had in her life his grin got wider maybe hed have a flunky look for her after the speech was done and maybe he wouldnt too he couldnt afford to get too much of a reputation as a tomcatting man not when so many people who went to church every sunday were likely to vote freedom he hated compromise but that was one hed had to make havent we got ourselves enough trouble he said again folks i tell you the whigs have been carrying the ball too long theyve been carrying it too long and now theyve gone and dropped it he slammed his fist down on the podium more applause from the crowd cries of tell em jake and give em hell rang out over the general din they might have been listening to a preacher on the revival circuit not an ordinary politician jake featherston wasnt an ordinary politician which was both his greatest weakness and his greatest strength theyve gone and dropped it he repeatedagain as a preacher might have what else would you call it when here in the middle of july a good month after the flood finally started going down the confederate states of america have still got more than half a million peoplehalf a million i tell you and im not lying its what the confederate red cross saysliving in tents if thats not a shame and a disgrace you tell me what it is a lot of those people maybe a majority were colored cotton pickers who worked for white plantation owners in what differed from slavery in little more than name more often than not jake would have gloated at their suffering but if he could use them as a club with which to beat the present administration he would he went on up in the usa theres not a soul still stuck in a tent oh i know they didnt get hurt as bad as we did but it makes a point when the yankees need to get things done they up and do em when we need to get things done what happens he threw his arms wide in extravagant disgust not a damn thing thats what i tell you folks youre just lucky new orleans didnt go out to sea on account of the government in richmond wouldntve done a thingnot a single solitary thingto stop it if it had that drew more applause baying angry applause they know im telling the truth he thought being a whig meant doing as little as you could to get by the line wasnt in the text of his speech but he used it adding folks say that works all right maybe it did once upon a time but this here aint no fairy tale and we havent got no happy ending people we need a government in richmond thatll stand up on its hind legs and do things who stumbled into the war the whigs who let the niggers stab us in the back without even knowing they were going to the whigs who went and lost the war the whigs now the crowd shouted out the name of the csas longtime ruling party with him he rolled on who let the damnyankees steal kentucky the whigs who let em steal sequoyah the whigs who let em cut texas in half the whigs who let em take northern virginia away from us the whigs i fought in the army of northern virginia and im proud of it but the yankees have taken the place away from us and who let the yankees tell us what we could do with our army and navy who left us too weak to fight back when those bastards started throwing their weight around the whigs again he slammed his fist down on the podium the crowd in the hall roared they might have been so many coon dogs taking a scent featherston took a scent from them too if he didnt make a crowd hot and sweaty he wasnt doing his job his nose told him he was tonight theyve done everything they could to tear this country down he went on now they had their day once i give em that jeff davis was a great president nobody can say different so was lee so was longstreet but that was a long time ago we had friends back then where are our friends now the frenchmen have the kaiser on their back englands trying to keep from starving every year were on our own and the whigs are too damn dumb to know it god helps the people who help themselves and as long as the whigs hang on in richmond god better help us cause well need it bad that got him a laugh hed known it would he understood that it should but it wasnt funny to him the contempt and hatred he felt for the whigsfor all the confederate elite including the second and thirdgeneration officers whod done so much to lose the great warwere big as the world they hadnt given him a chance to show what he could do no matter how right hed been in fact theyd scorned him all the more because hed been right just see what i do if i win this election you sons of bitches he thought just you see then meanwhile he had this speech to finish if you want to go on the way the confederate states have been going you vote whig he thundered if you want your country to go straight down the toilet thats the way to vote he got another laugh there an enormous one he continued the supreme court says you can keep on having just what youve hadand arent you lucky their day would come too hed promised himself that but if you want change if you want strength if you want prideif you want to be able to look at yourselves in the mirror and look the usa straight in the eye yall vote freedom the shout from the crowd more than a thousand voices speaking as one made his ears ring he threw up his hands thats right folks thank you and rememberno matter what else you do fight hard more applause shook the hall as he stepped away from the podium the house lights came up so he could see the people hed been haranguing he waved to them again freedom freedom freedom they chanted over and over again the rhythmic cry rolled through him rolled under him and swept him along on its crest hed read somewhere that in the sandwich islands the natives rode waves lying or even standing up on flat boards he supposed that was true if it werent true who could make it up he felt something like that now buoyed up by the crowds enthusiasm as he went offstage the bodyguards and other men whod come west from virginia with him pumped his hand and told him what a great speech hed given thanks boys he said and then for christs sake somebody get me a drink louisiana had never surrendered to the siren song of prohibition he could drink his whiskey here without shame or hypocrisy it seared his throat and sent warmth exploding out from his middle as soon as he emptied the glass somebody got him a fresh one he sipped the second drink more slowly got to keep my wits about me he thought not everybody was going to like the speech as well as his flunkies had no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a tall blond handsome man in a suit that must have cost plenty came up and shook hands with him you gave em hell out there tonight jake he said a texas twang in his voice i thank you kindly willy featherston answered willy knight had headed up the redemption league an outfit with goals much like those of the freedom party till the bigger party enfolded it he wasnt the best numbertwo man around mostly because he still had thoughts of being number one damn good speech agreed amos mizell he led the tin hats the biggest confederate veterans organization the tin hats werent formally aligned with the freedom party but they shared many of the same ideas thank you too jake featherston said mizell wore the ribbon for a purple heart on his shirt you were out there same as me you know how the whigs sold us down the river you know how theyve been selling us down the river ever since sure do mizell nodded what willy and i arent so sure of though is whether youre the fellow whos going to kick em out on the street where they belong no huh featherston looked from one of them to the other you boys felt like that how come you didnt try and keep me from getting the nomination last month he wanted his enemies out there in the open where he could see them and smash them not lurking in dead leaves like a couple of rattlesnakes wouldntve been much point to that on account of wedve lost willy knight said well see how you do come november and well go from there you really think youre going to win featherston made an impatient scornful gesture thats to keep the troops happy and you know it as well as i do im hoping i finish ahead of the damn rad libs and that we hold our ground in congress i think we can do that he hoped the freedom party could do that before the great flood he wouldnt even have bet on so much but the flood had shown that the whigs werent so slick as they thought they were and that they didnt respond well in emergencies some voters at least would see the light knight and mizell looked at each other all right jake knight said at last that sounds fair if the party does that well come fall well keep on backing your play but if we take another hammering the way we did in the last couple of congressional elections everybodys gonna have to do a lot of thinking i carried the freedom party on my back god damn it jake growled nobody says you didnt so keep your shirt on willy knight was a bigger man than featherston but jake in a fury was a match for anybody knight knew it too still speaking placatingly he went on moses took the hebrews out of egypt but he wasnt the one who got em into the promised land amos mizell nodded if the partys vote slips again the tin hats will have to think about getting what we want some other way featherston had thought he wanted enemies openly declared now he had them and wished he didnt and i suppose the two of you will try and screw me over so we dont get what i said we would they almost fell over themselves denying it as long as we do what you said wed do were still in business knight said if we fall down now who knows if therell be any pieces worth picking up later on were still with you youd better be jake said lets see what happens in november then and afterwards knight and mizell both nodded featherston shook hands with each of them in turn and if you bastards think ill let go without a fight even if things do go wrong youre a hell of a lot dumber than i think you are i n the terry the colored district of augusta georgia election day meant next to nothing only a handful of negro veterans of the great war were registered to vote to most people it was just another tuesday as usual erasmus was in his fish store and restaurant when scipio walked in scipio got himself a cup of coffee to drink while sweeping up the place his boss was setting newly bought fish on ice in the counter scipio said what you think de whigs gwine win again dunno erasmus said with a shrug them or the rad libs dont matter one way or tother long as it aint that goddamn crazy man he threw a crappie into place with more force than he usually used while handling fish that election day meant next to nothing didnt mean it meant nothing at all dat featherston buckra he aint gwine do nothin much scipio said better not erasmus answered and slammed down a gutted catfish that son of a bitch win everythings even tougher for us niggers and things is tough enough as they is voice sly scipio said you aint got it so bad you owns your house free an clear i aint stupid erasmus said and scipio nodded his boss had been damn smart there hed paid off his mortgage just when inflation was starting to ravage the csa when hed had a pretty easy time accumulating the money he needed but before confederate dollars became nothing but a joke the bankers had taken the money even if theyd been unhappy about it a few weeks later and they would have refused him i aint stupid he repeated im smart enough to know i aint got it easy long as is a nigger in the csa he was right about that scipio didnt need to be a genius to understand as much he said no you aint got it easyi takes it back but you has it worseall us niggers has it worseif dat featherston he win working for anne colleton had given him a feel for the way confederate politics worked again though he didnt need to be a genius to find the truth in what hed just said not so many parades with them goddamn white men in the white shirts an the butternut pants yellin freedom this year erasmus observed they aint been tryin to bust up the other parties meetins neither like they done before they walkin sof again don want to remind nobody what that one buckra done scipio said but too many folks dey recollects any which way hell yes erasmus said thing of it is freedom party they needs the white folks to be stupid or else to act stupid on account of they scared now lord knows the white folks is stupid do jesus yes scipio said as if responding to a preachers sermon but they aint that stupid not unless theys scared bad erasmus went on as if he hadnt spoken things aint too bad for em right nowmoneys still worth somethin most of ems got jobsso they aint gwine vote for no jake featherston not this year they aint thats how i sees it anyways way i sees it you should oughta write fo de newspapers scipio said not intending it as any sort of flattery on the contraryhed read plenty of editorials about what was likely to happen that didnt sum things up anywhere near so neatly as his illiterate but ever so shrewd boss had managed in a couple of sentences erasmus lit a cigarette he blew out a cloud of smoke then said you bangin your gums on all this politics so as you kin git out o workinaint that right xerxes oh yassuh marse erasmus suh scipio laid on his low country accent even thicker than usual ah aint nevah done one lick o work not since de day you hire me ah jus eats yo food an drinks yo coffee an steals yo smokes he held out his hand pale palm up for a cigarette laughing erasmus gave him one then leaned close so scipio could get a light from the one he already had in his mouth hed just taken his first drag of the morning and coughed a couple of times when the first customer of the day came in calling for coffee and ham and eggs and instead of grits hash browns erasmus got busy at the stove scipio got busier doing everything else they stayed busy all day long when scipio finally went home erasmus was still busy scipio sometimes wondered whether his boss ever went to bed and when scipio got back to his roominghouse he heard splashes and squeals from the bathroom at the end of the hall he also heard bathshebas voice rising in evergrowing exasperation and wrath he smiled to himself antoinette was going on two years old now and an evergrowing handful to bathe a few minutes later bathsheba carried the baby into the room antoinette swaddled in a towel saw scipio and said dada in delight scipios wife looked wetter than the baby did she also looked a lot less happy what de matter sweetheart scipio asked givin toinette a bath aint dat hard i even done it my ownself a time or two he spoke as if that were some enormous accomplishment in his mind it was he hadnt heard many fathers talk about giving their children even that much in the way of care but bathshebas baleful stare made him stop with his mouth half open the baby shit in the damn tub she said bleakly oh scipio said aw golly the first expression of sympathy that came to mind wouldnt have been to bathshebas liking not just then instead of saying anything scipio went to a cupboard and pulled out a bottle of moonshine georgia was officially dry but contraband liquor wasnt hard to come by he poured his wife a stiff drink and a smaller one for himself holding out the glass to bathsheba he said here you is reckon you done earned dis here reckon i did she poured down half of it then she puffed out her cheeks and exhaled violently whew dats nasty stuff scipio was inclined to agree hed always preferred rum even to good whiskey and the murky yellowish fluid in his glass bore a closer relationship to paint thinner than it did to good whiskey antoinette saw her parents drinking something and naturally wanted some too bathsheba fixed her a bottle then she started making supper since the room had only a hot plate for cooking everything took a while scipio was glad for the chance to sit down and play with his little girl and talk with his wife and drink the moonshine and let it relax him buckra ladies i was cleanin for they all talkin bout the election today bathsheba said dunno why they cant vote any moren us black folks kin bills allowing womens suffrage showed up in the georgia legislature almost every session they got tabled or voted down with monotonous regularity even so scipio asked who dey say dey husbands vote fo whigs mostly bathsheba knew why he was worried and added that featherston fella dont reckon he gwine go nowhere much do jesus hope you right scipio answered bathsheba took lamb chops out of the pan and started frying potatoes in the grease theyd left behind got me somethin more important to tell you anyways what dat scipio asked as he stuck a little bite of lamb in antoinettes mouth the baby made a face but ate the morsel scipio gave her another one bathsheba pointed at her reckon she gwine have herself a little brother or sister come summertime i was wonderin about dat my ownself scipio said as he got up to give her a hug didnt tink you monthlies dey come her breasts had been tender lately too and shed started falling asleep early in the evening as if to prove he was right bathsheba yawned she laughed a moment later better sleep now when the new young un come aint never gwine sleep again we gots to find a bigger place too scipio said the room they had was intended for one it was tolerable for two provided they got on wellwhich scipio and bathsheba certainly did with three in it there wasnt room to swing a cat with four scipio thought about that with four people in this room there wouldnt have been room to bring in a cat let alone swing it what you reckon antoinette make o the new baby bathsheba asked she aint gwine like it scipio answered young chillun dey don never like no new baby in de fambly but she git over it she have to dey allus does jus sometimes take longer is all bathsheba nodded reckon yous right she yawned again i gots to get to sleep come here toinette time we both go to bed the baby didnt want to she was convinced shed miss something some evenings she was right others wrong tonight she fussed and fumedand then got up the following morning not just ready but eager to play scipio was the one who yawning went out to face the day he paid his five cents for a copy of the constitutionalist on his way to erasmus place newsboys shouted of burton mitchels victory as president of the confederate states president mitchel reelected they yelled a confederate president wasnt supposed to get reelected but the supreme court said this didnt count no matter what the supreme court said the newsboys knew what was what the whigs had won easily this time nothing like their razorthin victory in the freedom party took tennessee mississippi and texas the radical liberals arkansas and chihuahua sonora still looked too close to call everywhere else the people had voted whig scipio read that with more relief than hed felt for a long time life in the csa was hard enough for a black man any time he imagined going to bed one morning and waking up to discover jake featherston was president the mere idea chilled him worse than the cool november morning he methodically worked his way through the election stories below the headlines the freedom party hadnt taken quite so many lumps as he would have liked to see it had lost one senator but gained a pair of congressmenmaybe three because one of the races in texas remained very tight i may not be going to the gray house next march the constitutionalist quoted featherston as saying but well make ourselves heard in congress and in state houses all over the country we arent about to go away no matter how much the whigs wish we would were just reloading for the next round of the fight hed lost he hadnt come close to winning but he still sounded confident right was on his side and that hed win one of these days he reminded scipio of nothing so much as cassius and the other colored reds whod formed the illfated government of the congaree socialist republic and dragged him into it their faith in the dialectic had kept them going through thick and thin jake featherston sounded like a man with the same kind of faith hed kill me if i could tell him so scipio thought the reds would kill me tooif they werent already dead themselves no neither side here would see its resemblance to the other that didnt mean the resemblance wasnt there the reds had proved wrongdead wrongabout the dialectic with any luck the freedom party would prove just as wrong that thought heartened scipio he tossed the constitutionalist into a trash can and hurried to work erasmus would skin him if he was late t he first time sam carsten had seen the remembrance going on ten years ago now which struck him as very strangehed thought her the ugliest funniestlooking ship in the us navy or for that matter in anyone elses shed started out life intending to be a battle cruiser but had had her design drastically revised while she was abuilding back in those distant days not long after the great war nobody had seen a ship with a flight deck so she could launch and land aeroplanes now as sam returned to the remembrance she still looked strange he shook his head as the boat neared the carrier no that wasnt right she looked strange all over again but for different reasons this time by now the navy had three aeroplane carriers that had been built for the purpose from the keel up they were a lot more capable than the remembrance which looked like the hybrid she was she may not be pretty but she gets the job done he thought the boat from the obrien came alongside sailors up on the remembrance lowered a rope ladder carsten shouldered his duffel bag good luck sir one of the sailors said youre going from a little fish to a big one thanks fritz carsten answered he grabbed the ladder and swarmed up it as if boarding with intent to take the ship rather than to serve in her he knew a lot of eyes were watching him if he acted like a gouty old man on the way up from the boat theyd treat him with less respect than if he did his best impression of a pirate as he scrambled up onto the remembrance s broad flat deck a sailor leaped forward and grabbed the canvas duffel bag let me take that for you sir the fellow said by his tone carsten had passed his first test a lieutenant commander strolled up at a more leisurely pace sam stiffened to attention and saluted permission to come aboard sir he said formally granted the other officer returned his salute then he smiled my name is watkins ensign michael watkins do i understand this is your second tour aboard the remembrance pleased to meet you sir yes sir ive spent some time on her before carsten answered but that was a while agoi was just thinking about how long it seemsand i was only a petty officer in those days oh really i didnt know that watkins voice gave no clue as to what he thought about it either so youre a mustang eh up through the hawse hole sam nodded thats me not a whole lot of men jumped from rating to officer he supposed he should have been proud of himself hell he was proud of himself when he had time to think about it im going to ask you one question carsten and i hope you wont take it the wrong way lieutenant commander watkins said sam nodded he had a pretty good idea what the question would be and sure enough watkins asked you do remember you are an officer now i hope carsten nodded again i do my best sir hed seen a couple of other mustangsboth of them men fifteen or twenty years older than he waswhod been promoted during the war for bravery too conspicuous to ignore both of them acted as if they were still cpos he understood thattheyd got set in their ways long before their promotionsbut he didnt try to imitate it he seemed to have satisfied watkins fair enough ensign the remembrance s officer said ill take you to your quarters dougherty follow us aye aye sir said the sailor who had sams duffel bag he was redheaded and freckled and very fair pharmacists mate still carry plenty of zincoxide ointment and such sam asked him dougherty gauged his pale blond hair blue eyes and pink pink skin well yes sir he answered dont know how much youll need it though in january off baltimore he jerked his chin toward the gray cloudy sky you never can tell ill burn damn near anywhere carsten said the sailor smiled sam thought in sympathy dougherty certainly looked as if he too would burn under any light brighter than a kerosene lanterns lieutenant commander watkins opened a steel door here you are ensign he said flipping on a switch to turn on the lamp inside the cabin as he stepped back to let sam see in he apologetically spread his hands and added sorry its so small but its what weve got thats all right sir sam said its a lot more room than i had my last tour aboard her they still tripledeck the bunks dont they he waited for watkins to nod then went on and i served in one of the fiveinch gun sponsons so i didnt have any room there either ah watkins started to nod and let that go but then his gaze sharpened were you aboard remembrance when she took fire off belfast i sure as hell was sir carsten answered a shell killed two men in my crew only dumb luck none of the fragments got me well well lieutenant commander watkins said i wonder if we have any men still aboard who served with you been five years sir i havent seen any yet not that that proves anything sam said id like to say hello if i do but i dont suppose i could do much more than that could i i wouldnt think so ensign watkins told him this is part of what i meant when i asked if you remembered you were an officer sam nodded hed figured that out for himself watkins stepped back i wont keep you any moreyoull want to get settled in im sure i hope to see you and talk with you more later on thank you sir carsten saluted my pleasure watkins returned the salute come along dougherty he said and walked on down the corridor sam closed and dogged the door to his cabin hed been telling the truth when he said it was spacious compared to his previous accommodations on the remembrance that didnt mean he had much room if he stood with arms outstretched he could touch the graypainted metal walls with his fingertips the cabin held a bunk a steel chest of drawers bolted to the opposite wall a steel desk a chair and a tiny washbasin with a steel mirror above it all that left him just about enough room to put his feet down provided he was careful doing it stowing his worldly goods such as they were didnt take long then he went out on deck once more the obrien having delivered him steamed away smoke pouring from her four stacks the remembrance pushed south through heavy seas the rolling and pitching didnt bother sam hed always had good sea legs and a calm stomach his achilles heel was his pale skin back toward the stern a couple of mechanics worked on an aeroplane the machine looked sleeker and more powerful than the modified great warvintage aeroplanes that had flown off the remembrance during carstens last tour aboard her id better bone up on what the differences are he thought he didnt get to stand around watching for very long a respectful petty officer soon came up to him and whisked him over to the office of a grayhaired commander named van der waal what do you know about minimizing damage from torpedo hits the other officer demanded sir i was aboard the dakota when the japs put a fish into her off the sandwich islands but i didnt have anything to do with damage control there sam answered all right thats a little something anyhow van der waal said youve experienced the problem firsthand which is good thats more than a lot of people can say does it interest you no sir not a whole lot carsten said honestly i served a gun before i was an officer and im interested in aeronautics too thats how i came aboard the remembrance during my first tour here naval aeronautics is important id have a hard time telling you anything different wouldnt i here on an aeroplane carrier commander van der waals craggy face creased in unaccustomed places when he smiled but he quickly turned serious again but so is damage control the japs arent the only ones whove got submersibles you know he looked south and west in the direction of the csa the confederates arent supposed to have em sam blurted i know that and i know we send inspectors up and down their coast to make sure they dont van der waal told him but id bet theyve got a few anyhowand we havent been inspecting as hard as we might have the past few years the budget keeps going down and president sinclair wants to get along with everybody and the british still have some boats and the french might and we know perfectly well that the japanese do and so does the german high seas fleet and so ensign i see your point sir sam said knowing he couldnt very well say anything else if thats what you want me to do ill do it he couldnt very well say anything but that either then he dredged up a childhood expression but if i had my druthers its not what id do van der waal chuckled havent heard that one in a while you gave up your druthers you know when you put on the uniform really sir i never would have noticed some men would have wound up in trouble after talking back to a superior officer that way carsten did have a knack for not getting people angry at him commander van der waal said well well see what happens youll start out in my shop because i do need a man to back me up if another opportunity comes along and you want to take it i dont suppose id stand in your way fair enough more than fair enough sir its damn white of you matter of fact sam saluted most officers would have grabbed him and held on to him and that would have been that thank you very much i dont want a badly disaffected man serving under me its not good for me it wouldnt be good for the officer in question and its not good for the ship van der waal nodded briskly for now youre dismissed sam saluted again and went out on deck he spied a knot of sailors at the starboard bow they were all pointing in the direction van der waal hadtoward the confederate states carsten looked that way himself he had no trouble spotting the confederate coastdefense ship steaming along between the remembrance and the shore like one of the us navys socalled great lakes battleships the confederate warship was only about half the size of a real battlewagon shed carry a battleships guns but only half as many of them as say the dakota she wouldnt have the armor or the speed to take on a firstclass battleship either and she and her three sisters were the biggest warships the cs navy was allowed to have what does her skipper think looking at the remembrance carsten wondered he could sink her if they fought gun to gun the aeroplane carrier had nothing bigger than fiveinchers aboard but they wouldnt fight gun to gun not unless something went horribly wrong and how would that confederate captain like to try shooting down aeroplanes that could drop bombs on his head or put torpedoes in the water running straight at his ship he wouldnt like it for hell sam thought his grin stretched wide as the atlantic he liked the idea just fine himself n ellie jacobs was keeping one eye on the coffeehouse and the other on claras arithmetic homework when claras half sister edna grimes burst into the place that clara was going on eight years old and so old enough to have homework surprised nellie that edna should come bursting in astonished her then nellie got a look at her older daughters face and astonishment turned to alarm good heavens edna whats wrong she asked are you all right are merle and armstrong armstrong is a brat clara declared anything might have distracted her from the problems in her workbook the mention of her nephewwho was only a couple of years younger than she wasmore than sufficed only a couple of customers were working on coffee and in one case a sandwich business would pick up after government offices closed in another fortyfive minutes nellie hoped it would anyhow it had been a slow daywhenever snow fell in washington it tied the city in knots nellie expected edna to go into one of the back rooms before saying whatever was on her mind that way the men wouldnt be able to eavesdrop but her daughter said oh ma i dont know what to do merles found out about nick kincaid oh nellie said and then oh lordy whos nick kincaid edna clara asked he was a a fellow i used to know a soldier edna answered i was going to marry him maybe but he got killed in the war that told clara enough to satisfy her it didnt say everything there was to say on the subject not by a long chalk edna had certainly been about to marry lieutenant nicholas h kincaid shed been walking down the aisle with him when us artillery fire tore off his head the other thing shed neglected to tell her half sister was that kincaid had been a soldier all right but one who fought for the confederate states well dear nellie said as coolly as she could you knew this was liable to happen one of these days she was if anything amazed it hadnt happened sooner edna said when it didnt happen for so long i reckoned it never would and you know how merle is how he always put me on a pedestal most men nellie was convinced put women on pedestals so they could look up their skirts but she found herself nodding merle grimes was differentor had been different hed lost his first wife during the great influenza epidemic of since meeting edna and falling in love with her hed made as good a husband as any woman could wantbetter than edna deserved nellie often thought edna never would have gone up on that pedestal if merle who had a purple hearta us purple heart had known everythingor even most thingsabout nick kincaid what he would have thought had he known kincaid had got edna into bed nellie shied away from that sometimes the quiet ones were the worst when they did lose their tempers even finding out ednas former fiance had worn butternut and not greengray was liable to be enough what am i gonna do ma edna wailed howd he find out nellie asked this fellow from the csa came into his office for some kind of business or other now edna had the sense to keep her voice down one of the men drinking coffee had leaned forward to snoop a little too obviously she went on they both wore purple heart ribbons dammityou know how the confederates give em too and they got to talking soldier talk whered you fight howd you get hurt that kind of thing and nellie asked and one thing led to another and they got to liking each other edna said and merle said how hed married a washington gal and that was the closest thing you could get to marrying a gal from the confederate states and the other fellow said that was funny on account of his cousin had almost married this washington gal who worked in a coffeehouse when he was here on occupation duty during the war uhoh nellie said edna nodded bitterly uhoh is right merle said his wifeme i meanwas working in a coffeehouse when he met her too and they went and talked a little more and they figured out they were both talking about the same gal and i got this phone call from merle and i didnt like the way he sounded not for beans i didnt and so i left armstrong with mrs parker next doorhe was playing with her boy eddie anywaysand i came over here all right dear nellie said i may not be much but im what youve always got and thats for sure edna nodded biting her lip and blinking back tears there had been times when nellie hoped she would never see her daughter again not a few of them when edna was fooling around with the late confederate lieutenant kincaid but edna was what nellie had too and always would be it wasnt that she didnt love clara but her younger daughter often felt more like an afterthought or an accident than flesh of nellies flesh of course edna had been an accident too but that was a long time ago now what am i gonna do ma edna asked again just remember sweetie your husband aint the only one in the family whos got himself a medal nellie said he starts going on about you selling out your country you hit him over the head with the order of remembrance for heavens sakes teddy roosevelt put it on you his very own self thats true edna brightened a little that is true but then she turned pale she pointed out through the big glass window in front oh jesus ma there he is nothing bads going to happen nellie said though she knew she couldnt be sure of any such thing ednas husband was a quiet fellow yes but the bell above the door chimed cheerily as merle grimes walked into the coffeehouse the rubber tip on his cane tapped against the linoleum floor behind the lenses of his spectacles his eyes had a blind stricken look as if hed had too much to drink but nellie didnt think he was drunk he nodded jerkily to her before swinging his gaze towards edna when you werent home i figured id find you here he said she nodded too grimes gestured with his cane by the way he aimed it at edna nellie thanked god it wasnt a springfield what came out of his mouth though was only one more word why before edna could say anything nellie told clara go upstairs go right now this is grownup stuff clara didnt argue nellies tone got through her younger daughter took her homework and all but fled on account of if i told you i was friendly with a confederate soldier back in them days i thought id lose you and i didnt want to lose you edna answered i didnt want to lose you on account of i love you i always have i always will it was nellie thought about the best answer her daughter could have given but when her soninlaw said you lied to me nellie knew it was liable not to be good enough you lied to me merle grimes repeated it might have been the very worst thing he could think of to say i thought i knew you and everything i thought i knew i didnt know one of the customers got up and left a moment later more reluctantly so did the other one nellie went to the door behind him she closed it in the face of a woman who started to come in sorrywere closed she told the startled woman she flipped the sign in the window to closed too that was going to cost her money but it couldnt be helped when she walked back behind the counter edna was saying so sorry but that was before i knew you merle remember ive never done nothing to make you sorry since so help me god i havent id have believed you yesterday because idve been sure you were telling me the truth her husband said now how do i know its not just another lie edna wouldnt do nothing like that merle nellie said you think about that youll know its true she liked merle grimes enough to want to do everything she could to keep him in the family even if she had her problems with edna her soninlaw was the kind of man who tempted her to forget her low opinion of half the human race she didnt mollify him though the look he gave her was colder than the weather outside you must have known about this kincaid fellow mother jacobsyou couldnt very well not have and you never said a word about him to me so why should i believe you either we said edna had a fiance during the war and that he got killed nellie said is that the truth or isnt it its less than half the truth merle grimes said stubbornly thats the best way i know how to lietell the part of the truth that goes your way and leave out everything else he was right of course that was the best way nellie knew how to lie too she said the mans dead merle hes more than ten years dead now you can just forget about him everybody else has grimes shook his head thats not the point whats more you know its not the point mother jacobs the point is that he was a darned confederate and that edna never told me about that ive tried to take care of her and armstrong ive saved money ive bought stocks if she had told me i dont know what idve done washington was occupied after all those things happened but trying to sweep em under the rug afterwards he shook his head again no nellie didnt like the grim finality in his voice tears trickled down ednas face sweet jesus she really thinks shes going to lose him right here and now nellie thought fighting against panic of her own she may be right too before she or edna could say anything the bell over the door chimed again in came hal jacobs i saw you put out the closed sign from across the street nellies husband said why so early were having aa family discussion thats why nellie answered ive found out about nicholas kincaid father jacobs merle grimes said sounding even harder than he had before ive found out all about him have you hal whuffled out air through his gray mustachealmost entirely white now in fact i doubt that yes sir i doubt it very much what do you mean grimes demanded i know he was a confederate officer i know he was going to marry edna till he got killed and i know she never told me what he was what else do i need to know as far as nellie could see that was plenty but hal jacobs said the other thing you need to know is what teddy roosevelt knew god rest his souledna and nellie were both spies during the war working with me and bill reach god rest his soul too for im sure hes dead nellie was even surer but her secrets unlike ednas were unlikely to come out her husband went on whatever edna told youand whatever she didnt tooshe asked me about first because of what we were doing do you understand what im saying behind his spectacles grimes eyes widened i think i may sir he answered unconsciously he straightened towards if not quite to attention but then his gaze swung back to edna dont you think almost marrying a confederate went too far oh she went further than that nellie thought wild horses wouldnt have dragged the words from her though and edna did a splendid job of picking up the cue hal had given her i didnt almost marry him on account of i was a spy she replied but washington was occupied like you said yourself and hal asked me not to talk about anything that went on that had to do with the coffeehouse and spying even a little bit just to be on the safe side so i didnt hal had never asked her to do any such thing he knew that and so did nellie and so did edna herself but merle grimes didnt know it and he was the one who counted here all right he said after a long long pause well let it go then god knows i do love you edna and i want to be able to love you and trust you the rest of my days edna did the smartest thing she could have instead of saying even a word she threw herself into merles arms as the two of them embraced nellie caught hals eye thank you she mouthed silently her husband gave a tiny nod and an even tinier shrug as if to say it wasnt worth getting excited about theyd been married for almost ten years till that moment nellie had never been sure she loved him she was now h ad lucien galtier not cut himself he might not have found out for some little while that his life was about to change it wasnt a bad wound like the time when hed laid his leg open with an axe but he was sharpening a stake that would support some green beans when spring came and the knife slipped and he gashed himself between thumb and forefinger osti he hissed calisse de tabernac he put down the knife and the stake pinched the lips of the wound shut and went to the house to get a clean bandage he hoped that would do the job and that he wouldnt need stitches if he did though he was reasonably sure he could get them for nothing there were advantages to having a doctor for a soninlaw even if leonard odoull would tease him for being a clumsy old fool even as he sewed him up lucien hurried up the stairs quietly wiped his boots on the thick soft mat in front of the kitchen door and went inside marie was sitting at the kitchen table one hand on her belly tears running down her face marie galtier whispered his own cut forgotten his right hand dropped to his side blood started dripping on the floor questce que tu as its nothing she said springing to her feet with as much dismay and guilt as if hed caught her in the arms of another man nothing i tell you what have you done to yourself youre bleeding he grabbed a towel and wrapped it around his left hand this is truly nothing he said a slip of the knife thats all but you marie might pause during her days work for a cup of tea never in all the years hed known her had she paused because she was in pain that was literally true shed gone on working till ridiculously short stretches of time before she bore her children and shed got back to work after each birth much sooner than the midwife said she should for her to hold herself like that and weep was the end of the world was the first thing that occurred to him an instant later he wished hed thought of a different comparison i think it could be that we both should see our beaufils he said marie shook her head its nothing she insisted im just tired thats all hearing her say that frightened him as badly as seeing her sit there crying he knew she must have been tired at times through their close to thirtyfive years of marriage she was a farm wife and shed raised six children but shed never admitted it not in all the time hed known her not till now here he went to the closet and got her a coat put this on my dear we are going into town to talk with leonard odoull i dont need to see the doctor marie insisted and how can you drive the motorcar with your poor hand hurt to keep her from going on about the hand he let her bandage it which she did with her usual quick competence as long as she was taking care of him she seemed fine but once shed done the job she argued less than hed expected when he draped the coat over her shoulders come on he said our soninlaw will tell you why you are tired and he will give you some pills to make you feel like a new woman it could be that you are the one who feels like a new woman his wife retorted but that gibe aside she kept quiet she let him lead her out to the chevrolet and head for town her acquiescence worried him too leonard odoulls office was on rue frontenac not far from the eglise saintpatrice on rue lafontainethe church over which bishop pascal no longer presided dr odoulls office assistant exclaimed when she saw the bloody bandage on luciens hand hes vaccinating a little boy right now monsieur galtier she said as soon as hes done hell see you but lucien shook his head again its not me he needs to see its marie that made the office assistant start to exclaim again just in time she thought better of it sit down then she said hell see you both soon a howl from the part of the office out of sight of the waiting room told galtier exactly when the vaccination was completed a couple of minutes later a city woman in a fashionablyeven shockinglyshort dress came out with her wailing toddler in tow normally lucien would have eyed her legs while she paid the assistant that marie was sitting beside him wouldnt have stopped him that marie was sitting beside him not feeling well did their soninlaw stuck his head out into the waiting room as soon as the city woman and her son left like his assistant he saw luciens bandage and wagged a finger what have you gone and done to yourself now he asked with mock severity dont you think i get tired of patching you again galtier said i didnt come to see you on account of this scratch marie is not well no dr odoull became very serious very fast he almost bowed to his motherinlaw come in please and tell me about it as marie rose odoull nodded ever so slightly to lucien why dont you wait here all right galtier said he knew what that meant his soninlaw would have to look at perhaps even have to touch parts of marie only lucien would normally look at and touch he could do that much more freely if lucien werent in the room with the two of them galtier understood the necessity without liking it he buried his nose in a magazine from montreal all the articles seemed to talk about ways in which the republic of quebec could become more like the united states galtier was far from sure he wanted quebec to become more like the usa the people writing the magazine articles had no doubt that was what quebec should do every so often he noticed he was reading the same sentence over and over it wasnt because the sentences sounded so much alike though they did but he couldnt stop worrying about what was going on on the far side of that door after the longest half hour in galtiers life marie came out again dr odoull came out with her saying please sit here for a moment if you would she nodded and sat down beside lucien odoull continued mon beaupere i would speak with you for a few minutes come in please very well galtier didnt want to get up he wanted to stay there beside marie but he saw he had no choice is everything as it should be he asked his soninlaw well that is what i want to talk to you about odoull answered numbly galtier walked to the door dr odoull stood aside to let him go through galtier had thought he was afraid before now his heart threatened to burst from his chest at every beat odoull waved him into his own personal office lucien sat in the chair in front of the desk his soninlaw opened a desk drawer to galtiers surprise he pulled out a pint bottle of whiskey medicinal odoull remarked as he yanked out the cork and took a swig he held out the bottle to galtier here have some merci lucien drank too it wasnt very good whiskey but it was plenty strong he coughed once or twice as he set the bottle on the desk odoull corked it with a smile that might have come straight from the gallows galtier asked and now mon beaufils have you a bullet for me to bite on hed forgotten all about his cut hand and so had leonard odoull which was an even worse sign if i did id give it to you he said your wife has a a mass right here in her belly he put his hand on his own belly on the spot that corresponded to the one marie had been holding when galtier had walked into their kitchen a little more than an hour before a mass galtier echoed dr odoull nodded he had surely used the mildest word he could find to give lucien the news though galtier hadnt had much schooling he needed only a moment to figure out what the younger man was talking about a tumor do you mean im afraid i do his soninlaw answered as gently as he could she should have an x ray it is possible she should have a surgical operation possible only possible lucien said what does this mean it depends on what the x ray shows odoull answered she told me she first began feeling this pain a year and a half or two years ago though it was less then that means it could begod forbid but it could bethat there has been some some spread of the mass if the x ray shows there has in that case there would be less point to an operation in that case an operation would do no good because she would die anyway again lucien didnt need his soninlaw to explain that to him he forced his mind away from it she had this pain for two years so she told me dr odoull replied and she said nothing she did nothing in the name of god why odoull sighed uncorked the whiskey bottle once more and took another drink ive seen this before among you quebecois why maybe because you hope the pain will go away by itself and you wont need to go to the doctor maybe because you simply refuse to let pain get the better of you and maybe because youre just too busy to get out of the house and into town to do what needs to be done slowly galtier nodded any or all of those reasons could have fit marie he didnt think he had the nerve to ask her even if he did he doubted he would get a straight answer is it that you can take this xray picture he asked no i have no xray machine here odoull answered she will have to go to quebec city to the capital if she has the operation she will have to have it there too all right we will do that then lucien didnt hesitate even for a moment he wondered how much the required treatment would cost he wished he hadnt bought the chevrolet if he had to though he could sell it marie mattered more than money and that was all there was to it he did ask this operation it will cure her his soninlaws shrug was more weary and worried than gallic without knowing what the x ray will show without knowing what the surgeon will find how can i answer that be fair to me please im sorry lucien bent his head and rubbed his eyes let me ask you a different question then you have been a doctor for a good many years now from what you see from what you know what do you think the chances are leonard odoulls lips skinned back from his teeth in what wasnt a smile i wish you hadnt asked me that because now i have to answer it from what i have seen from what i know i wish things were better mon beaupere thats all i can say i wish things were better he made a fist and brought it down on the desk i will pray galtier said here lately hed been thinking hed got ahead of life his laugh held only bitterness no one ever got ahead of life not for long and life had just reminded him of it why wasnt it me he wondered dear god why didnt you take me instead that question had no answer it never would americanempire thecentercannothold ix j onathan moss nodded to the military judge in front of him sir no matter what the occupation codes say about collusion and incitement my client is not guilty the prosecutor hasnt introduced a single shred of evidence that mr haynes either conspired against the united states urged others to conspire or act against them or for that matter acted against them himself in any way shape or form the judge a grimfaced major named daniel royce said didnt you spend three years fighting against the canucks yes sir i did moss answered right around here as a matter of fact i thought as much major royce rumbled why the devil are you defending them now in that case to make sure they get a fair shake sir moss said plenty of people just want to jump on them with both feet now that theyre down this conspiracy charge against my client is a case in point its utterly groundless as you can see it is not yelped the military prosecutor a captain surely too young to have fought in the great war look at the evidence sir not the allegations and youll see for yourself moss told major royce he hadnt lied to the judge he did dislike seeing americans swarming up into ontario and ravaging the conquered province like so many locusts but his reply hadnt been the whole truth either what would royce have said had he answered because i fell in love with a canadian woman while my squadrons aerodrome was up by arthur the major looked to have been a formidable football player in his younger days he would have dropkicked moss clean out of his courtroom scowling still the military judge shuffled through the papers in front of him he picked up one sheet and carefully read through it even from the back moss recognized it it was a statement hed got from his clients neighbors saying theyd never seen anyone visit haynes house at a time when the prosecutor claimed he was shaping a plot there against the usa his hopes leaped bang went royces gavel everyone in the courtroom whod seen combat started the sudden noise was too much like a gunshot for comfort im sorry captain but i find myself agreeing with the defense attorney here the military judge said i see no evidence of an offense against occupation regulations greed by people bringing the charges may be another matter this case is dismissed keep your nose clean mr haynes as you have been doing youre a free man the gavel banged again thank you very much your lordship paul haynes sounded astonished that he wasnt heading for prison im not a lordship you call me your honor judge royce said no more lordships here and a good thing too if you want to know what i think thank you your honor then haynes said not contradicting the military judge but not offering his own opinion either he turned to jonathan moss and stuck out his hand and thank you very much i didnt think you could bring it off youre not the only canadian client ive had whos told me the same thing moss answered ill tell you what ive told a lot of themour courts will try you fairly if you give them half a chance i wouldnt have believed it haynes said i thought theyd lock me up and throw away the key when they brought those treason charges against me in a low voice moss said youd be smart to follow the judges advice and not give them any excuse to charge you again if you come before the court a second time theyre liable to think that where theres smoke theres fire even if they did let you off the hook once before listening to himself he wondered how many cliches he could string together all at once wasnt any excuse to charge me this time paul haynes grumbled but then he nodded all right mr moss i understand what youre telling me good moss said they left the courtroom together spring had been on the calendar for more than a month now as april gave way to may it was finally visible in berlin ontario too the sky was blue with only a few puffy white clouds drifting across it the sun was if not warm at least tepid it got up early and went to bed late trees were coming into new leaf a robin chirped in one of them youre a good fellow haynes said he didnt even add for a yank as so many canadians might have done ill send you the rest of my fee soon as i can scrape the money together you dont need to worry about that i wasnt worried moss said which was true his canadian clients reliably paid what they said they would when they said theyd do it he wished the americans he represented up here were as reliable reporters were seldom allowed in military courts censorship still lay heavily on occupied canada moss understood that without necessarily approving of it here in the street a couple of newspapermen pounced on paul haynes moss slipped away before they could start grilling him too if they wanted him badly enough they could run him down at his office meanwhile meanwhile he aimed to celebrate his victory in his own way he got into his bucephalus and pressed the starter button the engine roared to life a bucephalus was a big powerful motorcar owning one went a long way toward saying you were a big powerful man owning a new one went a long way toward saying that anyhow moss had owned this one when it was new here in the spring of it was anything but one reason the engine roared was that it needed work he hadnt given it the automobiles paint job and upholstery had seen better years he had put new tires on it recently but only because hed got sick of patching the old ones when they blew out he put the car in gear and drove west out of berlin roads were better than they had been when he first hung out his shingle in ontario the war by now had been over for ten and a half years the roads the grinding conflict had cratered and pocked with shell holes were smooth once moresmoother than ever in fact paving stretched for miles where only dirt had gone before about an hour after leaving berlin he drove through the much smaller town of arthur thirty miles to the west arthur hadnt bounced back from the war the way berlin had it lay off the beaten track fewhardly anyamericans came here with their money and their energy and their connections with the powers that be in the usa but for a few more motorcars on the streets than would have been visible in time might have passed arthur by a couple of people pointed to the bucephalus as it rolled through town jonathan moss saw one of them nod theyd seen the motorcar before many times they had to know who he was if a diehard wanted to take a shot at him he shrugged it hadnt happened yet he wasnt going to start worrying about it now when he got to laura secords farm he found her where hed expected to out in the fields plowing behind a horse about the size of a halfgrown elephant she must have seen his automobile pull in beside the farmhouse but she didnt come in right away the work came first shed stubbornly got a crop from the farm every year since the end of the war and she didnt look like intending to be an exception only after shed done what she thought needed doing did she unhitch the enormous horse and lead him back toward the house and the barn moss got out of the bucephalus and waved to her she nodded back sober as usual but her gray eyes danced you got paul haynes off didnt you she said sure did not just a reduced sentence either full acquittal moss said proudly dont win one of those every day not from major royce thats swell she said the hesitation probably meant shed almost said bully instead the old slang died hard especially in outoftheway places like this she led the immense horse into the barn when she came out she asked and how do you have in mind celebrating eh yank i expect well think of something he answered what im thinking of first is a bath she said moss nodded sure sweetheart ill scrub your back if you want me to im sure you will she told him and as a matter of fact he did one thing pleasantly led to another after a while they lay naked side by side on her bed lazy and sated moss lit a cigarette he offered her the pack she shook her head that made other things jiggle too he watched with interested admiration though he didnt care to remember it he was a little closer to forty than thirty these days a second round wasnt so automatic as it had been a few years before he thought he could rise to the occasion today though laura secord watched him watching her did you enjoy your celebration she asked had she smiled that would have been different as things were her voice had an edge to it whats the matter darling he asked and reached out to toy with her left nipple she twisted away why should anything be the matter she asked you come up here when it suits you you celebrate and then you drive back down to empire she stubbornly kept using the name the canadians had tried to hang on berlin during the war before the usa took it although jonathan moss didnt have experience with a great many women he knew trouble when he heard it dammit laura youd better know by now that i dont come up here just to have a good time he said i know you didnt used to she answered but things have been going on for a while now and i do start to wonder can you blame me will you still drive up here every couple of weeks in or will you have found someone younger and prettier and closer to empire by then im not looking for anybody else moss said i love you in case you hadnt noticed do you laura secord asked of course i do he said she looked at him she didnt say what she was obviously thinking in that case what are you going to do about it the question was if anything more effective left hanging in the air jonathan moss took a deep breath his response looked pretty obvious too will you marry me he asked will you sell this farm and come over to berlinyou can even call it empire if you wantand live with me for the rest of our lives her nod said that that was the right question sure enough but it wasnt a nod of acceptance she asked a question of her own why didnt you ask me that a long time ago jonathan why because i know im nothing but a lousy american and i figured youd tell me no for sure id sooner have gone on the way things were than have that happen hearing no to a question like that hurts worse than anything else i can think of what if i said yes she asked quietly id throw you into my motorcar and wed get back to berlin in time to find a justice of the peace if you think id let you have the chance to change your mind youre nuts laura secord gave him the ghost of a smile it couldnt be quite that fast im afraid id have to make arrangements to sell the livestock or to have it taken care of before i leave the farm are you telling me yes moss demanded she nodded again this time she meant it the way hed hoped she would he let out a whoop that probably scared some of her feral farm cats out of a years growth moss didnt care and he did rise again and they found the best way to inaugurate their engagement afterwards she said i was afraid you didnt want to buy a cow as long as milk was cheap moo me he answered and startled her again this time into laughter if that wasnt a good omen he didnt know what would be g eorge enos jr set cash on the kitchen tablemore of it than sylvia enos had expected here you go ma her son said his voice breaking with excitement we had us a he heck of a run cod like you couldnt believe he looked down at his hands which had acquired the beginnings of the scabs and scars that always marked fishermens fingers and palms i did more gutting than anybody could think of and with the offal over the side the birds that came and the sharksi never imagined anything like it your father used to talk the same way sylvia answered she remembered him sitting up over a mug of coffee in the days when they were first married telling her about what hed done and what hed seen and what it had felt like but this wasnt quite the same after all george enos had done enough fishing by the time he married her that it had become routine and wearying routine at that george jr didnt seem tired at all maybe that was because everything still seemed bright and new to him or maybe it was just because at seventeen he never got tired at all his father certainly had though and hed been only a few years older how much is it ma mary jane asked looking up from the onions she was chopping she paused to rub her streaming eyes then let out a yelpshe must have had onion juice on her fingers and made things worse instead of better quite a bit answered sylvia whod been trained from childhood not to talk about money in any detail it will help a lot thats good mary jane said im going to look for a shopgirl job again tomorrow i bet i find something too that one i had last summer was swell but then you went and made me go back to school she sent sylvia as severe a look as a fifteenyearold girl could give her mother sylvia had no trouble withstanding it shed known far worse summer work is one thing she said school is something else you need your schooling george jr glanced at his sister they both almostbut not quite no not quiteinvisibly shook their heads these days they were old enough to team up on sylvia instead of fighting each other as theyd done for so long sylvia knew why george jr sneered at school he was making good money without it and sylvia had a pretty good idea why mary jane didnt want to keep going she was bound to be thinking something like who cares whether i can divide fractions and diagram sentences what difference will it make im going to get married and have babies and my husband will make money for me you never can tell sylvia said half to herself half to her daughter i thought george jrs father was going to take care of things forever but then the war came and the confederates captured him and after that he joined the navy and he he didnt come home and ive had to run like crazy ever since just trying to make ends meet if i knew more about spelling and typing and arithmetic idve had better jobs and made more money and wedve done better for ourselves and if you think things like that cant happen to you and the people you love mary jane youre wrong i wish you werent but you are because you never can tell by something surely not far from a miracle she got through to her daughter instead of giving her a snippy answer mary jane nodded and said i wish i couldve known pa better george jr got up and set a hand on his younger sisters shoulder i wish i could have too his voice roughened but at least ma paid back the stinking son of a bitchhad he been out on the trawler instead of in his kitchen he undoubtedly would have said something much hotter than thatwho sank the ericsson everybody i sail with knows mas a hero sylvia brushed that aside it wont get me any supper she said and stood up herself so she could start cooking she hadnt felt heroic when shed pumped a revolverful of bullets into roger kimball she had trouble remembering now exactly how she had felt frightened and resigned was about as close as she could come to it she hadnt thought she would ever see her children or boston again but here she was with all the same problems all the same worries shed had before getting on the train for charleston being a hero shed rapidly discovered paid few bills when shed come home she had got back the job shed left so she could go to the confederate states shed made a few speeches that brought in a little money by now though she was old news even in this presidential election year no one asked her to come out joe kennedy for instance had used her and forgotten about her every once in a while she wondered how many women hed really rather than metaphorically seduced and abandoned more than a few or she missed her guess while washing dishes later that evening mary jane asked who are you going to vote for come november ma womens suffrage had finally come to massachusettsand to the rest of the holdout states in the usawith the passage of the nineteenth amendment these days all the men whod opposed it were busy explaining how theyd never really done any such thing how theyd always looked out for the countrys best interests and as many other lies as they could find most of those men were democrats even so sylvia answered im going to vote for governor coolidge for president because hes a democrat and hed be harder on the confederates than vice president blackford coolidge fought in the war too he didnt stay back of the lines do you think coolidge will win mary jane asked i dont know sylvia said thats why they have the electionto find out who wins i mean hardly anybody thought president sinclair would beat teddy roosevelt in but he did i was still little then mary jane said thoughtfully scrubbing at a frying pan with steel wool to sylvia mary jane was still little now and would be the rest of her life but she put that aside and went back to the question her daughter had asked a little while before i do wish governor coolidge would be a little more lively people dont seem to get very excited about him and that worries me blackford and his wife can really whip up the crowds it matters a lot the following sunday someone knocked at the door to her flat there stood her neighbor brigid coneval the irishwoman said blackford his own self will be after speaking on the common today at half past two now that we can vote and all im for hearing what he has to say for himself will you come with me now sylvia found herself nodding i sure will she said youre rightwe ought to find out all we can about them indeed and we should brigid coneval agreed a war widow like sylvia she hadnt had an easy time of it since her husband was shot she made ends meet by taking care of other peoples childrenthough her own boys by now were also old enough to get jobs of their own and bring in a little money to help through everything shed kept an infectious grin and besides itll be fun we can ride the subway over to the common theres a station close by there why not sylvia didnt often do things on impulse but this would be out of the ordinary and it wouldnt cost anything except subway fare she didnt like the subway it was even more crowded than trolley cars and noisier too between stations the tunnel was black as coal she kept wondering things like what would happen if this train broke down she knew she shouldnt she knew that wasnt likely but she couldnt help it the subway train got to the common without incident sylvia and brigid coneval emerged from the bowels of the earth into bright sunshine it glowed off the gilded dome of the state house in front of which vice president blackford would speak lets get under one of the trees sylvia said pointing were early theres still room under there we can stay in the shade itll be cooler well arent you the clever one now her friend said they staked out their spot with no trouble at all they were early the crowd hadnt really begun to fill the boston common most of the people there so soon were either blackfords socialist backers or the democratic activists who would heckle the vice president when he spoke the two groups jockeyed for position and traded insults mostly goodnatured theyd squared off against each other many times before and knew theyd often meet again after this afternoon one of the men carrying an years is enough sign was joe kennedy seeing him sylvia shrank back farther under the tree she didnt want him to see her even though she had every right to be here but he didshe got the feeling he missed very little he saw her recognized her and turned his back she wanted to call out im going to vote for coolidge she didnt she could tell it would do no good a big black car pulled up by the platform a tall grayhaired man and a short woman much younger than he got out and went to the platform thats himselfs wife brigid coneval said a congresswoman from new york city she is and a christkilling sheeny besides sylvia didnt care much about jews one way or the other she said by all they say shes done a good job in congress and look at her shes been there since the war and she doesnt look any older than we are foosh said brigid who seemed determined to stay unimpressed and whats her husband then sure and hes a dirty old man for id not care to hang since hes seen the sweet side of forty flora blackford stepped up to the microphone the democrats in the crowd immediately started to jeer she made as if to urge them on and then said listen to them comrades they wont tell the truth themselves and they dont want to let anyone else tell it either is that fair is that honest is that what you want in the powel house for the next four years no people shouted the congresswoman from new york city made a short strong speech giving the socialists credit for everything that had gone right the past eight years the booming stock market laws allowing strikes for higher wages and on and on what about the revolt in canada what about cutting off confederate reparations the democrats yelled what about the bank troubles in europe well what about them flora retorted meeting the hecklers head on the canadians lost and were at peace with the confederate states and getting along with them well enough isnt it about time this country was at peace with its neighbors as for the banks in europe well what can we do about them here most people cheered the democrats went right on heckling vice president blackford himself stepped up to the microphone weve had eight good years he said lets have four more weve got prosperity weve got peace give us a few more socialists in the senate and well have oldage insurance too if you want to go back to gearing up for a war every generation vote for governor coolidge hell give you one if you want to make sure your sons and husbands and brothers live to grow old vote for me its that simple but it wasnt not as far as sylvia was concerned she wanted the confederate states punished for what theyd done to the ericsson not forgiven their reparations hosea blackford might not want a war but wouldnt the confederates if they ever got strong again im glad we came she told brigid coneval on their way back to the subway station now im surer than ever ill vote for coolidge sure and you cant mean it brigid exclaimed and argued with her all the way home even though shed mocked both hosea blackford and his wife she didnt change sylvias mind or even come close o ver the supper table chester martin grinned at his wife election day coming up he said with a sly smile and so rita answered but she smiled too plenty of worse ways to meet than at a polling place i should say martin had met women at worse placesand that didnt even count the soldiers brothels behind the front during the war when youd stand in line outside in the rain for a couple of minutes of what was much more catharsis than rapture at least i never got a dose of the clap he thought do you think blackford can do it rita asked hope so martin said i dont see why not everybodys making good money why should we change when things are going the way theyre supposed to he spread his hands i still dont much like the socialists foreign policyid take a stronger line than they dobut thats not enough reason to vote for the great stone face rita laughed at the nickname coolidge doesnt have much to say for himself does he i think theres a reason for that too chester replied hes never done anything worth talking about massachusetts is prosperous rita said he takes credit for that after sarcastically clapping his hands a couple of times martin said he may take it but who says he deserves it the whole countrys prosperous and the socialists deserve credit for that hed come late to the socialists but had what amounted to a converts zeal look where we were in before president sinclair won and look where we are now youre preaching to the choir you know his wife told him with a smile im going to vote for blackford too i know but look chester felt expansive he wanted to tell the whole world how well his party had run the country over the past eight years since the whole world wasnt sitting across the kitchen table from him and rita was she got to listen to him he went on look how high the stock markets risen who would have thought the proletariat could start owning the means of production by buying shares in the big companies with buying on margin though its awfully easy to do he laughed if we can afford to do it it must be easy to do rita pointed to the newspaper which lay on a chair the wireless corporation is splitting its stock again martin nodded i saw that im glad i got into wireless somewhere close to the ground floor i think its going to be the big thing for years and years and those four shares i managed to buy last summer are sixteen shares now its swell everything keeps going up and up and up its like coining money did you see that congresswoman blackford is coming to town saturday rita asked no i missed that he answered do you want to go see her sure why not itll be fun rita said and besides she shows what a woman can do when she puts her mind to it although chester wasnt sure he liked the sound of that he said all right anyhow finding agreement the better part of valor then he added did i ever tell you that i met flora blackford when she was still flora hamburger rita cut in had her brother in your company during the war she shook her head her bobbed dark blond hair flipped back and forth no you never ever told me that ive never heard it not even once cant you tell i can tell youre giving me a hard time he answered she grinned so did he flora blackford chose to speak near the toledo city hall in the shadow of the smaller copy of the great statue of remembrance that stood on bedloe island in new york harbor chester found that interesting even challenging for more than a generation remembrance had been the loudest drum the democrats beat for a nation twice defeated twice humiliated by the csa and the confederates european allies it was a drumbeat that had struck deep chords but now the great war was eleven years past the united states had won it people still held remembrance day parades but they didnt march with flags upside down any more having won the united states were no longer in distress and ever since the great war ended the democrats hadnt been able to find any other theme that resonated with the voters as remembrance had and now here stood flora blackford under that great statue with the gleaming sword by the way she stood there she said remembranceand the democratsspoke to yesterdays worries yesterdays needs im going to talk about what you need to hear todayand tomorrow she said without words merely by standing there weve come a long way the past eight years she said but weve still got a long way to go when president sinclair was elected you risked losing your job if you went out on strike some of you had lost your jobs that cant happen any more thanks to the laws weve passed chester martin pounded his palms together hed fought company goons and hed fought the police who served as the big capitalists watchdogs and hunting hounds next to what hed been through in the trenches those brawls hadnt been anything much and if you werent willing to fight for what you wanted did you really deserve to get it he believed in the class struggle he believed in it all the way down to his toes when the applause died down a little vice president blackfords wife went on you know the democrats never would have passed a bill like that or like the one that gives workers the right to take leave without pay if theres a baby in the family or someone takes sick and then get their jobs back they were in power from to and they still behave as though its that drew not only applause but whoops of laughter it also fit in very well with what chester had been thinking not long before flora blackford continued and we tried to give you oldage insurance too we tried hard but we couldnt quite manage that because the democrats had enough men in the senate to tie up the bill with a filibuster weve got to elect more socialists friends comrades the presidency is important but its not enough not by itself we have to fight the forces of reaction wherever we find them thats what the class struggle is all about it wasnt how martin imagined the class struggle he took the phrase literally hed broken enough heads in his time to have reason to take it literally hed taken his lumps too the real problem with the class struggle was that the capitalists and their lackeys fought back hard but the idea of carrying the struggle even to the halls of congress held a powerful appeal for him we dont need the enormous army and navy we had before the great war the army and navy that ate up so much money and so much of our industry flora said weve won the war now we can enjoy what we won factories can make goods for people not for killing we can spend our wealth on what we need not on battleships and machine guns and barrels weve fought our neighbors too many times we can work toward living at peace with them now that drew more loud cheers chester joined in them but more than a little halfheartedly this was the part of the socialist platform that still graveled him still flora blackford expressed it well maybe the s were so prosperous because less money was going into weapons and fortifications and more into peoples pockets maybe hosea blackford will take us on toward the middle of the twentieth century flora declared calvin coolidge will drag us back into the nineteenth century which way do you want to go the choice is yoursits in the peoples hands i ask you not to turn your back on the future i ask you to vote socialist to vote for hosea blackford for president and hiram johnson for vice president let dakota and california show the rest of the country the way thank you more applausethunderous applause rita said i cant wait for november neither can i chester agreed that was how a good stump speech was supposed to work it made the faithful eager men and women pushed forward trying to get a word with flora blackford now that shed come down off the platform come on martin told his wife and did some pushing himself wondering if the vice presidents wife would remember him he didnt really expect her to and she didnt not when she looked at him but when he shouted his name at her she nodded you were davids sergeant she said thats right maam chester grinned and nodded and this is my wife rita pleased to meet you flora clasped ritas hand will you vote for my husband on election day i sure will rita answered i was going to even before i heard you talk but even if id been thinking about voting for the democrats before you would have made me change my mind thank you very much flora blackford said he needs all the votes he can get believe me we cant take anything for granted if we do were liable to lose wed better not chester martin said before vice president blackfords wife could answer a fresh surge of people from behind pushed rita and him away from her again that was no surprise he felt lucky to have talked with her at all turning to rita he asked what do you think shes honest rita said at once if she is its a good bet her husband is too and she knew who you were as soon as you told her your name that was something she proudly took his arm you know important people he laughed stick with me kiddo and ill take you to the top rita laughed too but only for a moment then she sobered you really do know important people chester that might turn out to be important one of these days you never can tell maybe but chester didnt believe it not down deep i dont think flora blackfords the sort of person you can use to pull strings she was in congress remember when her brother got conscripted and she didnt pull any for him he could have had some soft safe job behind the linestypist or driver or something like that he could have but he didnt he went into the fighting and he got shot if she didnt help david hamburger shes not likely to help me that depends on what youd need to ask her rita answered like i said a minute ago you never can tell somebody stepped on chesters foot hard ow he said in the crowd he couldnt even tell whod done it he pointed toward the trolley stop lets get out of here and go home before we get trampled suits me his wife said im glad we came though she made a good speechand i found out what a special fellow i married martin started to tell her he was just an ordinary guy he started to but he didnt if rita wanted to think he was a special fellow he didnt mind a bit f lora blackford had waited out six elections to the house of representatives shed been nervous every single time though her new york city district was solidly socialist and shed had easy races after the first one now for the first time since she wasnt running for congressbut she was more nervous than ever worrying about her husbands race proved more wearing than worrying about her own ever had she hadnt been this anxious in she was sure of that in hosea blackford hadnt headed the ticket it probably hadnt won or lost because of anything he did things were different now if they went as she hoped her husband would become president of the united states next march if they didnt no she wouldnt think about that telegraph sets clicked in their apartments phones jangled off in one corner an announcer on a wireless set spewed out results flora and hosea got any news that came in as fast as they would have at socialist party headquarters in philadelphia but the same longstanding tradition that kept a presidential nominee away from the convention till hed been declared the candidate bound a presidential hopeful to find out whether hed won or lost away from the people whod done the most to help him when flora complained about that her husband only shrugged its one of the rules of the game he said one of the rules of the game used to be that the democrats won every four years flora answered weve changed that why not the other hosea blackford looked surprised i just hadnt thought about it i did this in the two of us did it in maybe we will change things four years from now she gave him a kiss i like that youre already starting to think about your second term are you id better worry about the first one dont you think he said the wireless announcer said in massachusetts governor coolidge continues to pull away he also leads comfortably in vermont and tennessee and early returns from kentucky show him with a strong lead there oy flora said in dismay her husband took the news much more in stride than she did massachusetts is coolidges home state he said weve never done well anywhere in new england and kentucky is full of reactionaries how could it be anything else when it belonged to the confederate states till the middle of the war wait till we start getting returns from the places where working people live where they make things she nodded she knew that as well as he did even so i dont like losing anywhere she said hosea blackford smiled thats one of the reasons im so glad youre on my side a man at one of the telephones called out your lead in new york city just went up another twenty thousand votes mr vice president flora smiled toothen she finally had something to smile about vice president blackfords large lead in new york city looks likely to carry the state for him in spite of governor coolidges popularity in the upstate regions the commentator on the wireless declared pennsylvania will probably be a closer race the socialists are strong in pittsburgh but philadelphia is still a democratic bastion we have to have new york flora murmured we have to the state had the biggest bloc of electoral votes in the usa one out of every seven pennsylvania came next but far behind the democrats could count as well as the socialists theyd campaigned hard in new york let them fall short in floras mind it was more than half a prayer new returns from ohio a telegrapher said youre up in toledo up in cleveland holding your own in columbus not doing so well in cincinnati about what we expected blackford said what do the overall figures in the state look like youre up by let me see seventeen thousand the man answered after some quick work with pencil and paper not bad for this early in the night flora said no not bad hosea blackford agreed cant say much more than that without knowing just where all those votes are coming from but id rather be ahead than behind flora nodded little by little returns began trickling in from farther west indiana had long been a socialist stronghold senator debs had twice lost to teddy roosevelt as the socialist partys standardbearer hosea blackford was well ahead there republicans remained strong in illinois michigan and iowathose threecornered races wouldnt be settled till the wee small hours like indiana wisconsin was solidly in the socialist camp were doing fine flora said and tried to make herself believe it maybe im glad im here after all her husband said looks like its going to be a long night this way i can just go back into the bedroom and sleep whenever i feel like it and there arent any reporters yelling at me either i wouldnt be able to hear myself think over at party headquarters i wish it didnt look like a long night flora said i wish we were sweeping the country and we could declare victory as soon as the polls closed well i wouldnt mind that myself hosea laughed the democrats did it for one election after another maybe we will too somewhere down the line but we havent got there yet this ones going to be close floras fists tightened till her nails bit into the palms of her hands it wasnt just that she wanted the socialists to win powel house and as many seats in the house and senate as they could though she did shed always wanted that ever since becoming a party activist before the great war but it felt secondary now with her husband in the race she wanted his triumph with an intensity that amazed her a win tonight would cap a lifetime of service to the socialist cause and to the country losing again she refused to think about losing hosea blackford didnt if i win we stay in philadelphia he said if i lose we go home how would you like living way out west for a while its beautiful country flora answered and then said the best thing she could for it joshua would like growing up there having said that she went on it seems so empty though to somebody whos used to new york city or philadelphia shed enjoyed spending holidays in dakota with her husband the wide open spaces awed her for a while but towns and trains and civilization in general seemed a distinct afterthought there she didnt like that not at all to someone whod grown up on the preposterously overcrowded lower east side so many empty miles of prairie relievedif at allonly by a long line of telegraph poles shrinking toward an unbelievably distant horizon felt more alarming than inspiring someone slammed down a telephone and let out a string of curses that ignored her presence in the room kansas is going for coolidge god damn it he said that made flora want to curse too hosea blackford took it in stride confederate raiders hit kansas hard during the war he said they dont love socialists there theyve been democrats since the second mexican war well they can geh kak afen yam flora said her husband chuckled he knew what that yiddish unpleasantry meant theres no yam anywhere close to kansas for them to geh kak afen he pointed out i dont care flora said they can do it anyway the new state of houston carved from the conquered piece of texas went for calvin coolidge so did montana which had been a democratic stronghold ever since theodore roosevelt made a hero of himself there during the second mexican war flora began to worry in earnest but a little past midnight pennsylvania which had teetered for a long time fell into her husbands campand pennsylvanias electoral votes made up for a swarm of montanas new jersey had also stayed close till then and also ended up going socialist we may make it hosea blackford said we just may by then returns from the west were coming in colorado had a strong union tradition and looked like going socialist again idaho fell to coolidge and so did nevada but blackford swept the west coast including populous california hiram johnson had delivered his state flora was yawning when one of the telephones rang a little past three in the morning mr vice president called the man who answered it and then in a different awed tone of voice mr presidentelect its governor coolidge calling from massachusetts that woke flora better than a big cup of black coffee could have done she kissed her husband before he could go to the telephone hello governor he said when he picked up the instrument thank you very much sir thats very generous yes you did give me quite a scare and im not ashamed to admit it whats that he had been smiling and cordial but now his expression hardened i certainly hope youre wrong governor i think you are yes time will tell thank you again good night he hung up perhaps more forcefully than he had to what did he say that made you angry flora asked he said maybe he was lucky not to win hosea blackford answered he said bull markets dont last forever and this ones gone on so long and risen so high the crash will be all the worse when it comes back to earth god forbid flora exclaimed i think weve given god some help hosea said the business cycles been rising steadily all through both of president sinclairs terms i dont see any reason why it shouldnt do the same for me the democrats may have enjoyed boomandbust capitalism before the war but weve put that behind us now were prosperous and well stay prosperous alevai omayn whenever flora fell back into yiddish these days she spoke from heart and belly hosea blackford smiled he understood that i really do think itll be all right flora he said gently oh theres more farm debt than i care to see out in the west and the factories almost seem to be making things faster than people can buy them but all thats just a drop in the bucket well do fine im not going to argue with you not nowmr president flora kissed him again the telegraphers and men at the phones all cheered not for another five months hosea reminded her say that to me in front of president sinclair and hell arrest you for treason phooey flora said which wasnt english or yiddish but was exactly what she meant another telephone rang mr presidentelect its the president this time flora didnt try to delay her husband when he went to the telephone hello upton he said thank you so very much yes cal threw in the towel a little while ago he gave me some sour grapes too babbling about a crash yes of course its idiocy when in all the history of the country have things gone so well and we have you to thank for it ill do my best to follow your footsteps thanks again goodbye flora went in and woke up joshua your fathers going to be president she told him i want to go back to sleep he said irritablyhe wasnt quite three and didnt care whether his father was president or a garbageman flora wanted to go to sleep too now i wont have to live in dakota she thought and if that wasnt reason enough all by itself to be glad hosea had won she couldnt imagine what would be t he year had turned eight days before lucien galtier didnt want to be standing out in the open not with the weather down around zero and a raw wind blowing out of the northwest under his overcoat his tight collar and black cravat felt as if they were choking him charles and georges stood beside him in the graveyard his sons faces were blank and bitter with grief so he suspected was his own his daughtersnicole denise susanne and jeannecould show their grief more openly though that wind threatened to freeze the tears on their faces it also whipped at father guillaumes wool cassock is everyone here he asked galtier nodded himself his children their spouses his two grandchildrenand charles wife big with child due almost any daymaries brother and sister and their spouses and children and grandchildren some cousins some friends the priest raised his voice a little let us pray lucien bowed his head as father guillaume offered up sonorous latin to the lord absurdly galtier chose that moment to remember how strange the american priest whod married nicole and leonard odoull had sounded while speaking latinhed pronounced it differently from the way quebecois clergymen did but even theyd assured him it wasnt wrong merely not the same after the latin was done father guillaume dropped back into french marie galtier no longer gives us the boon of her company on this earth but she is at the right hand of the father even as i speak these words as she died in our true and holy catholic faith and she will live forever for she was a good woman as you show by coming here today to honor and commemorate her passing nicole began to sob leonard odoull put his arm around her lucien wished someone would do the same for him but he was a man he had to bear this as a man did as stoically as he could his eyes slid to the blackdraped coffin hed thought burying his parents was hard and it had been this though this felt ten times worse that was his life going into the hole the gravediggers had hacked from the frozen ground how can i go on without marie he wondered he couldnt imagine finding an answer in a real way too marie galtier does still live here among us the priest said lucien almost called him a liar and a fool there in front of everyone before he could say the words father guillaume went on she lives in our hearts in our memories whenever we recall her kindness and her love she lives again and because she gave us so many reasons to do just that she will live on for a very long time indeed even if her years among us were fewer than we would have wished think of her often and she will live for you again he turned toward the coffin making the sign of the cross and praying once more in latin all the people standing there shivering as they listened to him crossed themselves too as lucien did so he felt a certain dull amazement father guillaume had been right after all lucien could hear his wifes voice inside himself could see her smile whenever he closed his eyes a marvel yes but a painful marvel seeing her and hearing her that way only reminded him he wouldnt see her or hear her in the flesh any more helplessly he began to cry here papa of all people his foolish son georges was the one who held him and gave him a handkerchief georges whose alwayssmiling face was as twisted with sorrow as luciens had to be thank you my son lucien whispered he felt his eyelids trying to freeze together and rubbed at them with the handkerchief then he and his sons and maries brother and dr leonard odoull lifted the coffin and set it in the grave what struck lucien was how little it weighed which had little to do with six men lifting it after dr odoull found the mass in maries belly after the x ray and the operation that only confirmed the worst the flesh had melted off her day by day till she was little more than parchment skin wrapped around bones by the time the end finally mercifully came those were memories of his wife galtier wished he wouldnt carry into the future with him no matter what he wished though he would have them till his turn to lie in a coffin came he made himself go over to the priest and say merci father guillaume the young priest nodded soberly you are welcome and more than welcome this is a cup i wish had passed from me and one i wish had passed from your wife as well i would have hoped she might enjoy many more happy years yes i would have hoped for the same galtier looked up into the cloudy sky more snow might start falling any time better god should have taken me why did he take her and leave me all alone that thought had been with him since he first found out marie was ill he knows the answer to that even if he does not give it to us to know father guillaume said marie knows now too lucien said if ever i see god face to face i intend to ask him about it and his explanation had better be a good one the priest coughed and turned red galtier went on and if i dont see him face to face if i meet the devil instead as could be then i intend to find out from him now father guillaume gravely shook his head satan is the father of lies whatever he might tell you you would not be able to believe it with quebecois stubbornness lucien said ill hear what he says and then ill make up my own mind charles came up to him and asked do you want me to drive you home papa why would i galtier asked in honest surprise after this i was not sure how you would be his older son answered i am not so very well galtier agreed but if i am not so very well after burying my wife are you so very well after burying your mother it could be you would make a worse menace on the road than i nestce pas charles looked surprised but nodded yes it could be i suppose he turned away i should have known you were too stubborn to take help from anyone when i need it i take it lucien said when i dont i dont dont be angry at me son i am not angry at you and the two of us were not so very different eh he knew that was true charles took after him in more than looks his older son also had a character much like his own after a moments thought charles gave him the same sort of grudging nod he would have used himself all right father yes youre righti can be a stiffnecked nuisance too ill see you there then certainly galtier said where else would i go but to my own house but when he got out of the chevrolet close by the farmhouse on the land that had been in his family for almost years he wondered he didnt want to go back into the house going in there had alwaysnot literally always but more than thirty years came close enoughmeant going in to see marie now she wasnt there she never would be there not any more and remembering that she had been there remembering the life together the two of them had built the life now forever sundered forever shattered was like knives to lucien he had to gather himself before he could go inside nicole and leonard odoull were already there so were charles and his wife one by one and in small groups the rest of his children and his wifes relatives and his friends came in there was plenty to drink and plenty to eat the womenfolk in the family had been cooking since marie died thank you all lucien said thank you all very much for coming thank you for caring for marie his face twisted into a characteristically wry grin for i know you certainly would not have come for my sake certainly not mon beaupere dr odoull said we all hate you for a moment galtier took him seriously being too emotionally battered to recognize irony but then even he saw the smile on his soninlaws face and those on the faces of his other loved ones he wanted to smile too but ended up weeping once more instead he felt mortified all over again and angrily turned away from dr odoull its all right said the american whod become part of his family no one thinks less of you for it here drink this he gave lucien a glass of applejack the homemade spirits went down galtiers throat without his even noticing them he had another glass and another all with scant effect he felt too much already for applejack to make much difference for the next half hour or so he thanked everyone whod come to his house to say goodbye to marie what will you do now papa georges asked him do you know yet what can i do galtier answered ill go on as best i can if i dont feed the animals tomorrow who will if i dont take care of the farm who will the work doesnt do itself you always thought it did but it doesnt someone has to do it if no one does it it doesnt get done but his younger son gestured how can you do all the farm work and then do all the housework too electricity helps lucien said with electricity everything is quicker and easier and i was in the army a long time ago i know how to keep things tidyunlike certain people i could name georges didnt rise to that which proved how solemn an occasion this was he just asked and while you were in the army papa did they also teach you how to cook no but then who cares galtier answered i am the only person ill be cooking for i wont starve to death and if supper is particularly bad one night i can always throw things at the clumsy fool who fixed it he made his son laugh at that and thought hed tricked georgesmaybe even tricked himselfinto believing everything was or at least soon would be all right a few minutes later though georges sprawled in a chair hands over his face weeping with as much heartbreak as lucien knew himself what will i do galtier wondered for all his glib talk he had no idea at the moment he didnt particularly want to go on living himself maybe that would change as time passed hed heard it did hed heard it but didnt particularly believe it why not me he wondered as he had ever since hed found marie in the kitchen with tears running down her face hed hoped father guillaume would have an answer for that but no such luck it would have to wait till he saw god as marie was seeing god now if he doesnt have a good answer ill give him a piece of my mind nicole came over to him she looked achingly like her mother though she was a few inches taller marie had been a little woman not much over five feet shes gone papa she said wonderingly i cant believe it but shes gone i know lucien said i love you his oldest daughter said he hadnt heard that from her for years he suspected it meant im afraid ill lose you too and i love you my dear he said as if to reply im not going anywhere but that wasnt really for him to say he looked up to and past the ceiling dont you argue with me he told god and dared hope god was listening a nother inauguration day nellie jacobs said dear god where do the years go first one i can recollect is president blaines back in i was just a little girl then of course well i hope to heaven hosea blackford does a better job than james g blaine did her husband answered hed better nellie exclaimed a few months after blaine got elected the confederates were shelling washington ive been through that twice now it had better not happen again thats all ive got to say because i dont think anybody could be lucky enough to live through it three times i dont look for a war any time soon hal jacobs said i dont see how we could have one the confederates arent very strong and were prosperous i still think the stock market is sound even if the money trouble in europe has set it hiccoughing im glad its hiccoughing nellie said it let us buy those shares of the wireless corporation for a lot less than they would have cost us a couple of months ago buy on the dips hal said wisely buy on the dips and you cant go wrong thats what they say nellie agreed its worked out pretty well for us so far i just wish wed been able to start out when we were a lot younger hal shrugged for one thing we didnt have the money for another the market was a lot riskier in those daysit would crash every few years and then the war came along and we were too busy to worry about it for quite a while too busy well yes a little bit nellie said hal pinned his distinguished service medal on the breast pocket of his black jacket with his white shirt black cravat and black homburg the medals ribbon gave his outfit the only dash of color it had nellie nodded approval you look handsome she told him and he did indeed look as handsome as he could thank you my dear he always seemed to glow a little when she paid him a compliment and he returned the favor you are as lovely as always oh foosh nellie had heard too many compliments from men over the years to trust them or take them seriously men complimented women because they wanted something from themmost often one thing in particular she put on her order of remembrance then turned her back on her husband fasten the ribbon at the back of my neck would you hal of course he said and did then he kissed the back of her neck too shed more than half expected him to do that and she let him get away with it by his relieved expression hed wondered if she would are you ready clara she called yes ma her daughter answered from the room across the hall is it time to go just about nellie said and dont forget your coat do i have to bring it clara said its not cold out she was right the weather was springlike even though spring still lay two and a half weeks away but nellie answered yes take it im bringing one too you never can tell what itll do clara grumbled but she couldnt complain too hard not if nellie was also bringing a coat and nellie knew she was right she also had an umbrella though the sun shone brightly for now no you never could tell they walked toward the mall for the parade of bands and companies of soldiers andsince this was another socialist administrationgangs of workers who would precede the new president blackfords inaugural address they had a spot picked outright in front of the rebuilt national museum of remembrance and not far from the platform where the new president would speak edna and merle and armstrong would meet them there if they could fight their way through the crowd they wiggled forward till they stood in the second row in front of the museum nellie could see the platform which was already filling with dignitaries we made good time she said yes we did hal agreed well be able to see everything and we wont have any trouble hearing the president talk clara chose that moment to announce mama i have to go you always have to go nellie said in no small exasperation she sighed ill take you into the museum hold our places hal do the best you can her husband nodded she took claras hand come along with me young lady why didnt you go before we left thats what i want to know i did clara answered with a childs selfrighteousness i have to go again the line for the womens powder room at the museum of remembrance was as long as nellie had feared it would be she and clara needed twenty minutes to work their way to the front by then clara was fidgeting enough to convince nellie she hadnt said she needed to go just to be annoying many more people had come to the mall by the time nellie and clara emerged from the museum once more nellie had to do some elbowing and stepped on a couple of feet that didnt get out of the way fast enough to suit her watch where youre going lady an angry man said im so sorry nellie answered and stepped on him again not in the least by accident hal jacobs wasnt a big man nellie began to wonder if shed ever find him she was starting to worry when merle grimes said hello mother jacobs he and edna and armstrong stood with hal hello merle she said idve gone right past the lot of you if you hadnt spoken up lord help me if i wouldnt were all together now hal said thats the way things are supposed to be thats right edna said a little louder than she had to she clung to merles hand they both wore their decorations too from what nellie could see things between them werent quite the same as they had been before merle found out about nicholas h kincaid they were tolerable and edna didnt seem actively discontented but they werent so loveydovey as before told you so edna nellie said but only to herself a band began to play nellie stopped worrying about her daughter and soninlawand even about her other daughter and her grandson who got along no better than they ever didand watched yet another inauguration yet another passing of the torch from one president to another this year the passing was odd as outgoing president sinclair was about fifteen years younger than incoming president blackford it was as if the usa were moving backwards in time something the country didnt do very often chief justice holmes administered the oath to hosea blackford voice aided by a microphone blackford repeated the words that made him president of the united states i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states a sigh ran through the crowd nellie had heard that oath every four years since not counting it made official what had happened five months before now the country had a new president now we see what happens next she thought as if it were a new chapter in a novel and so in a way it was the most immediate thing that happened next was blackfords inaugural address nellie got a good look at him up there on the stand behind him his wife who was much younger than he tried to keep a little boy younger than armstrong quiet robbing the cradle mr president nellie thought i am pleased to tell you how well off our country is today thanks to the inspired leadership given over the past eight years by my most distinguished predecessor president upton sinclair hosea blackford owned a ringing baritone nellie thought she remembered hearing hed been a lawyer before going to congress he certainly had the voice for it he led the applause for the president leaving office sinclair rose one last time from his seat behind the podium to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd as the new expresident sat down again blackford went on we are at peace on our continent we extend the hand of friendship to both the confederate states and the empire of mexico we share a common heritage with the csa and i am pleased to note that confederate president burton mitchel a civilized gentleman shares this view may we see no more war in north america not ever again nellie clapped as loud as she could if war came it would surely come to washington would surely come down on her head she wanted peace for her daughter peace for her grandson shed seen too much of war ever to want to know it again to the north the republic of quebec is our staunch ally blackford declared even nellie knew that meant the quebecois would do as they were told the president said englishspeaking canada continues to recover under our guidance even nellie knew that meant the rest of the canucks would damn well have to do as they were told and utah long turbulent looks toward the day when it shall be a state like any other that drew scattered boos even from a mostly friendly crowd few people outside of utah had much sympathy for the mormons not after two uprisings broad oceans protect us from foreign foes president blackford said the sandwich islands serve as a bastion against the empire of japan while the atlantic shields us against europes unending turmoil and danger and let me note that i am completely confident the panics of the past ten days in vienna in rome in paris and in london will not affect the empire of germany in any important way and that they cannot possibly cross the atlantic and endanger our own wellbeing everyone applauded vigorously there so far the berlin and new york exchanges had avoided most of the jitters afflicting the smaller european markets though richmond also seemed nervous beside nellie hal murmured if we can ride it out for another week well be fine the austrohungarians cause so much trouble if they hadnt called for repayment of that russian loan hush nellie told him i want to hear the president blackford seemed to have said everything he was going to say about foreign affairs he switched to what he hoped to accomplish within the united states we want no man hungry we want no one ablebodied without work we want no capitalists exploiting the workers of our great land we want justice for all and we intend to get it we will not let the aged who have worked hard all their lives be discarded like so many wornout cogs in our industrial machine nellie applauded that shed worked hard all her life and looked forward to the day when she wouldnt have to any more oldage insurance sounded good to herbetter than relying on whatever charity she might get from merle and edna and perhaps from clara and whomever she ended up marrying if blackford can find a way for me to have enough to live on when im old id vote socialist foreverif i could vote at all womens suffrage was here all over the usabut not in washington dc men were every bit as disenfranchised in the nations legal capital now more than ever that struck nellie as monstrously unfair men had complained about it for as long as she could remember it also affected her now so she noticed it more hosea blackford said not a word about votes for washington americanempire thecentercannothold x c larence potter had to wait to see his broker he spent the time in ulysses dalbys waiting room drumming his fingers on his thigh to the outside world he showed only impatience he kept the fear and rage he felt bottled up inside no one would have known from his stolid impassive face the way his heart pounded or how cold and damp the palms of his hands were at last the brokers secretary said mr dalby will see you now mr potter thank you betty potter strode past her without another word she was a redhead whose generous contours could usually be counted on to distract male investors from their worries today potter was too worried to be distracted he closed the door behind him as he went into ulysses dalbys office the broker was a few years older than he a plump grayhaired man with a jovial manner who wore sharp suits he extended a wellmanicured hand with a glittering pinkie ring for potter to shake good morning sir he said his low country accent sweet and syrupy what can i do for you this fine day get me out clarence potter said dalby raised an eyebrow i beg your pardon sir get me out potter repeated sell every stock i have fast as you can do it best price you can get but sell richmond and new york exchanges both ill be back for the cash this afternoon mr potter i hesitate to carry out an order like that dalby said are you sure youve considered carefully maybe youll call me a fool a month from now potter answered if im wrong i can buy back in but ill have something to buy back in with my opinion is that theres a fire in the woods if i dont get out now it will burn me out panic selling sir will only make the fire worse dalby said sitting around while the woods burn wont do me any good potter said ill take my chances on the other what have you done with your portfolio mr dalby ive diversified as much as possible dalby replied thats fancy talk it means youre already out of the markets doesnt it potter asked when the broker didnt answer right away potter nodded i thought so im getting out while the getting is at least tolerable if not good place those sell orders right this minute i want to make sure you do it ill be back for my money this afternoon mind you and i expect to have it he didnt quite say i know where you live dalby but it hung in the air only after the broker made the necessary telephone calls did clarence potter leave his office when he stepped back out onto the streets of charleston he still felt panic in the air a newsboy shouted france leaves the gold standard another one called london market plunges again big selloff in richmond and yet another cried president mitchel calls for calm confederate dollar still sound he says potter hoped burton mitchel was right about that last if the currency went out the window as it had right after the war thered be hell to pay but no money for the devil will i have to buy gold potter wondered is there any gold to buy ill worry about that later first things first banknotes nice brown banknotes let me get a good fat wad of them and i can laugh at the world for a while when he went back to ulysses dalbys office that afternoon the newspaper hawkers were talking about the beating the richmond exchange had taken and about the one the new york exchange had taken too he set his teeth and hoped the broker hadnt decamped with his money betty the decorative secretary led him into dalbys office just seeing dalby made him let out a sigh of relief he let out another one when dalby handed him a thick sheaf of brown banknotes what he let out after counting the money was more on the order of a grunt of pain this is all he demanded thats all mr potter i tried to warn you you dont get top dollar in a bear market ulysses dalby said here are the transaction records im not cheating you well maybe you dont potter said after carefully checking the records he did his best to sound philosophical but i would have got a lot less if id waited till tomorrow or the day after or next week wouldnt i dalby nodded i have to say you would have im also going to ask you one thing more in what bank do you intend to put your money now that youve got it why the first secession bank and trust potter answered ive been doing business with them since i came down here after the war you must know that how come mm it may be nothing youre a good judge of banksi think the first secession is a pretty solid outfit it may come through all this just fine clarence potter stared at him it may you say dalby nodded again potter whistled softly you think its going to be as bad as that banks going under the way they did in and yes it may be that bad the broker answered after a little thought on the other hand it may be a good deal worse potter started to laugh thinking dalby had made a grim sort of joke but dalbys face was serious even somber im not kidding mr potter he said im not kidding at all in the last couple of panics our markets took a beating and so did wall street up in the usa but the rest of the world went on about its business its not like that this time sir i wish to heaven it were this time it wont do much to africa i suppose and maybe not to china eitherthe heathen chinese are already about as bad off as they can be but i dont believe anyplace else will get off untouched potter whistled again an even lower even more mournful note he might have been tolling the passing of an era maybe i am he thought my god he said aloud and i thought i was a pessimist i watched the ticker tape all day mr potter i watched it get further and further behind the sales it was supposed to be listing dalby said when i saw you this morning i still had some hope id say it died about an hour and a half ago maybe im wrong i hope im wrong i hope so but i dont think so not any more he looked shellshocked that was exactly how he looked potter realized hed been through too much like men in the army of northern virginia during the war theyd got that stunned beaten look on their faces too half the time after that they didnt care if they lived or died dalby didnt seem to not right now stowing your money in your mattress was a joke that went at least as far back as money and mattresses potter wondered which of those had come first joke or not he did just that with the banknotes hed got from ulysses dalby the next morning he closed out his account at the first secession bank and trust the lines at the bank werent too bad i assure you sir said the young clerk who gave him his money we are perfectly sound i believe you son potter answered thats why im doing this now who knows how the devil youre going to be in a couple of weeks though the clerk didnt try to tell him everything would be fine he found himself wishing the fellow would have he went to the whig party meeting the following tuesday more out of morbid curiosity than for any other reason the stock exchanges hadnt got any better theyd kept right on sinking richmond faster than new york lines outside the banks were starting to get longerand more anxious the meeting went very much as potter expectedvery much as hed fearedit would it put him in mind of a lot of maiden ladies talkingor rather trying not to talkabout sex the lawyers and businessmen circled the building crash like a man circling a rattlesnake in a small room they couldnt ignore it but they didnt want to deal with it either they kept making noises about changing conditions and uncertainty and a seeming slump in the business cycle clarence potter stuck up his hand he needed a while to be recognized he wasnt surprised hed expected they wouldnt want to notice him hed proved himself a gadfly and they didnt like that but he was or could be a patient gadfly at last the chairman had no choice but to turn his way and ask yes mr potter boys potter said the jig is up bang the chairman rapped loudly for order have you anything more germane to say mr potter or may we move on to the next order of business what is the next order of business in the middle of a crash potter demanded sending out for more strings so we can fiddle while the market burns bang went the gavel again potter ignored it next congressional elections are only a few months away he said harshly if this is as bad as it looks how do we intend to send one single solitary whig incumbent back to richmond for the new congress wed better be thinking about that eh before we worry about anything else and wed better try to keep the country on its feet so itll be in some sort of shape to want to vote for us how are we supposed to go about that bang bang bang mr potter you are as thoroughly out of order as it is possible for one man to be the chairman all but shouted youre right potter agreed but the country is a lot further out of order than i can be and so are the whigs i have one last question gentlemen and then im done if this turns out to be as bad as it looks right now how the hell do you propose to keep those freedom party yokels from trying to pick up the pieces bang bang bang bang bang the gavel descended again and again a veritable fusillade of banging that succeeded in silencing clarence potter but he noticed no one tried to answer his question hed expected nothing different nothing better hed hoped for something better but he knew too well the difference between hope and expectation he walked out of the meeting gloomy but hed figured he would a couple of days later after watching stocks tumble lower yet after listening on the wireless to a speech by president mitchel that was as full of misplaced optimism as any hed ever heard he decided to telephone anne colleton he wasnt even sure she would remember him a brief acquaintance in a political squabble a couple of years before didnt necessarily constitute an introduction but she said oh yes mr potter i do appreciate the help you gave me against that fool of a braxton donovan whats on your mind today i dont know frankly he answered the main reason i called was to see how you were doing if anyone could land on her feet in this mess youre the one im not too bad she said as soon as i saw which way the wind was blowing i sold out as fast as i could i got hurt i didnt get wiped out if id stayed in the market a little longer i would have how about you mr potter about the same he told her i could have done better if id left a couple of days sooner but im getting by for the time being an awful lot of people arent though and it may get worse before it gets better im afraid youre right anne colleton said not many people can see that in a way its good to know someone can belshazzar needed daniel to read the writing on the wall potter said i hope someone can do the job for us i wish there were no job to do anne answered well so do i he answered but im very much afraid this is only the beginning and not just for the confederate states in a way misery loves company in another way if everyones in trouble nobody can help anybody else get out of it anne colleton didnt say anything for perhaps half a minute at last she told him that makes good sense to me another pause you seem to make very good sense mr potter maybe we should talk some more if we get the chance and what am i letting myself in for if i say yes to that potter wondered but the answer seemed obvious trouble only question is how much trouble he too paused but not for long maybe we should miss colleton maybe we should w hen chester martin got off his shift at the toledo steel mill he went straight to the socialist party hall not far from the factory he could have had himself a beer there but opened a bottle of nesbits instead he wanted to keep his wits about him spotting albert bauer he called what do you think of this management notion cutting shifts from eight hours to six you mean bauer answered yeah thats what i mean all right unless theres another brandnew management notion i havent heard about yet chester said bauer didnt look happy way i see it weve got two choices he said we can say yes and let em cut our pay by a quarter or we can so no and have em fire one out of four of us he was drinking a beer he drained it then added this is what you call being between the devil and the deep blue sea i dont trust those management bastards martin said like as not its a trick to pump up their profits and hurt us at the same time instead of hiring goons and scabs they play these games nowadays i know but bauer looked mighty unhappy hate to tell you chester but i dont think so not this time ive seen the orders going through the pipeline theyve fallen right off a cliff nobodys buying steel not to speak of theres no point in making it if nobodys ordering less than no point in facta big inventory just drives prices down when orders do start picking up i dont think the bosses are playing games for the sake of playing games not this time i wish they were id strike in a redhot minute fine wonderful but somebodyd better tell me how the hell im supposed to make ends meet on threequarters of my proper pay well that depends bauer said slowly would you rather try to make ends meet on none of your proper pay the companys trying hard not to get rid of people i dont like the bosses and i never will but i have to give them credit for that martin told him exactly where hed like to give the bosses credit bauer laughed martin said its not funny dammit if my wife didnt have work we wouldnt make it on threequarters of a paycheck id sooner take my chances on getting the sack if i did id look for something else and if i didnt id be all right so much for the solidarity of the proletariat bauer observed and martin felt himself flush bauer went on but if they didnt get you in the first round of firings how do you know they wouldnt the next time because there will be a next time chester sure as youre standing there a next time martin scowled hadnt thought of that bet youre right though who would have thought a loan the russians couldntor maybe wouldntpay back would cause all this trouble for want of a nail bauer said and then sighed were all going to be wanting nails before too long oh yeah chester said if were all going to be wanting nails how come theyre cutting back on how much steel theyre making because whether we want them or not we wont be able to afford them bauer answered of course we wont be able to afford them theyre cutting our hours bauers smile was full of anything but amusement welcome to the vicious circle that circle was anything but welcome to martin he hung around the party hall till he saw no one had any firm notion of how to respond to the bosses proposal for cutting hours no one could decide if it was good because it saved jobs or bad because it cut pay martin concluded the proposal would probably go forward strong opposition from the workers might have stopped it if they couldnt decide whether it was good or bad they would find out by experimenton themselves he rode the trolley back to the flat he shared with rita his own mood was glum or worse than glum hed told albert bauer the exact truth if his hours and pay got cut to threequarters of what he had now the only thing that would keep him afloat was his wifes salary and rita seemed anything but happy when he came through the door after a perfunctory kiss she said orders have taken a real tumble since the market started going down nobody wants pipe any morenot new pipe anyway it was spring a bright spring the weather full of newpuppy warmth and hope ice walked chester martins back even so he tried to remember when hed known fear like this the roanoke front he shook his head that terror had been different and far more immediate fear of death and pain and mutilation this was something else fear of loss fear of hunger fear of endless misery without escape fear of bills fear of moving back in with his mother and fatherif this quiet creeping horror didnt lay hold of them too when martin laughed he might have been whistling while walking past a graveyard it was just a few weeks ago when we figured we could have any old thing we wanted he said and went on to tell rita about the companys plan to cut everybodys hours she listened to that her face getting longer and longer i know what i want she said i want us to keep our jobs thats what yeah he said quietly thats about what it boils down to isnt it its hard times when your neighbors out of work rita said its the end of the world when you are maybe if the government really had seized the means of production this wouldnt have happened chester said trying to make himself believe it he couldnt shaking his head he went on no they couldntve done it i dont think it would have meant real class warand it might not have helped what are we going to do rita asked what can we do hang on tight he said were still working were going to lose most of the stocks we bought though i hated answering the last margin callfelt like throwing money away and we probably wont be able to afford to answer the next one weve got each other were healthy rita sounded as if she was trying to reassure herself and not having much luck it cant get much worse chester said how could stocks go any lower than they have already theres got to be a floor somewhere yes but where rita asked and he had no answer he felt less ashamed of that than he might have otherwisefor no one else in the usano one else in the whole world by all the signshad any answer to it either no he wasnt ashamed but that didnt mean he wasnt frightened he went to work day by day having nothing else he could do before long his shift did go from eight hours to six his pay dropped by a quarter too he hated that but he supposed he would have hated being without a paycheck even more as long as rita had a job too they got by the market continued to sink reading the papers martin took occasional consolation in noticing richmond stocks had fallen even further than those on wall street did misery really love company he didnt know about that either what he did know was that every day there seemed to be more misery to go around people started telling stories about brokers jumping off bridges and diving out of windows nobody could say whether those stories were true people told them anyhow one day in the middle of june wall street stopped sinking it dove maybe brokers didnt but the market did the wave of sell orders overwhelmed the ticker tape it lagged ever further behind the tidal wave of disaster the last few shares chester had so proudly held on to went then on what the papers called swandive wednesday by that time hed almost stopped caring not till almost four hours after the market closed did the chattering tape finally spit out the last of the days losses when thursday dawned the market didnt open an eerie calm prevailed at the steel mill reminds me of the day after a big attack that didnt work martin said to albert bauer as they opened their lunch pails together bauer had been at the front too he nodded or maybe it did he said only we were on the receiving end he took a bite out of his cheese sandwich hed usually eaten bologna or pastrami before the market tumbled so had martin his sandwich had cheese in it too cheese was cheaper bauer went on president blackfords got almost four years left in his term but hes a lame duck already poor sorry son of a bitch hes doing everything he can chester said i like what he said in the paper this morning we have nowhere to go but up thats good he means it tooyou can tell oh yeah im not arguing with you bauer answered but even if things do go up what will people remember theyll remember how far down we went and who was in the powel house when we did come hell have democrats lined up six deep to run against him martin thought about that it made altogether too much sense to be comfortable well the class struggle takes a step back he said or probably takes a step back you never can tell not for sure want to bet bauer said im as good a socialist as any man around and ive got twenty bucks says therell be a democrat in powel house after the elections you wont get my twenty martin said wish i could but ritad kill meand i think id lose the dough times are tough enough without throwing it away of course by the time rolls around i might have forgotten who i made the bet with bauer said fat chance martin answered its not just that you wouldnt forget between now and then al its that you wouldnt let me forget who me bauer did his best to sound indignant come on eat up weve got to get back to it pretty goddamn quick right martin said tightly the company was also cracking down on people who violated its rules he didnt want to end up on the street six hours pay was better than none at all when he got home that night he found rita crumpled in tears on the sofa oh lord he said whats the matter sweetie he feared he knew the answer even without the question he had to ask and he was right they fired me his wife answered they told me to clean out my desk and not come back tomorrowthey cant afford to keep me any more ive been there seven years and they threw me out like a piece of dirt where am i going to go what am i going to do what are we going to do i dont know chester said dazedly so help me god i dont know in a few weeks theyd gone from having two paychecks to having threequarters of one that was bad enoughwas worse than bad enough but what was worse yet what was really terrifying was that compared to an awful lot of people they were still well off i n the terry times hadnt been good since the last hectic days of the great war back then with every white man possible at the front augustas negroes had filled factory jobs galore theyd made less money than the whites they were displacing but even that added up to more money than theyd ever seen in their lives till that time then the whites those whod lived came back and the factory jobs dried up people began living handtomouth again erasmus place was a case in point scipio would have thought a fish market and cafe in a poor part of town immune from anything so remote as a stockmarket panic after all the worst had happened in the terry a dozen years earlier hadnt it he would have thought that but he would have been wrong erasmus wrinkled face got longer with each passing day his grizzled hair got grayer too or so it seemed to scipio one morning while scipio washed the pile of breakfast dishes erasmus put his discontent into words they aint comin in aint that bad boss scipio said they aint comin where we get all these here dishes they aint comin erasmus repeated fore all this panic happen woulda been twice the dishes woulda been twice the money too he was right of course scipios denial meant very little erasmus place remained busy it wasnt packed not the way it had been before the market plunged scipio put the best face on things he could peoples bein careful wid dey money erasmus shook his head a month ago say people was bein careful with their money aint like that no more now what its like is folks who come here they aint hardly got no money to be careful with lotta white folks outta work scipio admitted bathsheba she done lost fo five cleanin jobs las few weeks de buckra aint got the money to give her here in the terry aint many of us works for our ownselves erasmus said we mostly works for the buckra almost like it was still slavery days if the buckra outta work we outta work on account of they cant afford to pay us no more how is i supposed to make money when there aint no money to make dunno scipio said he waved doin pretty good so far aint broke yet erasmus said dunno why not specially the way you eats he wagged a finger at scipio had scipio been white he would have turned red but taking meals at erasmus place was as much a part of what his boss paid him as the banknotes he got every friday it saved him money the way things were going the way bathshebas cleaning jobs were drying up he needed to save all the money he could and erasmus said not a word when he fixed himself a friedegg sandwich and a big plate of grits for lunch hed just finished when the first lunch customer came in a cleaning woman whose latest job had been close by the edge of the terry dont know how long i kin keep comin here she said as she took a bite out of a baconlettuceandtomato sandwich white folks is lettin people go aint got no money their ownselves sure aint got none to spend on cleanin their houses i seen that too scipio said my wife she done los half she people worlds a crazy place nowadays the woman said lady at the house i was at jus now her husband he been a whig forever an his daddy before him an his daddy before him she say he talkin bout votin freedom when the lections come round this fall i didnt say nothin you dont like to tell the lady whats payin you her husband aint got no brains she took another bite from his station in front of the stove erasmus said when the white folks see their money goin away some of em liable to do some crazy things how many of em do dem crazy things scipio wondered as he fetched the cleaning lady a cup of coffee we gwine have buckra in de streets yellin freedom again reckoned we was done wid dat god do what he want to do not what we wants him to do the cleaning woman said thank you kindly xerxes she added when scipio set the coffee on the table yous welcome he answered absently how many whites were losing their jobs or losing money he had no way of knowing not for sure more than a few though the stories in the constitutionalist made that very clear so did what was happening to the jobs of negroes who depended on whites for work how many of the whites who lost their jobs would start voting for jake featherston and his party scipio had no way of knowing that either not for sure but hed just heard of one and that was one more than he wanted to know about the cleaning lady gulped the coffee and got to her feet she left money on the tabletop and hurried away over her shoulder she said cant be late gittin back miz hutton i reckon she grab the first excuse she find to put me on the street dont aim to give her none out the door she went in a hurry because her tip was small a man who sold secondhand furniture across the street came in for some fried catfish as he ate he remarked had me a couplethree buckra come in the last few days aint seen none in a hell of a long time fore that buy anything scipio asked sure enough did the furniture dealer answered sold me a couple beds and a good chest o drawers good for you athenaeus erasmus said bout time i hear of somebody doin good right now fellas sellin new furniture theys the ones wouldnt be happy if they knowed athenaeus said white folks all say they look at the new stuff first but they cant afford it no way nohow so they come to me good to hear it scipio echoed as erasmus had said any news of success was welcome but athenaeus wasnt wrong what would the white furniture dealers whose goods hadnt sold think and it wasnt just what they would think what would they do what could any man do when he stared at bills and had no money to pay them would they put on white shirts and butternut trousers and start shouting freedom at the top of their lungs if they did could anybody blame them scipio nodded i can blame them he thought hearing inside himself the precise english he no longer dared speak loud i can blame them for the freedom party will not make their troubles disappear even if they think it will and what the freedom party will do to me and mine if ever it should come to power that fear had spread all through the colored communities of the csa in the early s and then receded as the partys fortunes ebbed now white men were seeing the confederate states could still know hard times what would that discovery that rediscovery mean for negroes here scipio didnt know he feared finding out try as he would though he saw no escape what kin we do he said aloud hoping one of the other men in the place would have a better idea than he did cant go nowheres aint noplace else wants us erasmus said not the usa thats for sure athenaeus agreed they dont like the niggers they got aint got very many an sure dont want no more stock market in de usa down de sewer too scipio said they aint got no money no spirit to help nobody else not when they got trouble helpin they ownselves good things theys down too you wants to know what i thinks athenaeus said if they was up they be lordin it over us they do that jus git more buckra listenin to jake featherston on the wireless and gittin all hot and bothered afterwards for a long time before the world finally went mad in respect for each others strength had kept the united states and confederate states from going to war scipio had never imagined mutual weakness could do the same but he couldnt deny athenaeus had a point it wasnt one hed thought of either empire of mexico mebbe he said but neither erasmus nor athenaeus paid much attention to that scipio couldnt take it seriously himself to a negro in eastern georgia the empire of mexico might as well have been on the dark side of the moon besides what were the odds that mexicans had any more use for negroes than white men did erasmus asked a more immediately relevant question fore long some black folks gwine start runnin out o money what happen to em they git hungry athenaeus said church help some scipio said church be swamped erasmus said scipio nodded by all the signs that would come true and soon his boss went on aint no use waitin fo the gummint to do somethin wait till judgment day gummint wont do nothin fo no niggers fore long some white folks starts runnin out o money and gettin hungry too athenaeus said plenty po buckra they aint hardly better offn niggers gummint worry bout the buckra first you wait an see whats a po nigger gwine do erasmus asked starve the word hung in the air scipio had known a lot of hungry people during the war hed been hungry himself after the confederates destroyed the congaree socialist republic but there was a difference between being hungry and starving he tried to imagine thousands maybe tens of thousands of negroes and whites too going without because they had no money with which to buy food outside the sun shone brightly the day was hot and muggy it would stay hot and muggy from now all the way till fall even so scipio felt a chill this was liable to be a disaster of biblical proportions what kin we do athenaeus asked mournfully what kin anybody do pray erasmus answered god done made this happen he kin make us come through it too so long as he take it in his mind he want to do dat amen athenaeus said scipio made himself nod he didnt want to seem out of placeseeming out of place was one of his greatest fears because it was deadly dangerous but if god had really wanted to do something about this disaster couldnt he have stopped it in the first place more we pray more he gonna know how much we loves him erasmus said along with being a believer though he was a relentlessly practical man he went on course we gots to work hard too god aint never gonna pay no heed to nobody who dont work hard scipio would have bet hed say that erasmus not only believed in the virtues of hard work he practiced what he preached scipio himself was sure it couldnt hurt what he wasnt sure of was how much it could help s omething was wrong in salt lake city colonel abner dowling shook his head something was always wrong in salt lake city it wouldnt have been the place or the sort of place it was if something hadnt been wrong all the time but something now was different anything different in salt lake city automatically roused dowlings suspicions as far as he could tell different and dangerous were two sides of the same coin ill tell you what it is sir captain angelo toricelli said go ahead angelo dowling urged tell nobodys building anything thats what his adjutant said its quieter than it ought to be slowly dowling nodded youre right ill be damned if youre not right it isnt on account of theyve got everything rebuilt either still plenty of wreckage lying around yes sir captain toricelli agreed but an awful lot of money that would have paid for more construction all of a sudden isnt thereits gone dowling nodded again he gave toricelli a sidelong glance fortunately his adjutant didnt notice the way the younger man watched every penny he might have been a jew not an italian dowling didnt want toricelli to know he was thinking that he didnt want to insult his adjutant and everybody had to pay special attention to money these days because it was so very thin on the ground with a sigh dowling said not much we can do about it at least weve got the army paying our salaries yes sir and im damn glad of it too toricelli answered i just got a letter from new york from home my brotherinlaws out of a job whats he do dowling asked he reads x rays sirwent to night school to learn the trade toricelli said not without pride my sister and heve got five children and another one on the way i dont know what theyll do if he doesnt find something quick i hope he does dowling said on the whole sincerely who would have thought the bottom could drop out of things so fast nobody captain toricelli answered but it has he was right about that too the army censored salt lake city papers pretty hard pain came through their pages even so stories of halfdone buildings abandoned of banks going under of people losing jobs couldnt very well be prettied up and the only way to leave those stories out of the newspapers would have been to have no papers at all captain toricelli touched a fat document on his desk dont tell me what that is dowling said let me guess another normalization petition right the first time his adjutant said its not as though i havent seen enough of them dowling said every few months the mormons of salt lake cityand the occasional gentile toowould circulate petitions asking that utah finally be treated like any other state in the usa dowling had got a couple of dozen since coming to the state capital with a sigh he went on they still havent figured out im not the one they ought to send these to because i have no authority to grant them they should go to general pershinghes supreme commander of the military district a thoroughly precise man toricelli said he hasnt got authority to grant them either only the president and congress can do that what do you think the chances are dowling asked better than decent if the mormons can keep their noses clean captain toricelli answered the socialists seem to want to do it i know dowling packed a world of meaning into two words they think a zebra can change its stripes the way the one in that englishmans fable did i think he shook his head what i think doesnt matter i dont make policy i just get stuck with carrying it out he picked up the petition it was a hefty one it had to weigh a couple of pounds ill take this to general pershings office if you like oh you dont need to do that sir toricelli said its not important i can fetch it next time i go over there im on my way dowling said better pershings adjutant should have it on his desk than you on yours he caught toricellis eye they shared a slightly conspiratorial chuckle thank you very much sir the young captain said youre welcome abner dowling answered ive got to go over there and talk with the general about his scheme for mounting better guard on temple square we need to do it every broken rock from the temple and the tabernacle counts for a sacred relic with the more radical mormons these days yes sir toricelli said but theres a certain problem in shooting anybody who bends to pick up a pebble in the square too a certain problem yes dowling agreed and thats what ive got to talk to general pershing about how do we keep the mormons from getting symbols of revolt without provoking them and ruining what ever bits of goodwill weve managed to build up since the war ended im sure i dont know sir his adjutant replied i hope you and the commanding general can find a way so do i cant hope for much in the way of normalization if theyre still picking up broken rocks and dreaming of treason dowling tucked the petition under his arm and strode down the hall to his superiors office he took no small pleasure in dropping the document on pershings adjutants desk and in watching the papers already there jump as it thudded home thank you so much sir pershings adjutant a major named fred corson said with a sickly smile the general is waiting for you he sounded reluctant to admit even that much to dowling hello colonel general pershing said when dowling walked in a grin spread across his bulldog features was that the thump of a normalization petition i heard just then it certainly was sir dowling answered well ill forward it to philadelphia the commandant said thats my duty and there that petition will sit till the end of time along with all the others unless the socialists decide to grant them all that is dowling said yes unless in that case colonel you and i will both need new assignments because normal states dont have soldiers occupying them part of me wont be sorry to get away pershing rose from behind his desk and went over to the window not far away he looked at his fortified headquarters and at salt lake city beyond part of me though will regret leaving this state because im convinced that no matter what this administration may believe utah isnt ready for normalization as a matter of fact here we abner dowling heard a distant pop it might have been a motorcar backfiring or a firecracker going off it might have been but it wasnt at the same instant as he heard it or perhaps even a split second before the window in front of which general pershing was standing shattered pershing made a surprised noise that was the best way dowling could have described it it didnt hold much pain before dowling fully realized what had happened the military commandant of the state of utah crumpled to the carpet in front of him general pershing dowling whispered he hurried over to the fallen man he needed a moment to add two and two together only when he saw the neat hole and the spreading bloodstain in the middle of pershings chest did he fully understand what he was seeing general pershing he said sharply this time he grabbed for pershings wrist and felt for a pulse he found none aside from that the sudden sharp stink in the room told him what he needed to know pershing had fouled himself when the bullet struck home thinking of a bullet made dowling think of the man whod fired it he peered out through the shattered window the us perimeter around the headquarters ran out for several hundred yards the gunman must have shot from well beyond it which meant he had to be a brilliant sniper in warravaged utah that was anything but impossible as colonel dowling knew all too well only while dowling was shouting for pershings adjutant did he pause to wonder whether the sniper was still out there peering through a telescope on his springfield and waiting for another shot he was at the moment too shocked too stunned to worry about it major corson hurried in in his outer office he hadnt even heard the gunshot dowlings shouts were what drew him oh jesus christ he said which summed it up as well as anything is he he couldnt bring himself to say the word dowling did hes dead all right he dropped down like somebody let all the air out of him he was dead before he hit the rugnever knew what hit him out on the perimeter soldiers had started shouting and pointing a couple of them started running dowling noted all that as if from a very great distance in one sense whether they caught the sniper mattered a great deal in another sense it hardly mattered at all the damage was done and more than done pershings adjutant saw the same thing he got the truth into four words so much for normalization yeah dowling said we just went back to square one sir youre senior officer in the state right now corson said dowling nodded the city commandants in both provo and ogden were lieutenant colonels pershings adjutant looked to him with desperate appeal in his eyes what are your orders youre in charge of utah god help you you poor sorry bastard dowling tried to pull himself together fetch a doctor it wont do any good but fetch him send men after that sniper he feared that wouldnt do any good either but he had to try call the president and the war department in that order let them know whats happened after that we close salt lake city down we take hostages we do whatever we have to do to let the mormons know that if they want to play rough were going to play ten times rougher have you got that yes sir major corson answered he saluted and hurried away leaving dowling alone with general pershings body if the mormons want to play rough well play ten times rougher dear god in heaven had he really said that he nodded he had and in saying it hed sounded a great deal like general george armstrong custer he hadnt wanted to he hadnt intended to but he had all the same custer had rubbed off on him after all and if that wasnt a chilling thought if that wasnt a chilling thought maybe it was a reminder that custer for all his enormous flawsand nobody knew them better than dowling a general had no more secrets from his adjutant than a man from his valethad ended up the most successful soldier in the history of the united states i wont keep this command long dowling thought theyll bring in someone with stars on his shoulder straps as fast as they can meanwhile though it was his he had to do the best job he could while it remained his a doctor dashed into pershings office little black bag in hand what do you need colonel he asked not me major dowling answered its general pershing whos dead along with any hope for peace in utah for god only knows how long j ake featherston strode through the streets of richmond his bodyguards surrounding him front and back left and right he moved swiftly and confidently and with such abrupt decision that his turns would sometimes take even the alert guards by surprise so theyd have to scramble to stay with him richmond was not the city it had been before the war by now ten years after the confederate states had yielded to the united states almost all the damage from us bombing aeroplanes had been repaired even so something was missing from the citys heart before the great war everybody in richmond had known the csa sat on top of the world nowadays nowadays richmond felt poor and shabby everything looked gray it all needed cleaning up hosing down painting nobody bothered to give it any such thing and the people seemed as gray and grimy and defeated as the town in which they lived jake had thought the same thing even before the stock market submerged but it was much more noticeable now he hurried past a man with shoulders slumped from lugging heavy sample cases to firms that werent buying that wouldnt have been buying if hed been selling gold for the price of lead that luckless drummer was a dead man walkingtill he saw jake he straightened up his eyes got back their spark freedom mr featherston he called freedom to you pal featherston answered hang on just remember well lick those bastards yet how the man asked what can we do same thing ive been saying all along jake told him first thing is weve got to get rid of the stupid bastards who landed us in this mess in the first place they arent fit to carry guts to a bear but theyve been running this countryand running it straight into the groundever since the war of secession that means the politicians and the bonehead generals in the war department sounds good to me sounds mighty damn good to me the salesman said what else got to pay back the niggers featherston said got to get strong again so we can look the usa in the eye again got to get strong so we can spit in the usas eye too if we ever have to how do you like that me i like it fine the man said you go on and give em hell just what i intend to give em but ill need your help buddy remember vote freedom come november weve got to get this country on its feet again ive been saying that for years now maybe people will start paying attention to me he walked on leaving the drummer with a last freedom freedom the fellow echoed back in the middle of the s that luckless drummer had probably been comfortable enough to vote whig bad times made the freedom party grow featherston knew as much he looked around hed seen plenty of bad times right after the war when the money went down the toilet this this felt worse this felt as if the confederate states were closing down one store one factory at a time and might never open for business again freedom somebody else calleda woman her voice high and shrill with worry freedom dear jake told her everythings going to be just fine he waved and kept going during the war hed usually had a pretty good notion of whether the troops in front of him would succeed in an attackor later if they would succeed in holding back the damnyankees when they attacked now after years wandering in the wilderness he felt things in his own country turning his way again shame it took a panic and a crash to do it he thought but thats the way it goes sometimes if you dont grab with both hands when you get the chance you deserve what ever happens to you he intended to grab what ever the times gave him hed had one chance and seen it go glimmering god damn you to hell and gone grady calkins that had been the first time hed wondered if he would ever see another now here it was again if he could make it so he and his escorting guards rounded a corner one of them pointed up grace street toward capitol square look at that boss he said isnt it a shame and a disgrace its a judgment on the damn whigs thats what it is jake answered back just after the great war ended capitol square had been full of soldiers fresh out of the army theyd had nowhere to go and nothing to do so theyd camped there many of them still with their weaponsenough to make the police leery of trying to clear them out anyhow even though theyd rioted more than once now tents and shanties sprouted in the square once more jake didnt know who all was in them some veterans certainly but some men who werent and a lot of women and kids too people whod lost jobs and lost their homes or couldnt pay the rent on a flat any more where else were they going to go again the police were going easy on them clearing them from the shantytown by force would have made dreadful headlines another guard said those people shouldnt ought to be in a mess like that aint their fault not most of the time but that aint the only shantytown in the country neither damn right it aint joe featherston agreed theres one outside of every town in the csa and youre rightmost of the people in em are decent hardworking folks whore just down on their luck he slapped joe on the back hard enough to stagger him and ill be go to hell if you didnt just give me next weeks wireless talk on a silver platter by then going into the studio was second nature for him when the red light came on he rasped out the greeting hed been using for years this is jake featherston of the freedom party and im here to tell you the truth inside the glassedin room next to the studio the engineers nodded at himeverything was going the way it should and his words were going out to far more people in the csa than they had a few years before a whole web of stations a nationwide web was getting this broadcast now it went everywhere from richmond to miami to deep in sonora and stations near the postwar usimposed border beamed it up into kentucky and houston and sequoyah truth is jake went on all across our country people are losing their jobs truth is all across our country theyre losing their homes truth is all across our country theyre trying to get by in shacks and tents a godfearing dog wouldnt want to live in and the truth is my friends the whig party doesnt care he banged his fist down on the table hard enough to make papers jump in front of himbut not hard enough to make them fall off or to tip over the microphone hed had practice with that thump so help me god friends that is the truth im ashamed to say it about anybody in these confederate states but it is what are the whigs doing to help these folks get new jobs nothing what are the whigs doing to help em hang on to their houses nothing what are the whigs doing to keep em from starving nothing one more time thats not the governments job is what they say well friends im going to tell you something the whigs proved how useless they were two years ago when the big floods came did they do anything much for the poor suffering people in tennessee and arkansas and mississippi and louisiana did they in a pigs ear they did they patted em on the head and said sure wish you good luck yallll be just fine were they just fine you know bettern i do ill tell you something else too this here panic this here crash is dragging more people under than mother nature ever dreamt of doing and thats happening all over the confederate states not just in the mississippi valley god help us all theres a shantytown in capitol square here in richmond the fat whig congressmen could look out their windows and see the poor hungry folks they could but they dont on and on he went finishing two years ago the supreme courtthe bought and paidfor supreme courtsaid burton mitchel could run for president again well he did and he got himself elected again too and now were all paying for it so if you want things to work again if you want us to be strong again if you want to tie a can to the whigs tailand to the supreme courts tail tooif you dont want to have to live in a shack like a nigger cottonpicker vote freedom in november god bless you all and thank you kindly the lead engineer drew a finger across his throat the red light in the studio went out jake featherston leaned back in his chair then gathered up his papers and left the small soundproofed room saul goldman the station managed waited in the hallway that was a strong speech mr featherston a very strong speech he said lets hope it does some good jake answered ive heard a lot of your speeches the past few years mr featherston goldman said i think this one will sway people especially with things the way they are yeah especially featherston said i think this onell do some good too high time people got the wool pulled away from over their eyes high time they see you dont have to be a whig to run the country high time they see wed be better off with people who arent afraid to get their hands dirty who arent afraid to pitch right in and do what needs doing weve got to fix things we cant go on like this no goldman shook his head times are very hard he risked a smile at jake you should be glad you have a job i am jake said ive had a job ever since the war ended to see the confederate states back on top its taken me a long time to start doing that job but i think my hours coming round at last i think you may be right the station manager agreed if not now when will it come if not now will it ever come but jake featherston pushed that thought to the back of his mind as he did whenever it cropped up he couldnt afford to doubt and so he didnt im going to tell you something mr goldman he said this here station and the web youve set up have done the freedom party a hell of a lot of good we dont forget our enemies everybody knows that but we dont forget our friends either youll see thank you goldman said that i should be your friend surprises me weve had that talk before a long time ago but thank you thank you very much it has passed over me whats that featherston asked the jew only shrugged and changed the subject jake didnt push it he had other things to worry about the world wasnt his as he thought it should be but now at least he had the hope it was going his way w hen jefferson pinkard opened his pay envelope at the sloss works he discovered it contained a pink slip along with his salary his curses were soft and bitter and heartfelt i shouldve stayed in mexico by god he said if id known the company was going to treat me like a nigger i wouldve the paymaster a grayhaired man named harvey gordon had known pinkard since before the great war he shook his head you never should have gone to mexico in the first place you forfeited all the seniority you had now theyre treating you like a new hire im sorry as hell jeff but thems the rules fuck the rules pinkard said how am i gonna eat gordon didnt answer that it wasnt a question that had an answer except maybe god knows if god did know he hadnt bothered telling jefferson davis pinkard get moving the fellow in line behind him said dont hold up the works fuck you too jeff answered hoping for a fight he didnt get one only a stony glare muttering under his breath he strode out of the steel mill wont be coming back either he thought aint that a son of a bitch he wondered where he would live too a fired man had two weeks to leave company housing if he didnt go after that theyd pitch his belongings out of his cottage and onto the sidewalk at least the yellow clapboard house he had now was a long way from the one hed shared with emily back in happier times how can i afford a new place if i just got fired it was a good question again he wished he had a good answer for it he wished he had any answer at all inside the cottage he had a cheap iron bed and a cheap iron stove an icebox a rickety table and one chair a furnished room would have had more in it he didnt want to think about a room thinking about one reminded him he didnt know what hed do when they threw him out of here he made a mess of bacon and eggs for supper hed had them for breakfast too he was no kind of cook he never had been he did a tolerable job on bacon and eggs most of the time hed started getting sick of them but he did so few things well he didnt have much choice when he went to bed that night he set the alarm clock forgetting he wouldnt need to get up the next morning the clock was cheap too its tinny jangle jolted him awake he was dressed and eating breakfastbacon and eggs yet againbefore he realized he had nowhere to go shit he said without originality but with great feeling that morning was one of the strangest of his life he sat on the one chair in the cottage and watched men streaming toward the sloss works and others coming off the night shift he could have been one of them up till the day before he had been one of them now he felt as far apart from them as a prisoner of war did from his army he didnt go to work there not any more after a while the two streams of men stopped everything grew quiet wives came out of the cottages to shop or gossip with the neighbors children headed for school the ones too little to go to school played in front of their houses all that had gone on for years while he worked at the steel mill but hed seen it only when he was too sick to go in now he felt fine except for being sick of bacon and eggs but he had nowhere to go he started to read a magazine a pulp called aeroplane adventures some of the tales in it were set in the great war others afterwards it was printed in richmond all the war stories had confederate pilots gunning down yankees or englishmen knocking german aeroplanes out of the sky the later tales were set in the confederate west or in odd corners of the world aeroplane adventures had sat on the kitchen table for more than a week without his looking at it hed been too tired to read when he came back from the sloss works now with nothing else to do he went through the magazine twice a young texan from a town called cross plains had written an exciting story about the air war over west texas where jeff had served the fellow had a few details wronghe hadnt been old enough to see combatbut he could tell a tale the other pieces were much less memorable jeff started the magazine for a third time late that afternoon but set it aside instead he wished he had a wireless set to make time pass more quickly but then he brightened freedom party meeting tonight he said the first words hed spoken since the morning as hed forgotten to leave the alarm alone hed almost forgotten the weekly meeting when the time came he put on a white shirt and butternut trousers and hurried to the trolley stop where he could ride into central birmingham crickets chirped lightning bugs winked on and off on and off the trolley stop was crowded several men had on the same kind of outfit as jeff freedom one of them said freedom jeff echoed when was the last time you went to a party meeting clem been fourfive years the other steelworker answered i didnt reckon it was on the right track now im wondering if maybe i was wrong wont hurt none to come and find out you stopped coming to meetings for a while too jeff another man said pinkard shook his head not me not like you mean anyhow i never walked away from the party what i did was i went down to the empire of mexico oh said the fellow whod brought it up he said not another word after that anybody whod fought in mexico took the freedom party and its business very seriously indeed the trolley rolled up then clanging its bell the men bound for the freedom party meeting climbed aboard with everyone else at the stop pinkard threw a dime in the fare box he hadnt worried about money since coming back from mexico not while hed had work but now without it those ten cents suddenly seemed to loom as large as ten dollars would have and here was the old livery stable again the smell of horses fainter than ever but still there here were the old folding chairs even more battered than they had been before hed headed south here was the rostrum at one end of the hall and the stars and bars and confederate battle flag on the wall behind it the two flags hadnt changed they still carried the stars representing kentucky and sequoyah though the states lay under us occupation the meeting was crowded that steelworker wasnt the only man returning after a long absence and there were faces jeff had never seen before some of them belonging to men surely too young to have fought in the great war jeff recognized the way those men bore themselves stiff with a special nervous sort of dignity he carried himself the same way it was the distinctive posture of men whod lost their jobs but didnt want the world to know somebody swigged from a bottle of homebrew pinkard grinned to see that some things hadnt changed alabama remained dry but the police had never come around trying to enforce the temperance laws at a party meeting they had to know they would have had a fight on their hands if theyd been so rash he found a chair and sat down hed sat right about here he remembered when hed got up and pushed past grady calkins on his way out of one meeting people had still sat on hay bales in those days not folding chairs he cursed under his breath calkins a freedom party man had done more to hurt the party by turning assassin than all its enemies put together caleb briggs stepped up onto the rostrum and took his place behind the podium the dentist looked out over the crowd and called freedom freedom people shouted back briggs cupped a hand behind one ear i cant hear you freedom this time the yell shook the rafters thats better briggs nodded good to see some old familiar faces back with us again nice to know yall have seen the light one more time and youre welcome we wish youdve stayed with us all along but its good to have you back and how many folks are here for the very first time several men raised their hands briggs nodded again good to see new blood too we need you we need everybody for years and years now weve been telling anyone whod listen that the confederate states were going over a cliff not enough people did listen and over we went dammit now weve got to get back up again and we need help weve got to fight for what we believe in you new men are you ready to do that yes sir the newcomers chorused jeff wondered whether they knew briggs meant it literally if they didnt theyd find out sure enough the dentist said youll have your chance i promise you well set this country to rights yet maybe people are starting to see whats wrong in richmond about time and if we have to knock a few heads together or more than a few to get things going again well do it thats all you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs thats right pinkard said you bet thats right if you arent afraid to get blood on your clothes you dont belong here remember the stuff washes out with plenty of cold water it sure does briggs turned his attention to pinkard did i hear right that the sloss works flung you out yes sir you did jeff knew a certain amount of pride that the birmingham head of the freedom party kept such close tabs on him you know of any other outfit that wants a man whos been on the casting floor since before the great war id be much obliged nooo briggs said slowly but dont i remember right that when you were down in mexico you were the fellow who ran a prisoners camp for the rebels maximilians boys caught yeah that was me pinkard answered what about it ill tell you what about it i happen to know the birmingham city jails looking for an assistant jailer if you want the job fellow you ought to talk to is named albert sidney griffith over in city hall hes a party man too let him know who you are and what you did down in mexico tell him to give me a telephone call if hes got any questions ill set him straight my lord jeff whispered hed had hope machinegunned with the pink slip in his pay envelope now suddenly it lived again tears stung his eyes god bless you sir thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart caleb briggs waved that aside dont you worry about it pinkard dont you worry one little bit this here is the freedom party remember we arent the whigs or the radical liberals we take care of our own youve been a good party man for a long time we owe you for that and we pay our debts we pay em to our enemies and we pay em to our friends ill see this griffith fellow first thing in the morning jeff said with the chance of work ahead of him he felt like a new man and the new man was every bit as loyal to the freedom party as the old one had been this is the best outfit in the world he exulted briggs smiled and nodded damn right it is americanempire thecentercannothold xi h ipolito rodriguez had never thought about what a stockmarket crash could do to the town of baroyeca and to the silver mine in the hills on which the town depended for its existence just because he hadnt thought about such things though didnt mean they werent real the mine shut down in september a few days later the railroad stopped coming into baroyeca a good thing we got the stove when we did his wife said when he brought that news home it would take a lot longer to come here now si magdalena he said everything will take a lot longer to come here now the town is liable to dry up and blow away and then what will become of the farms all around it we go on and do as we always did magdalena answered we stay on our land and mind our own business but we cant make everything here rodriguez said if the general store closes life will get very hard how can the general store close magdalena said everyone around here goes to it senor diaz is a rich man how rich will he be if he has to ship everything into baroyeca by wagon or by truck rodriguez asked i dont know how much that costs but i know it costs a lot more than the railroad now you worry me magdalena said i think you did that on purpose as a matter of fact yes he replied im worried myself i didnt want to be the only one oh shed been making tortillas after rubbing cornmeal off her hands and onto her apron she gave hipolito rodriguez a hug who would have thought it could be this bad who indeed he answered up till now we complained that things that happened in richmond didnt matter one way or the other here in sonora and that nobody back there cared about us his laugh rang bitter now things that happened in richmond and in new york city matter very much here and madre de dios but i wish they didnt magdalena nodded how do these things work out like this you go to the meetings of the partido de la libertad what do they say there do they know can they make it better what can they do now he asked in return the president is a whig most of the senators and congressmen are whigs the freedom party can only protest what the whigs do and the whigs dont do much they dont seem to know what to do they are fools hed always thought the whigs were fools even before sonora started electing men from the freedom party to congress the state had sent radical liberals off to richmond if the freedom party had power what would it do magdalena asked put people to work rodriguez answered at once make sure they stayed at work make the country strong again tell the united states to leave us alone and be strong enough to make sure the united states did it take back the states the usa stole from us in the war the only time hed ever seen men from the united states was during his service in the confederate army during the great war the soldiers from the usa had done their best to kill him and had come alarmingly close more than once a lot of the westtexas prairie where hed fought was now included in the us state of houston it was as if the usa were mocking all his effort all his courageyes and all his fear too anything he could do to pay back the united states of america he would do and do gladly noddingshe knew how he feltmagdalena said these things sound wonderful how will the freedom party make them happen why he hesitated then shrugged i dont know not exactly he admitted i dont think anyone knows but i do know they will work hard and try everything and i know they have no hope of helping the country if they arent in power the whigs have made too many mistakes its time for them to go robert quinn the freedom party organizer in baroyeca had said that very thing in his accented spanish hipolito rodriguez didnt mind that he spoke the language like a man whose first language was english that quinn spoke spanish at all mattered to the farmer it told him the freedom party was serious about winning followers in baroyeca in all of sonora the whigs never had been even the radical liberals had worried about the big men the rich men first and had expected them to bring the campesinos into line it had worked for many years too but no more when you vote freedom you know the party cares rodriguez said nobody else does not like that but the election is still more than a month away magdalena said what can the party do in the meantime what can anyone do ifthe blessed virgin forbid itthe general store closes its doors she crossed herself i dont know rodriguez answered i dont think anyone knows as long as we have enough water to keep the corn and beans growing and the livestock healthy we can go on his wife said life may be hard but life has been hard before we will get through till it is better again i hope so rodriguez said hed got used to being a fairly prosperous farmerprosperous by the standards of southern sonora at any rate hed seen just enough of the rest of the confederate states to have a suspicion bordering on certainty that prosperity here was something less than it might have been elsewhere in the country as a measure of that prosperity magdalena had a treadlepowered sewing machine shed bought it secondhand from a woman in baroyeca whod got a better machine but even secondhand it was a status symbol for a farmers wife it also let her get more work done faster than she could have managed without it with six children to be clothed that was no small matter a few days after rodriguez came back from baroyeca the needle in the sewing machine broke like any farmer he was a good handyman fixing anything that small and precisely made though was beyond him you have to go back into town magdalena told him i have half a dozen pairs of pants to make you dont want the boys to run around naked do you ill go he said give me the broken needle so i can be sure im getting the matching part there are as many different kinds as there are different sewing machines and you would have something to say to me if i brought back the wrong one now wouldnt you maybe not his wife answered maybe id just think youd spent too much time in la culebra verde before you tried to buy the right one i dont know what youre talking about rodriguez said with dignity magdalena laughed so raucously she distracted miguel and jorge enough to make them stop wrestling for a little while with that laughter still ringing in his ears hipolito rodriguez set out for baroyeca the next morning when he got there he made sure he bought the sewingmachine needle first magdalena would never have let him live it down if after all his care he came back with the wrong one the general store remained open rodriguez was astonished to discover that a packet of three needles cost only eight cents the machine when magdalena bought it had come with the one that had just broken and no others i expected they would be much more he told jaime diaz as the proprietor took his money then i will gladly charge you twice as much diaz said one way or another i have to make some money with the mine closed i dont know how im going to do it and the railroad too how will i get supplies i dont know rodriguez answered in a low voice my wife and i were talking about this if you dont how will baroyeca go on i have no answers the storekeeper said every day i keep hoping things will get better and every day they get worse be thankful you live on a farm its not so bad for you for anyone who has to get things from other places every day he shook his head what can you do rodriguez asked what can anyone do no one can do anything diaz replied no one can do anything to make things better i mean thats what makes this whole business so dreadful my friend the whole world is broken and no one has the faintest idea how to fix it hipolito rodriguez hadnt thought of the collapse in those terms hed thought about what it meant to baroyeca to sonora and to some degree to the confederate states the world that was too much for him to grasp he said senor diaz i know the man who can set things right who is that then diaz said in the name of god and the blessed virgin tell me if anyone can make the mine open and the train come back to baroyeca i will bless him with all my heart in spite of his talk of the world most of his thoughts stayed close to home too such is life for most men jake featherston of the freedom party thats who rodriguez said they can make the country strong again and if we are strong how can we help being rich again too rich i dont care about rich all i care about is having the money to go on from day to day the storekeeper said he was polite enough to understate what he had and what he wanted rodriguez nodded polite enough to accept the understatement for what it was diaz went on i dont know about the freedom party either he drummed his fingers on the countertop behind which he stood but the whigs have no notion what to do a blind man could see that and the radical liberalshe smiled a wry smilewhat have they ever been good for but making faces at the whigs so maybe just maybe you could be right i think so rodriguez said when did you ever see the whigs or even the radical liberals with a headquarters here in town the freedom party has one and robert quinn even learned spanish to get us to join the party when have the others cared so much about us a point diaz admitted quinn buys from me everyone who actually lived in town bought from him what other choice did people have again he was polite he continued he always pays his bills on time i will say and he never treats me like a damn greaser the rest of the conversation had been in spanish he used english for those two words rodriguez nodded a sour smile on his face hed also heard those english words more often than he ever wanted to he said you see they speak english but they dont look down their noses at sonorans if they can manage that i think they can manage the whole country i hadnt thought of it in that way diaz said maybe youre right it could be so i really think it is rodriguez said look at the mess the other parties have got us into doesnt the freedom party deserve the chance to get us out the storekeeper didnt say no rodriguez added the clincher and the election is coming up soononly a little more than a month to go a nne colleton drove a fiveyearold birmingham down toward charleston shed finally sold the ancient ford shed acquired during the war after confederate soldiers confiscated her vauxhall she knew shed kept it longer than she should have as a reminder of those grim times but when she weighed sentiment against ever more cranky machinery sentiment came off second best the robert e lee highway was better going than it had been in those days it was paved all the way where long stretches of it had been only rutted dirt a lot more motorcars traveled up and down it too and nowadays the bodies of hanged negro reds didnt dangle from trees by the side of the road shed seen plenty of them coming back from charleston to st matthews in shed been going to see a lover then she was going to see a lover now back then regardless of whether roger kimball had had a flat in charleston rather than being on leave from the navy not even anne radical as shed reckoned herself would have dared park her motorcar in front of the building where he lived that would have meant scandal theyd always met in hotels in charleston in richmond down in georgia times had changed much of what had been radical was now taken for granted anne didnt think twice about leaving the birmingham in front of clarence potters block of flats or of knocking on his door inside the clattering of a typewriter abruptly stopped a mans voice kept on coming out of a wireless set potter opened the door he gave anne a quick kiss and said come in fix yourself a drink im almost done with this damn report pretty soon well find out how good the news is by his tone he didnt expect her to take good literally a heavy turnout is expected in todays congressional election the reporter on the wireless said as anne went into the kitchen to deal with whiskey and water and ice the whigs remain confident of holding their strong position in the house despite the unfortunate state of the economy and the typewriter started clacking again just then drowning out the rest clarence potter was far and away the most unusual man anne had ever met he not only believed she could take care of herself he encouraged her to do it hed never shown any interest what ever in running her life a thoroughly competent man he respected competence wherever he found it and seemed happy hed found it in her her whole life long shed fought against men who either tried to control her or simply assumed they would potter hadnt tried anne sometimes had trouble figuring out what to make of that drink in hand she came back into the front room do you want me to fix one for you too she asked he didnt expect her to fix drinks that no doubt was why she was willing to do it and he shook his head now lamplight glinted from the metal frames of his spectacles no thanks not yet let me finish up here i think ive figured out whos been lifting crates from lucas williamsons warehouse and how he can keep it from happening again concentration on his face he went back to typing you did remember to vote didnt you anne asked he nodded oh yes im not going to give the freedom party any help at all the whigs have done too much of that lately he went back to typing and might almost have forgotten anne was in the room with him she listened to the wireless the commentator kept on sounding optimistic about the whigs prospects she hoped he was right like clarence potter she hoped and believed two different things ten minutes later potter took the sheet of paper out of the machine there he said in his halfyankee accent laying it on a neat stack another weeks bills paid now i get to remember im a human being he went back into the kitchen and fixed a whiskey for himself raising it in salute he added its damn good to see you you know that always nice to have company on the deck as the ship goes down it wont be as bad as that anne said no indeed itll probably be worse potter looked out the window twilight was setting in pollsll close before long then well start getting returns and then well know how big a mess well have for the next two years to tell you the truth id almost sooner not find out would you rather stay here and stay in bed then anne asked the election will be what it is regardless of whether we go to whig headquarters after supper potter smiled but shook his head plenty of time for that afterwards i have this restless itch to know and it needs satisfying as much as any other urge all right and to annes internal surprise it was all right she knew clarence potter was interested shed had plenty of very pleasant proofs of that if he put business before pleasure well didnt she too im keeping company with a grownup she thought it was in her experience a novelty but one she didnt mind when they went out for supper she ordered a big plate of boiled shrimp they dont come fresh to st matthews she said no i suppose not potter agreed when i first moved here i remember thinking how wonderful all the seafood was hed chosen crab cakes for himself now unless people remind me about it the way you just did i take it for granted i shouldnt do that should i no anne said the whole countrys taken too many things for granted were liable to pay the price for it too he said that goes back a long way now you knowstarting when we took it for granted wed win the great war and be home to celebrate by the time the leaves turned red and gold the colored waiter brought their suppers as anne began to eat she said i took that for granted and i cant say otherwise you didnt did you nobut remember i went to yale i was there for four remembrance days i had a pretty fair notion of how desperately in earnest those people were we figured we could whip them they went out and made damn sure they could whip us he took a bite of crab cake nodded and went on in meditative tones weve always figured we could whip the freedom party too but the damnyankees arent the only people who are desperately in earnest thats what worries me well find out anne feared he might be right but didnt want to think about it not just then after they finished supper they walked over to the whig headquarters it lay only three or four blocks away even in november bugs still buzzed around street lamps somethinga bird a batswooped down grabbed one of them out of the air and vanished into darkness again when anne and clarence potter came into the headquarters they got their share and more than their share of suspicious looks anne had former freedom party ties that made people distrust her her companion didnt but he did have the unfortunate habit of saying exactly what he thought and that regardless of what the received wisdom was but then someone called out to them have you heard the news potter shook his head anne said no thats what we came here for whats the latest horatio standifer out in north carolina the man replied in congress since before the war but a freedom party man just did him in oh good god potter said if standifer lost his seat nobodys safe tonight and if nobodys safe tonight then god help the country tomorrow whats the news here in south carolina anne asked not as bad as that the whig said were going to lose the seat we picked up two years ago and maybe one more besides potter pointed at the blackboard on which new results were going up maybe two more besides looks like to me after a second look at the numbers the other whig scowled and nodded maybe two more besides he admitted and went off as if potter had some sort of contagious disease he does anne thought he tells the truth as he sees it and he pulls no punches such men are dangerous returns from georgia started coming and then tennessee and alabama the more of them there were the longer the faces at whig headquarters got people started slipping over to the saloon across the street some of them came back others didntthey stayed away and began the serious business of drowning their sorrows clarence potter didnt go each new seat lost to the freedom partyand those came in one after another with no possible room for doubt in most of thembrought not howls of dismay from him but rather a bitter smile he might have been telling the world i knew this was going to happen now here it is and what are you going to do about it no one in the whig headquarters seemed to have the slightest idea what to do about it except for the men who headed across the street to get drunk as anne watched the man she was with so he watched her too after a while he said its probably not too late for you you know what do you mean she asked though she had a pretty good idea and sure enough he said your politics arent that far from jake featherstons if you want to you can probably make your peace with him she wanted to haul off and slap him she wanted to but she couldnt for the same thought had crossed her mind he told her the truth as he saw it too still she said i dont know i turned him down once when he asked for money years ago he doesnt forget things like that potter laughed scornfully ill tell you what he wont turn down he wont turn down money if you give it to him now thats what anne wondered about that she decided potter was probably half right jake featherston might take her money if she offered it to him again but would he ever trust her ever let her have any real influence she had her doubts featherston struck her as a man whose memory for slights an elephant would envy casually clarence potter added if you do go back to him were through i dont know how much that means to you i hope it means something losing you would mean a lot to me but ive known featherston longer than any of the freedomshouting yahoos who go marching for him these days we arent on the same side and were never going to be what if he gets elected president anne asked a muscle jumped in his right cheek perhaps an inch below his eye no one ever went broke underestimating the stupidity of the confederate people but i still find that hard to imagineeven harder than it was in when he came so close and s still a long way away things are bound to look better by then he paused and sighed and the way you asked that question makes me wonder if we arent through anyhow up till now you never put any conditions on me anne said i liked it that you never put any conditions on me up till now i never imagined i needed to he answered but i cant put up with the freedom party im sorry but i cant dont you want revenge on the usa she asked i dont want anything that badly potter said anne sighed some things are worth any price he shook his head now she sighed its been fun clarence she said but ill do what i think i have to do and not what anyone else tells me to not ever no wonder i never got married she thought she walked out of the whig headquarters and back toward her motorcar k amloops british columbia was a long way from philadelphia and a long way from the confederate states too that didnt keep news from getting there about as fast as it got anywhere else though not in this age of telegraph clickers and wireless sets colonel irving morrell studied the confederate election returns with a sort of horrified fascination sweet jesus christ he said looking at the newspaper that had set them out in detail eryes sir his aidedecamp said and chuckled no offense lieutenant morrell said hastily just a manner of speaking oh yes sir i know that lieutenant ike horwitz answered youre not like that damn german sergeant who was tagging along with your buddy from the general staff over there i should hope not morrell set the paper on horwitzs desk but look at this for heavens sake look at this the freedom party went fromwhatnine congressmen to twentynine they won three governorships down there they took control of four state legislatures too and that means theyll start electing senators because their state legislatures still choose em they didnt switch to popular vote the way we did thats a big pickup no doubt about it horwitz leaned forward to study the numbers he looked up at morrell im awful damn glad im a jew in the usa and not a shvartzer in the csa a what morrell said and then he nodded making the connection from yiddish to german oh yeah i bet you are theres people here who dont like jewsplenty who feel just like that stupid sergeant horwitz said but it isnt all that bad hell even the presidents wifes jewish not that ive got any use for her politics or his if youre colored in the confederate states youve got to be shaking in your shoesif they let you have any shoes he was right morrell hadnt even wondered what the negroes in the csa felt about the election returns hed been dissecting he rarely thought about negroes what white man in the usa did maybe horwitz being a jew was more likely to look at other people who had a hard time in their homeland ill tell you what morrell said write me an appreciation of the confederate negroes likely response to this do a good job on it and ill forward it to philadelphia see if i can get you noticed thank you sir thats damn white of you his aidedecamp answered morrells own thoughts were on the more immediate any time the freedom vote goes up thats trouble for us because those bastards want another shot at the usa and featherstons boys havent seen numbers like these since i hope to heaven the president sits up and takes notice what do you think the odds are lieutenant horwitz asked do i look like a socialist politician to you id better not thats all ive got to say morrell replied they cut off confederate reparations early they havent been checking about rearmament near as hard as they should have theyve cut our budget he sighed they think everybody should just be friends i wish that would work i really do people vote for it horwitz said nobody wants to go through another war like the last one no of course not but both sides have to want peace you only need one to have a war and the only thing worse than fighting a war like that is fighting it and losing ask the confederates if you dont believe me i dont need to ask anybody horwitz said i can see that for myself anyone with a brain in his head ought to be able to see that for himself but what are we going to do thats the question all right morrell drummed his fingers on the desktop i dont know i just dont know half of those people who voted for featherstons gang of goons probably dont hope for anything but jobs and three square meals a day if he calls the shots they sure arent getting em with the folks theyve got running things now his aidedecamp smiled unhappily and isnt that the sad and sorry truth sir when i joined the army i never thought id be glad to be in for the food and for the roof over my head but thats how it looks nowadays if i were a civilian id probably be scuffling like everybody else good point morrell nodded were insulated from that anyhow thank god i suppose the socialists are doing everything they can there ike horwitz said grudgingly feeding people who are out of work and giving some of em makework jobsits not great god knows but its better than nothing you know what i mean i guess so morrell sighed if you give a man something for nothing though will he want to stand up on his own two feet again when times get better or will he keep wanting a handout for the rest of his life you ask me sir most people want to work if you give em the chance horwitz answered other thing is if they do starve talking about the rest of their lives starts looking pretty silly doesnt it and if theyre afraid theyre going to starve then what happens then they start voting for somebody like jake featherston in the usa right i suppose so morrell said again up till now his politics had always been firmly democratic hed never had to think about it he still didnt not really but hed never been a man to worry about subtleties either and now he wondered whether hed made a mistake youre saying the socialists are giving us a safety valve arent you i wouldnt have put it quite that way but yes sir i guess i am lieutenant horwitz answered if things blow up what have we got trouble nothing else but like any soldierand like anyone else with an ounce of sensehe was convinced staying out of trouble was a good idea a couple of days later morrell went into the town of kamloops to do some shoppingchristmas was coming and he wanted to buy some things for agnes and mildred that he couldnt hope to find at the post exchange the weather was crisp and chilly the sun shining bright out of a blue blue sky but not giving much in the way of warmth even so the reception he got in kamloops gave little in the way of warmth either here a dozen years after the end of the war the canucks cared for the greengray uniforms their occupiers wore no more than they had after the usa finally battered them into submission people on the streets turned their backs when morrell walked by most of them did anyhow hed got used to that what he hadnt got used to were the raggedlooking men who held out their hands and whined spare change pal and he especially hadnt got used to the respectablelooking men who held out their hands and said the same thing one of them added been a long time since my twin boys saw any meat on the table why dont you get a job then morrell asked why the man glared at him ill tell you why even though youre a damned fool to need telling because there damned well arent any jobs to get thats why lumber companies arent hiringthats what i got fired from farms arent taking on hired men not when they cant sell half the sheep and cows and wheat they raise even here in town only way you can keep your job is if youre somebodys brotherif youre just a brotherinlaw youre in trouble thats why you stinking yank well i asked him and he went and told me morrell thought he dug in his pocket and gave the canadian some coins here buddy good luck to you i ought to spit in your eye the hungry man told him hell of it is i cant ive got to tip my hathe didand say thank you sir on account of i need the money so goddamn bad never in all his days had morrell heard thank you sir sound so much like go to hell you son of a bitch and he discovered the problem that sprang from giving one beggar some money as soon as he did all the others became four times as obnoxious swarming around him and cursing him as foully as they knew how when he pushed past without doing for them what hed done for one of their fellows maybe they hoped theyd make him feel guilty all they really did was make him mad hed just shaken free of the crowd when a woman sidled up to him skirts were longer than they had been a couple of years before and the day wasnt warm but what she wore displayed a lot of her want a good time soldier she said three dollars she was skinny like any town with soldiers in it kamloops had its share of easy women but she didnt look as if shed been part of their sorry sisterhood for very long what did you used to do morrell asked quietly what difference does it make she answered whatever it was i cant do it any more do you want to go someplace no thanks he answered she cursed him too with a sort of dreary hopelessness that hit him harder than the anger the male beggars had shown even the storekeepers attitudes seemed different from the way they had before things went sour hed never seen men so glad to take money from him when he remarked on that the fellow whod just sold him a doll for mildred said you bet im glad youre only the second customer ive had today anybody with any money at all looks good to me right now how am i going to pay my bills if nobody buys anything from me and if i cant pay my bills what happens then do i end up out on the street i sure hope not later another shopkeeper said hate to tell you this but kamloopsd wither up and die if it wasnt for you yank soldiers they still pay you regular so you still have money in your pockets damn few folks do and youd better believe that a third man was even blunter if things dont turn around pretty quick what the hells going to happen to us morrell had to run the gauntlet of beggars once more on the way back to the us army base the men cursed him all over again this time for spending money on himself and not on them how would you like it if you were hungry one of them called after hima parting shot as it were it was a good question he had no good answer nobody wanted to be hungry he remembered that skinny woman nobody wanted to have to choose between whoring and starving but nobody seemed to have much of an idea how to make things better either morrell hurried home a troubled man j onathan moss was making a discovery as old as mankind that not even getting exactly what you thought youd always wanted guaranteed happiness when he thought about itwhich was as seldom as he couldhe suspected laura moss once laura secord was making the same unpleasant discovery i dont like the city she said one morning over a cup of tea jonathan preferred coffee which he brewed himself im sorry he answered not altogether sincerely i dont know how i could practice law from a farm he almost added in the middle of nowhere but let that go at the last possible instant he might as well have said it by her sour expression laura heard it even if it remained technically unspoken but everybody here loves the yanks and knuckles under to them she complained the first part of that wasnt even close to true as she had to know as for the second whether you like it or not dear the united states won the war moss pointed out lauras expression got unhappier yet out on her farm and even in arthurwhich was far enough off the beaten path for the american occupiers to pay little attention to itshed had an easier time pretending that blunt truth wasnt real here in berlin she couldnt ignore it us military courts here tried cases under occupation law soldiers in greengray uniforms were always on the streets even the newspapers she burst out they spell color color and labor labor not colour and labour thats how we spell them in the states moss said but this isnt the states its the province of ontario cant you leave even the kings english alone he finished his coffee at a gulp the king doesnt run things around these parts any more the united states do sweetheart i know you dont like it but that doesnt mean it isnt so carrying his cup over to the sink he went on im going to the office ill see you tonight all right she sounded almost as relieved to have him out of the apartment as he was to go with a sigh she added i dont know what im going to do around here though back on her farm finding ways to pass the time had never been a worry moss knew just enough of farm life to be sure of that if you werent busy every waking moment on a farm you had to be neglecting something it wasnt like that here in the city to moss that was one of the advantages of getting off the farm he wasnt sure laura saw things the same way before leaving he put on his overcoat and a fur hat with ear flaps that tied under his chin berlin ontario might be under us occupation but its winters remained thoroughly canadian moss had grown up in chicago hed thought he knew everything there was to know about nasty winter weather the war and coming back here afterwards to practice law had taught him otherwise only after he was out the door and going down the stairs to his elderly bucephalus did he realize he hadnt kissed laura goodbye he kept going his sigh was more glum than bemused for years he hadnt been able to get the idea of her out of his mind then when they finally did come together their lovemaking had been the most spectacular hed ever known and now they were marriedand he forgot to kiss her goodbye so much for romance he thought unhappily he got into the motorcar and turned the key hoping the battery held enough charge to start the car someone down the street was cranking an old ford most of the time a selfstarter was ever so much more convenient in weather like this though the bucephalus engine sputtered coughed and then came to noisy life moss let out a sigh of relief the motorcar would get him to the office which meant the odds were good it would get him home again too and then once he got home he would find out what new things laura had found to complain about he put the bucephalus in gear and pulled onto the street even though the engine hadnt had enough time to warm up only after the auto had started to roll did he wonder if he was running away from trouble well what if you are he asked himself its not as if you wont go back to it tonight not many motorcars shared the streets with the bucephalus considering the snow and the state of the machines brakes that might have been just as well moss saw one traffic accident with steam pouring from a shattered radiator and with two men in heavy coats standing there shouting at each other moss thought fewer automobiles were on the streets than had been the winter before he knew why too fewer people in berlin had jobs to go to than had been so the winter before that was true all over canada all over north america all over the world everyone hated it but no one seemed to have the faintest idea what to do about it two words painted on the side of a buildingyanks out before long somebody would come along and paint over them the canucks hadnt given up wanting their own country back the united states remained determined they wouldnt get it since the usa had the muscle the canadians faced an uphill fight as moss got out of the bucephalus a man in a ragged overcoat who needed a shave came up to him with a gloved hand out and said can you give me just a little money friend ive been hungry a long time now here you are moss handed him a quarter buy yourself something to eat the man took the coin he went down the street muttering something about a damned cheapskate yank jonathan moss sighed try as you would you couldnt win he had an electric hot plate in his office as soon as he got in he started perking more coffee not only would it help keep him awake it would help keep him warm even before the coffee was ready he got to work on the papers waiting for him on his desk hed won his name among the canadians of berlin for keeping the us occupiers off their backs as much as he could that brought him a fair number of cases to be tried in military courts it also brought him a lot of much more ordinary legal business most of his current case load involved bankruptcies so many of those were on his desk right now in fact that he thought of adding a slug of whiskey to the coffee he poured for himself maybe that would help him face the ruin of other mens hopes with something more like equanimity or maybe itll turn me into a drunk he thought and left the whiskey bottleit was only a pintin his desk drawer how many of those bankruptcies would have happened if the russians had managed to pay their loan to that austrohungarian bank moss didnt know not exactly the only sure answer that occurred to him was a lot fewer of course he was lucky he was still in business himself hed sold out when the stock market started dropping like a rock and had escaped before swandive wednesday the longer hed stayed in the worse hed have got hurt by ten oclock he was starting to come up for air in his paperwork that was when the door to his office opened and his first appointment of the day came in good morning mr harrison moss said getting up and leaning forward across the desk to shake hands what can i do for you today you can call me edgar for starters edgar harrison answered he was a short thin intenselooking man of about moss age the top half of his left ear was missing a war wound had the bullet that clipped him traveled a couple of inches to the right of its real course he would have died before he hit the ground as he sat down in the chair to which moss waved him he added its not like we havent worked together before no its not moss agreed harrison sailed as close to the wind as he could when it came to urging more freedom for the conquered canadian provinces hed spent time in jail not long after the great war ended moss thought hed been lucky not to get shot though hed never said that out loud care for some coffee he asked pointing to the pot on the hot plate edgar harrison shook his head nasty stuff never could stand it dont know how you yanks pour it down the way you do we manage moss said dryly and refilled his cup youve got something on your mindi can tell by your lean and hungry look such men are dangerous harrison said with a laugh how would you like to mount a court challenge to the whole rationale for the us occupation of canada how would i like it moss echoed personally id like it fine ill tell you straight out though youll lose occupation law says the us army can do whatever it has to in occupied territory and the constitution doesnt apply here i know that the canadians face clouded i dont see how i could help knowing it but thats what i want to challenge the notion that your fancy precious constitution shouldnt apply in canada dont we deserve the rule of law same as you yanks what you deserve and what youre going to get are two different things moss replied im sorry mr harrisonedgarbut i cant help you make that case i dont see any point to even trying to get a judge to hear it the law here isnt any different from the law in utah and thats part of the usa yes and you yanks were right on the point of letting it go back to being a regular part of the usa too harrison said we were moss said then that mormon murdered general pershing and now itll be another ten years before anybody so much as mentions making utah a normal state again nobodys murdered a military governor here harrison said that bomber tried whatever his name was moss answered he tried twice as a matter of fact and there was the uprising a few years ago he felt like fortifying this cup of coffee too but he wouldnt not with harrison watching im sorry whether youre right or wrong you havent got a chinamans chance of making an american court take you seriously edgar harrisons eyes were gray as iceand at the moment every bit as cold what will your wife say mr mosshe wouldnt use jonathans first name nowwhen she finds out you dont want to help us toward our freedom i hope shell say im the lawyer in the family and i know what im doing moss answered thats what i hope if she says anything else well thats between her and me wouldnt you agree that depends harrison said yes indeedthat depends moss looked at him mr harrison i think were done here dont you yes im afraid we are the canadian replied im sorry you turned out to be just another goddamn yank after all he got to his feet well we have ways of dealing with that too stung by the injustice of harrisons words moss exclaimed if it werent for me half the canucks in this town would be in jail or dead the other man paid no attention but turned on his heel and walked out the door only after he was gone did moss wonder if his words had been more than unjust he wondered if theyd held a threat c incinnatus driver didnt like having to start over as he approached middle age hed spent the years since moving up to des moines getting his hauling business up to the point where it made a pretty good living for him and his family hed sold the beatup old duryea truck hed driven to des moines from covington and bought himself a less beatup middleaged white a bigger more powerful machine and then luther bliss had lured him back to kentucky and thrown him into jail elizabeth had to sell the white to keep food on the table for his family and a roof over their heads cincinnatus had a little celebrity value when he got back thanks to that hed been able to get a new truckwell actually an old truck a ford that had seen a lot of better yearson credit for a negro that was something not far from a miracle hed kept up the payments too hed never been afraid of work if he had to get up before the sun rose and keep driving till long after it set he would do it without a word of complaint he had done it without a word of complaint and then the bottom fell out of the stock market all of a sudden fewer goods came into the railway yard fewer riverboats and barges tied up at the docks by the des moines river but just as many hauling companies and independent drivers like cincinnatus were fighting for less business one way to get it of course was to charge less for hauling if after that you worked more hours still you might make ends meet you mightprovided you didnt charge less than fuel and upkeep on your truck cost cincinnatusand everybody else who drove a truck in des moines and elsewhere in the countrycollided headon with that painful limitation what am i supposed to do he asked elizabeth one evening over supper what can i do cant charge less now dont make no money at all if i charge less dont make any money achilles said after so long in iowa hed lost a good part of the kentucky negro accent cincinnatus still kept and having entered his teens he was inclined to look on everything his father did with a critical eye he went on i know youre not ignorant pa but you sure do sound that way sometimes in another year or so he probably would have come right out and called cincinnatus ignorant cincinnatus knew it too he remembered the hellraiser hed been at achilles age this was what boys did when they started turning into men i cant help it son cincinnatus said now as mildly as he could i talk the way ive always talked dont know no other any other achilles broke in way to do it cincinnatus finished as if his son hadnt spoken and im talkin about important stuff with your ma stuff we got to talk about maybe your english teacher dont like the way we do itthis time he quelled achilles with a glancebut we got to hash it out just the same your pas right elizabeth said things aint easy her accent was thicker than her husbands but achilles held his peace she went on i aint been gettin so much in the way of housekeepers work lately neither dunno what we gwine do like your pa say dunno what we kin do government talks about them makework jobs for folks who cant get nothin else cincinnatus said achilles stirred not once but a couple of times but had the sense to keep his mouth shut maybe he does want to live to grow up cincinnatus thought aloud he went on trouble is i dont want one o them all i want is to go on doin what i been doin go on doin that and make a living at it elizabeth nodded i know she said she didnt say she wanted to go on cleaning other peoples houses and cincinnatus knew she didnt what she did say made a painful amount of sense we got to get the money from somewheres though i know cincinnatus said glumly i could look for something achilles said plenty of people hire kids nowadays because they can pay em less than grownups he was of course dead right cincinnatus shook his head even so aint gonna let you do that unless things get a lot worsen they are now first thing is you wouldnt bring in much money like you say and second thing is i want you to get all the education you can down the line thatll do you more good than anything else i can think of we aint in the confederate states no more no law against you goin out and gettin any kind o work youre smart enough to do theres even colored lawyers and doctors in the usa so there werea handful of each their clients were also colored almost exclusively cincinnatus didnt dwell on that he wanted his son ambitious as he was hed done as well as he could himself to have the hauling business maybe one of these days achilles would take over for him but maybe once the boy became a man he would want something morewant it and be able to get it so cincinnatus hoped anyway amanda said wish you waswish you were home more pa she corrected herself before her older brother could do it for her i wish i was too sweetheart cincinnatus answered after getting out of jail hed had to get to know his little girl all over again by the time he came home shed nearly forgotten him and hed found there was a great deal to like in her she had an even sweeter nature than elizabeths which was saying a lot but wishes and the real world had only so much to do with each other i dont work we dont eat simple as that wish it wasnt but it is it had always been as simple as that now though a new and dreadful simplicity threatened the old even if he worked as hard as he could as hard as was humanly possible they still might not eat that terrified him snow was falling when he got up the next morning he fired up the truck and headed for the railroad yard even so he intended to get there early some truckers would let snow make them late they were the ones whod get what was left after the more enterprising men won the good assignmentsor maybe the latecomers would end up with nothing at all when cincinnatus saw how few trains had come into the yard he thanked heaven hed come as fast as he could he got a choice load too he filled the back of the old ford with canned fish from bostonthe mackerel on the cans looked absurdly cheerfuland set out to deliver it to the several grocery stores run by a fellow named claude simmons some of the grocery boys who helped him unload the fish were no older than achilles one or two of them looked younger than his son down in the csa even white kids would have pitched a fit about working alongside a colored man nobody here complained the boys seemed as grateful to have work as cincinnatus was himself at one of the stores simmons himself signed off on the paperwork he nodded to cincinnatus ive seen you delivering things here more than once havent i he asked thats right suh cincinnatus answered you drive for yourself yes suh the grocery man studied him you do that just cause its the way things worked out or are you one of those people who cant stand taking orders from anybody people like that they start going crazy if they have to let somebody else tell em what to do so they end up with a job where they work for themselveseither that or they really do go nuts ive seen that happen a time or two with a shrug cincinnatus answered i dont reckon im like that you ask somebody else he might tell you different but i think i just want to make a living do the best i can for my family you want a job with me simmons asked delivery driver twentytwo fifty a week you wont get rich but its steady he pointed to the clipboard in cincinnatus hand what youre doing there youre liable to starve on that held the unpleasant ring of truth even so cincinnatus didnt need to think very long before he shook his head thank you kindly suh but i got to tell you no do you simmons scowled cincinnatus got the idea not many peopleand especially not somebody like a colored truck drivertold him no he went on you wont tell me you clear twentytwo fifty a whole lot of weeks these days no suh cincinnatus admitted what he could hardly deny but what happens if i take the job with you and things get worse like they look like theyre doin and then you let me go idve been drivin one o your trucks rightnot my own probably sell that then id really have to start at the bottom i done that before dont want to have to try and do it again have it your way the grocery man said with a shrug dont expect me to ask you twice thats all i dont suh didnt expect you to ask me once right decent of you to do it suddenly simmons seemed less a boss and more a worried human being do you really think itll get that much worse how could it how dunno how mr simmons cincinnatus answered but you ever know times that werent so bad they couldnt get worse that seemed to strike home go on get out of here claude simmons said his tone suddenly harsh heres hoping youre wrong buthe lowered his voiceim afraid youre liable to be right over supper that night cincinnatus asked elizabeth did i do the right thing twentytwo fifty steady money that aint bad aint great but it aint bad you done just right his wife spoke with great authority couplethree months he forget why he took you on and he let you go what kind of mess we in then way things is leastways you know what you got to do to git by i thought the same thingthe very same thing cincinnatus said were in trouble now but wed be ruined if i took that job and i lost it well go on the best way we know how thats all cant get worsen what it was when you was in jail elizabeth said hope to god it cant cincinnatus answered he didnt know exactly how bad it had been for his family but when he laughed he didnt feel mirthful when i was in jail i didnt have to worry none about where my next meal was comin from i knew i was gonna get fed wouldnt be much an it wouldnt be good but i was gonna get fed he would have got beaten too but he didnt talk about that it wasnt anything his family needed to know and it wasnt relevant to the discussion elizabeth said one way or another the lord provide for us thats right cincinnatus said clarence darrow might not have believed in god but he did the confidence that god was keeping an eye on him even while he went through the worst of times in jail was hard to come by but it had proved true so he remained convinced at any rate and one day about six weeks later when he went to the railroad yard to see what he could haul he remarked to the conductor i aint had nothin for the simmons stores in a while now the white man sent him an odd look you wouldnt want that assignment if i gave it to you cincinnatus he answered old man simmons went bankrupt week before last didnt you know no cincinnatus said softly i missed that he looked up toward the heavens a drop of drizzle hit him in the eye but he didnt care thank you jesus he whispered he might not have much but what he had he would keep a while longer s ylvia enos had always enjoyed books like anyone whod grown up in the days before wireless sets brought words and music straight into the home shed used books to while away a lot of empty hours in her life that didnt mean shed ever thought she would end up writing one herself well yes she had a coauthor he was a real writer he told her to call him ernie so she did hed been shot up during the war hed served in quebec and had written a couple of novels about that shed even read one but times were just as hard for writers these days as they were for everybody else hed got himself a thousanddollar contract for i sank roger kimball by sylvia enos as told to and five hundred dollars of that went into his pocket and the other five hundred into sylvias and five hundred dollars bought a hell of a lot of groceries so sylvia was writing a book tell me how it happened ernie would say sitting in the chair in her front room smoke curling up from his pipe as he took notes tell me exactly how it happened make it very plain make it so plain anyone can follow ill try sylvia would say ill do my best she found herself echoing the direct way in which he spoke when i got on the train bound for charleston i thought wait stop ernie held up a hand he was a big man burly like a prizefighter and the scars above his eyebrows and on his cheeks argued hed been in his share of scraps whether in the ring or just in one saloon or another dont tell me what you thought tell me what you did why dont you want to know what i thought sylvia asked thats why i did what i did tell me what you did ernie insisted ill write that people will read it then theyll know what you did and theyll know why too sylvia frowned why will they know that ernie was a handsome man but normally one with a slightly sullen expression when he smiled it was like the sun coming out why because im good he said that smile by itself was almost enough to lay sylvias doubts to rest shed had room in her life for precious few romantic thoughts since the ericsson sank but ernies smile coaxed some out from wherever theyd been hiding all these years she knew that was foolishness and nothing else but how could she help knowing it when he was five or ten years younger than she was he listened she didnt think shed ever had anyone listen so closely to what she said she knew george hadnt when he was still alive shed loved him and she was sure hed loved her too but he hadnt listened like thatnor as she had to admit to herself had she listened to him so paying such close attention hadnt occurred to either one of them ernie not only listened he took detailed notes sometimes he lugged a portable typewriter to her flat the battered leather of its case said hed lugged it to a lot of different places most of them worse than boston not far from the harbor he typed in quick short savage bursts pausing between them to stare at the ceiling and gnaw on the stem of his pipe in one of those pauses between bursts sylvia said the way the keys clatter it sounds like a machine gun going off the pipe stopped twitching in his mouth it swung toward her as if it were a weapon itself no he said his voice suddenly harsh and flat you dont know what youre talking about thank god you dont know what youre talking about im sorry she whispered i drove an ambulance he said at least as much to himself as to her sometimes i was up near the front sometimes i had to fight myself i know what machine guns sound like oh yes i know but i was on the safe side of the st lawrencehe laughedwhen i got shot an aeroplane shot up a train full of soldiers poor stupid bastards they never even found out what it was about before they got shot he shrugged maybe that was what it was about that and nothing more i went to help them to take them away a hospital was close by another aeroplane came over it shot up all of us i got hit ernie went back to typing then the next time sylvia thought of making some unaskedfor comment she kept it to herself instead he delivered the finished manuscript on a day when winter finally seemed ready to give way to spring thrusting it at her he said here read this it is supposed to be yours you should know what is in it he flung himself down on the sofa plainly intending to wait till she read it it wasnt very thick sylvia sat down in the chair by the sofa and went through it even before she got halfway she looked up at him and said i understand why i did what i did better now than i did when i did it she wondered if that made any sense at all it must have for he gave her a brusque nod i told you he said im good yes she nodded back you are she went back to reading when she looked up another fortyfive minutes had gone by and she was finished you make me sound better and smarter than i am that made him frown you should sound the way you are how do i fix it he was serious sylvia laughed and shook her head dont i like it ernie still looked discontented she laughed again i like you too shed never said that before thanks he said and put the manuscript back into a tidy pile and imprisoned it with rubber bands i enjoyed working with you i think the book will be all right by the way he sounded the second was more important than the first even so when he headed for the door sylvia planted herself in front of him put her arms around him and gave him a kiss it was the first time shed kissed a man the first time shed wanted to kiss a man since shed kissed george goodbye for the last time during the war ernie kissed her back too hard enough to leave her lips feeling bruised he squeezed her against him then all at once shoved her away its no good he said its no damn good at all why not sylvia said its been so long knowing desire had been a delicious surprise knowing it having it stirred and now having it thwarted seemed more than she could bear why not sweetheart ill tell you why not the writer answered i got shot in quebec you know that you dont know where i got shot right there not enough left to do a woman any good not enough left to do me any good either oh sylvia said that didnt seem nearly strong enough oh hell he looked at her and nodded why this is hell nor am i out of it the words werent quite in his usual style maybe he was quoting from something but sylvia didnt recognize it he bared his teeth in what seemed more snarl than smile im sorry sweetheart youre sorry sylvia exclaimed you poor man that was the wrong thing to say she realized it as soon as the words were out of her mouth which was of course too late ernie set his jaw and glared no he wasnt one to take pityhed despise it for weakness maybe sylvias more likely his own shouldnt have messed with you he said my own stupid fault i forget every once in a while then it tries to wag like a goddamn boxer dog wagging his little docked tail but a boxer can hump your leg i cant even do that he kissed her again even harder and rougher than before then he walked straight out the door over his shoulder he threw back a last handful of words take care of yourself kiddo the door slammed sylvia burst into tears oh hell she said again oh hell oh hell oh hell she was sure she would never see him again she was sure but she was wrong one day a couple of weeks later he waved to her as she came out of her block of flats shed never known she could feel joy and fear in the same heartbeat ernie she called what is it you have your money in a bank he said that wasnt at all what shed expected which bank is it plymouth and boston bank and trust she answered automatically why i thought i remembered that ernie said i saw the passbook on your coffee table take the money out take it all out take it out right away the bank is going to fail it will fail very soon fear of a different sort shot through her god bless you she whispered youre sure no of course not he snapped i came here because i was guessing why else would i come here sylvia flushed i was going somewhere else but ill head over there right now thank you ernie his face softened just for a moment youre welcome writers find things out i know someone who works for the bank who worked for the bank i mean he saw the writing on the wall he quit he said anywhere else in the world was better than to be there right now he paused and nodded to sylvia nice to think i can do something for you anyhow touching a finger to the brim of his sharp new fedora ernie hurried away the crowd on the street swallowed him up plymouth and boston bank and trust was only a few blocks away the main reason sylvia banked there she ran almost the whole way the lines didnt stretch out the door as shed seen at other banks in trouble but she felt panic in the air when she went inside everyone was speaking in the low nearwhispers people used when they tried to show they werent afraid she filled out a withdrawal slip and worked her way to the front of the line how many lines have i stood in how many hours of my life have i wasted in them too manyi know that at last she stood before a tellers cage with its frosted glass and iron grillwork the young man looked very unhappy when he saw the slip you want to close out your entire account he said in that soft noimnotafraid voice thats right sylvia answered firmly you do have the money to cover it the teller flinched yes we do we certainly do of course we do well then kindly give it to me sylvia said yes maam please wait here ill be back with it the teller disappeared into the bowels of the bank before he returned an older man stepped into the cage and said maam i want to personally assure you the plymouth and boston bank and trust is sound thats nice sylvia told him if it turns out youre right maybe ill put my money back in if it turns out youre wrong ill have the moneyif that teller ever gets back how long is he going to take he chose that moment to return while the frowning older man looked on he counted out bills and change for sylvia here you are maam he said every penny thats owed you he sounded as if he were doing her a favor by giving her back the money and as if she hadnt done the bank a favor by depositing it there in the first place by the time she left the lines did stretch out the door did you get it someone called to her she didnt answer she didnt want to get mugged when people found out she was carrying cash she just headed home as fast as she could plymouth and boston bank and trust closed its doors for good the next day americanempire thecentercannothold xii m ary mcgregor went about her chores with a certain somber joy that had nothing to do with how hard things were on the manitoba farm where shed spent her whole life it had a great deal to do with how hard the market crash had hit the united states she hardly cared what happened to her so long as the united states got hurt and by all the signs the occupiers did hurt fewer greengray us army motorcars rattled along the road to rosenfeld that ran past the edge of the farm fewer us soldiers prowled the streets of the local market town and the rosenfeld register published these days by an upstart from minnesota who used occupation propaganda as filler kept on weeping about how hard a time people south of the border were having none of which made things on the farm any easier only somewhat easier to bear things on the farm were desperately hard and all the harder because julia had married kenneth marble and gone off to live with him she came back to visit fairly often usually bringing beth marble kenneths mother with her and kenneth himself stopped by every so often for a burst of work for which a mans strength came in handy things werent the same though and mary and her own mother both knew it one of these days before too long youll meet somebody too maude mcgregor said over supper after a long wearing day out in the fields youll meet somebody get married yourself and move away ill probably have to sell this place and move in with you or julia i wouldnt do that mary exclaimed her mother smiled of course you would you should thats the way the world works young folks do what they need to do and older ones ride along with it as best they can i dont see how wed go on if things worked any different it doesnt seem right it isnt right mary saidshed had that passionate certainty for as long as shed been alive after a moment she went on if i ever marry anybodyand the thought had crossed her mind more and more often since shed passed her twentieth birthdayhe ought to come and live here and help us work this place then our children could go right on working it years and years from now the trouble with that you know is that julia and kenneth and their children when they have them have an interest in this land too her mother said julia doesnt seem very interested mary said she went off without so much as a backwards glance julia doesnt seem very interested now her mother replied how shell feel about things ten or twenty years from nowor how her husband and her children will feelwell how can anybody know for sure thinking about what things might be like ten or twenty years from now still didnt seem natural to mary she tried to imagine herself at forty but no picture formed in her mind that lay too far in the future to mean anything to her now she wondered if julia still felt the same way maybe notwith a husband at hand she had to be looking forward to having children how children were begotten was no mystery to mary as it could be no mystery to anyone whod grown up on a farm why anyone would want to have anything to do with the process was a different question to let a man do that with her to her she shook her head the mere idea was repulsive but people did it that was what being married was about she knew that too if people didnt do it after a while there wouldnt be any more people sometimes that didnt seem such a bad idea her mother went on a couple of knotholes have popped out of the wood in the barn i want you to nail wood over them when you get the chance so the inside will stay warmer in winter the sooner you do it the sooner we dont have to worry about it any more ill take care of it mary promised ive noticed em too especially the one that came out right behind that old wagon wheel yes thats the biggest one maude mcgregor agreed a good patch there will keep a lot of warm air from leaking out when the weather turns cold againand it will i know mary said no one whod lived in manitoba any time from september to april could help knowing when she went out to the barn the next morning she took care of the livestock first that had to be done and done every day as soon as shed finished she went over to her fathers work bench she cut a square off a flat board then grabbed the wood a hammer and some nails and went to get at the knot that had turned into a knothole it was right behind that wagon wheel she had to put down the tools and the patch to wrestle the wheel out of the way miserable thing she muttered or perhaps something a little stronger than that why the devil hadnt her father got rid of it come to that why hadnt she or her mother in the years since her father died she had no good answer except that there had always been more important things to do once shed shifted the wheel she picked up the square of wood and the hammer and nails and advanced on the knothole as she took the next to last step she frowned it didnt sound rightshed never known that reverberation anywhere else in the barn it didnt feel quite right underfoot either ground had no business giving slightly as it did here it almost felt as if mary bent down to look more closely at where shed been standing it just looked like dirt with straw scattered over it but when she scraped at it with her hand she didnt have to dig far at all before her fingers found a boardundoubtedly the board shed trodden on after moving the broken wagon wheel whats that doing there she wondered almost of their own accord her fingers kept searching till they found the edge of the board she pulled up dirt slid from the board as she raised it under it was a sharpedged hollow dug into the soil and in that hollow marys eyes got big and round in that hollow rested sticks of dynamite and blasting caps and lengths of fuse and some highly specialized tools at last she whispered shed finally found her fathers bombmaking gear the first thing she imagined was going into rosenfeld as arthur mcgregor had done at the end of the great war and blowing as many americans as she could skyhigh she didnt worry about getting caught if it meant more revenge on the usa she would gladly pay the price the real problem was she didnt know enough about explosives to make a bomb that had any real chance of doing what she wanted it to do i can learn she thought it cant be too hard i just have to be careful im sure i can figure it out without killing myself while im doing it thank you pa mary said im sorry you had to stop im even sorrier you didnt get general custer but the fights not done the fight wont be done till canadas free again she looked toward that old broken wagon wheel suddenly a wide smile flashed across her face now she understood why her father had never repaired it or got rid of it it perfectly concealed his tools and explosives not one of the yankee soldiers whod searched this barnand there had been a lot of them for theyd suspected much more than they could ever provehad thought to move it and see what lay underneath she wouldnt have thought of it either if she hadnt had to shift the wheel for an altogether different reason she wondered if she could find anyone in the sputtering canadian resistance movement who could teach her about making bombs then almost as soon as the thought occurred to her she shook her head her father had gone his own way in fighting the americans which meant no one had betrayed him no one could betray him if no one knew what he was doing people told a bitter joke when three people sit down to conspire one is a fool and the other two american spies that would have been funnier had it not held so painfully much truth more than once the rosenfeld register had exulted about plots that failed because one member or another gave them away to the yankees mary mcgregor nodded to herself whatever i do ill do it alone thats how pa did it hed still be blowing them up if he hadnt had bad luck its my turn now ill be as careful as he was or even more so nobody will give me away and i wont give myself away either some people said even the big canadian uprising of a few years before had been betrayed to the americans before it broke out that theyd been on the alert because of that mary had even heard some people with reputations as patriots had turned traitor because theyd fallen in love with invaders from the south she didnt want to believe that she had trouble imagining any proper canadian falling in love with a yankee the americans had ravished the country wouldnt they be ravishing anyone in it who had anything to do with them that was how it seemed to mary as far as she was concerned nobody whod betrayed the uprising deserved to live yes thats what ill do she said as if someone had suggested it to her getting rid of traitors was the best way she could think of to remind the whole country that going along with the occupation had a price she wanted to go out and start planting bombs that very morning she knew some names she was sure she could learn others without much trouble but she checked herself you were going to be careful remember after nodding she patched the knothole that had led to her discovery then she carefully concealed the hole in the ground once more replacing the board covering it with dirt and straw and putting the old wagon wheel back where it belonged when she was done she looked hard at the ground and did a little more smoothing satisfied at last she nodded and went on to cover up the other knots that had come out of the planking took you long enough her mother said when mary came into the farmhouse i didnt think it was that hard a job sorry ma mary had known from the minute she lifted the edge of the board and saw what lay beneath it that she couldnt tell her mother about it what would maude mcgregor do pitch a fit and tell her to leave the stuff alone she was as sure of that as she was of her own name she was also sure she wouldnt leave the stuff alone no matter what her mother told her to do sorry her mother shook her head dont you think you have enough other things to take care of what were you doing playing with the chicks you havent done that since you were a little girl i know but i was looking at them and they looked so cuteand they turn into stupid boring old hens so fast i wanted to have some fun with them while i could they act so silly mary seized on the explanation with both hands she didnt like to lie to her mother but preferred that to telling the truth here cant afford to get sentimental about em her mother said theyll go into the pot when they stop giving enough eggs to be worth their keep nothing like a good chicken stew on a cold winter night i know that too ma mary didnt want to say anything to stir her mother up or make her start asking questions agreeing with everything maude mcgregor said was also liable to make her mother wonder but not in any dangerous way or so mary thought till her mother asked are you all right dear mary thought that over after a couple of seconds she nodded im swell ma im the best ive been for a long time matter of fact her mother gave her a quizzical look but not of the sort to make her worry no she didnt worry at all everything was going to be fine now she could feel it t he remembrance sailed west through the straits of florida out of nassau in the bahamasthe formerly british bahamas surrendered to the usa after the great warbound for puerto limon on the caribbean coast of costa rica the sun stood tropically high in the sky the day was hot and bright and perfect perfect that is for almost everybody aboard the aeroplane carrier except sam carsten no matter how hot and muggy it got sam had to keep his cap on and to jam it down as far down over his eyes as he could a lot of officers went around in their shirtsleeves he didnt he left on his white summer jacket to protect his arms as well as he could his ears his nose especially his nose and the backs of his hands were snowy white with zincoxide ointment even so every square inch of flesh he exposed to the sun was red and peeling or blistered he hated weather like this hated it where most men reveled in it like most men commander martin van der waal tanned readily oh hed burn if he did something stupid but even that would only last till he stayed out enough to get his hide acclimated to the sun the torpedodefense specialist looked at sam with wry sympathy youd sooner be patrolling somewhere between greenland and iceland wouldnt you he said now that you mention it siryes carsten answered sorry about that van der waal said theyve got somebody else keeping an eye on the royal navy up there we get to show the flag in what used to be a confederate lake not quite enough little specks of land in the florida straits to let the csa claim this as territorial water and make us go the long way round sam said we would have had to before the war his superior said the confederates thought they were little tin gods then now now i dont care if they build themselves a bridge from key west to habana well sail right under it by god and thumb our noses as we go by yeah carsten smiled and nodded liking the picture down at the remembrance s stern a sailor spun an aeroplanes prop the engine roared to noisy life with a push from the steam catapult the machine taxied along the carriers flight deck descended for a split second as it went off the end and then gained altitude and buzzed away another followed and another and another sam said of course itll be unofficial when they look over what the confederates are up to in south florida and cuba he winked of course it will commander van der waal chuckled yeah and rain makes applesauce but two could play at that game before long a biplane came down from florida and began flying lazy circles above the remembrance not caring for the company the aeroplane carriers commander ordered a couple of fighting scouts aloft to look over the newcomer and if need be to warn him off sam happened to be going by the wireless shack when one of the us pilots said the confederate says hes just a civilian his machines got confederate citrus company painted on the side hes out for a stroll you might say what the officer inside the wireless center said meant yeah and rain makes applesauce but was a good deal more pungently phrased the officer went on tell the son of a bitch he can goddamn well go strolling somewhere else or maybe hell go swimming instead yes sir the pilot answered carsten lingered in the corridor to hear what happened next after half a minute or so the pilot came back on the air sir he says if we want an international incident from shooting down an unarmed civilian pilot in international waters we can have one the officer in the wireless center expended more bad language at last he said id better talk to the old man about that one he might have wanted to order the confederate aeroplane knocked out of the sky but he didnt have the nerve to do it without approval from on high carsten wouldnt have either maybe the skipper of the remembrance used some blue language of his own whether he did or not that confederate citrus company aeroplane flew above the carrier for the next hour and a half nobody fired a shot at it the pilot finally ran low on fuel or got bored or found some other reason to fly back off toward the north in the officers galley at supper that evening sam said i bet theyre developing that bastards photographs right now probably a lieutenant junior grade agreed fat lot of good they can do with em though maybe theyve built a few submersibles without our noticing and maybe than can keep em hidden from us too especially since the socialists arent spending the money on inspections that the democrats did a lieutenant commander put in yes sir the jg said but theres no way in hell they could build themselves an aeroplane carrier on the sly thats too big a secret to keep besides they havent got the aeroplanes to put aboard it we hope they dont sam said for all we know theyre all labeled confederate citrus company right now that produced a few laughs and a few curses the lieutenant commander said that machine had no guns the pilots checked first thing yes sir sam said but how long would they need to convert the type to something they could use in combat nobody had anything resembling an answer for him the lieutenant commander said thats something we ought to find out about maybe more of these fruitcompany bastards will come look us over before too long if they do well look them over too he sighed i dont know how much good that will do us not the way things are in philadelphia these days but we do have to make the effort by the next morning though theyd left the straits and even cuba behind no more aeroplanes came out from the csa to inspect them carsten was sure that didnt mean nobody was keeping an eye on them lots of little fishing boats some confederate others mexican bobbed in the gulf of mexico how many of them had wireless sets how many of those sets were sending reports to say the confederate naval academy at mobile or to new orleans he didnt know but he had his suspicions he also had suspicions of another sort whenever he came up onto the flight deck he kept staring out into the blue blue waters of the gulf what are you doing commander van der waal asked looking for periscopes yes sir sam answered altogether seriously van der waal stared do you really think the confederates would try to sink us no sir sam said i think theyd have to be crazy to try that but if theyve got any submersibles what better way to train their crews than by stalking a real live aeroplane carrier his superior pondered that then nodded good point carsten lets see what we can do about it maybe we ought to get some training in too before long the remembrance shut down her engines and drifted to a stop sam knew what that meant she was giving her hydrophone operators the best chance she could to pick up the sounds of submarines moving on their electric engines somewhere under the sea what will we do if we hear one carsten wondered the carrier couldnt start lobbing depth charges into the gulf of mexico that would be an act of war no less than if one of the hypothetical subs launched a torpedo at her we could report it to philadelphia how much good would that do sam didnt know but the confederate states couldnt claim they had no submersibles if the remembrance found one or could they maybe theyd claim the boat belonged to the empire of mexico sam doubted the mexicans could build such boats on their own or man them if they did but how could you know for sure you couldnt subs under the sea were hard to find and even harder to identify they didnt come with license plates the way motorcars did nobody ever officially said whether the hydrophone operators found anything sam did get a letter of commendation in his service jacket for enhancing the remembrance s readiness against surprise attack he drew his own conclusions from that he also kept his mouth shut about them sometimes advertising youd done something smart was a good idea sometimes it was anything but when they neared the central american coast a tiny gunboat flying the blueandwhite costa rican flag came out of puerto limon to greet the remembrance an officer at the bow hailed her through a megaphone he looked just the way sam had thought a costa rican would look and spoke english with a spanish accent the gunboat which might have been a toy alongside the aeroplane carrier got out of the way in a hurry so the elephantine ship could advance puerto limon itself turned out to be very different from what carsten had expected hed come to ports in latin america before hed figured the people here would be like the officer swarthy most of them of mixed white and indian blood and spanishspeaking instead most of them turned out to be negroes and they used more english than spanish in their mouths the language had a lilt that put him in mind of what hed heard in the bahamas a long line of black men carrying huge bunches of bananas came up the pier next to the one where the remembrance tied up they vanished into the hold of a freighter flying the confederate flag then emerged to go back down the pier lugging crates whatever that freighter had been carrying here to exchange for the golden fruit actually the bananas going aboard were green sam supposed they would ripen on the way up to the csa white sailors aboard the freighter stared over at the aeroplane carrier to commander van der waal carsten remarked i wonder how many of those bastards were in the cs navy during the war more than a few or i miss my guess the other officer answered weve just given them some free intelligence he shrugged thats the way it goes sometimes the costa rican officer from the gunboat came aboard a few minutes later his white uniform was more festooned with gold braid than that of the remembrance s skipper but he introduced himself as lieutenant commander garcia that tickled sams funny bone i wonder what an admiral in the costa rican navy looks like he remarked you probably cant see the cloth on his uniform at all on account of the gold and the medals and such commander van der waals snicker had a nasty edge to it my little girl back in providence likes to play dressup the same way of course shes got an excuseshes only eight years old but lieutenant commander garcia said all the right things we are pleased to see this great ship in our growing port we hope it is a sign of friendship between your great republic and our own costa rica and the united states have never been enemies we do not believe we ever have to be sam wondered whether the sailors aboard the confederate freighter could hear garcias words and how they liked them if they could hope you dont like em for beans he thought w hen abner dowling went to the train station in salt lake city a police officer patted him down before allowing him inside the building another cop and a military policeman with him went through dowlings suitcase sorry about this sir the mp said when he got to the bottom of dowlings belongings i do apologize for the inconvenience its all right dowling answered identity cards and uniforms can be fakedweve found that out the hard way now you know for a fact i wont be carrying contraband onto the train thank you for taking it so well sir the military policeman said no point getting huffy about it dowling said you were going to search me any which way he was dead right about that everyone who left utah was searched these days whether at train stations or at checkpoints along the highways since assassinating general pershing mormon diehards had set off bombs from san francisco to pittsburgh they were suspected in a couple of murders of prominent men too and of bank robberies to finance their operations and so and so lines into the railroad station were long and slow everyone was searched men women children even babies in flowing robes at least once somebody had tried to smuggle out explosives hidden under baby clothes dowling only hoped the diehards hadnt succeeded at that game before the us occupiers got wise to it every suitcase got searched too some the ones suspected of false bottoms also got xrayed as dowling took his seat in the fancy pullman car he marveled that any ordinary civilians at all got on in utah he muttered under his breath a mutter uncomplimentary to the inhabitants of the state he helped rule utah had precious few ordinary civilians and even fewer who were also mormons up till general pershing was killed dowling had dared believe otherwise so had the administrators whod been on the point of relaxing military occupation in utah it could have become a state like any other dowling thought as the train began rolling east they could have rebuilt the temple if theyd wanted to but some damnfool hotheads made sure that wouldnt happen i hope theyre pleased with themselves utah wont get out from under the us armys thumb for the next ten years now he suspected the man whod gunned down general pershinga man whod never been caughtand his pals were pleased with themselves some people had a vested interest in trouble if it looked as if calm threatened to break out people like that would do anything they could to thwart it and as theyd shown they could do plenty colonel dowling let out a loud long sigh he glanced toward the bed in his compartment if he wanted to he could take off his shoestake off his uniform for that mattercurl up there and go to sleep he didnt have to worry about salt lake city or utah as a whole for the next several days unless the mormons have planted a bomb under the railroad tracks he thought he knew that wasnt likely but he also knew it wasnt impossible he shook his head angry at himself i said i wasnt going to worry about it and what do i do start worrying thats what he looked out the window an aeroplane flew past also heading east but easily outpacing the train it was one of those new threemotored machines that could carry freight or passengers suddenly dowling wondered what sort of precautions people were taking at landing fields a bomb aboard an aeroplane would surely kill everybody on it muttering again this time a sharp curse he scribbled a note to himself maybe the mormons hadnt thought of trying to bomb aeroplanes the way they assuredly had thought of bombing trains maybe they wouldnt but maybe they would too he wanted to stay one step ahead of them if he could when lunchtime came he made his way back to the dining car he was about to dig into a big plate of spare ribs when a cleverlooking woman with reddish hair going gray came up to his table and said mind if i join you colonel dowling i suppose not he frowned she looked familiar but he couldnt place the face youre ophelia clemens she said crisply holding out her hand manfashion we met in winnipeg if youll remember good god yes dowling exclaimed as he shook it im not likely to forget that shed come to occupied canada to interview general custer and shed just escaped being blown to bits with himand with dowlingwhen arthur mcgregor planted a bomb in the steakhouse where custer ate lunch how are you miss clemens tolerable well thanks the newspaperwoman answered are you also heading to washington for general custers funeral dowling nodded yes i am i would have gone anyway but mrs custer also sent me a telegram asking me to be there which i thought was very kind and gracious of her do you have any comments on the generals passing its the end of an era dowling said automatically that he knew it was a cliche made it no less true he went on he was an officer in the war of secession he was a hero in the second mexican war he was a heroprobably the heroof the great war even though he broke orders to do it even though he almost got himself courtmartialedand me with him and he was a hero all over again when he was coming home to retire when he threw back the bomb that canadian tossed at him every word of that was true too dowling knew he would have died if general custer hadnt stubbornly irrationallycorrectlybelieved mcgregor was the man whod been out to kill him he added he lived to ninety too thats a good run for anybody it certainly is ophelia clemens took out a notebook and scrawled in it a waiter came by she gave him her order then turned back to dowling may i ask you something colonel go ahead dowling replied what kind of answer you get depends on what kind of question it is it always does she agreed heres what i want to know teddy roosevelt and george custer always told different stories about what happened during the second mexican war theyre both dead now you cant hurt either one of them with a straight answer do you know who had it right do i know for a fact abner dowling remembered the quarrel hed listened to in nashville in right at the end of the great war roosevelt and custer had almost come to blows then though one was in late middle years and the other already an old man dowling knew what his opinion was but that wasnt what miss clemens had asked maam i wasnt there i was a little boy during the second mexican war even if i had been there odds are i wouldnt have heard exactly what orders were given or by whom ophelia clemens gave him a sour nod i was afraid you were going to say that i even talked to a couple of the surviving machine gunnersgatling gunners they called themselvesbut they dont know or dont remember who did what when well probably never know not for certain dowling said what do you think the newspaperwoman poised her pencil over the notebook ready to take down whatever pearls of wisdom he gave her not for publication he answered at once the pencil withdrew he still didnt say what he thought instead he added not even as a highly placed source or anything like that the look she sent him this time was even more sour all right she said at last you dont make things easy do you maam teddy roosevelt and george custer are dead but you wont find a senior officer who doesnt have strong views about both of them dowling said ophelia clemens nodded again that did seem to make sense to her i promise she said solemnly and in case youre wondering i dont break promises like that if i did no one would trust me when i made them dowling believed her she was from everything hed seen in winnipeg and here on the train a straight shooter she probably had to be to get ahead in a normally masculine business like reporting he remembered shed told him and custer her father had been a newspaperman too dowling said strictly off the record id bet on teddy roosevelt i thought as much she said custer was nothing but a phony and a blowhard wasnt he strictly off the record dowling repeated he was a humbug and a blowhard but if you say he was nothing but a humbug and a blowhard youre wrong he always went straight after what he wanted and he went after it as hard as he could when he was rightand he was sometimesthat made him one of the most effective people the world has ever seen the rest may be true but dont forget that part of him ophelia clemens considered that in the end a little reluctantly she nodded yes i suppose you have something people need to judge a man by what he did not just by the way he acted custer did a lot dowling said no two ways about that he might have managed more he might have managed better if he hadnt become a selfparody in his later years but what he had done would be remembered as long as the united states endured dowling told custer stories all the way from salt lake city to washington dc some on the record some off ophelia clemens wrote down what she could and either laughed or rolled her eyes at the rest dowling was sorry they went their separate ways after the train rolled into union station he paid his respects to libbie custer who sat beside the generals body where it lay in state in the capitol hello colonel custers widow said we had a fine run autie and i i dont know what in heavens name ill do without him i think youll manage dowling said on the whole truthfully hed always reckoned mrs custer the brains of the outfit i suppose i could she said now but whats the point i spent the past sixtyfive years taking care of the general now that hes gone what am i supposed to do with myself i havent much time left either you know with no answer for thathow could he contradict an obvious truthdowling murmured im sorry and made his escape he marched in the mourners procession behind custers flagdraped coffin the generals funeral was modeled on teddy roosevelts dowling found it strangely fitting that the two men longtime rivals in life should be equals in death the only difference he could see was that no foreign dignitaries came to say their farewells to general custer a bespectacled man hoisted a boy onto his shoulders in the funereal hush his words carried look armstrong there goes the man youre named for custers final wishesor maybe they were libbies wisheswere that his remains be buried at arlington across the potomac from washington in what was now west virginia he would spend eternity with teddy roosevelt and robert e lee presumably would spend it gnashing his teeth at having not one but two us heroes take their final rest on his old estate well to hell with robert e lee dowling muttered and he felt sure both custer and roosevelt would have agreed with him f lora blackford had spent years speaking in front of crowds of workers a womens club in philadelphia wasnt the same thing speaking as first lady in front of organizations like this wasnt even like speaking in the house of representatives thered been plenty of cutandthrust in the house here flora had to be polite whether she wanted to or not im sure youll agree that we can return to prosperity and that we will return to prosperity she told the plump prosperous women even if it was noncontroversial it was also a campaign speech with the congressional election just around the corner the worst is over from where we are now we can only go up the women applauded shed told them what they wanted to hear what they wanted to believe she wanted to believe it herself shed wanted to believe it ever since the stock market crashed right after her husband became president shed wanted to but believing got harder every day we were the party of prosperity through the s she insisted we dont deserve to be labeled the party of depression even though the women applauded again flora knew more than a little depression herself her husband had done what only twentynine men had done before himhed become president and what had it got him only curses and the blame for the worst collapse the united states had known since the bad times after the confederate states broke away in the war of secession she got through the speech shed learned all about getting through speeches despite a heavy heart when shed had to stand up in congress after her brother david lost a leg in the great war she had to do a good job here the coming election would be the first chance voters had to say anything about the blackford administration and the socialist party since things went sour what would they say when they got the chance nothing good she feared the socialists naturally had taken credit for everything that had gone right in their first two terms upton sinclairs terms in powel house regardless of whether theyd caused it political parties did that how could they keep from getting the blame for everything that was going wrong now the democratseven the remnants of the republicanswere certainly doing their best to pin that blame on the party of marx and lincoln and debs after the speech after the coffee and cakes and polite talk that followed she went back to the presidential residence traveling by chauffeured limousine to the powel house struck her as expensive and wasteful to say nothing of being the very opposite of egalitarian but against entrenched presidential custom the socialists had struggled in vain the limousine waited for flora outside the womens clubwaited for her and whisked her away when she got back to powel house she found her husband studying a bill is that the new relief authorization from congress she asked hosea blackford nodded thats what it is he said im going to sign it tooeven makework is better than no work at all and no work at all is what too many people have these days but it feels like putting a bandage on a man whos just been shot through the heart how much good is it going to do hed been president for only a little more than a year and a half the pressure of the job though had aged him more in that time than all the years hed spent as vice president his hair was thinner and grayer his face more wrinkled and more wearylooking his clothes hung on him like sacks for hed lost weight too would he look this way if things hadnt gone wrong flora wondered guilt gnawed at her shed encouraged hosea to run for president if she hadnt the country would be blaming someone else for its troubles now shantytowns inhabited by men whod lost their homes wouldnt be called blackfordburghs comics wouldnt tell jokes about him on the vaudeville stage and over the wireless then he said its a good thing ive got this job instead of calvin coolidge if he were sitting here hed veto this bill and all the others like it things would be a lot worse thenim sure of it we have hungry people nowwed have starving people then the class struggle would go straight to the streets tears stung her eyes she said i was just thinking i never should have put you through all this you didnt put me through it he answered i did it myself i wanted it too you know and in spite of everything i think im a better man for the job than coolidge would have been the country doesnt deserve you flora said oh are you saying it does deserve coolidge her husband asked with a wry grin im not sure even massachusetts deserves him thats not what i meant and you know it flora said with some asperity maybe not sweetheart but its what you said hosea blackford answered even that wry grin had trouble staying on his face if only something we tried would do some real good for the country so people would believe we had hope things would be a lot worse without the relief programs and the dole flora insisted wed have men out selling apples on street corners to try to stay alive we might as well even now her husband said i havent seen the country so gloomy since since before the great war flora knew what a hard time he had bringing that out the socialists still looked at the war in terms of the lives it had squandered the lives it had wrecked the ruin it had wrought they didnt usually talk about the triumph it had been as democrats were in the habit of doing but before the war the usa caught between the csa and canada with england and france always ready to pounce had a downtrodden feel enemies had ganged up on the united states twice the fear those enemies might do it again had filled the countryand perhaps with reason no more now the united states had their place in the sun no one had a bigger place either only the empire of germany came close the kaisers monarchy was a rival yes but not the deadly foes the confederacy and her allies had seemed in the old days the days before they were beaten at last and from to under theodore roosevelt and then under upton sinclair the united states had walked tall had walked proud after half a century of furtive skulking the united states had strutted but now this nobody in all the world was strutting these days everyone was trying to figure out how to fix what had gone wrong no one though was having much luck what are we going to do flora asked you mean besides take a drubbing at the polls next tuesday her husband asked in turn i dont know dear i really dont and i wish to heaven i did if i knew what to do id be doing it you can bet on that he drummed his fingers on the desk blackfordburghs he spoke the word as if it were a curse and so in a way it was a curse on him and a curse on the party he headed maybe it wont be so bad flora said people arent stupid the democrats cant mystify everybody whats happened the past year and a half isnt our fault isnt your fault it would have happened if coolidge were president too it would be worse thenyou said so yourself thats logical thats rational hosea blackford said politics unfortunately is neither people wont think about what might have been theyll think about what really happened and theyll say you were there it damn well is your fault and youve got to pay for it he pointed to himself flora wanted to tell him he was worrying about nothing she couldnt he was worrying about something all too real and she knew it she did walk over and give him a hug there she said and joshua loves you too thats all good blackford said thats all wonderful as a matter of fact in my personal life im as happy and lucky as a man could be but none of it will buy the socialists a single extra vote when voting day rolls around he was right flora wished she could tell him he was wrong he would only have laughed had she tried though he knew better so did she waiting for the election was like waiting for an old sick loved one to die day followed day without much apparent change but then suddenly and somehow unexpectedly the moment came at last people went to the polls blackfords name wasnt on the ballot but the election would be a judgment on him even so he couldnt even vote for his party nor could flora neither of them officially resided in philadelphia hosea blackford could have gone over to socialist party headquarters to learn of voters decisionor rather decisions for every race here unlike in a presidential election was individual unique to its area but he stayed in powel house instead once more custom triumphed plenty of wireless sets and telegraph clickers brought in the news and from the very beginning it was as bad as flora and he had feared it would be if anything it was worse socialist after socialist went down to defeat even the fellow whod followed flora to congress in the eleventh ward in new york city found himself in deep trouble against a democratic candidate of no particular luster what are we going to do flora wailed as the magnitude of the socialist disaster grew plain no the question is what will the new congress do her husband said glumly he answered his own question odds are the democrats wont do much and they wont let us do much either they think weve done too much already and that were part of the problem they dont know what theyre talking about flora snapped well i happen to agree with you you know hosea blackford said the voters unfortunately look to have other ideas how can they do this to us flora didnt try to hide her bitterness im sure the democrats felt the same way ten years ago when we first came to power her husband said that struck her as cold consolation but were right she said they were wrong he managed another of those wry smiles remember your dialectic thesis antithesis synthesis now the antithesis gets its turn for a while and we see what comes of that nothing good flora predicted darkly the irony was that shed always been a much more ideological socialist than hosea his chiding her on basic party doctrine stung as hed no doubt meant it to she went on we have to keep them from doing nothing the way you say they want toand of course youre dead right about that we have to maybe we can get a halfway worthwhile synthesis out of that were going to lose the house hosea said i dont think theres any doubt about it the senate well that depends on how some of the races in the far west go if were lucky there may be enough socialists and republicans to go with a handful of progressive democrats and let us do some useful things well see thats all he sounded as if he looked forward to the challenge that wasnt how flora felt about it as far as she was concerned the faithless people had betrayed the party shed always been on the barricades throwing stones at the oppressors now by their votes the people thought the socialists were among the oppressors that hurt it hurt a lot and she knew she would be a long time getting over it c larence potter tried to remember the name of the englishman whod written a novel about a man whod invented a machine that let him travel through time he hadnt altogether liked the bookparts of it struck him as a socialist tract about the divisions between capital and laborbut he couldnt deny that it had more than its share of arresting images the mere idea of a timetraveling machine was one on new years eve as the year was poised to pass away and usher in potter felt as if not just he but all of charleston were caught in the grip of a timetraveling machine and hurled back almost a decade into the past the freedom party had laid on an enormous rally to mark the changing of the year and had succeeded he feared beyond its wildest dreams a strident sea of humanity filled hampton park to hear jake featherston whod come down from richmond to speak dozens of searchlights stabbed up into the sky creating columns of silvery radiance that seemed to transform the park into an enormous public building blocks of freedom party bully boys in their white shirts and butternut trousers along with veterans from the tin hatswho wore uniforms even more closely resembling those of the confederate armystood out amid the swarms of ordinary charlestonians whod come to the outskirts of the city more bully boys in white and butternut these carrying long truncheons formed a perimeter around the crowd the searchlights spread just enough light around to let potter see how very ready for a brawl they looked he touched braxton donovans arm we cant try to break this up not with the men weve got here he said urgently theyll slaughter us donovan grimaced but then reluctantly nodded just our luck he said we try to take a leaf out of the freedom partys book and it doesnt work theyd brought along seventyfive maybe even a hundred stalwart young whigs armed with a motley assortment of streetfighting weapons the force would have been plenty to disrupt any ordinary freedom party gathering attacking this one potter shook his head he would sooner have sent infantrymen charging uphill against machinegun nests and massed artillery disgust in his voice he said featherston even has the luck of the weather a december night in charleston could easily have been rainy could have been freezing could even have seen snowthough that was unlikely but the thermometer stood in the upper forties with a million stars in the sky trying to fight their way through the searchlight beams the moon and even lower in the east jupiter blazed bright so what do we do now donovan asked just send the boys home go on home ourselves that stinks you want to know what i think getting massacred stinks worse potter answered you can go or stay whichever you want they can go or stay whichever they want me ill hang around and hear what that featherston bastard has to say you thinking of going over to the freedom party donovan asked you blocked me when i tried to read anne colleton out of the whigs and now shes back in bed with dear old jake fat lot of good you did us i was wrong potter said with a scowl youre luckyyouve never been wrong in all your born days have you he still missed anne his mind kept exploring how things between them had soured as a mans tongue will explore the empty socket that recently held a tooth admitting he was wrong disconcerted donovan the lawyer probably didnt hear it happen often enough to know what to do when it did all right all right he said gruffly lets forget about it then i wish i could potter said the other whig didnt know what to make of that either too bad potter thought a whiteshirted freedom party man came up to them you fellas want to move along now he said almost indulgentlyhe knew he had strength on his side potter looked at him what we want to do is kick your damn teeth down your throat he growled watch your mouth the freedom party man said indulgent no more we can squash yall flat like a cockroachand just what you deserve if i give a yell if you give a yell youre a dead man clarence potter promised your side might win the fight afterwards but you wont be around to enjoy it i promise the man in white shirt and butternut trousers scowled at him he stared back no expression at all on his face the freedom party hooligan was the first to look away a moment later he spun and stalked off you told him braxton donovan said as if potter and the whigs had won some sort of victory hes going to come back with enough men to squash us flat potter said go on home and take the boys with you well get other chances im going to hang around youre crazy braxton donovan declared no its just that i was in intelligence during the war i want to know what the enemy is up to potter replied with a shrug or maybe i am crazy you never can tell as the whigs outnumbered toughs headed away from hampton park and back toward downtown charleston potter mingled with the freedom party men and women still streaming in to hear featherston speak that mingling came just in time too the fellow hed faced down returned with a lot of men at his back he looked around and laughed when he didnt see potter or any of the other whigs they were leaving anyway you son of a bitch potter thought and now ive found my way inside by their clothes most of the men who wanted to hear jake featherston were farmers and laborersmost but far from all potter saw druggists and shopkeepers and businessmen and even a few who looked like professional men not all the men were great war veterans either more than potter had expected looked too young to have fought in the war that surprised and dismayed him the women coming inperhaps a third of the audiencelikewise came from all social groups with the emphasis on the lower middle class potter pushed forward as far as he could even so the rostrum from which featherston would speak remained halfway across the park from him and seemed tiny as a toy everyone exclaimed as searchlights swinging toward the podium picked out a face behind it but that wasnt jake featherstons lean visage which potter knew all too well whoever that was pinned in the glow of the bright lights hed never missed a meal and was nobody potter recognized some of the people around potter grumbled too then the plump stranger introduced himself as one of the new freedom party congressmen south carolina had sent up to richmond in the election of that was plenty to win him a round of applause from the party faithful clarence potter had to join it to keep something dreadful from happening to him he felt like washing his hands the first chance he got and now the congressman boomed it gives me tremendous pleasure to have the privilege of presenting to you all the leader of our great freedom party mr jaaake featherston the roar of applause and cheers that went up stunned potters ears he opened his mouth but silently he didnt have to shout and keeping his mouth open helped protect his ears featherston an old artilleryman likely knew that trick himself through the shouts and clapping from the crowd came disciplined yells from the men in white shirts and butternut trousers freedom freedom freedom little by little more and more people joined that chant so it began to drown out the noise all around freedom freedom freedom the twosyllable word felt as heavy and regular as a heartbeat jake featherston let the chant build to a deafening crescendo then raised both hands above his head still disciplined the blocks of goons fell silent at once without their steadying influence the cries faded away after perhaps fifteen seconds into the ringing quiet that followed featherston said its always good to come to charleston on account of this here is where the confederate states of america were born he couldnt miss getting applause with that line he couldntand he didnt again clarence potter had to clap along with everybody else to keep from standing out he hated that but saw no way around it featherston went on they say showings better than telling and i guess theyre right weve been telling people whats wrong with the confederate states for more than ten years now and not enough folks wanted to listen now the whigs have gone and shown we were right all along and all of a sudden everybodys paying attention to us i wish to heaven it didnt have to happen like this i truly do but here we are just the same to clarence potter staunch whig it wasnt much of a joke but people around him laughed featherston said im warning people right now its not a good idea to think about the freedom party like were just another bunch of politicians cries of no and hell no and better not rang from the crowd featherston let them spread through hampton park then raised his hands again this time silence fell at once into it he said we are the confederacys destiny we are the confederacys future were giving our dear country a faith and a will again we have to concentrate all our strength on action revolutionary action because were going that way were gathering into our ranks every last member of the confederate people who still has energy and nervethats you folks and im glad of it people were even more eager to applaud themselves than they were to applaud jake featherston again potter had to clap too as he did he reluctantly nodded hes shrewder than he used to be he thought he doesnt just think of himself any more but that wasnt right no he lets people think hes thinking about them inside hes still the same coldblooded snake he always was burton mitchel wants to cozy up to the united states the usa saved his bacon once featherston shouted but the united states cant save his bacon this time around on account of they havent got any bacon of their own and even if they did do yall want to be the usas tagalong little brother from now till the end of time some people shouted no others shouted things a good deal more incendiary potter would never have said anything like that where ladies might hear but then not ten feet away from him a woman who looked like a schoolteacher yelled something that would have made a sergeant a twentyyear veteran blush weve got us a duty a duty to be strong jake featherston declared weve got us a duty to stand up to the united states just as soon as we can and to do that weve got us a duty to put our own house in order weve got us a duty to put people back to work weve got us a duty to make sure they dont go hungry weve got us a duty to keep the niggers in their place and not to let them steal work from white folks and weve got us a duty to remember what the confederate states of america are all about and folks what were about is freedom the great roar staggered potter yall remember that featherston said remember it every single day when you see the liars and the cheats getting together dont let em get away with it smash em up how can you have freedom when the rich folks want to take it away from you does he see the irony there potter wondered does he see it and not care or does it go right by him as the crowd roared as jake featherston wished them a happy new year and exhorted them to vote for the party in november potter wondered which of those possibilities frightened him worse w hen jake featherston came through south carolina on his speaking tour anne colleton tried to see him she tried and she failed featherston wouldnt talk to her a flunky told her he wasnt available she fumed for days afterwards she wasnt used to getting brushed off her habit in fact was to brush off others featherston annoyed her enough to make her wonder if she shouldnt stay a whig after all in the end what made her decide she had to swallow her pride was the thought that staying a whig meant admitting clarence potter had been right all along if he had why had she broken up with him over their political differences staying a whig would mean swallowing her pride too and swallowing it in front of an old lover she preferred making up with jake featherston to that after the papers announced featherstons return to richmond she sent a telegram to freedom party headquarters shall i come north to talk things over the answer at least returned promptly come ahead convince ferd koenig then well see featherston anne said something extremely unladylike as she crumpled up the telegram and threw it in the trash having to talk with anyone except jake featherston himself was galling but ferdinand koenig wasnt a flunky or not precisely a flunky hed been in the freedom party even longer than featherston had and had twice been his running mate on the party ticket the main difference between him and jake was that he wasnt colorful and so swallowing her pride again anne wired arrive next tuesday looking forward to meeting mr koenig as she usually did when coming up to richmond she booked a room in fords hotel just north of capitol square the room she got gave her a fine view of the square in happier times it would have been a peaceful restful patriotic view she could have looked out on the grass and on the splendid statues of george washington and albert sidney johnston she could still see the statues tents and shanties swallowed almost all the winterbrown grass men walked aimlessly from one to another some smoking some sipping from whiskey bottles here and there women hung out laundry on lines that ran from tents to trees children ran this way and that columbia and charleston had shantytowns too even st matthews had a little one but anne had never seen any to match richmonds the capital of the confederate states was a great city when things went wrong they went wrong more visibly here than anywhere else she asked the house detective how bad are things will my clothes and suitcases still be in my room when i get back likely so maam he answered we work hard at keeping the trash out of the hotel we had some trouble with that when things first went sour but we dont let it happen any more its just a matter of taking pains giving pains too she thought the house dick was about six feet three with shoulders wide as a barn door he wasnt visibly armed but she was sure he had brass knucks or a blackjack stashed where he could get at them in a hurry she wouldnt have wanted to run into him if he found her anywhere she wasnt supposed to be when she waited on the street for a taxi though beggars hurried across capitol street to try to pry money out of her she knew that if she gave anything to anybody none of them would ever leave her at peace closing the motorcar door on them was a relief where to maam the cabby asked freedom party headquarters anne answered she wondered if she would have to give him the address as things turned out she didnt the driver nodded take you right over there it aint far at all im thinking about voting that way myself come november matter of fact alert guards armed with bayoneted tredegars stood outside the headquarters they wore what was almost but not quite confederate army uniform their clothes werent quite the same as what the tin hats put on these men looked somehow more menacing than most members of the big veterans outfit anne didnt know whether that was the cut of their uniforms or the expressions on their faces some of each she thought youre mrs colleton come to see mr koenig one of them asked anne shook her head im miss colleton and youd better remember it sorry the disconcerted guard muttered and passed her on into the building she had to ask two more people how to find ferdinand koenigs office which struck her as inefficient when at last she got there a pretty secretary led her inside koenig looked like a man whod done time in the trenches he had fierce eyebrows a jutting jaw and a rumbling baritone voice good to see you again miss colleton he said its been a few years hasnt it sit down make yourself at home tell me why youve decided the freedom party isnt such a bad thing after all he looked like a bruiser he didnt sound like one though hed been jake featherstons righthand man for a long time now that almost certainly meant he could think as well as break heads anne said when i left the party you were still tainted by what grady calkins did our politics have never been that far apart whether i was formally with you or not youre saying youre a fairweather friend youll back us if we look like winners and dump us if we dont koenig said question is in that case why should we want to have anything to do with you because were going the same way because i can help you get there youll know what i did in south carolina when i wasnt with you i was trying to bring the whigs more into line with what youve been saying all along ferdinand koenig paused to light a cigarette after blowing out a cloud of smoke he said and you were doing us a favor by this you say no i dont think so and that isnt what i said anne answered but i think i was doing the country a favor thats what this is really all about isnt itwhat happens to the confederate states i mean another cloud of smoke rose from koenig thats some of what this is about he said at last the rest of it is why should we trust you now you walked away once walked away and left us in the lurch who says you wont do it again no one at all if i dont happen to like the way youre going anne said but as long as were heading in the same direction wouldnt you rather have me on your side than against you maybe he answered maybe not too his eyes measured her she didnt care for that gaze koenig might have been looking at her over the sights of a rifle you dont pull any punches though do you i try not to anne said getting straight to the point saves time maybe koenig said again he didnt say anything more till hed finished the cigarette and stubbed it out in an brass ashtray made from the base of a shell casing then he went on you talk a good game i will say that for you im not going to tell you yes or no im going to pass you on to the sarge hell make up his mind and well go on from there how does that sound i came to richmond to see him anne answered ferdinand koenig shook his head no you came up here to see me remember now youve passed the first test so you get to see him see the difference yes anne said though shed always assumed she would pass it well come on then koenig heaved his bulk out of the chair he led her down the hall up a flight of stairs along the corresponding hall on the next floor up and into an office the secretary there wasnt decorative she was in fact severely plain that probably meant she was very good at what she did koenig nodded to her morning lulu heres miss colleton to see the boss lulu gave anne the onceover she sniffed as if to say what can you do anne bristled the secretary took no notice of that at all with a small sigh she said go right in miss collins hell be expecting you she wasnt the sort whod get names wrong by accident that meant shed done it on purpose anne bristled all over again and again got nothing resembling a rise from lulu when she walked into jake featherstons office the leader of the freedom party rose and leaned across the desk to shake her hand he wasnt handsome still those strong bony features and the energy that sparked from him made mere handsomeness seem insipid anne had had that thought before sit down he said waving her to a chair sit down and tell me why i should pay any attention to you after you went and left us when we needed you bad he hadnt forgotten anne doubted he ever forgot anything that went against him they werent so far apart there she answered two reasons my money and my brains he frowned if you had any brains you never wouldve walked out on us in the first place no anne shook her head i back winners if you think you looked like a winner after calkins killed president hampton youre not as smart as you think you are but times are hard again and in hard times the freedom party shines so here i am how many people gave him such straight talk not many anne suspected what would he do when he heard it get angry yes by the slow flush that mounted to his cheeks and by the way his eyes flashed but he held it in saying youre a cool one arent you youre telling me straight out youd walk away again if you saw us in trouble no anne replied what im telling you is this time i expect you to win and you want to come along for the ride featherston said of course i do anne answered sooner or later were going to have some things to say to the united states if you dont think i want to be part of that you dont know me at all and i can help at your rallies youre still using tricks i figured out for you ten years ago and you know it you spent the last few years trying to teach the whigs new tricks he said yes and theyre old dogsthey couldnt learn them anne answered theyve been in power too long they cant learn anything any more thats why theyve got to go theyre dogs all right the sons of featherston caught himself well i have plans for them too youd best believe that way theyve stomped on the people of the confederate states youre dead right theyve got to go miss colleton and i aim to get rid of em anne wondered how he meant that literally she knew he was ruthless was he that ruthless maybe she wouldnt have been astonished but even the most ruthless man faced a formidable barrier of law anne nodded to herself here that kind of barrier might not be bad at all you come back in youll follow the party line jake featherston asked youll do as i say was what he meant anne had never been one to do as anybody said but if she said no shed have no place in the freedom party not now not ever that was ever so clear this is why you came to richmond she reminded herself do you want to go home emptyhanded part of her said she did she ignored it nodding to featherston she said yes ill do that he didnt warn herno youd better or anything like that good he said weve got a deal he didnt ask for her soul either but why would he shed just handed it to him americanempire thecentercannothold xiii t he alarm clock jangled bouncing jefferson pinkard out of bed at what he reckoned an ungodly early hour his shift at the birmingham jail started an hour and a half earlier than hed gone to the sloss works he yawned lurched into the bathroom of his downtown flatone more thing he was getting used to after so long in company housingbrushed his teeth lathered his face and slid a straight razor over his cheeks and then went into the kitchen and made coffee and the inevitable bacon and eggs on the fancy newfangled gasburning stove in there thus fortified he got out of his nightshirt and into the gray jailers uniform hed worn since caleb briggs found out the sloss works had given him the boot he planted his widebrimmed hat on his head at a jaunty angle and looked at himself in the mirror his reflection happily nodded approval at him im hot stuff no two ways about it he said and that reflection did not presume to disagree he put his nightstick on his belt and headed out the door hed toted longer heavier bludgeons while breaking up whig rallies with his freedom party pals but he supposed he understood why jailers didnt usually carry guns if something went wrong that would give prisoners deadly weapons which was the last thing anybody wanted people got out of his way when he walked down the street in that uniform he liked that hed never had it happen before except when he was in the company of a lot of his pals all of them in white shirts and butternut pants all of them readyeven eagerfor trouble now he strode along by himself but men and women still made way for him he lit a cigarette and blew out a cheerful cloud of smoke birmingham city jail was a squat redbrick building that looked like a fortress as far as jeff was concerned it looked just the way it was supposed to he tipped his hat to a policeman in an almost identical uniform coming out mornin howard he said freedom mornin jeff same to you the cop answered a lot of policemen in birmingham belonged to the freedom party pinkard had seen some of them at meetings since becoming a jailer hed found out that a good many who didnt go to meetings or knock heads were members just the same some policemen felt they shouldnt flaunt their politics but that didnt mean they had none inside the city jail jeff stuck his card in a time clock just like the one at the sloss works except for being painted gray rather than black he stuck his head into the cramped little office where he had a battered desk mornin billy he said to his nightshift counterpart who was writing a report at an equally beatup desk whats new for me not a whole hell of a lot billy fraser answered he was about jeffs age and like him a veteranprecious few white men of their generation in the csa hadnt gone to the front a couple of niggers in for drunk and disorderly and one burglar who was the easiest collar youd ever wantdumb asshole fell out a secondstory window making his getaway and broke his ankle yell he let out woke up the whole goddamn block they were beating on him pretty good he was probably glad when the cops pulled the citizens off him and hauled him away dont reckon we have to worry about him bustin out for a while pinkard said with a chuckle hell no fraser said like i told you a quiet night jeff nodded anything else i need to know dont reckon so the other man answered he threw the report in his out basket and got to his feet gonna head on home and catch me some shuteye see you tomorrow freedom freedom pinkard echoed get some rest i dont expect the bastards weve got locked up are going anywhere much they better not billy fraser said thatd leave us some pretty tall explaining to do he grabbed his hatthe twin of jeffsfrom the rack stuck it on his head and went out whistling the pennsylvania rag a tune that had been popular during the early days of the great war back when the csa had held a large part of pennsylvania the first thing jefferson pinkard did then was look at the report fraser had written it was meant for the warden not for him but he didnt care about that hed discovered billy sometimes wrote things down that he forgot to say things jeff needed to know nothing like that was in there today but you never could tell when you were dealing with prisoners you couldnt be too careful either if his experience in the empire of mexico had taught him anything that was it after jeff put the report back where hed got it he ambled down to the kitchen and snagged himself a cup of coffee he snagged a roll too one of the colored cooks clucked reproachfully at that but he was grinning while he did it a grin that showed several gold teeth jeff grinned back he had no trouble with negroes as long as they remembered who the boss was after he did that he prowled through the whole jail peering into every cell to see who was where he couldnt take the prisoners out of the cells and line them up for roll call the way he had down in mexico hed had all the room in the world down there hed built his prison camp on the loneliest stretch of ground he could find things were different in birmingham but he wanted to know as much about what was going on as he could i aint run away jailer man said a negro named ajax who was doing a year for beating up another man whom hed caught using loaded dice the victim was also black had he been white ajax would have faced a lot more time behind bars is still here you dont got to check on me every mornin morning i dont check on you is probably the morning youll try some damnfool thing or other pinkard answered more i check harder it is for me to get a nasty surprise ajax reproachfully clicked his tongue between his teeth you aint no fun atall he said you wanted fun you shoulda thought twice about pounding on that other nigger jeff said that cheatin son of a bitch won ten dollars o my money with them goddamn dice ajax exclaimed nothing but indignation in his voice i see him when i gits out o here i kick his shiftless ass again teach him not to try none o that shit no more if jail was supposed to rehabilitate it wasnt working with the aggrieved ajax but jeff didnt think jail was supposed to rehabilitate like the other jailers he was getting to know he thought it was supposed to keep people who belonged there inside till it was time to let them out again he didnt worry his head about who belonged and who didnt either figuring that out wasnt his job as far as he was concerned if somebody ended up in the birmingham city jail he damn well belonged there by the time his rounds ended the trusties were going through the corridors serving breakfast to the other prisoners jeff didnt like that either he thought using trusties begged for trouble because they were so likely to be anything but but the jail didnt have the money to hire enough guards to do everything inside that needed doing and so trusties took care of a lot of work he scowled at them as he headed back to his office how much contraband did they smuggle in they knew nobody else did he was halfway through a circuit of the jail before lunch when one of the corridor guards waved to him and called hold on there warden wants to see you in his office right away does he jeff said uselessly the guard nodded as if to affirm he hadnt been kidding what the hell does he think i did pinkard muttered the guard didnt hear that a prisoner did and leered at jeff as far as the former steelworker knew the boss wanted to see you only when you were in trouble still cursing under his breath he walked to the wardens office ewell mcdonald had all to himself more space than jeff and the other assistant jailers put together he was a beefy man in his early sixties with his silver hair greased down and with a bushy gray mustache hed probably worn since it was dark and stylish back in the s he heaved himself out of his swivel chair and stuck out a wellmanicured hand for jeff to shake sit down pinkard sit down he boomed sounding more like a politician on the stump than anything else sit down and make yourself comfortable uh thank you kindly sir jeff replied wondering when and how and why mcdonald was going to lower the boom on him what can i do for you might as well make it short and sweet he thought instead of answering right away mcdonald reached into his desk and pulled out a bottle of whiskey pinkards eyes widened slightly or more than slightly alabama was a dry state though there were ways around that he knew as much he didnt expect the warden of the birmingham city jail to know it or at least to show he knew it to a man he was going to bawl out but ewell mcdonald yanked out the cork swigged and then passed the bottle across the wide expanse of his desk to jeff here you go pinkard he said have a snort thank you kindly pinkard said again he knew he sounded bewildered but couldnt help it after he drank he whistled appreciatively that was real whiskey not something cooked up in a hurry over an illegal still he hadnt drunk anything so tasty in quite a while he passed the bottle back more worried than ever mcdonald wouldnt waste that kind of whiskey on him if he were in only a little trouble but the warden beamed at him you know pinkard when i hired you i reckoned i was stuck with you on account of freedom party business he said happens sometimes nothing you can do but make the best of it but ill be goddamned if you aint pulled your weight and then some you werent lyin bout that prisoncamp business down in mexico were you lying sir pinkard shook his head hell no i did all that stuff i guess maybe you did mcdonald said i wouldnt have bet on it when i took you on ill tell you that but youve worked out fine hell son youre doing better than some of the fellows whove been here ten years he grabbed the whiskey bottle and tilted it back for another knock thank you very much sir jeff said more than a little dazedly hed thought the same thing himself but hed never dreamt the warden would come out and say so thank you very much ive learned a hell of a lot here too down in mexico i was making it up as i went along youall really know what youre doing some of the time maybe mcdonald said but i like the way you prowl the cells i like that a lot nothings going to happen unless you know about it first is it well i hope not pinkard answered you can never be sure but i hope not long as you know you can never be sure you wont do too bad the warden pushed the bottle across the desk again go ahead youve earned it dont mind if i do as ewell mcdonald had jeff took a long pull at the bottle smooth fire ran down his throat ahh thats mighty fine he said and then laughed prisonersll smell it on my breath and say ive been drinking on the job mcdonald laughed too they dont like it you tell em they can take it up with the warden he corked the whiskey bottle and stuck it back in his drawer however you did it im glad you found your way here youre goddamn good at this business you hear what im telling you thanks jeff said once more yes he did feel dazed and not just on account of unaccustomed morning slugs of whiskey how long had he been at the sloss works without ever hearing anybody tell him anything like that too long he thought as he got to his feet much too damn long i n the summertime heat and humidity could make augusta close to unbearable especially for negroes in the crowded quarters of the terry when scipio got the chance he liked to bring his family up to allen park and relax in the fresh air under the shade of the trees that grew thickly there he and bathsheba and the children would lie on the grass on a sunday afternoon and watch people with more energyand he was convinced less senseplay volleyball or throw around a football allen park was in the white part of town but close enough to the terry that negroes often used it scipio would gladly have gone to a park inside the terry but nobodyd bothered leaving any open space for a park there he wasnt surprised how could he have been when hed lived in the confederate states all his life whites got whatever they needed and whatever they wanted if anything happened to be left over after that negroes got it if nothing happened to be left over well too bad that was how whites saw things anyhow and then theyd been shocked when blacks rose up against them in red revolt during the great war scipio had thought that a damnfool idea because hed been all too sure the revolts would failas they had nothing made the whites fight hard like seeing their privileges threatened but fearing failure didnt mean scipio hadnt understood the impulse to hit back as hard as his own people could one lazy july sunday after finishing a picnic lunch bathsheba pointed to a sheet of paper stuck to the trunk of an oak not far away whats that say xerxes she asked scipio took his alias for granted he also took being asked such questions for granted bathsheba couldnt read or write i goes and looks he answered climbing to his feet full of fried chicken and yams he ambled slowly over to the tree read the paper and came back to sit down on the grass again well his wife asked well antoinette echoed she was six now which astounded scipio every time he thought about it and cassiusnamed though scipio had never said so for the red rebel in the swamps of the congaree riverwas already three which astonished him even more but he shook his head aint so well he said the thick patois of the congaree made him sound more ignorant than bathsheba whose accent was milder big freedom party rally here two weeks from now the corners of bathshebas wide generous mouth turned down youre right she said that aint so good that aint no good at all thought them people was all over and done with but now theyre back now theys back scipio echoed somberly times is hard de buckra deys scared when deys scared dey starts yellin freedom if they want it so bad how come they dont want to let us have none bathsheba asked dey does dat who dey gots to tink days bettern scipio didnt hide his bitterness ought to tear that sheet o paper down bathsheba said do jesus no scipio exclaimed anybody see me do dat my life aint worth a penny an deys bound to be plenty more o they papers dont put up no notice like dat in jus de one place tearin it down dont do no good she didnt argue with him but she didnt look as if she agreed with him either when they walked back to their flat scipio saw more freedom party notices he wondered how hed missed them coming up to allen park maybe he hadnt wanted to see them and so had turned his eye aside hed expected to pay no attention to the rally what else was a negro supposed to do with anything pertaining to confederate politics especially with a part of confederate politics of which he disapproved but this rally very much in the frightening freedom party style of ten years before refused to let augustas negroes ignore it for one thing it was enormous scipio didnt know exactly how many white men thronged to it but he could hear great roars of freedom coming from the park again and again though it was blocks away from his familys apartment building why they yellin like that pa antoinette asked scipio wished he knew what he was supposed to tell her on account o dey dont like what de gummint doin he answered at last she could have left it there scipio wished she would have left it there instead with a childs persistence she asked the inevitable childs question why theyre some o the buckra what have it in for black folks bathsheba said when scipio hesitated that satisfied their daughter no negro no matter how young could help knowing plenty of whites in the confederate states had it in for blacks if any negro from augusta hadnt known it the ralliers did their best to drive it home they swarmed out of the park and into the terry shouting freedom all the while a few policemen came with the long sinewy column but more to observe it than to check it had the freedom party men turned on the police they could have got rid of them in moments and then rampaged through the terry altogether out of control they could have but they didnt scipio didnt even think they beat anybody up they just marched and yelled and marched and yelled in a way that was a relief in another way it left scipio all the more terrified not least because of the discipline it showed it was sending a message this is what our people do when we tell them to do this if we tell them to do something else scipio shivered at what the freedom party might do then and would that handful of policemen try to stop them could they if they tried neither struck him as likely he made a point of getting to erasmus fish store and restaurant early the next morning he still didnt get there as early as his boss mornin xerxes erasmus said when scipio came through the door how you is i been better scipio answered buckra march underneath my window yesterday dont like that none not even a lil bit erasmus nodded gloomily they go past my front door too he said no i dont like that none neither they scared when they scared they do somethin stupid do somethin big an stupid scipio agreed burn down de terry maybe de po lice dey dont stop em if dey tries reckon not erasmus agreed reckon the po lice do trythey aint all bad men reckon they try but i dont reckon they kin do much neither where dat leave we scipio answered his own question in trouble dat where erasmus looked at him yous a black man in the csa he said you think you aint been in trouble since the day you was born i was borned in slavery days same as you scipio said i knows all about dat kind o trouble but de freedom party dey worsen usual he waited to see whether erasmus would try to argue with him if his boss did he intended to argue right back but erasmus slowly nodded reckon yous right didnt used to think so i reckoned them crazy buckrad find somethin new to git all hot an bothered about they been around for moren ten years now though dont reckon theys goin noplace wish they wouldwish dey go far away an never come back no more scipio said they gwine win plenty o new seats in the lection come fall too gods will erasmus said we is a sinful lot and the good lord he make us pay before scipio could think about it he shook his head i dont care none how sinful we is he said de lord cant hate we enough to give we what de freedom party want to give we would he have had such thoughts before he got mixed up with the red negroes whod led the uprising in he didnt know for certain but had his doubts the lord do what he want to do not what we wants him to do erasmus said blessed be the name o the lord lord help he what help hisself scipio replied de freedom party git stronger i reckon maybe niggers gots to help theyselves was he really saying that after watching from the inside the destruction of the congaree socialist republic could he really be saying that he could he was we rise up against the buckra again we lose again you knows it too erasmus sounded very sure and scipio did know it too blacks in the csa couldnt hope to beat whites hed thought as much before the rising of and hed proved right on the other hand de freedom party git stronger we lose if we dont rise up too erasmus didnt answer him maybe that meant there was no answer he hoped it didnt but feared it did three days later he got an answer of sorts after finishing at erasmus he went into the white part of augusta to visit a couple of toy stores that had a better selectionand better pricesthan any in the terry coming home with something new and amusingit didnt have to be very big or very fancywas a good way to delight his children having been childless for so long scipio found he took enormous delight in making them happy now that he had them he found a doll for antoinette one that closed its eyes when it lay down it was of course white with golden hair and blue eyes hed never seen a doll with dark features like his own hed scarcely imagined there might be such a thing whites dominated the confederate states in ways neither they nor the negro minority quite understood no matter what this doll looked like scipio knew his little girl would enjoy it he set money on the counter before asking the clerk for it to that extent he did understand how things worked in the csa but the clerk once he had the price was polite enough saying here you are have a good evening thank you suh scipio answered he started for the door and had just set his hand on the knob when he heard a scuffle outside and then a mans shout of pain from behind him the clerk said maybe you dont want to go out there right now freedom party hasnt always been nice to colored folks they catch out in the evening hasnt always been nice to seemed to translate into is beating the stuffing out of scipios first emotion was raw fear his next was shame that he couldnt help the luckless negro the goons had found he felt gratitude toward the clerk gratitude mixed with resentment ought to call the cops he said as close as he dared come to letting that resentment show ive done it before the man answered they dont usually come for a call like that im sorry but they dont erasmus had insisted the augusta police werent all bad men maybe he was right scipio found it harder to believe now he did nod to the clerk thank you fo tryin suh he said not all whites were bad he was reasonably sure of that a little while after the sounds of violence ended scipio left the toy store and hurried back to the terry he got home safe his daughter did love the doll everything should have been fine and it would have been if only he could have forgotten what had happened in the white part of town as things were he got very little sleep that night w hen the train pulled into abilene texas jake featherston knew he was in a different world from the one hed left the plains seemed to go on forever dust was in the air this wasnt the narrow confined landscape of virginia no wonder texans had a reputation for thinking big but texas itself wasnt so big as it had been not far west of abilene texas abruptly stopped what the damnyankees called the state of houston began that was why jake had come all the way out here to make a speech as close to what he still called occupied territory as he could the train stopped his bodyguards got up ready to precede him out onto the platform looking out there one of them said its all right willy knights there waitin for us hell its all right pete another guard said what if that knight bastards the one who wants to try and get rid o the boss pete an innocent soul looked shocked jake wasnt willy knights redemption league might have swallowed up the freedom party instead of the other way round it hadnt though and knight couldnt be happy that he wasnt the biggest fish in the pond the way hed dreamt of being still if he wants to put me six feet under reckon he can do it featherston said this is his part of the country he can hire more guns than i can bring along but if you stick your head in the lions mouth and get away with it after that the lion knows whos number one thats what were gonna do here when jake stepped out onto the platform the band struck up a sprightly version of dixie people cheered jake took off his hat and waved it willy knight stepped forward to shake his hand as the two freedom party leaders met photographers took pictures the flashes made featherstons eyes water welcome to texas jakewhats left of it knight said a broad smile on his handsome face thank you kindly my friend featherston lied through his teeth well see what we can do about getting back what the usa stole from us how are you going to do that a reporter shouted the yankees wont pay any attention to us they dont have to pay any attention to the csa not as long as the whigs hold on to richmond jake answered the whigs say we lost the war and so were stuckstuck forever and we are too long as we think that way but even the yankees knew better after we whipped em they set up remembrance day so they wouldnt forget what happened the whigs want to forgetthey want to pretend all their mistakes never happened at all and they want the country to forget me i dont intend to thats right willy knight nodded vigorously thats just exactly right here in texas we live with that every day when we look west and see what the united states did to us the reporters scribbled jake sent knight a sour look the texan wanted to be part of the story too if you wanted to horn in on this whyd you invite me out here to the middle of nowhere featherston thought but he knew the answer knew it all too well because you still want to be top dog thats why you son of a bitch most ways having ambitious men in the party was wonderful they worked hard for their own good as well as its but having them here meant jake could never stop watching his back im making my main speech at a park west of town isnt that right he asked knight though he also knew that answer almost within spitting range of what they call houston spittings not half what they deserve either sure isnt knight said if the people in occupied texas ever got the chance to vote theyd come back to the confederate states in a redhot minute same with kentucky featherston agreed same with sequoyah he had mixed feelings about sequoyahit was after all full of redskins and he had little more use for them than he had for niggers the usa had even less use for indians sequoyah remained occupied territory while houston and kentucky were fullfledged us states but sequoyah was also full of oil and gas and cars and trucks and aeroplanes meant the confederate states needed all the oil and gas they could lay their hands on if the redskins came along too then they did that was all at least theyd been loyal during the war unlike the blacks in the confederacy take you to the hotel first if that suits you knight said give you a chance to freshen up maybe rest a little bit before you go out and give your speech you arent set to start till six you know oh yeah jake nodded as they left the platform together that way its eight oclock back on the east coasta good time for folks on the wireless web to listen in he laughed who wouldve reckoned a few years back that wed have to worry about such things times are changingif we dont change with em were in trouble thats whats wrong with the whigs knight said theyre a bunch of damn dinosaurs is what they are dinosaurs had been much in the news lately a team of japanese scientists in mongolia had come back with not only spectacular skeletons but also some of the first dinosaur eggs ever seen theyd sent some of their specimens to the museum of natural history in richmond where theyd drawn record crowds jake liked the phrase too it captured exactly what he felt about the whigs he slapped willy knight on the back they sure are he said you took the words right out of my mouth matter of factim aiming to call em that very thing tonight and so he was even if he hadnt been a moment before good knight said not suspecting featherston was stealing his figure of speech driving through abilene was depressing the town had flourished in the years just before the great war and like so much of the confederacy languished since timber buildings looked sunblasted brick ones looked old before their time as he did all over the csa jake saw men sleeping on park benches and in bushes and others prowling the streets looking for food or work the hotel seemed as gloomy as the rest of the place ceiling fans spun lazily in the lobby stirring the air without cooling it much the carpet was shabby the walls needed painting the clerk behind the registration desk seemed pathetically glad to have anybody come in welcome to abilene sir he said as he gave jake his key thanks jake replied in lieu of what he really thought freedom uh freedom the clerk said but not as if he were a party man since featherston was due to speak at six he and willy knight ate an early supper enormous slabs of steak a texas specialty texas wasnt dry they could drink beer without breaking the law knight swallowed a big piece of rare meat and then said god damn you jake i thought you were buzzard bait but you turned out to be right all along our time is coming i always said so featherston cocked his head to one side you reckoned we were going down the drain and youd pick up the pieces the mixed metaphor didnt faze the former head of the redemption league damn right i did this party was drying up and blowing away four years ago he cut off another chunk of steak by the way he did it he would sooner have stuck the knife into featherston amos mizell and i we were ready to get on another horse the party did jussst well enoughhe stretched the word into a long hissto keep us on board but now jake finished for him now were back in business we are knight nodded hell with me if were not id take my hat off to you if i was wearing it all through everything you said this was going to happen one of these days you said so and you were right you bet i was featherston said adding you stinking bastard to himself come november were going to pick up a hell of a lot more seats in the house well pick up some in the senate too from states where we got control of the legislature two years ago and two years from now two years from now by god even in the dimly lit steakhouse a feral glow shone in his eyes yeah that same glow lit willy knights face he and jake nodded to each other both men had been hungry hungry in the spirit for a long long time and at last they thought they could see satisfaction on the horizon softly jake said if things go our way two years from now im going to pay back every blueblooded bastard and every nigger who ever did me wrong and im going to put this poor sorry country back on its feet again yeah knight said again as with featherston he sounded more as if he looked forward to revenge than to rebuilding he added weve got the united states to pay back too i havent forgotten jake said dont you worry about that willy i havent forgotten at all thats why i came out hereto help everybody remember when he got to the park it was filling up fast bare bulbs bathed the platform from which he would speak though the sun hadnt set yet as he walked up onto the platform and over to the microphone that would send his words across the csa a frightening almost savage roar went up from the crowd he hoped the microphone would pick it up he wanted people to get all hot and bothered when they heard him or thought about him hello friends he said at six on the dot im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth the truth is the united states are afraid of us you look across what they call the border you look into what they call houston and youll know its the truth if they let people over there vote which country they wanted to belong to they know what would happen you know what would happen too texas would be itself again and so the yankees dont let em vote cheers in abilene had that savage edge too here not far from the border people feared the united states whether the united states feared them or not jake went on the usa wont let people in kentucky vote on that either or people in sequoyah they know where the people would go and they dont aim to let em why theyre scared thats why he pointed east a gesture full of contempt and do the whigs way over there in richmond the whigs whove been running this country ever since the war of secession do they do anything about it do they push the usa to let the folks in houston houston and kentucky and sequoyah vote about who they want to belong to do they do they noooo he made the word a howl of rage theyre nothing but a pack of dinosaurs is what they are and you know what youve got to do with dinosaurs dont you send em to the museum a vast roar went up featherston looked back at willy knight standing there behind him they grinned at each other knight was happy about his own cleverness even though he thought featherston had had the idea on his own too jake was happy about how well the line had gone over he knew hed stolen it knew and didnt care the point was it did what he wanted and nobody else in the whole wide world knew or cared where hed got it little by little party men turned the roar into a chant freedom freedom freedom the crowd followed along the chant went on till jakes head rang with it he raised his hands quiet slowly returned into it he said come november you get your chance to send some more whigs to the museum i know youll take care of it friends folks who think theyre smart used to say the freedom party was dead well show em whos dead see if we dont and who needs burying too were not dead by god were just getting started another roar went up one that told him hed found a brandnew slogan h asta luego hipolito rodriguez told his wife im going into baroyeca ill vote and then im going to stay to see how the election turns out magdalena wagged a finger at him and in between times youll sit in la culebra verde and waste money on cerveza if a man cant have a beer or two with his friends the world is in a sorry state indeed rodriguez said with dignity a beer or two or four or six magdalena wagged that finger again but indulgently go on have a good time i will say youve never been one to sit in the cantina all the time and come home drunk four days a week libertad libertad rodriguez echoed he put a serape on over his shirt the weather was about as chilly as it ever got around baroyeca he put on a widebrimmed straw hat too it wasnt raining but looked as if it might the polling place was in one room of the mayors house more often than not rodriguez still thought of the mayor as the alcalde even though sonora had belonged to the csa longer than hed been alive the old spanish forms died hard especially here in the south he gave his name signed on the appropriate line in the record book and took his ballot into a voting booth he voted for the freedom party candidates for congress for his state legislature and for governor of sonora when hed finished he folded the ballot gave it to a waiting clerk and watched till the man put it into a ballot box senor rodriguez has voted the clerk intoned a formula as full of ritual as any in the mass as rodriguez left the mayors office jaime diaz came towards it they exchanged greetings from within someone called out a warning no electioneering within a hundred feet of the polling place that too was ritual rodriguez snorted electioneering he said all i want to do is say hello i cant chat anyhow diaz said ive got esteban back at the general store and he cant count to eleven without looking at his toes so i have to get back there as fast as i can well talk some other time then rodriguez said adios he didnt say libertad the fellow inside had warned him against electioneering when he wandered over to la culebra verde he found it crowded many of the men sitting and drinking had worked in the silver mines that went bellyup soon after the stock market sank these days the miners didnt have much to do with their time but sit around and drink rodriguez wondered where some of them came up with the dimes they used to buy beer but that wasnt his worry a lot of the miners he suspected would spend money on cerveza before they spent it on their families that wasnt the way he would have done it but they wouldnt care carlos ruiz waved to him he waved back bought himself a bottle of beer and joined his friend at a corner table ruiz was also a farmer he might not have a lot of dimeswhat farmer ever had a lot of moneybut he did still have some income have you voted he asked as rodriguez sat down across from him oh yes libertad rodriguez answered he kept his voice down though some people came into the cantina to brawl as well as to drink arguments over politics gave them a good excuse rodriguez had seen enough fighting during the great war that he never wanted to see any more libertad ruiz said also quietly i think we are going to do very well this year i hope so rodriguez said a pity though that it takes trouble to show people what they should have been doing all along his friend shrugged if youre fat and happy do you want to change of course not you keep on doing what you always did after all thats what made you fat and happy si you need a jolt to want to change much truth in that rodriguez agreed but the whole country got a jolt in too many people try to pretend it never happened ah well asi es la vida he shrugged too and took a pull at the beer the question that had occurred to rodriguez was also on the minds of the outofwork miners one of them asked the man behind the bar for another beer saying you know ill pay you soon felipe felipe shook his head lo siento antonio but if you pay me soon youll get your beer soon tooas soon as you pay me as a matter of fact i cant carry people the way i could when times were better i hardly make enough money to keep this place open as is rodriguez had his doubts about that if a cantina couldnt make money what could probably nothing after all what did hard times do they drove men to drink my wife is going to get a job any day now antonio whined ill have the money by god i will womens jobs in baroyeca were even harder to come by than those for men there was of course one obvious exception somebody behind antoniorodriguez couldnt see whosaid shell have a nice comfortable time of it too working on her back rodriguez didnt think the man who made the crack intended antonio to recognize his voice either coming from nowhere in particular a gibe like that might be tolerated but antonio whirled shouted chinga tu madre and threw himself at another miner they rolled on the floor cursing and clawing and pounding at each other felipe kept a club under the bar rodriguez had seen him take it out before mostly to brandish it for effect hed never seen a sawedoff shotgun come out from under there before men dove away from the two battling miners enough felipe yelled antonio and his foe both froze the bartender gestured with the shotgun take it outside dont come back eitherand that goes for both of you outor else i blow holes in you out they went rodriguez realized he was holding his beer bottle by the neck ready to use it as a club or break it against the table for a nastier weapon hed also scooted back his chair so he could dive under the table if he had to across from him ruiz was just as ready to fight or take cover very slowly and carefully rodriguez set down the bottle some of the things we learned in the war dont want to go away he remarked sadly youre right ruiz said its terrible that we should remember all the best ways to kill the other fellow and keep him from killing us as felipe made the shotgun disappear rodriguez nodded of course most of the men who didnt learn those ways are dead now he said and a lot of the ones who did learn are dead too a shell from the yanquis didnt care who it killed oh yes his friend nodded oh yes indeed ruizs face twisted as at some memory that wouldnt go away rodriguez didnt ask him about it he had memories of his own every once in a whilenot so often as right after the war when it would happen every week or twohe would wake up from a dream shuddering and drenched with sweat sometimes he would remember what hed seen in his sleep sometimes the details would be gone but the horror would remain he didnt scream very often any more that made him glad and magdalena no doubt gladder not wanting to think about such things he got up bought himself another beer and got one for carlos ruiz as well muchas gracias amigo ruiz said when he brought it back de nada rodriguez answered he sipped from the beer then asked the bartender que hora es felipe wore a big brass pocket watch on a chain it could have been a conductors watcha thought rodriguez wished he wouldnt have had since the railroad came to baroyeca no more the bartender made a small ceremony out of pulling it out and checking it son las cuatro y media he answered and made another ceremony of returning the watch to his pocket half past four rodriguez nodded gracias he said sure enough by the lengthening shadows outside the sun was getting low in the west ruiz said pretty soon we can go over to freedom party headquarters the trains may stay away but the telegraph still comes we can find out whats happening in the elections especially since the polls in the east of los estados confederados close earlier than they do here let me buy you a beer to pay you back for the one you so kindly got me and then well see what we see eh rodriguez was glad to let his friend buy him a beer he was a little elevatednot drunk but a little elevatedas he and ruiz walked down the street to the shopfront that said freedom andlibertad a couple of men were already there hola amigos robert quinn said in his accented spanish as rodriguez and ruiz came in three more men followed right behind them quinn went on libertad i wish we had a wireless set here this town needs electricity por dios if the mines had stayed open rodriguez began and then shrugged as if to say what can anyone do but quinn didnt have that attitude let the party come into power and well do something about the mines well do something about all sorts of things thats why youre here right you believe in doing things not in sitting around and waiting for them to happen is that why im here rodriguez wondered he thought he was here mostly because he couldnt stand the united states and wanted revenge on them but if that required doing other things then it did that was all a messenger from the telegraph office came in with a sheaf of flimsy yellow papers gracias quinn told him and gave him a dime he went through the telegrams in a hurry then he let out a banshee whoop of a sort rodriguez hadnt heard since his days in the trenches some of the men there had called the battle cry a rebel yell were winning quinn said virginia north carolina south carolina floridawherever i have returns were picking up seats in congress and in the state legislatures and our men running for governor are ahead in south carolina and florida and the race in virginia is still very close libertad libertad the freedom party men shouted rodriguez couldnt wait for results to start coming in from states closer to sonora to while away the time quinn pulled a whiskey bottle out of a desk drawer he took a pull himself then passed it around rodriguez had always thought whiskey tasted nasty he still did but that didnt keep him from swigging when the bottle got to him ahh he said the stuff might taste bad but he liked what it did more telegrams came in so did more people the freedom party didnt look as if it would win the governorship of virginia after all but it gained a senator from mississippi and another from tennessee before long it also picked up two more congressmen in alabama a senator from arkansas and several congressmen from eastern texas will we have a majority rodriguez asked even a few weeks before the question would have seemed unimaginable now now to his disappointment robert quinn shook his head no i dont think so he answered but were still doing better than anybody thought we could he pulled out a fresh bottle of whiskey and led the party men in a new shout of libertad an hour or so later returns from chihuahua started arriving the freedom party men in baroyeca cheered their candidate for governor there was well ahead of the radical liberal incumbent and in sonora itself two more congressional districts swung to the party as rodriguez had known he would be he was very late getting home that night but he hadnt knownhed had no ideahow happy he would be making that long walk in the dark l ucien galtier parked his motorcar in front of the house where his daughter nicole lived with dr leonard odoull nicole opened the door at his knock and gave him a hug hello papa she said its always good to see you is it galtier said i dont want to make a nuisance of myself since marie died hed started visiting his children as often as he could for one thing he was lonely for another he was sure he was the worlds worst cook any evening where he didnt have to eat what he turned out was an evening gained nicole made a face at him dont be silly you know youre welcome here as if to underscore that little lucien came running up shouting grandpere when galtier picked up his namesake the boy threw his arms around his neck and gave him a big sloppy kiss youre growing up galtier told him youre heavier every time i try to lift you he turned to his daughter it must be that you keep feeding him she snorted you sound like georges he must get his foolishness from you now come in for heavens sake sit down relax this is a strange word for a farmer to hear but galtier wasnt sorry to sit down on the sofa leonard odoull walked in a moment later with glasses of applejack and fine habana cigars i thank you very much galtier said accepting the brandy and the tobacco he raised his glass in salute to your good health and to yours his soninlaw answered they both drank as did nicole the applejack went down soft and sweet as a first kiss little lucien ran off to play odoull asked and how are you mon beaupere lucien shrugged as well as i can be i suppose it is not easy that was as much as he would say it would also do for an understatement till he found a bigger one which might come along oh a hundred years from now dr odoull looked sly but of course you have all the pretty ladies for miles around looking in your direction now that however unfortunately you are a single man once more he probably meant it for a joke in fact galtier was almost sure he meant it for a joke but that didnt mean it held no truth hed been amazed how many widows and maiden ladies had come to call on him to say how sorry they were that marie was gone and sometimes quite openly to size him up hed been even more amazed that a couple of farmers both in the most casual offhand way imaginable had brought up their marriageable daughters with him true he wasnt an old manhe wouldnt see sixty for a few years yetbut what would he do with an eighteen or twentyyearold girl oh there was one obvious answer but he couldnt even do that so often as he had when he was younger and if he were to have a wife younger than his youngest daughter wouldnt making love to her feel like molesting a child some men his age no doubt would have thought themselves lucky to get offers like those he didnt making a production out of lighting his cigar meant he didnt have to answer his soninlaw once he had it going once hed savored the fine mild smoke he asked and how is it with you here not too bad odoull answered nicole nodded galtier did too in approval the american sounded more like a quebecois with each passing year it wasnt just his accent though the years had also meant that riviereduloup supplanted paris in his french but americans from everything galtier had seen liked to brag not too bad was about as much as a man from this part of the world was ever likely to say dr odoull went on i wish i could do more about influenza and rheumatic fever and a dozen other sicknesses but i dont know of any other doctors anywhere else in the world who wouldnt say the same thing your glass is empty papa nicole said and then did something to correct that pour me full of applejack yes and how will i go home galtier asked not that he didnt want the freshened glass the one advantage a horse has over an automobile is that the horse knows the way you can sleep here you know youre welcome his daughter said he smiled he did know that hed even done it once or twice on nights when hed been too drunk to find the door let alone to fit the chevrolets key into the ignition he might even have slept better here than at home and that wasnt because hed been drunk trying to sleep alone in a bed where hed had marie beside him for so long he grimaced and took a quick nip from the brandy no that wasnt easy at all to keep from brooding about that empty bed back at the farmhouse he asked his soninlaw what do you think of the state of the world that was a question usually good for a long fruitful discussion galtier got one this time too but not of the sort hed expected the corners of dr odoulls normally smiling mouth turned down he said right this minute mon beaupere i like the state of the world not at all and why not galtier leaned forward ready to argue with what ever odoull said because i read the newspapers because i listen to what they say on the wireless odoull replied how could anyone like it when the freedom party doubles its vote in the confederate states they hold more than a third of the seats in the confederate congress now and heaven only knows what theyll do next with a shrug lucien said this to me is not so much of a much the confederate states are a long long way from riviereduloup his soninlaw looked startled yes thats true he said after a momentary hesitation i still think of myself as an american some ways i suppose ive been here more than fifteen years now so it could be that i shouldnt but i do it is not so bad that you do galtier said a man should know where he springs from if he does not know what he was how can he know what he is you sound like a quebecois all right leonard odoull smiled and why should i not lucien replied by the good god i know what i am but tell me mon beaufils why is this freedom party so bad for the united states because it is the confederate party for all those who dont want to live at peace with the united states odoull replied if it comes to power there will be trouble trouble is what its leader this man featherston stands for i see galtier rubbed his chin you say it is like the action francaise in france then or that other party the one whose name i always forget in england the silver shirts odoull nodded yes just like them he cocked his head to one side studying galtier and what do you think of the action francaise lucien galtier clicked his tongue between his teeth that is not an easy question for me to answer he said slowly as if to lubricate his wits his soninlaw poured him more apple brandy thank you he murmured and drank the applejack might not have made him any smarter but it tasted good he went on i would not be sorry to see france strong again she is the mother country after all and even if the republic of quebec is a friend of the united states and so a friend of germany which is not a friend of france he could feel himself getting tangled up in his sentence and blamed the applejackcertainly easier than blaming himself he tried again regardless of politics i care about what happens in france and i wish her well moi aussi nicole said softly dr odoull nodded all right thats certainly fair enough but let me ask you something elsedo you think the action francaise will do well for france if they take power there if france goes to war with germany for instance do you think she can win my heart says yes my head says no galtier let out a long sad sigh i fear my head is right i think so too his soninlaw agreed but let me ask you something in return lucien said if the confederate states were to go to war with the united states do you think they could win wouldnt be easy odoull said then he shook his head no they couldnt not a chance not now well then why worry about this freedom party lucien asked before odoull answered he poured his own glass of brandy full again because i fear featherston would start a war if he got the chance regardless of whether he could win it or not because a war is a disaster whether you win or you loseits only a worse disaster if you lose im a doctor i ought to know and becausehe took a long pull at the applejackwho knows what might happen five years from now or ten or twenty who knows indeed galtier wasnt thinking about countries growing stronger or weaker he was remembering marie remembering her well and then in pain and then so soon gone forever he gulped down his own glass of apple brandy then reached for the bottle to fill it again nicole reached out and set her hand on his own workroughened one maybe she was remembering marie too she said hard times mean trouble no matter where they land and when they land everywhere she sighed shook her head and got to her feet im going to see how suppers doing by the odor of roast chicken floating out of the kitchen supper was doing very well indeed for a moment lucien kept thinking about his wife then he realized nicole meant the hard times that made it easy for him to hire help with the planting and harvest with so many out of work in riviereduloup he could pick and choose his workers some of them had never done farm labor before but they were pathetically grateful for a paying job of any sort and often worked harder than more experienced men might have done to leonard odoull he said it seems to me mon beaufils that you and i are lucky in what we do people will always need something to eat and god knows they will always fall sick no matter what sort of troubles the world has that will always be true and so the two of us will always have work to keep us busy no doubt you are right dr odoull said i think you are also lucky you own your farm free and clear and dont owe much on your machinery there are too many stories these days of men losing their land because they cannot pay the mortgage and of losing their tractors and such because they cannot keep up the payments ive heard these stories too lucien shivered though the inside of his soninlaws house was toasty warm to be robbed of ones patrimony that would be a hard thing to bear it is a hard thing to bear odoull said that fellow in dakota a couple of weeks ago who shot his wife and children shot the sheriff and three of his deputies when they came to take him off the farm hed lost and then shot himself before all this started who could have imagined such a thing galtier crossed himself hed seen that in the papers too and heard about it on the wireless and he still wished he hadnt god have mercy on that poor mans soul he said and on his family and on the sheriff and his men that farmer worked a great evil there he let it go at that hed told nothing but the truth if he also said he understood how the desperate american had felt when he knew he must lose his patrimony nicole would understand if she was listening from the kitchen but would dr leonard odoull lucien doubted it and so kept quiet then dr odoull said of all the sins in this world which is more unforgivable than the sin of not having enough money none i can think of galtier realized hed underestimated his soninlaw w ell well colonel irving morrell stared at the report on his desk isnt that interesting he whistled tunelessly then looked back at his aidedecamp theres no doubt of this doesnt seem to be sir answered captain ike horwitz whod gone through the report before giving it to morrell it makes an unpleasant amount of sense morrell said especially from the japs point of view i wonder how long its been going on he flipped through the document till he found what he was looking for we never would have found out about it at all if that fellow in vancouver hadnt had a traffic accident while his trunk was full of japanese gold tokyos denying everything of course horwitz said of course morrell laced agreement with sarcasm but what makes more sense for japan than keeping us busy with rebellion up here the busier we are here the less attention well pay to what goes on across the pacific hell we did the same thing during the war when we helped the irish rise up against england so the limeys would have more trouble getting help across the atlantic from canada a lot of coastline in british columbia his aidedecamp observed isnt there just morrell said i wouldnt be surprised if the japs are operating out of russian alaska too the russians have to be afraid well take their icebox away from them one day why would anybody want it horwitz asked theres gold in the yukon morrell answered maybe theres gold in alaska too who knows the russians dont thats for sure theyve never tried very hard to find out or to do much else with the place they tried to sell it to us after the war of secessioni read that somewhere a long time ago his aidedecamp said i forget what they wanted for it seven million dollars is the number that sticks in my mind but i wouldnt swear thats right what ever it was though we turned them down because we didnt have the money from what the oldtimers say we didnt have a pot to piss in after the war of secession morrell said and horwitz nodded morrell went on but thats neither here nor there the question is what do we dowhat can we doabout the damned japanese at least now we know weve got to do something about them horwitz replied anybody with half an eye to see has known that since the great war ended no since before it ended morrell said we didnt beat em they fought us to a draw in the pacific and then they said all right thats enough well have another go a few years from now and theyre stronger than they used to be they took indochina away from the french and the dutch east indies away from hollandoh paid em a little something to salve their pride but they wouldve gone to war if the frogs and the dutchmen hadnt said yes and everybody knows it who could have stopped them horwitz said england before the war yesbut not any more shes got to be glad the japs didnt take hong kong and malaya and singapore the same way and head for india the kaiser doesnt have the kind of navy or the bases to let him fight the japs in the pacific and wed have to get past the japanese philippines to do anything so yeah so morrell agreed sourly what they do six thousand miles away is one thing though what they do right here in our own back yardthats a whole different kettle of fish if they dont know as much wed better show em pretty damn quick hed been aggressive leading infantrymen hed been aggressive leading barrels now with a vision that suddenly stretched to the pacific a few hundred miles to the west he wanted to be aggressive again what have you got in mind sir horwitz asked we ought to be flying patrols up and down the coastline morrell answered they couldnt sneak their spies ashore so easily then and if they have a destroyer or something lying out to sea we damn well ought to sink it in international waters hell yes in international waters if theyre using it as a base to subvert our hold on british columbia all wed need is to spot a boat and the destroyer thatd be all the excuse i needed anyhow horwitz frowned you might start a war that way better to start it when we want to than when they want to wouldnt you say morrell returned sooner or later we will be fighting em you can see that coming like a rash why wait till theyre ready for us i dont think president blackford wants a war with japan his aidedecamp said i dont either but morrell only shrugged but i also dont think blackford has a chinamans chance of getting reelected this november come next march horwitz shook his head no theyve amended the constitution remember the new president takes over on the first of february from now on with trains and aeroplanes and the wireless he doesnt need so long to get ready to do the job thats right id forgotten thanks come february first then well have a democrat in the white houseor powel house take your pickagain maybe hell have better sense heres hoping anyhow morrell rubbed his chin it would be a funny kind of war wouldnt it not much room for chaps like us all ships and aeroplanes and maybe marines it would be good practice for a war with the kaiser if we ever had to fight one of those horwitz said yes it would wouldnt it morrell grinned at his aidedecamp theres another report for you if you feel like writing ittell the people back in the war department what you just told me back it up with maps and force breakdowns and distance charts and all the other little goodies you can think of captain horwitzs expression was less than overjoyed youve really got it in for me dont you sir he said about half in jest and about half in jest morrell nodded damn right i do i want to get you promoted again so i dont have to deal with you any more if you dont want to be a major dont write the report i think the last one helped make you a captain ill write it his aidedecamp said anything to escape you they both grinned but morrell wasnt grinning after horwitz left his office the japs he said softly son of a bitch as hed told horwitz meddling in canada did make good logical sense from their point of view a usa distracted by troubles close to home would be less inclined to look or reach out across the pacific but now that tokyo had got caught with its hand in the cookie jar the united states would likely do what sure enough that was what a popular wireless show called the ninetynine dollar question for the life of him morrell didnt know why that show didnt give winners a full hundred bucks but it didnt he took japanese interference in british columbia very seriously indeed but how serious would it look to war department functionaries back in philadelphia that wasnt so easy to see he sometimes thought that if it werent for the sandwich islands the navy had captured from the british at the start of the great war the war department would have forgotten the pacific ocean and the west coast existed maybe this would make a useful wakeup call maybe it would remind those easterners that the united states did have two coastlines and that they had unfriendly countries to the west as well as to the east maybe he dared hope and maybe just maybe having an unfriendly power making a public nuisance of itself would remind even the socialists of why the united states needed an army and a navy in the first place theyd gone out of their way to conciliate the confederates and the confederates to be sure had gone out of their way to conciliate the usa they were smart enough to remember they were weak and not to get into trouble they couldnt get out of they were under the whigs anyhow the freedom party worried morrell more than ever not least because now it looked as if it might come to power one day i wonder if i ought to write my own report he laughed and shook his head what point to that he wouldnt have been posted to kamloops if bureaucrats in philadelphia were likely to pay attention to anything he said for some people a report from him might be an argument to do the opposite of what ever he suggested besides horwitz might win promotion to major in which case he would escape morrells perhaps stifling influence on his career no report would get morrell the brigadier generals stars he craved promotion during the war had been swift promotion after the war even men in good odor in philadelphia languished promotion for someone who wasnt might never come and if you retire a colonel morrell shrugged hed done his part to win one war for his country no one could take that away from him if they wanted him to count jackrabbits and pine trees out here in kamloops he would do it till they wouldnt let him do it any more one of these days they may decide they need someone who knows something about barrels again you never can tell he laughed a bitter laugh he knew he did a good enough job here in kamloops but what he did had nothing to do with the specialized knowledge hed acquired during the war any reasonably competent military bureaucrat could have taken his place and done about as well that even applied to his proposed solution to japanese meddling in british columbia though he might have wanted to push harder than most uniformed drones would he laughed again this time with something approaching real amusement reasonably competent military bureaucrats shuddered at the prospect of ending up in a place like this they intrigued and pulled wires to stay in philadelphia or to go on inspection tours of places like new orleans that meant kamloops and other such garrisons in the middle of nowhere attracted drunks fools dullards and people like me morrell thought when he went home after finishing the days stint he didnt walk he couldnt not when the last blizzard had left a foot and a half of snow on the ground snow that piled into drifts higher than a man instead he buckled on the pair of long wooden skis leaning against the wall of the entry hall captain horwitz came out while morrell was making sure hed got everything tight his aidedecamp shook his head you wouldnt get me on those things sir i know ive tried morrell answered i keep telling youyou dont know what youre missing its the next best thing to flying with your own wings i know what im missing horwitz said stubbornly a broken ankle a broken leg a dislocated knee a broken arm a broken neck and if i go flying ill do it in an aeroplane thanks o ye of little faith holding both ski poles in one hand morrell opened the door then quickly closed it behind him cold smote he skied down the stepsthere was enough snow on them to make it easyand pushed off for home darkness had already fallen he relished the wind in his face the play of his muscles as he glided along over the smoothly undulating snow a shimmer of motion in the sky caught his eye he stopped staring up in awe white and golden and red the northern lights danced overhead he didnt know how long he simply stood there staring at last he got moving again though he kept looking up to the heavens warmth and home and family had their place no doubthe was always delighted to get back to agnes and mildred but there were so many who like captain horwitz closed their souls to this chill magnificence god im sorry for them he said and skied on americanempire thecentercannothold xiv a nother friday another payday it wouldnt be much of a check chester martin knew as much hed been working six hours a day instead of eight for quite a while now and not working at all on saturdays he should have enjoyed the extra time off he would have enjoyed it a lot more if hed had the money to do more things as it was fifty cents for a couple of cinema tickets once or twice a month made him and rita worry the evening out would mean beans for supper instead of liver and tripeor the way things were these days it might mean potatoes and cabbage instead of beans ive still got a job he thought as he inched toward the clerk who would give him his pay envelope the clerk still had a job too and still had the faintly supercilious air hed worn when times were good pettybourgeois bastard looking down his nose at the proletariat martin thought sourly do you really believe the bosses cant replace you too later on he remembered that that had gone through his mind just before he got to the clerk and gave him his name and pay number the clerk checked him off a long long list handed him the envelope and all of a sudden didnt seem so snotty any more here you are martin he said as if speaking in a sickroom whats eating him chester wondered he didnt open the envelope till he got to the front door of the steel mill a couple of galvanized iron trash cans stood there to hold just such refuse martin pulled out the check and put it into the breast pocket of his overalls he started to throw away the envelope when he noticed another piece of paper inside this one was pink martin stood there staring at it altogether unmoving for at least half a minute hed known the same mix of numbness disbelief and swelling pain when he got wounded on the roanoke frontnever before and surely never since he pulled out the second sheet of paper hoping against hope it might be something else it wasnt come monday he didnt have a job any more other paydays hed seen stunned men holding pink slips here you didnt say anything you didnt look at them maybe that was cruel maybe it had a touch of there but for the grace of god go i but maybe it held a sort of rough kindness too if you didnt look at your fellow workers who all at once werent working beside you they could say anything do anything they chose and not have to worry about losing face the only trouble with that was chester had no idea what to do with the license he had what could he possibly say nothing would make any difference he was gone and the steel mill would go on without him at last one thing did occur to him fuck he said softly he tore up the pink slip dropped the pieces into a trash can and walked out he might as well have torn himself up and thrown himself away instead after all what was he but a disposable proletarian the capitalists who ran the mill had just disposed of that thought made him look up the street toward the socialist party hall he almost started over there if anybody knew what to do if anybody could help him hed find what he needed there but he shook his head before taking his first step in that direction the hall could wait it was only a trolley ride away but with no money coming in was it only a trolley ride and rita deserved to know first when the trolley rattled past the statue of remembrance across from the city hall martin had to look away hed remembered hed helped the united states get their honor back hed paid in blood and pain doing it too but now it seemed the whole world had forgotten himhim and how many hundreds of thousands how many millions of others just like him he almost missed his stop and had to scramble off at the last minute the motorman whod started rolling sent him a sour look as he braked again most of the time martin would have apologized now he hardly even noticed he trudged off toward his apartment building his feet scuffing through snow a man in a ragged overcoat came toward him from an alley spare change the fellow said and coughed hed probably been hatchetfaced when he was eating well now a man could wound himself on the sharp angles of cheeks and nose and chin martin had always given what he could even though he hadnt had much tonight he shook his head sorry buddy he said i just lost my job too just the hatchetfaced mans scorn said there were degrees in misery too degrees martin hadnt yet imagined its been two years for me i used to have a house and a motorcar hell i used to have a wife enjoy it youre only a beginner he tipped his battered hat and walked away shivering from more than the cold martin hurried into his building he half feared another beggar would find him before he got up the steps but none did how long can we keep this place he wondered as he turned the key in the lock is the next stop a blackfordburgh rita came to the door and gave him a quick wifely peck on the lips how did it she began her voice trailed away as she got a real look at his face slowly the blood drained from hers oh no she said you didnt she stopped again i sure as hell did chester said yes i sure as hell did and god only knows what happens now have we got anything to drink in this place he knew they did he took a bottle of bourbonkentucky pride now made in the usa it saidfrom a cupboard and poured himself a glass very much as an afterthought he added a couple of ice cubes when he started to put the bottle away rita said wait a minute she made a drink for herself too though she added water as well as ice to the whiskey martin raised his glass cheers he saidthe very opposite of what he meant he drank a good many steelworkers celebrated payday by going out and getting drunk hed never fallen into that habit tonight though he felt like killing the bottle and whatever other bottles they had in the place why not he thought why the hell not its not like ive got to get up in the morning who knows when ill have to get up in the morning again what are we going to do rita said in a thin frightened voice maybe one of usll find a job chester answered he didnt mean that either he took another sip and shook his head it wasnt so much that he didnt mean it as that he didnt believe it rita had been looking ever since she lost her job and hadnt had any luck landing a new one she hadnt just searched for typist positions either nobody seemed to be hiring anyone even as a waitress or a salesgirl as for him he wanted to laugh but he hurt too much inside he wondered if he even ought to bother trying other steel mills they were all laying people off not hiring he couldnt remember the last time hed seen a new face on the foundry floor rita said what do we do if if we cant find a job neither one of us i mean why do you think im drinking he said which seemed as complete a reply as anything else a couple of swallows of bourbon later he added my pops still working weve got a place to stay if we have to he couldnt imagine a worse humiliation than moving back in with his folks as he neared his own fortieth birthdayand bringing his wife with him his father and mother would take them in he was sure of that but having to crawl back to them was the last thing he wanted he shook his head again the last thing he wanted was to have nowhere at all to go and to end up in a blackfordburgh next to that the prospect of trying to fit himself and rita into the room that had been cramped for him alone didnt seem so bad rita said maybe you can find something in some other line construction or something like that even she sounded doubtful chester wanted to laugh again again the pain was too much to let him as gently as he could he asked hon why would they want me when theyve got real carpenters and whatnot coming out their ears he didnt expect his wife to have an answer for him but she did why ill tell you why because youd work cheaper oh he winced it wasnt because she was wrong it was because she was right and so much for socialist solidarity among workers he thought if times got bad enough if people got desperate enough socialist solidarity went straight out the window a job now no matter what the pay counted for more than the damage taking that job did to labors ability to get better wages later his glass was empty he filled it again again he started to put away the bottle again rita wouldnt let him she poured herself another drink too after shed taken a swallow she said at least your fathers still got work yeah chester said ritas father had worked in a cement plant for more than thirty years except when hed done his time in the army during the great war that hadnt stopped him from losing his job a few months before he hadnt been fired or not exactly the company had gone bellyup hed been able to land only odd jobs since and worried about losing his house how much exactly have we got in the bank rita asked their bank was still sound where so many had gone under if this mess had any sort of silver lining that was it we can get by for a month or two anyhow martin answered wed be better off if wed never bought any stocks at all dammit we were suckers his wife said lots of people were suckers dont i know it he said bitterly buy when the market was near the top throw money away on margin calls when it went sour and youre right honeywe arent the only ones elections coming up this year she said i dont see how hosea blackford has a prayer of getting a second term i almost went to the socialist party hall before i came home martin said and then proving the depths of his own despair he asked why the devil should anyone whos out of work vote socialist though it wasnt the democrats who passed the relief bills rita said they voted against most of them i know but they say the crash never would have happened in the first place if theyd been running things martin sighed maybe theyre even right who knows rita looked shocked he held up a defensive hand i used to be a democrat till after the war my old man still isyou know that i changed my mind when the bosses sicced the cops on us when we struck for higher wages we needed worker solidarity then and we needed the socialists too we still do ritas family had always voted socialist chester wasnt so sure chester wasnt so sure of anything just then except that the bourbon was hitting him hard theyve had twelve years he said blackfords had his whole term to get us back on our feet and he hasnt done it maybe the other side deserves a shot how could it be worse youd really vote for calvin coolidge his wife asked the governor of massachusetts again looked to be his partys likely candidate for president right now i dont know what the hell id do martin answered all i know is i wish i still had my job i wish i did but i dont and god only knows what were going to do on account of that he waited to see if rita would argue some more he hoped she wouldthat might mean shed seen a ray of hope he hadnt but she said not a word r ounding the horn in the uss remembrance felt like old times to sam carsten i came the other way from the pacific to the atlantic in the dakota during the war he said as waves lifted and dropped the aeroplane carrier again and again its easier going that way lieutenant commander michael watkins said the waves are coming with you instead of hitting you headon yes sir sam agreed i still dont know how they ever got around this place against the wind in sailing ships it wasnt easyi know that watkins said snatching up his mug of coffee from the galley table as the remembrance plunged into another trough sam did the same the table was mounted on gimbals but the pitching in the strait was more than it was designed to handle after another couple of rises and falls sam said i pity the poor fellows whose stomachs cant take this thats no joke watkins said and took another sip of coffee i didnt think it was sir carsten said have you seen the sickbay lists its a good thing we dont have to do any fighting in these latitudes thats all ive got to say he checked himself no i take that back anybody else who tried to fight down here would have just as many seasick cases as we do true enough the other officer sent him a sly look but ill bet you dont mind the weather a bit who me sam tried to look innocent lieutenant commander watkins snickered so he couldnt have pulled it off he went on rounding the horn in aprilautumn down here heading toward winter no sir i dont mind it one little bit its the kind of weather i was made for i can go on deck without smearing goop all over my face and my hands im not burned im not blistered and were heading for the sandwich islands im going to toast up there ive been there before and i know ill toast so ill enjoy this while it lasts he hadnt intended to get so worked up but he didnt enjoy never had enjoyed owning a hide that scorched if the sun looked at it sideways watkins held up a hand all right i believe you do you think were going to have to fight when we do get up there me sir sam shrugged im no crystalball reader no were talking about the japs so i guess i should say im no tealeaf reader watkins made a face at him he grinned but then quickly became serious once more one thing ill tell you though is that a scrap with them wont be any fun at all i was aboard the dakota when they suckered her out of honolulu harbor and torpedoed her and for the battle of the three navies in the pacific theyre tougher than most americans think and thats the truth we can whip em lieutenant commander watkins sounded confident we can whip anybody except maybe the high seas fleetand the kaisers got more things on his plate than us right now what do you know about these action francaise people sir when i was on the obrien we put in at brest i went into town to have a few drinks and look around and i saw an action francaise riot what they remind me of most is the freedom party in the csa they remember how things were back before the war and they want to turn back the clock so theyre that way again good luck watkins said the kaiser wont let them get away with that and we wont let the damned confederates get away with it either wed better not anyhow yes sir carsten said but hard times mean parties like that get more votes seems like i dont know what anybody can do about it i dont know if anybody can do anything he was sorry when the remembrance rounded cape horn and made her way up the west coast of south america to valparaiso where she refueled hed been there briefly in the dakota during the war chile was a staunch us ally not least because argentina her rival had close ties to england and the other great alliance system argentina outweighed chile but the peace held because the argentines didnt outweigh the united states and didnt want to give them any excuse to meddle in south american affairs valparaiso had grown in the years since sam was last there he saw no signs of damage from the great earthquake of the weather was mild which meant he got sunburned then the remembrance started north and west again toward the sandwich islands he sighed went to the pharmacists mate and drew himself yet another tube of zincoxide ointment you dont happen to carry this stuff in fivegallon tubs do you he asked not altogether in jest sorry no like most in his post the pharmacists mate had no sense of humor a few days out of valparaiso the remembrance changed course swinging more nearly toward the north change of plan commander martin van der waal told carsten keep it under your hat for a bit though because the men wont like it you can forget about honolulu no bright lights no booze no fast women not any time soon were bound for patrol duty off the coast of british columbia sam had fond memories of some of the fast women in honolulu even so he said thats the best news ive had in months sir you ever eat one of those whole roasted pigs they cook in a pit in the sandwich islands thats what i look like when im stationed therecooked meat nothing else but the coast of british columbia thats not so bad hed sunburned in seattle too but only a little van der waal looked him over then nodded to himself no you wouldnt be one to complain about going way north would you youve got your reasons you bet i do sir sam nodded but whats the scuttlebutt about the change in plans whats going on off british columbia well be flying combat air patrol keeping an eye out for the japs and giving em hell if we catch any of em in the neighborhood commander van der waal replied i dont know this for a fact but i hear theyve been trying to stir up the canucks get em to rebel again bastards carsten said without much rancor having gone to ireland during the great war he knew that was how you played the game but frowning he asked why us sir theyve got to have other aeroplane carriers closer to canada than we were when we set out why not use one of them were going the long way round seems like yes there are other carriers closer van der waal agreed theyre purposebuilt ships not a converted battle cruiser like the remembrance they carry more aeroplanes than we do and theyre all going to the sandwich islands so is a lot of the rest of the fleetwhatever we dont leave behind in the atlantic to keep an eye on the confederates and the limeys and the germans sam thought he lit a cigarette if they want the first team in honolulu he said slowly then they think there really might be trouble with the japs thats the way it looks to me too van der waal said and that means were going to have to pay special attention to torpedodamage drills on our way north nobody knows what the japs have operating off the canadian coast it may be nothing it may be a destroyer or two or it may be more including submersibles and destroyers can launch torpedoes toothats their best hope against bigger ships in fact yes sir sam hoped he didnt sound too resigned it wasnt that torpedodamage control wasnt important he knew it was hed seen how important it was aboard the dakota important or not though it wasnt what he wanted to be doing hed come to the carrier hoping to work with aeroplanes or that failing to stay in gunnery his specialty as a petty officer before he got promoted of course what he wanted to do and what the navy wanted him to do were two different beasts van der waal knew he was reluctant he said this duty is vital to the ships security ensignvital i tell you yes sir carsten said again i know that sir he stifled a sigh ill do what ever you need sir im sure you will i appreciate it van der waal said you make a solid officer carsten and im pleased to have you under me if youd gone to annapolis instead of taking the mustangs route i wouldnt be surprised if youd made captain by now thank you very much sir sam said i do appreciate that believe you me i do a lot of what he was doing these days amounted to showing people what he might have done if hed had better chances when he was younger he shrugged those were the breaks he hadnt even thought about becoming an officer till years after the war but i passed my exams very first try he thought proudly some veteran cpos had been trying for years with no luck at all he went out on deck this wasnt cape horn not any more the air was warm the sea was blue and calm the sun shone bright sam sighed you couldnt have everything he reached for the zincoxide ointment b erlin ontario didnt boast a whole lot of fancy saloons the best one as far as jonathan moss was concerned was the pig and whistle not far from the courthouse he found himself having a couple of drinks with major sam lopat the military prosecutor they werent sparring with each other in court today theyd both ducked in to get warm though the calendar declared it was april a new blizzard had just left berlin eight more inches of snow hoisting a glass moss said mud in your eye same to you the us officer said and drank of course all the mud around heres frozen into a cheap grade of cement isnt that the sad and sorry truth moss drank too nobody in his right mind would come here for the weather thats for sure nope nobody in his right mind would come here at all but then lopat paused and shook his head i take that back damned if i dont youre here for a reasonyou cant very well practice occupation law in the usa two reasons matter of fact because you married that canadian gal too yeah moss didnt mention that hed gone into occupation law not least because even then he hadnt been able to get laura secord out of his mind lopats train of thought went down a different track which was probably just as well he said and everythings going to hell all over the world but youre a civilian with a steady job thats nothing to sneeze at either not these days its not aint it the truth moss said without grammar but with great sincerity i dont know when its going to turn around i dont know if its ever going to turn around tell you one thing the military prosecutor spoke with a glee unfueled as yet by whiskey come november old man blackford can head back to dakota and nobodyll miss him a bit and with a democrat in powel house things here in canada will tighten upand about time too you see if they dont jonathan my boy if they tighten up any more you wont bother trying canucks at all moss said youll just give em a blindfold and a cigarette the way it worked during the war what a liar lopat said some of the fast ones youve pulled off in military court and youre boohooing for the canucks give me a break for crying out loud your trouble major is that you think people spell prosecute and convict the same way moss said thats not how it works even in military court a defendants entitled to a fair shake most of the ones who come up before the court deserve to be shaken all right lopat said one of these days youre going to be sorry for getting so many of em off you may be turning another arthur mcgregor loose on the world mcgregor never went to court moss snapped and theres not a lawyer in the world who doesnt have some clients he wishes he didnt but what can you do for christs sake if you dont give everybody as good a defense as you can everybodys rights go down the drain some people deserve to be locked up and to have the jailer lose the key lopat insisted or worse how many people did mcgregor end up killing and a lot of em were just canucks in the wrong place at the wrong time mcgregor deserved whatever happened to himafter he had his day in court moss said till you have a trial you just dont know you people have tried to railroad a few canadians in your time and dont try to tell me any different lopat snorted youd say that wouldnt you ive got news for you though just because you say it doesnt make it so he picked up his glass of whiskey poured it down and signaled for a refill if you dont admit that moss threw his hands in the air of course sam lopat wouldnt admit it he was a lawyer too expecting a lawyer to admit anything damaging to the point of view he was presenting was like wishing the easter bunny would hop across your lawn you could do it but it wouldnt do you any good and youd spend a long time waiting lopat underscored the point grinning and saying i dont admit one damn thing counselor not one damned thing moss finished his own drink then got to his feet fine dont admit anything im still going to whale the stuffing out of you when we go back to court tomorrow morning for now im heading home see you in the morning he plucked his hat off the rack stuck it on his head and strode out of the pig and whistle in more than a little annoyance how could you have a civilized discussion with a man who wouldnt admit one damned thing and was proud of it that lopat might think the same of him never crossed his mind his bucephalus started reluctantly he let out a sigh of relief when it did start the battery was going no doubt about it pretty soon hed have to get a new one pretty soon hed have to get a new or at least a newer auto too too many things on the bucephalus were breaking down and the company had gone out of business in so parts were hard to come by and ever more expensive he parked it outside his block of flats and hoped it would fire up again in the morning if it didnt if it doesnt ill walk in he thought and reminded himself to set the alarm clock half an hour earlier than usual to give him time to walk if he had to his key turned in the lock im home he called as he stepped in the door he wondered how glad laura would be to see him shed been happy enough to marry him but neither of them had been particularly happy since moss listened silence im home honey he said again wondering what sort of trouble he was in but it turned out not to be that kind of silence a moment later noise came from the bathroom the unmistakable sound of someone being sick a moment after that the water closet flushed laura came out a minute or so afterwards she looked distinctly green what happened hon moss asked are you all right better now she said and made a face probably at the nasty taste in her mouth in about eight months well know if its a boy or a girl for a moment that seemed a complete non sequitur then moss jaw dropped you mean were she nodded doesnt seem to be much room for doubt any more ive missed a month and ive got morning sickness even if it isnt morning right now were going to have a baby sure enough thats wonderful moss said a good attorney was never supposed to be caught speechless he went on but how did it happen his wifes mouth quirked in a wry grin very much in the usual way im sure it hasnt happened any other way since the days of our lord he made a face at her i didnt mean that what i meant was its a surprise he couldnt think of the last time he hadnt worn a safe when they made love those things arent perfect laura said evidently not moss shrugged and laughed if its a boy we can call him broken rubber moss that has a ring to it dont you think or how about prophylactina for a girl what i think laura moss didnt couldnt go on what ever shed been about to say a giggle swallowed it she tried again what i think jonathan is that youre dangerously insane he bowed your servant maam youve known that for a long time im sure i certainly have she nodded there i was with this mad yank who kept coming to the farm i didnt want any mad yanks coming to the farm i should hope not moss said gravely you get into all sorts of trouble if you let those people anywhere near you you might even end up married to one of them if youre not careful and after that anything can happen obviously obviously laura echoed she set one hand on her belly though the pregnancy didnt show and wouldnt for months this was as much a surprise to me as it was to you you know i didnt much want a child now now well just have to make the best of it wont we i dont know what else we can do moss kissed her on the cheek when he tried to kiss her on the mouth too she pulled away saying you dont want to do that i havent properly cleaned my teeth yet oh jonathan nodded well why dont you then while laura went back to the bathroom he hurried to the kitchen the occasion really called for champagne but they didnt have any whiskey over ice would do the job well enough he had the drinks ready by the time laura came out again she took one they solemnly clinked glasses and drank then moss did kiss her her mouth tasted of liquor and toothpaste she said i hope this wont make me sick again after seeming to listen to something internal she shook her head in relief no i think it will be all right as if to prove it she took another sip thats good it is isnt it jonathan drank some more too he raised his glass heres to us and to whom it may concern thats pretty good i like it a lot better than what you said before laura wouldnt dignify it by repeating it all right moss made his drink disappear in a hurry along with what hed had at the pig and whistle it left him owlishly serious he took his wifes hands in his and said i do love you you know i always have you always called it love anyhow she said i think for a long time it was just what any man feels when hes been away from women for too long since she was bound to be right he didnt dignify that with a direct reply instead he said well you cant very well accuse me of that now as if to prove as much he kissed her again his hands resting on the swell of her hips he continued and since you cant accuse me of that he kissed her once more his lips hard against hers one of his hands slid to her behind to press her to him her own arms tightened around his back as the kiss went on she made a little wordless sound almost a growl in the back of her throat he lifted her off her feet she let out a startled squawk put me down youll hurt your back she had a reasonable chance of being right she wasnt a small woman and he was pushing forty he ignored her all the same carrying her off to the bedroom what are you doing she demanded what do you think he set her on the bed and got down beside her his hand slid under her skirt and up her thigh to the joining of her legs he rubbed there her legs slid apart to make it easier for him he hiked her skirt up and pulled her underpants down then went back to what hed been doing she laughed i think youre going to take advantage of me damn right i am jonathan unbuttoned his own fly he was also going to take advantage of her being pregnant if he didnt have to worry about putting on a rubber he didnt intend to he certainly liked it better without they both still wore most of their clothes when he went into her she wasnt quite so wet as he would have wanted but having to force his way in added to his excitement she wrapped her legs around him and bucked hard come on she said as he squeezed and fondled her breasts through the thin cotton fabric of her blouse as she kindled she said a good deal more than that she was the very model of a lady except in the bedroom when she was well and truly roused then anything could happen and anything could come out of her mouth it hadnt lately the two of them had started taking each other for granted since theyd got married today though today they thrashed on the bed and clawed at each other as they hadnt done since he would drive up to arthur and theyd picnic and then fornicate at her farmhouse outside the little town his own building pleasure driving him on moss rammed at her not caring in the heat of the moment if he hurt her a little too by the way laura yowled she didnt care either suddenly she arched her back threw back her head and let out a long shuddering moan at the same time she squeezed him inside her so tight that he couldnt help but erupt youre rumpling me laura said a moment later pushing at him he shook his head and replied with lawyerly precision no sweetheart i just rumpled you she made a face when he gave her a kiss he laughed his weight still on her if i remember right that has something to do with why we got married you think so do you she pushed at him again harder this time he flopped out of her which reminded him that despite the fierce lovemaking theyd just enjoyed he didnt burn so hot as he had back in his twenties then hed have been ready for a second round as soon as the first was over now now hed wait for tomorrow or maybe the day after laura gave him another shove and twisted under him too let me up let me set myself to rights oh i suppose so he said but he couldnt keep wonder from his voice as he went on a baby how about that yes how about that his wifes voice softened too it isnt what i expected but im glad its happened so am i he wondered if he meant it he decided he did about time we put down some roots here ive already got roots here laura said pointedly she nodded too though its about time we were a family a baby moss said again i wonder what hell see by the time he grows up the baby would be his age in the early s what would the world be like then a creek ran through the farm on which mary mcgregor and her mother lived scrubby oaks and willows grew alongside it they got some firewood there which was all to the good ducks sometimes nested along it too which gave mary practice with a shotgun and gave her mother and her a tasty dinner every so often and she would pull trout out of it once in a while though she seldom had the time to sit and fish the creek and the trees by it also came in handy in other ways mary lit a fuse and ducked down behind an oak to wait for the explosion it came just when she thought it woulda harsh flat crack mallards leaped into the air with a thunder of wings a couple of crows in a willow flapped away cawing in alarm moments later quiet returned mary stepped out from behind the tree trunk to see what the dynamite had done she nodded to herself the stump shed blown up had landed in the creek just as shed thought it would the hole in the ground it left was about the size shed expected too she hadnt done anything particularly usefula stump here wasnt the nuisance it would have been out in the middle of a field but shed learned a little more about explosives and fuses which was knowledge that wouldnt go to waste either on the farm or or anywhere else she thought she was after all arthur mcgregors daughter she wondered what had gone through her fathers mind while he waged his long oneman war against the americans who occupied canada hed never talked about it muchbut then hed never been one to talk about anything much what had he thought her guess was that hed tried not to think about it except while he was actually busy at it that would have made it harder for him to give himself away when the yanks came snooping around which they had again and again not thinking about it would also have made it easier for him to go on thinking of them as the enemy as abstractions not as human beings killing the enemy was what you did when you went to war blowing up menpeoplewho were just like you who fell in love and drank beer and got sore backs and dug splinters out of their hands and played checkers that was a different business it had to be a different business mary couldnt see how anybody would want or would even be able to do that had major hannebrink the american officer whod ordered her brother alexander shot during the war ever imagined him as a human being or had alexander simply been the enemy to him for a moment mary came close to understanding how the american could have done what he did came close to understanding without hating for a moment and for a moment only she shoved that understanding away with all the force of the hate shed nursed ever since the usa invaded her country in she saw americans as the enemy not as human beings at all she saw them so and intended to go right on seeing them so when she got back to the farmhouse her mother sat at the kitchen table drinking a cup of tea i heard the boom maude mcgregor said mary nodded i took out a stump she said im getting the hang of it i think are you her mothers voice held no expression what ever and what will you do with it once youve got it itll come in handy around the farm ma mary answered you know it will yesas long as you only use it around the farm her mother said thats what worries me i know you too well i dont know what youre talking about would have been a lie an obvious lie i dont intend to use it anywhere else mary said that was a lie too but maybe not so obvious maybe maude mcgregor looked at her for a long time i hope not she said at last and then would you like a cup of tea yes please mary said her mother fixed her one she added milk and sugar herself and sat down to drink it across the table from her mother neither of them said another word till the tea was doneor for that matter for several hours afterwards when they did start speaking to each other again it was quietly cautiously as if theyd had a knockdown dragout fight that might pick up again if they werent careful thats silly mary thought we didnt not even close all we did was talk about that stump to her mother that stump seemed plenty and mary herself wasnt inclined to change her mind maybe that was what worried her mother they were still wary around each other a few days later when they had to go into rosenfeld to shop mary remembered checkpoints outside of town where the americans would carefully examine wagons and goods for explosives before letting them go on not now the yanks seemed to think her countrymen werent dangerous any more one day she hoped to show them they were wrong that too though would have to wait for another day many more motorcars were on the road now than had been there when mary first started going into rosenfeld they whizzed past the wagon one after another some of the drivers angry because they had to slow down to keep from hitting it honked as they went by i wish i were a man mary said id tell them what i think of them her mother nodded yes im sure you would she said it did not sound like praise mary muttered to herself but didnt rise to it when they got into rosenfeld her mother tied the horse to a lamppost hardly any hitching rails left mary said i know maude mcgregor nodded again automobiles dont need them you go to the post office and get some stamps ill be in henry gibbons store all right mary hesitated then plunged do you want to go to the cinema afterwards we havent been in an awfully long time maybe her mother answered well see how much i have to spend at the general store thats all mary wished she could argue more but knew she couldnt not when the argument involved money even the half a dollar two tickets would cost was a lot considering how little the farm brought in wilfred rokeby stood behind the counter at the post office as he had for as long as mary could remember she noticed with surprise that hed gone gray when had that happened it must have sneaked up when she wasnt looking he still parted his hair in the middle and slicked it down with some oldfashioned sweetsmelling oil whose spicy odor she indelibly associated with the post office only one other customer was ahead of her a young man close to her own age who had a huge swarm of parcels the postmaster had to weigh each one individually and calculate the proper postage for it then stick on stamps and write down the sum so he could get a grand total when he finally finished seeing mary the young man waved her forward if you want to take care of what you need go ahead he told her ill be here for a while any which way she shook her head its all right you were here first i can wait are you sure he asked positive she said where are you sending all those boxes anyway winnipeg my brother just moved up there and he figured out this was the cheapest way to get his stuff up there with him of course that means i have to stand here and go through this but why should bob care he grinned to her surprise mary found herself grinning too brothers and sisters are like that she said speaking from experience you might as well be a pack mule as far as theyre concerned thats right thats just right bobs brothermary still had no better name for himnodded enthusiastically they always say theyll pay you back and then they never do or not enough he paused to stoop and hand wilfred rokeby another package thank you mort the postmaster said as if hearing his name reminded him mary didnt know it he said thats memort pomeroy at your service he touched the brim of his hat oh mary said she hadnt seen him before or at least hadnt noticed him but now she knew who his family was your father runs the diner down the street from gibbons general store with money so tight she couldnt recall the last time shed eaten there thats me he said again and handed another package a big heavy one to rokeby then he turned back to her thats me all right but who are you he looked at her as if he were an explorer whod just sighted a new and unimagined continent im mary mcgregor she waited oh mort pomeroy said in a tone very different from hers he couldnt go on with something bright and chipper as she had something on the order of your father blew up yanks then he blew himself up too he couldnt say anything like that but his face told her he knew who her father was sure enough who in and around rosenfeld didnt know who arthur mcgregor was too bad she thought now he wont want to have anything to do with me and he seems nice but after giving wilfred rokeby yet another parcelthe next to last onehe managed to put the smile back on his face and say well that was a long time ago now and it certainly didnt have anything to do with you he wasnt quite right the only thing mary regretted was that her father hadnt had more luck but pomeroy wouldnt know that of course and a lot of people in rosenfeld still stared and pointed whenever she went by and probably would for years to come someone trying to treat her kindly made a very pleasant novelty especially when the someone in question was a goodlooking young man thank you she whispered for what he sounded honestly puzzled as he gave the postmaster the last package that made her like him more not less rokeby went to work with pencil and paper comes to nine dollars and sixteen cents all told he said for postage can you imagine that mort pomeroy said genially astonished as he paid rokeby ill take it out of bobs hideif he ever finds a job i will times are hard mary agreed let me have seventyfive cents worth of stamps mr rokeby if you would i can do that he said and gave her twentyfive stampspostage had recently gone up from two cents to three he put the three quarters she handed him into his cash box she sighed the extra twentyfive cents she had to spend on stamps would have paid her way into the theater now the money was goneand gone into the americans pockets one more reason to hate them she thought are you in town by yourself pomeroy sounded hopeful i have to meet my mother at the general store mary said with much more regret than shed expected to feel his face fell oh too bad he hesitated then asked if i was to come calling on you one day before too long would that be all right maybe youd like to see a movingpicture show with me maybe i would mary realized she ought to say more than that yes im sure i would swell now the grin came back enormously ive got an auto can i pick you up saturday night well go to a film see what else there is to do after thata dance at the church or something all all right mary sounded dazed even to herself no one had ever shown this kind of interest in her her past left her damaged goods that had always suited her fineup till this minute she was ever so glad mort pomeroy didnt seem to care who her father was or what hed done saturday night she whispered and hurried out of the post office pomeroy and wilfred rokeby both stared after her c incinnatus driver used a hand truck to haul crates of oatmeal boxes from his ford to the market that had ordered them this heres the last load mr marlowe he said panting a little oscar marlowe nodded yes ive been keeping track of everything youve brought in he answered cincinnatus believed him the storekeeper was a thin fussily precise man with a little hairline mustache so very narrow it might have been drawn on with a mascara pencil he said i do appreciate how hard youve worked bringing it all in its my job mr marlowe said cincinnatus who knew he would feel it in his back and shoulders tonight work that had seemed effortlessly easy in his twenties didnt now that hed passed forty he added way things are these days i got to do everything i can oh yes marlowe nodded he ran a pink tongue over that scrawny little excuse for a mustache i understand you completelyand agree with you completely i might add even now though too many people dont seem to have figured that out im always glad to see someone who has let me have your paperwork the sooner i sign off the sooner you can be on your way i dont want to waste your time got it right here scipio handed him the clipboard i expected you would marlowe scribbled his name on the forms making sure he signed in all four necessary spaces he and cincinnatus leaned toward each other in mutual sympathy as he wrote their both being hardworking men counted for more than ones being white the other black the storekeeper said here you are and returned the clipboard to cincinnatus thank you kindly suh cincinnatus turned to leave hed taken only a step or two before marlowe said here wait a second he went behind the counter where he kept his meat on ice wrapped a package in butcher paper and thrust it at cincinnatus take this home to your missus why dont you marrow bones and a little meatmake you a good soup or a stew cincinnatus wanted to say he couldnt possibly but common sense won over pride thank you kindly he repeated and touched the brim of his hap you didnt have to do nothin like that mr marlowe i didnt do it because i had to i did it because i wanted to the storekeeper sounded impatient if you work hard you ought to know other people notice and i do im always glad to see you bringing me loads from the docks and the railroad yard much obliged cincinnatus touched his brim again then took the packageit was nice and heavyout to the truck and set it on the front seat beside him he had one more delivery to make before he could go home with it his last stop wasnt at a grocery store but at the offices of the des moines register and remembrance the crates he unloaded there were large and heavy what is this thing he asked the man who took delivery new typesetting machine the fellow answered well get the paper out faster than ever thats nice cincinnatus said obligingly and we wont need so many compositors the newspaperman added seeing that the word meant nothing to cincinnatus he chose a simpler one typesetters oh cincinnatus hesitated then asked what happens to the ones you dont need no any more they lose their jobs that isnt settled yet the newspaperman sounded uncomfortable now he sounded so uncomfortable cincinnatus was sure he was lying he went on even if we do let some people go well try to make sure they latch on somewhere else uh huh cincinnatus said how were they supposed to manage that with jobs so hard to come by he figured it for another lie right up there with old favorites like the check is in the mail his skepticism must have shown in his voice the man from the register and remembrance turned red he said well try goddammit we will what else can we do weve got to save money wherever we can because we sure as hell arent making much for that cincinnatus had no good answer he got his paperwork signed and went back to the truck outside the register and remembrance building a couple of men were hanging a banner over the doorway win with coolidge in it said and then in smaller letters a return to prosperity the register and remembrance was the democratic paper in des moines its socialist counterpart the workers gazette had its offices across the street and down the block even though this was a presidentialelection year the workers gazette displayed no banners extolling the virtues of hosea blackford the paper seemed to want to forget about him it was only may there was as yet no guarantee calvin coolidge would be nominated for a second run at the powel house it certainly looked likely though no other democratic hopeful roused much excitement cincinnatus snorted when that thought crossed his mind coolidge was about as exciting as a pitcher of warm spit but everyone thought he could win when november rolled around to the democrats locked out of powel house the past twelve years that was plenty to make the governor of massachusetts seem exciting nobody by all the signs thought president blackford had much chance to win a second term but the socialists had made no move to dump him from their ticket for one thing not even they were radical enough to jettison a sitting president for another no one else from the socialist party looked like a winner this year either blackford wouldnt run again win or lose if things went as they looked like going he could perform one last duty for the party by serving as sacrificial lamb that way defeat would taint no one else cincinnatus shrugged whom the socialists ran was all one to him he intended to vote democratic the democrats took a harder line about the confederate states than the socialists did he couldnt imagine any negro in the united states voting any other waywhich didnt mean some wouldnt when he got back to the family apartment elizabeth greeted him with how did it go today how much money did you make was what she meant of course some of the tension slid out of her face when he answered pretty well thanks how about you sweetheart ordinary kind o day his wife said with a weary shrug got me two dollars and a quarter every little bit helps i reckon achilles looked up from the kitchen table where he was writing a highschool composition he said classes let out next month then ill be able to look for work without you pitching fits dad he itched to do more than he was doing cincinnatus knew as much he said workin summers is one thing workin instead o schoolin is somethin else youre sixteenyou got two years to go fore you get your diploma i want you to have it by god its somethin nobody cant never taken away from you by achilles expression hed made a mess of his grammar but then at sixteen and where had the years since he was born gone achilles wore that look of scorn around him a lot of the time cincinnatus remembered wearing it around his own father when he was that age boys turning into young men banged heads with their fathers that was the way things worked if we need the money achilles began we dont need it that bad cincinnatus said this is the rest of your life were talkin about remember to his relief his son didnt choose to push it tonight cincinnatus knew hed be smart not to push the boy too hard about staying in school achilles liked school and did pretty well but if his father urged him to stay in and do well that might be enough to turn him against it amanda came in and gave cincinnatus a hug she was still young enough to love without reservation she said i got all my words right on my spelling test today thats good sweetheart thats mighty fine cincinnatus said enthusiastically cant hardly do no better than perfect how can you do better than perfect at all amanda asked you cant i was just jokin a little cincinnatus answered oh amanda wrinkled her nose thats silly daddy her accent held even more midwest even less kentucky than achilles shed been born here after all everyone shed ever heard except for her parents had that harsh precise way of talking with sharp vowels and every letter of every word pronounced it still sounded strange and ugly to cincinnatus although hed been here for going on ten years not counting time in luther bliss jail a delicious odor reached cincinnatus nose what smells good he asked im stewing giblets with potatoes and tomatoes and onions elizabeth answered butcher shop had em cheap cheap cincinnatus said thumping himself on the forehead with the heel of his hand he hurried down to the truck and returned with the butcherpaper package hed left on the front seat soup bones oscar marlowe gave em to me for nothin reckon id forget my head if it wasnt on tight soup bones thats wonderful ill do em up tomorrow elizabeth hurried to put the package in the icebox giblets soup bones achilles made a face that looked remarkably like the one his little sister had just made not many people eat that kind of stuff cincinnatus had grown up eating chicken gizzards and beef tongues and lungs and other cuts richer people thought of as offal he took them for granted as he always had when times here in des moines were good elizabeth hadnt bought them so often so achilles noticed them more now than he would have otherwise but cincinnatus wagged a finger at his son happens that aint so he said plenty of people who was eatin roast beefs eatin giblets now and glad to have em i aint just talkin bout colored folks neither its the same way with whites i seen enough to know that for a fact reckon its the same with the chinaman upstairs too when times are hard youre smart to be glad o what youve got not sorry for what you aint achilles said somebody at school told me chinamen cut up dogs and cats and use them for meat is that true dad i dont know cincinnatus answered i never heard it before ill tell you tell you somethin else toodont you go asking the changs about it neither theyre nice folks and i dont want you embarrassing em none you hear i wouldnt do that achilles sounded uncommonly sincere a moment later he explained why grace chang is in a couple of my classes i think shes a cute girl that made cincinnatus and elizabeth exchange glances even if cincinnatus had felt such a thing about a white woman in kentucky he never would have said so but the drivers werent in kentucky any more and grace wasnt white what were the rules for negroes and chinese were there any of course just because achilles thought grace was cute that didnt mean he was going to ask her to marry him or even to ask her to go to a film with him just the same a sensible fathera father who didnt want his boy beaten up or lynchedstarted worrying about these things as far ahead of time as he could by elizabeths expression she was worrying about them too before cincinnatus could say anything about any of that achilles changed the subject who are you going to vote for for president dad whoever the democrats runlooks like coolidge now cincinnatus answered elizabeth nodded agreement got to keep an eye on them confederates his wife nodded again not achilles if i could vote id vote for the socialists he declared they dont care if youre black or white or yellow or red they just want to know what you can do and that declaration of political independence started a whole new argument one that made cincinnatus forget grace chang for the rest of the night p ass the salt ma edna grimes said and nellie jacobs did her daughter sprinkled it on a drumstick this is awful good fried chicken she took a big bite sure is mother jacobs merle grimes agreed he turned to edna you all right honey everything staying down edna nodded couldnt be better merle stomach isnt bothering me at all this time around she yawned i still get sleepy a lot though she was three months pregnant the baby would be born somewhere around new years day suddenly she pointed at her son for gods sake armstrong im not too sleepy to miss you stuffing half a pound of mashed potatoes into your face all at once show some manners or youll find out youre not too big to paddle ten years old and you eat like that jesus sorry ma armstrong said most indistinctlymaybe it hadnt been half a pound of mashed potatoes but it hadnt missed by much across the table from him clara smirked aunt and nephew which seemed silly when only two years separated them had never got along not even when they were tiny merle grimes raised his glass of beer heres hoping cal sweeps the socialists out of powel house he said the democrats wouldnt hold their convention for another monththeyd scheduled it for the fourth of julybut governor coolidges nomination now looked like a foregone conclusion amen nellie said and drank so did edna so did hal jacobs armstrong grimes raised his glass of milk in imitation of the grownups clara made a face at him that will be enough of that young lady nellie said clara subsided armstrong laughed edna said were all democrats and it doesnt do us or coolidge a bit of good hardly seems fair it isnt fair her husband said this is what we get for living in washington dc were not a state so we dont get to vote most of the governments been in philadelphia for the past fifty years but they can vote for president there and we still cant there ought to be a law its been this way forever hal jacobs paused to cough youve lived here all your life merle said youre used to not voting i grew up in ohio i like having my voice count for something losing my vote was the hardest thing about coming to live here a lot of places ma and me wouldnt have had a vote up till a few years ago anyway edna had to raise her voice because hal coughed again summer cold she asked sympathetically he shrugged i do not know he lit a cigarette took a drag and coughed yet again i am having trouble shaking it though what ever it is merle lit up too he blew a smoke ring which made clara and armstrong laugh despite what he was doing he said maybe you ought to cut back father jacobs i always cough worse if i smoke a lot while ive got a coldi know that hal blew a smoke ring too with another shrug he said i have been smoking since before the second mexican warmore than fifty years now cutting back is not that easy the interruption was for more coughs yet merle grimes laugh was rueful oh i know i always feel like ive been steamrollered if i dont smoke my usual ration youre cross as a bear too edna said blow another smoke ring pa clara said he needed two tries before he could a cough in the middle ruined the first one you have been coughing a lot lately nellie said maybe you ought to see a doctor get yourself looked at what will he tell me dear her husband replied taking a last drag at the cigarette and then stubbing it out he will tell me i am not so young as i used to be i already know this thank you very much i do not need to pay a doctor money to find out what i already know even at the start of the great war eighteen years ago now nellie realized with no small surprise where had the time gonehals hair and mustache had been gray his face lined he hadnt seemed to change much in all the time since now though nellie tried to see him as if she were just meeting him he was close to seventy and looked every year of it his skin sagged on his face he was a sallow color he shouldnt have been she actually blinked wondering if she was seeing things that werent there but she wasnt she looked at her husband again it wasnt just that the changes had sneaked up gradually and she hadnt noticed she was sure it wasnt theyd come on lately she didnt care for any of the thoughts following from that hal she said i think maybe you really ought to see a doctor nonsense he told her and sounded very firm he seldom talked back to her in that as in most ways she had to admit he made a most satisfactory husband she decided not to push it especially not at the supper table maybe it was just a summer cold and he would get better but he didnt the cough went on he lost more flesh and hed never had that much to spare his appetite dwindled a couple of times nellie started to tell him to go to a doctors office each time she held back she didnt want to be a nag especially where hed dug in his heels then just before the fourth of july he had another coughing fit and she saw red on his handkerchief that does it hal she declared trying her best not to show how alarmed she was you get yourself to the doctor right this minute do you hear me if hed argued she would have dragged him by the heels but he didnt he only sighed and nodded and said yes maybe you are right all the pep has oozed right out of me the past few months feels like he made the appointment nellie made sure he kept it when he got back she said well what did he tell you nothing yet not really he answered he took an x ray of my chest i have to go back in a couple of days after he gets the photograph developed he will not charge me anything extra for the second visit hed better not not when its his fault nellie said and then anxiously do you want me to come along with you dear she didnt use endearments with hal very often that she did now showed how worried she was thank you nellie you are very sweet he was as usual politealmost courtlybut he shook his head without hesitation i hope i am by now a grown man whatever the news may be you can trust me to bring it home to you you know i trust you nellie said and that was true she could rely on him absolutely that was the rock on which theyd built the past going on fifteen years some people had passion at the bottom of their marriage nellie was pretty sure edna and merle didand yet that marriage had almost come apart when merle found out the soldier edna had nearly married before him wore cs butternut not us greengray trust mattered in any marriage what if hal knew i killed bill reach nellie shoved that question down as she always did the only way two can keep a secret is if one of them is dead that fit her and hals former spy bossher former client in her much much younger days in the demimondeto a t ednas secret had got out as nellie had thought it would sooner or later she would take her own to the grave with her considering hals cough she wished she hadnt thought of it like that when the day for the new doctors appointment came he put a closed sign in the window of the cobblers shop where hed worked so long and walked on over it was only three or four blocks to the office across the street in the coffeehouse where shed worked so long though not as long as hal nellie watched him go her eyes kept coming back to the closed sign she didnt like the look of it and she kept missing customers orders either not hearing what they wanted or bringing them the wrong thing even though shed written down the right one hal came back about an hour and a quarter after hed left he took down the closed sign and went back to work maybe that meant everything was fine maybe it just meant he had a lot to do nellie didnt think he would come across the street right away and tell her if the news was bad he wasnt like that and she couldnt go ask him right away because she was busy herself if i keep making mistakes like im doing though ill lose so many customers ill never be this busy again she thought at last she had a moment when nobody was in the coffeehouse she hung up her own closed sign waited for a break in the traffic and crossed the street the bell over hals door jingled he looked up from a new heel he was putting on spitting a mouthful of brads into the palm of his hand he said hello nellie she couldnt tell anything from his face or voice she had to ask it what did the doctor say what did the x ray say i have something unusual he laughed as if proud of himself the doctor said he has only seen it a few times in all the years he has been practicing what is it nellie didnt scream at him she never knew why or how she didnt but she didnt she waited taut as a fiddle string it is called carcinoma of the lungs hal pronounced the unfamiliar word with care he pulled out his cigarettes and lit one when he offered the pack to nellie she shook her head not now what the devil does that mean anyway well it is like aa growth in there he said a growth what kind of a growth what can they do about it the questions flew quick and sharp like machinegun fire hal sighed it is a cancer nellie they can aim more x rays at it the doctor said that will slow it down for a while slow it down for a while nellie echoed her husband nodded she knew what that meant knew what it had to mean but grasped for a straw anyhow can they stop it it is a cancer he repeated we can hope for a miracle but a shrug who knows why cancers happen just bad luck the doctor said he blew a smoke ring at the ceiling as he had for clara and armstrong then stubbing out the cigarette he said i am not afraid of death darling i am afraid of dying a little because i do not think it will be easy but i am not afraid of death death will bring me peace the only thing i am sorry for is that it will take me away from you and clara i do not think many men have the last years of their lives be the happiest one but i have i feel like the luckiest man in the world even now oh hal nellie hardly noticed the tears running down her face what are we going to do without you what can we do without you i love you it took me a long time to figure that outlonger than it should have you being the finest man i ever knewbut i do and who knows maybe therell be a miracle with the x rays she grabbed for that straw again hals smile was gentle yes maybe there will he said meaning not a chance he brushed her lips with his with you and clara i have already had two miracles nellie shivered she wasnt couldnt be ready for this but who ever could ready or not it always came americanempire thecentercannothold xv h ere you are george sylvia enos said setting a plate of bacon and eggs in front of her son when his fishing boat was in port she liked to stuff him she was convinced the cook on the whitecap was trying to starve him logic told her that was silly especially since hed grown into a strapping man almost six feet tall and broad as a bull through the shoulders logic sometimes had nothing to do with anything thanks ma he slathered on salt and pepper and started to eat with his mouth full he went on you know what when i went out to the banks i took along a copy of i sank roger kimball thats a good bookthats a really good book you and that writer fellow did a heck of a job the brief pause there surely meant he was changing what he might have said on the deck of the whitecap sylvia smiled shed raised him right he didnt cuss in front of herwell not much anyhow thank you she said now you ought to thank ernie too he did the real work and hes a brick tooif it hadnt been for him wedve lost our money when the bank went under he didnt have to come back and warn me about that but he did she turned away so her son wouldnt see the look on her face she didnt know what her expression was exactly but she did know it wasnt one she wanted george jr seeing she would have gone to bed with ernie shed wanted to go to bed with him and a whole fat lot of good that did me she thought just my damned luck the first time i really want a man since george got killed to fix on one who couldnt do me any goodor himself either poor fellow george jr got up and poured himself more coffeeand sylvia too when she pushed her cup toward him he added cream and sugar sipped and said theres a lot of stuff in there i never knew before im not surprised sylvia answered that was nine years ago now you were still a boy then when you put me and mary jane on the train to connecticut did you really think youd never see us again yes i thought that it was the hardest thing about what i did sylvia said but no one was going to make that man pay for what he did to the ericsson at the end of the war and he deserved to but you would have paid too i didnt even think about what would happen to me when i found out he was running around loose i didnt think about much of anything that must have been very strange george jr said a couple of fellows on the boat were in the army during the warthey got conscripted before they could join the navy or else they werent sailors yet i dont know which where was i oh yeah sometimes they tell stories they talk about how they were going up against confederate machine guns and they didnt think theyd come back alive it must have been like that for you too maybe sylvia wasnt so sure if a man charged a machine gun he had a chance of livingmaybe not much of a chance but a chance once shed shot roger kimball she was in the hands of the law and she didnt think she had any chance of escape at all she hadnt counted on having confederate politics come to her rescue her son said you have a book signing this morning thats right every time i sign one thats fourteen and threequarter cents in my pocket sylvia answered she couldnt have figured that out herself from the murky language of the book contract shed signed ernie had explained the way things worked call it fifteen cents george jrs face got a faraway look hed always been good in school sylvia wished he would have liked it more would have got his highschool diploma instead of going to work on t wharf years too late to worry about that though he went on if you sign twenty of them then thats three dollars thats not a bad days wage i dont know if ill sign that many of them sylvia said but theyre buying the bookor i hope they arefrom here to san diego well see what it does thats all the reviews have been pretty good that was ernies doing of course the actual words on paper were his but the storys mine sylvia reminded herself he couldnt have written it if not for me my name deserves to be on the cover too might be just as well they took a while getting it into print her son said with the freedom party coming up again in the csa people here are liable to be more interested in what happened to one of its bigwigs back then sylvia blinked that was true and she hadnt thought of it herself george jr had a mans shrewdness well fair enoughhe was a man hed be old enough to vote in november has it really been more than twentyone years since he was born sylvia didnt want to believe that but couldnt very well help it the bookstore burkes wasnt far from faneuil hall no line stretched around the block waiting for her when she arrived they did have a sign in the window saying shed be there that was good shed signed at two or three stores that hadnt let anyone know shed be there as a result she hadnt signed much she took her place at a table near the door the table held a dozen copies of i sank roger kimball and a neat handlettered sign meet the author a man in a suit that had seen better days came up to her and asked excuse me maam but wheres the bathroom im sorry i dont work here sylvia said shed already seen people paid no attention to signs the man muttered something and went away another man came up he took a book from the pile for her to sign i was in the navy he said you did everybody on the ericsson a good turn thank you sylvia said a woman picked up a copy of the book she said my brother would like this and his birthday is coming up would you sign it to pete please to pete sylvia echoed and wrote the mans name and hers on the title page that was where ernie had said the autograph was supposed to go he knew such things or sylvia was willing to believe he did a plump woman in a flowered housedress approached where are your cookbooks dear she asked im sorry i dont work here sylvia said again she held up a copy of i sank roger kimball would you like to buy my book ill be glad to sign it for you if you do of course i will it makes me money the woman shook her head not unless its got good recipes for beans and cabbage in it that sylvia couldnt claim the other woman wandered off in search of cookbooks over the next two hours four more people asked sylvia questions whose answers only someone who worked at burkes could have known she sent them off to the clerk behind the cash register she also did get another nine people to buy copies of the book most by simply sitting there and having them come up a couple by waving the book as they walked into the store the first time shed signed she hadnt done thatshed been too shy but the manager of that bookstore gave her a tip she took to heart if you dont toot your own horn lady whos gonna do it for you she was getting ready to go home when the bell over burkes front door jangled again in walked a lean irishman with a lot of teeth he tipped his fedora to her good day to you mrs enos striding up to the table he took a copy of her book and opened it to the title page most people left to themselves chose the halftitle page or the blank sheet in front of it but he knew the ropes if youd be so kind of course mr kennedy she wrote for joseph kennedybest wishes sylvia enos and gave the book back to him another fourteen and threequarter cents she thought but i didnt expect hed want anything to do with me kennedy took the book over to the clerk paid for it and then came back to sylvias table i hope this means youve come to your senses politically speaking he remarked though the way he looked at her didnt seem political at all she said ive always been a democrat that wasnt strictly true shed favored the socialists till she saw upton sinclair do no more than protest to the confederate states when it came out that roger kimball had torpedoed the uss ericsson after the confederates were supposed to have stopped fighting but shed voted democratic for as long as shed had the suffrage you sometimes picked odd ways to show it no kennedy hadnt forgotten seeing her at a socialist rally on the boston common knowing he hadnt forgotten she asked him what do you want with me the way his eyes flashed told her one thing he wanted he knew she knew he was married his wife had watched her children when she spoke at a democratic function he didnt care if she knew he wanted what he wanted but he made himself remember he wanted something else too i hear youre doing well with your book i look forward to reading it thank you sylvia enos said kennedy hefted his copy of i sank roger kimball this has put you in the public eye you know we have a campaign to run mrs enos would you help governor coolidgehelp the democratic partytake powel house back from the socialists they were lucky at first but whats happened to the country in president blackfords term shows their true colors that wasnt even close to fair and sylvia knew it but shed already seen that political campaigns werent designed to be fair they were designed to convince by whatever means possible she said id like to help mr kennedy but i dont know if i can times are hard dont you worry about that joseph kennedy said dont you worry about that a bit well take care of you that glint showed again in his eyes how does a hundred dollars a month sound from now till the election plus expenses of course for a moment it sounded too good to be true but then sylvia remembered ernie talking about his dicker with their publisher and about first offers being meant to snag people who didnt have the nerve the stand up for what they were really worth her spine stiffened she said im sorry mr kennedy but ive got so many things planned that isnt really enough to pull me away joseph kennedy eyed her again this time in a very different way plainly hed expected her not just to say yes but to swoon with gratitude after a long moment he nodded perhaps seeing her for the first time as a person and not just as a tool or a nicely shaped piece of meat more to you than meets the eye isnt there he said more to himself than to her he grew brisk well business is business and youll do us some good how does two hundred a month sound then sylvia didnt gasp but she came close the way things were that was a lot of money and expenses and full pay for november too she asked kennedy bared his teeth you sure youre not a sheeny mrs enos he said she didnt answer she just waited he gave her a sour nod and expenses and full pay for november too he promised and stuck out his hand bargain she was oddly reluctant to touch him she didnt see how she could avoid it though when they shook on the deal his hand felt like a hand somehow she hadnt expected his flesh to seem so ordinary bargain she said the wolf wouldnt come round her door again till the end of the yearlonger if she salted some money away as she planned to that made it a fine bargain indeed as far as she was concerned a eroplanes roared off the remembrance s flight deck one after another even with a push from the catapult to speed them on their way they almost dropped into the graygreen water of the northern pacific till they gained altitude and buzzed away some to the north others to the south sam carsten scratched his nose his fingertip came away white with zincoxide ointment even here off the west coast of canada he needed shielding from the summer sun but though he might burn in these waters he wouldnt scorch he turned to george moerlein back when they were both petty officers theyd bunked together but moerlein was even newer on the remembrance than he was now having rejoined her crew during a fueling stop in seattle carsten said feels good to see us in business again yeahuh yes sir moerlein said sorry sir dont worry about it sam answered his old bunkmate had forgotten for a moment he was an officer these days he went on im just glad this ship isnt tied up at the boston navy yard any more me too sir moerlein got it right this time that was what finally made me put in for a transferi wondered if shed ever go to sea again for a hell of a long time sure didnt look like it he pulled out a cigar then sheepishly put it back in his pocket the smoking lamp was out on the flight deck during takeoffs and landings for excellent good reasons the petty officer shook his head ive been away too damn long i shouldnt even have started to do that well you saved me the trouble of barking at you sam answered moerlein gave him a wry grin then said what the hell do we do if we catch the japs with their finger in the cookie jar theyre in international waters same as we are what can we do damned if i know carsten said but if theyre sending people into canada to try to get the canucks to rise up against us we cant let em get away with that can we beats me moerlein told him but if we do find em and we do clobber em dont you figure its about even money were doing it on account of president blackford needs votes and wants to look tough sam scowled id hate to think that he drummed his fingers on his trouser leg of course just because id hate to think it doesnt mean its wrong an hour later another flight of aeroplanes took off from the remembrance while a flight that had gone out before landed on the deck the carrier kept aeroplanes in the sky all the time if the japs really were trying to sneak something past her they wouldnt have an easy time of it as far as sam could prove the remembrance was just going through the motions her air patrols had spotted nothing out of the ordinary fishing boats and merchantmen none of them flying the rising sun whether they stumbled upon any actual jap warships or not though the training the whole crewand especially the pilotsgot was priceless as far as he was concerned george moerlein had it dead right anything was better than sitting in the navy yard when klaxons started howling a couple of days later sam sprinted to his battle station figuring it was just another drill he certainly hoped so going to the bowels of the ship on antitorpedo duty wasnt never had been and never would be his favorite choice by now though hed spent more than twenty years in the navy he knew how things worked the navy did what it wanted not what he wanted commander van der waal was down there ahead of him at the head of a damagecontrol party the other officers face was thoroughly grim whats up sir sam panted they tell you anything yes van der waal said our aeroplanes spotted a highpowered motorboat pulling away from what looked like an ordinary freighter ordinary freighters dont carry speedboats though son of a bitch sam said softly and then louder they sure dont what flag is the freighter flying argentine van der waal answered but the aeroplane buzzed her at smokestack height and the sailors dont look like theyre from argentina she doesnt respond to wireless signals either the throb of the remembrance s engine grew louder and deeper as the great ship picked up speed son of a bitch sam said again what are we going to do about it freighters only about sixty miles north of us van der waal said seems like were going up for a looksee of our own what about that speedboat carsten asked it wont outrun an aeroplaneprobably a swarm of aeroplanes by now commander van der waal said but if we find that freighters full of japs sailing under cover of a false flag well i dont know what well do then argentine flags handy for themargentina doesnt love us either sam said during the great war argentina had fought chile and paraguay both of them us allies because shed been making money hand over fist sending grain and meat to britain and france sams old ship had been part of the americanchilean fleet that sailed round the horn to try to cut off that trade not altogether successfully not till the empire of brazil finally entered the war on the side of the usa and germany forcing argentine and british ships out of her territorial waters we may be only a couple of hours from war ensign van der waal said yes sir sam answered well if we are i hope we kick the japs around the block but good in fact he wondered how much damage the usa and japan could do to each other an awful lot of ocean separated the two countries the united statesthe american empire counting canadahad more resources could they bring them all to bear though with a long frontier facing a confederacy that hated them and might be tempted to throw in with the japs of course the japanese had to worry about the russians sitting over their holdings in manchuria after a while a sailor brought word from the wireless room weve ordered them to stop for inspection and they say they dont have to not in international waters they sure as hell dont talk like argentines technically whoever was aboard that freighter was right technically a man who stepped out into the street with a traffic light was also right if a truck ran the light and killed him he ended up just as dead as if hed been wrong another half an hour passed then one of the fiveinch guns sam knew so well bellowed shot across her bow van der waal said carsten nodded and then quite suddenly the remembrance s engines roared with emergency power the great ship turned hard to port van der waal and carsten stared at each other sam said they mustve he got no further than that because a torpedo slammed into the aeroplane carrier and knocked him off his feet the lights flickered but stayed on starboard hit felt like back toward the stern van der waal said he was on his wallet when he tried to get to his feet he fell back with a groan and a curse i think the burst broke my ankle i cant move on it are you sound carsten sam was already upright again yes sir youre in charge of damage control then the other officer said biting his lip against the pain i know its not the job you wanted but youve got to do it were taking on water sure as hell yes sir i can feel it carsten agreed astonishing how small a list his sense of balance could detect but this wasnt a time to marvel about such things not if he wanted to have the chance to marvel later he nodded to van der waal ill take care of it sir you bet come on boyslets get moving even as he led the men of the damagecontrol party back toward the wound in the ship he wondered if the next torpedo would slam into her amidships and flood the engine room if she lost power the lights and the pumps would fail and then the remembrance might well go down that damn jap ship mustve had a submersible tagging along in case we found her he thought unhappily and were out here all by our lonesome without any destroyers along the navy department didnt really believe wed come up with anything so they decided to do this on the cheap now its liable to kill us all one of the sailors said fuel storage for the aeroplanes is back here were lucky the gasoline didnt blow up and send us right to the moon gurk sam said he hadnt thought of that all the watertight doors were closed that was something but how many doors how many watertight compartments had the blast shattered that was what they had to find out whether the remembrance lived or died would turn on the answer water in the corridor told them they were nearing the hit do we open that door sir a sailor asked pointing to the twisted portal no longer tight under which the seawater was leaking you bet we do sam answered likely men still alive on the other side now we fan out too cover as much ground as we can start sealing off what we have to and getting out sailors lets go this is what weve trained for and its what weve got to do i sound just like commander van der waal he thought damned if he wasnt right all along even if i didnt feel like admitting it they found sailors closer to the damage who were already doing what they could to stem the tide of water pouring into the remembrance stuffing mattresses and whatever else they could find into sprung seams between doors and hatchways and such carsten took charge of them too he kicked aside a floating severed hand that still trailed blood before long he was sure the hit the aeroplane carrier had taken wouldnt sink her most of her compartments were holding against the flood both his sense of balance and a level he had with him insisted that her list had stabilized her pumps never faltered most important of all the second torpedo the one hed dreaded so much never came in spare moments when he wasnt too busy sloshing through seawater eventually up past his waist he wondered why the japanese submersible hadnt put another fish or two or three more into the remembrance word eventually trickled down from above sir we sank the fucker a messenger said she launched two at us one missed the other one nailed us we had some aeroplanes with bombs underneath em in the air by then to help sink the jap freighter and the speedboat one of em spotted the submersible as she launched and he put a bomb right on the bastards conning tower that sub sank and it aint coming up again bully every once in a while especially when he didnt think sam still used the slang hed grown up with the messenger was a freshfaced kid whod surely been pissing in his diapers when the great war started and looked at him as if at the pyramids of egypt or any other antiquity he didnt care if the kid wanted to say swell that was fine most of the time sam said swell himself but bully even if it did smack of the days before the war said what he wanted to say too the united states had found themselves a new fight theyd need the remembrance and sam oldfashioned or not was glad not to be among its first casualties h eadlines in the rosenfeld register shrieked of war vicious jap attack on uss remembrance a subhead said ship badly damaged but stays afloat another headline warned beware the yellow peril mary mcgregor had never seen a japanese in her life except for pictures in books shed never seen a negro either she imagined japanese almost as yellow as sunflowers with slit eyes set in their faces at a fortyfivedegree angle it wasnt a pretty picture she didnt care the japs were fighting the united states as far as she was concerned nothing else mattered if they were fighting the usa she was all for them the yellow peril story in the register warned anyone who spotted a jap to report him at once to us occupation authorities she pointed that out to her mother pretty funny isnt it she said cant you just see a jap walking down the main street in rosenfeld and stopping in at gibbons general store to buy a pickle and some thumbtacks that story must be going out all over canada her mother said maybe there are places where you really might run into japanese peoplevancouver somewhere like that i know theyve got chinamen in vancouver why not japs too maybe mary said that would make some senseas much sense as the yanks ever make anyway but why put that kind of notice in the register its just stupid here really really stupid she held up a hand before her mother could answer i know why some yank in a swivel chair probably said stick this order in every paper in canada from british columbia to nova scotia and stick it in every paper in newfoundland too while youre about it who cares whether it makes sense if youre sitting in a swivel chair maude mcgregor smiled youre probably right the americans do things like that they like giving big orders if you know what i mean its part of what makes them the kind of people they are had mary been a man among men and not a young woman talking with her mother she would have expressed her detailed opinion about what sort of people americans were her eyes must have sparked in a way that got her opinion across without words for her mothers smile got wider then maude mcgregor said next time you go to the cinema with mort pomeroy make sure there arent any japs under the front seat in his motorcar ill do that mary said laughing her mothers smile changed she said your face just lit up you think hes special dont you yes mary nodded without hesitation ive never felt like this about a boy before she hadnt had much chance to feel anything special about boys up till now most of them stayed away from the mcgregor house as if she had a dangerous disease and in occupied canada what disease could be more dangerous than not only descending from someone whod fought the yanks to his last breath but also being proud of it im glad he makes you happy her mother said i hope he keeps making you happy for years and years if thats what you both end up wanting i think maybe it is mary said slowly a certain wonder in her voice he hasnt asked me or anything but i think ill say yes if he does the only thing i dont know about yet is how he feels about the usa would you let that stand between the two of you if you really love each other her mother asked i dont think i could really love anybody who sucks up to the americans mary answered i just couldnt stand it so ill have to find out about that then ill make up my mind maude mcgregor sighed all right dear im not going to try to tell you any different youre old enough to know your own mind but i am going to tell you this im afraid you wont have too many chances so youd be smart to think twice before you waste any of them i never expected to have any mary said well see what happens thats all im going out to the barn now i want to give the cow a bottle of that drench we got from the vet i dont know how much good it will do her mother said neither do i mary shrugged but it wont do any good if the cow doesnt drink it so id better try the trick in getting medicine into a cow she knew was making sure she thrust the bottle almost down its throat otherwise the drench would slop out the other side of the beasts mouth it probably tasted nastyit stank of ammonia and she wouldnt have wanted to drink it herself she poured it down the cow though and had the satisfaction of pulling the empty bottle from the beasts mouth and seeing only a few drops on the dirt and straw in the stall however satisfied mary was the cow was anything but it drank from the trough no doubt to get rid of the taste of the drench mary left the stall she paused and sat down by the old wagon wheel she hadnt given up she didnt intend to give up she still burned to pay back the yanksand the canadians who collaborated with them ill take care of it father she whispered dont you worry about a thing ill take care of it and what would mort pomeroy think of that he hadnt run away from her when he found out she was arthur mcgregors daughter that surely meant he had some interest in herand that he liked the yanks none too well what else could it possibly mean cold as manitoba winter she answered her silent rhetorical question it could mean hes head over heels for you and doesnt care about politics one way or the otheror if he does care hell forget about that for the time being because hes head over heels for you or colder yet it could mean hes really a collaborator himself but hes pretending not to be so he can trap you mary shook her head it wasnt so much that she believed mort incapable of such an outrage though she did it was much more that she didnt think the yanks could be interested in her her father after all was almost nine years dead shed been a girl when he blew himself up since then she hadnt done anything overt against the americans oh they were bound to know she didnt love them but if they got rid of every canadian who didnt love them this would be a wide and ever so empty land she took her weekly bath earlier than usual that saturday and dressed in her best calico her mother smiled what time is mort coming for you she asked between six and sixthirty mary answered do i look all right she anxiously patted at her hair you look wonderful her mother answered im sure youll have a good time talking pictures who would have thought of such a thing mary sniffed theyve had them in the usa and the csa for a couple of years now were only the poor relations we have to wait our turn that may be part of it but rosenfelds not the big city either maude mcgregor said ill bet theyve had them in places like winnipeg and toronto for a while now with another sniff mary said maybe she didnt want to give the americans the benefit of any doubt mort pomeroy pulled up in his oldsmobile at six on the dot mary didnt couldnt hold his driving an american auto against him after the us conquest the canadian automobile industry no longer existed hello mary mort said when she came to the door you look very pretty tonight hello mrs mcgregor he added to her mother who stood behind her hello mort maude mcgregor answered gravely shall we go mary didnt sound graveshe was eager have a nice time her mother said she didnt tack on dont stay out too late as she had on morts first few visits to the farmhouse riding in a motorcar was something mary hadnt done very often before she got to know mort pomeroy though she tried not to let on it was ever so much faster and smoother than traveling by wagon almost before she knew it they were back in rosenfeld mort laid down two quarters at the cinema as if hed never had to worry about money in his life that mary doubted his father might make a living from his diner but nobody got rich running a business in rosenfeld inside the theater he bought them a tub of popcorn and some sweet fizzy stuff called yankee cola the bubbles tickled as they went up marys nose she laughed in spite of the fizzy waters name music blared from the screen as the newsreel started then there were pictures of a damaged warship that with its flat deck and asymmetrical smokestack and superstructure was as funnylooking as anything mary had every imagined jap treachery almost sank the uss remembrance the announcer boomed but quick work by her damagecontrol team saved her on the screen a very fair officer looked out at the audience we got her back to port he said shell be in action again before long and then the enemys going to pay mary leaned toward mort pomeroy too bad the japs didnt sink her she whispered and waited to see how hed respond he nodded he didnt make a fuss about it or get excited but he nodded mary didnt think she could have stood it if hed said he would rather see the usa win than japan as things were she smiled and leaned her head on his shoulder in the dark theater and enjoyed the film sound did add to the story more than it did to the newsreel where most of it had been martial music and an announcer reading what would have been shown before in print on the screen hearing characters talk and sing made her feel as if she lived in new york city with themand made her feel as if she wanted to which was even more startling afterwards mort drove her back toward the farmhouse voice elaborately casual he said we could stop for a little while there were only the two of them and the motorcar and the vast canadian prairie who would know if they did stop for a little while no one at all yes mary said also casually we could he parked on the soft shoulder and turned off the engine and the headlights it was very quiet and very dark they slid towards each other on the front seat his arms went around her they kissed for a long time he squeezed her breasts through the thin cotton fabric of her dress the heat that filled her had nothing to do with the warm summer evening but when he set a hand high on her thigh and tried to slide it higher yet she twisted away im not that kind of girl mort she said and hoped her breathless voice didnt give away her lie evidently not he just nodded and said kiss me again then sweetheart and ill take you home she did happily he fired up the oldsmobiles engine and put the auto in gear off toward the farm it went mary didnt know when shed been so happy looking at mort pomeroy there beside her she was almost sorry she wasnt that kind of girl o ccupation duty colonel abner dowling made the words into a curse my countrys at war and what do i get occupation duty theres no justice in the world none at all as general custers adjutant sir you were right at the heart of things during the great war captain toricelli said i wanted to be at the front not at first army headquarters dowling said that was nothing but the truth it wasnt the whole truth of course the whole truth was he would have sold his soul for seventeen cents to escape the company of general custer provided the devil or anyone else had offered him the spare change for it and yet custer unquestionably was a hero a hero many times over how did that square with the other dowling cast a suspicious eye in the direction of captain toricelli what did toricelli think of him some things perhaps were better left unknown if you must do occupation duty sir his adjutant persisted there are worse places than salt lake city if the mormons rise up again with all their might they dont just tie down men we might use fighting the japs not likely they could dowling said damned few battleships and cruisers and submersibles in the great salt lake eryes sir captain toricelli said but the railroads still run through utah an uprising could keep manufactured goods from getting to the west coast and oil from getting to the east that would make everything much harder i should say it would dowling agreed and fighting japan will be hard enough as is the little yellow men have been getting ready for this ever since the great war and what have we been doing the past twelve years not enough captain im very much afraid we havent done enough do you know what worries me more than anything else sir toricelli said tell me captain dowling urged i can always use something new to worry about i may not be able to find enough things on my own eryes toricelli said again abner dowling in a sportive mood disconcerted him gathering himself he went on im afraid president blackford will pick up a lot of votes because were at war oh dowling scowled that made entirely too much sense for him to like it i do hope youre wrong with luck people will see a democrat in powel house is the best hope we have of winning this war weve been in two with republicans and we lost both of those and were not off to a good start with a socialist running one ill trade youdo you want to know what worries me more than anything else tell me sir angelo toricelli replied he didnt actually say he wanted to know but he came close enough he was an adjutant after all part of his job was listening to his superior dowling knew more about that side of being an adjutant than he cared to but the shoe was on the other foot now he didnt have to listen to general custers maunderings any more and he didnt intend to maunder here he said im afraid the japs will take the sandwich islands away from us the way we took them away from england in that would be very bad without the sandwich islands wed be fighting this war out of san diego and san francisco and seattle the logistics couldnt get much worse than that well no sir captain toricelli said but we caught the british by surprise when the great war broke out i cant imagine the japanese pulling off a surprise attack against pearl harbor i hope not by god dowling said still who would have thought they could have pulled off a sneak attack on the remembrance that was a pretty slick piece of work it cost them too his adjutant said they lost their freighter and their speedboat and their submersible a good thing they did dowling said if that sub could have launched a second spread of torpedoes wed have lost our aeroplane carrier by everything people say we almost lost her anyhow he shook his head his jowls wobbled as far as you can in a situation like that we got lucky toricelli nodded and canadas quietfor the time being anyhow and president mitchels keeping the csa quiet too he cant possibly strike at usthe confederates are no more ready for a big war than we are less if anything and the action francaise is busy puffing out its chest and making faces at the kaiser so its just us and the japs and thousands of miles of water dowling added yes sirand several thousand miles of water captain toricelli agreed those thousands of miles of water of course were the main reason abner dowling would almost surely stay in utah for as long as the war lasted the united states had needed an enormous army to take on the confederate states along the land frontier the two american republics sharedhad needed it got it and won with it but what good was an enormous army out in the pacific where most of the islands were small and where the only way to get to them was by ship none dowling could see he surged to his feet saying im going to take a bit of a constitutional every doctor hed ever seen told him hed be better off if he lost weight trouble was he had no great interest in losing it hed always been heavy he felt good and he liked nothing in the whole wide world better than eating by the time he got to the entrance to army headquarters in salt lake city a squad of armed guards waited to escort him on his stroll his adjutant must have telephoned ahead dowling fumed a little he didnt want to go for a walk surrounded by soldiers but he could hardly claim he didnt need guards not after hed been in general pershings office when that still uncaught assassin gunned down the military governor of utah if anybody in a thirdstory window had a rifle or maybe just a grenade all the guards wouldnt do him a hell of a lot of good he knew thatknew it and refused to dwell on it lets go boys he said yes sir they chorused the privates among them were young men conscripts the sergeant who led the squad was in his thirties a great war veteran with ribbons for the purple heart and the bronze star among the fruit salad on his chest the wind blew out of the west it tasted of alkali dowling thought tumbleweeds should have been blowing down dusty streets with a wind like that the streets in salt lake city werent dusty though they were well paved everything in the citywith the inevitable exception of the ruins of the temple and tabernaclewas shiny and new everything from before the great war had been knocked flat during the mormon uprising sea gulls spiraled overhead seeing them always bemused dowling staying within the borders of the united states you couldnt get much farther from the sea than salt lake city the gulls didnt care they ate bugs and garbage and anything else they could scrounge farmers liked them dowling pulled down his hat hoping the gulls wouldnt make any untoward bombing runs he strolled past the sandbagged perimeter around the headquarters soldiers in machinegun nests saluted as he went by he returned the salutes leaving headquarters wasnt so hard to return he knew hed have to show his identification the mormons hadnt tried anything lately that didnt mean they wouldnt people on the street looked like people women tugged at their skirts to keep them from flipping up in the breeze boys in short pants ran and shouted a long line of men waited patiently in front of a soup kitchen dowling could have seen the like in any mediumsized city in the usa and yet nobody said anything to him he hadnt expected anyone would not with soldiers tramping along beside him with bayonets glittering on their springfields no one even gave him a dirty look but he still had the feeling of being in the middle of a deep freeze the locals hated him and theyd go right on hating him too after a bit he noticed one difference between salt lake city and other mediumsized towns in the usa no election posters shouted from walls and fences no billboards praised hosea blackford and calvin coolidge being under martial law utah didnt enjoy the franchise lawsuits to let the locals vote had gone all the way to the supreme courtand had been rejected every time ever since the war of secession the supreme court had taken a much friendlier line toward the federal governments authority than toward any competing principle and its paid off by god dowling thought we finally licked the damned confederates were the strongest country in america were one of the two or three strongest countries in the world we did what we had to do he turned a corner turned it and frowned half a dozen posters were plastered on a wall there simple wordless things showing a goldandblack bee on a white background the bee symbol of industry was also the symbol of deseret the name the mormons had given to the wouldbe state the us army crushed dowling turned to the sergeant who headed the bodyguards note this address he said if those posters arent down tomorrow well have to fine the property owner yes sir the sergeant said crisply martial law meant no antigovernment propaganda the mormons and the government hadnt liked or trusted each other since the s theyd despised each other since the s and hated each other since that didnt look like changing any time soon the governmentand the armyheld the whip hand if the posters didnt come down the man on whose property they were displayed would be reckoned disloyal and would have to pay for that disloyalty of course hes disloyal dowling thought the only people in utah who arent disloyal are the ones who arent mormonsand we cant trust all of them either the army didnt stop to ask a whole lot of questions about who was who back in we landed on everybody with both feet so some of the gentiles havent got any use for us either well too bad for them as he walked down the block he saw more bee posters he nodded to the sergeant who took down more addresses one man was already out in front of his house with a bucket of hot water and a scraper taking down the posters on his front fence dowling nodded to the noncom again this time in a different way that address didnt get taken but when dowling asked the man scraping away at the posters if he knew whod put them up the fellow just shook his head didnt see a thing he answered he likely would have said the same thing if hed given cups of coffee to the subversives whod put the posters on his fencenot that pious mormons would have either offered or accepted coffee even the locals who outwardly cooperated with us authority werent reliable or anything close to it with a sigh abner dowling went on his way he wasnt in the front lines against the japanese he probably never would be but whenever he went out into salt lake city he got reminded he was at war n o misteruhmartin sorry sir the clerk in the hiring office shook her head we arent looking for anyone right now good luck somewhere else thanks chester martin said savagely the clerk blushed and ran a sheet of paper into her typewriter so she wouldnt have to look at him jamming the brim of his cloth cap down almost to his eyes martin stalked out of the office he didnt even slam the door behind him he might come back to this steel mill again and he didnt want them remembering him the wrong way he wanted work he wanted it so bad he could taste it but wanting and having werent the same somewhere around one man in four in toledo was out of a job it was the same all over the country he hadnt really expected to find work here but he had to keep going through the motions hed been to every steel mill in town at least four times with never the trace of a nibble hed been other places too hed been to every kind of outfit that might need a strong back and a set of muscles hed had just as much luck at the plateglass and cutglass works at the docks at the grain mills and even at the cloverseed market as he had in his proper line of work zero equaled zero he didnt remember much of what hed learned in school but that was pretty obvious a man in a colorless cloth cap shabbier than his own came up to him and held out a hand voice a sour whine the man said got a dime you can spare pal chester shook his head i dont have a job either the other man eyed himhere plainly was another fellow whod lost his job early in the collapse you havent been out of work all that long he said you still think youll get one pretty soon the day was hot and muggy but his laugh might have come from the middle of winter i have to martin said simply thats what i said the other unemployed man replied thats just what i said after a while though you find a blackfordburgh isnt such a bad place you just wait buddy youll see he tipped his shabby cap and walked on with a shudder as if a goose had walked over his grave martin went on his way too he and rita were still hanging on to their apartment thanks to money borrowed from his folks but he didnt know how long his father and mother would be able to go on helping them if his father lost his job chester didnt even want to think about that how could he help it though with so many men pounding the pavement looking for work guys just like me he thought as his own feet slapped up and down up and down on the sidewalk he had a long walk home he didnt care a long walk beat paying a nickel trolley fare one of these days soon though hed have to shell out some money to let the little old armenian cobbler down the street repair his shoes walking wore on the soles as much as being out of work wore on the soul somebody on a soapboxactually on what looked like a beer barrelwas making a speech under the statue of remembrance across from city hall a couple of dozen men and a handful of women listened impassively as the fellow bawled weve got to hang all the damn reds they arent real americansthey never have been and the democrats are just as bad no worse by thunder they pretend they want us strong but all they really aim to do is keep us weak half of em are in the japs pockets right this minute so help me god they are he paused for applause he didnt get much chester martin kept walking he supposed it was inevitable that hard times would spawn reaction but this fellow seemed no threat to imitate what the freedom party was doing in the csa just a noisy nut chester thought its not like we havent got enough of those vote socialist posters a little farther on proclaimed together we have power they showed a brawny factory worker swinging a hammer under a bare electric bulb nowhere did they mention hosea blackfords name it was as if they wanted to forget he was there while hoping he got reelected anyhow coolidge the democrats posters werent shy about naming their man hell fix things they promised and showed the governor of massachusetts as a confidentlooking physician at the bedside of a wan us eagle that wasnt fair but it was liable to be effective and the democrats seemed not only willing but proud to tell the world who their presidential candidate was they even had his running mate a native iowan with slickeddown hair at his side handing him a stethoscope martin muttered under his breath the depths to which the united states had fallen in the past three years and more truly made him wonder whether hed done the right thing in turning socialist after the great war it had seemed like a good idea at the time he laughed though it wasnt funny for how many mistakes was that an excuse about half the ones in the world if he was any judge but it had with the big capitalists clamping down tight on labor in the rough days right after the war voting socialist had seemed the only way to hold his own and it had worked for ten years and more the country stayed prosperous but when prosperity died it died painfully would the democrats have let things get this bad chester pondered that as he tramped toward his apartment he still had the letter teddy roosevelt had sent him after he was wounded hed met roosevelt in the trenches during the warhad in fact jumped on the president and knocked him flat when the confederates started shelling his position on the roanoke front roosevelt hadnt forgotten him trs concern hadnt been based on class as the socialists was it had been personal the socialists sneered at such ties saying they were like those of an oldtime baron and his feudal retainers maybe the socialists were right chester had no reason to believe they were wrong right or wrong though theyd done none too well themselves maybe personal ties really did count for more than those of class damned if i know martin muttered damned if i know anything any more except that things are fouled up all to hell and gone a woman coming the other way gave him an odd look she didnt say anything she just kept walking the way things were nowadays plenty of people went around talking to themselves martin opened the door to his apartment without having found any answers he doubted anybody in the whole country had any answers if anybody did have them he would have been using them by now wouldnt he ritas voice floated out of the kitchen hello honey how did it go n g chester answered the two slangy initials summed up the way things were in the usa these days the united states were no good no good at all he went on they arent hiring big surprise huh his wife came out of the kitchen an apron around her waist she gave him a hug and a kiss youve got to keep trying she said weve both got to keep trying somethings bound to turn up sooner or later yeah martin hoped his voice didnt sound too hollow he remembered the fellow whod tried to panhandle from him the one whod said he was living in the local blackfordburgh with a shiver martin made himself shove that thought down out of sight he tried to sound bright and cheerful as he asked what smells good he meant that something sure did they hadnt had any meat for a few days but the aroma said they would this evening its a beef heart rita did her best to sound bright and cheerful too mr gabrieli had em on special for practically nothing i know theyre tough but if you stew em long enough they do get tenderwell more tender anyhow and i could afford it all right chester said it does smell good since hed lost his job hed found out about tripe and giblets and head cheese and other things he hadnt eaten before some of them turned out to be pretty goodgiblets for instance he wouldnt get a taste for tripe if he lived to be a hundred he ate it because sometimes it was that or no meat at all sometimesa lot of the timeit was no meat at all maybe the beef heart would prove tasty it proved not too bad no matter how long rita cooked it it remained chewy with a faintly bitter taste but it satisfied in ways cabbage and potatoes and noodles couldnt heres hoping mr gabrieli has it on special again before too long chester said rita nodded unspoken was the painful truth that if even a cheap cut like beef heart wasnt on sale they couldnt afford it when morning came martin went out looking for work again he actually found some hauling bricks from trucks to a construction site it was harder work than any on a foundry floor and didnt pay nearly so well for a full day of it he made two and a half dollars but coming home with any money at all in his pocket felt wonderfulgood enough to let him forget how weary he was and when he set the coins and bills in front of his wife she was delighted too will there be more tomorrow she asked hopefully i dont know he answered but you can bet im going to go back and find out he made sure he got to the construction site early he didnt get there early enough though by the time he came up a couple of hundred men already clamored for work toledo cops did their best to keep order chester had played football against one of the policemen how about a break pal he said let me slide up toward the front i could really use the job the cop shook his head cant do it he said everybody else here is hungry too playing favoritesd be worth my neck he was probably right that made martin no less bitter knowing he had no chance for work there he went off to look for it somewhere else he had no luck not even when he offered to help a truck driver bring crates of vegetables into a store for a quarter no thanks ill do it myself the driver said if i give you a quarter i lose money on the haulage he stacked more cratesall of them with fancy labels glued to one sideon a dolly and wheeled them into the grocery when he came out again he said you that hungry hell yes martin said without hesitation id do damn near anything for a real job again you ought to go to california then the driver said thats where this stuff comes from and they grow so goddamn much out there theyre always looking for pickers and such weathers a damn sight better than it is here too probably doesnt pay anything chester said if it sounds so good why arent you on your way yourself believe me buddy im thinking about it the truck driver said there are times when i dont want to see another snowflake as long as i live you know what i mean yeah martin admitted i do but california its a hell of a long way and who knows what things are really like out there only one way to find out the driver set more crates on the dolly the spicy odors of oranges and lemons filled the air they were in their own way better arguments than anything he could have said california chester muttered as he went off to see what else he could scrounge in toledo pickings were slim pickings in fact couldnt have been any slimmer would they be any better on the far side of the country he shrugged maybe that was the wrong question maybe the right question was how could they be worse u p till now flora blackford had never been to the west coast when she got off the train in los angeles she was surprised to find it was ninety degrees in the second week of october she was even more surprised to discover that ninetydegree weather could be pleasant not the humid hell it would have been in new york city or philadelphia or washingtonor dakota for that matter she joined her husband on the platform at the station president blackford was smiling and shaking hands with wellwishers four more years people chanted patriotic redwhiteandblue bunting was draped everywhere socialist red bunting wasnt vice president hiram johnson said welcome to the golden state mr president were doing everything we can to make sure we deliver the goods three weeks from now thanks very much hiram hosea blackford replied with a gracious smile the two socialist stalwarts stood side by side as photographers snapped pictures flora wondered what the captions to those pictures would say the los angeles times didnt love the socialist party your limousine is waiting mr presidentmrs blackford johnson suddenly seemed to remember that flora existed escorted by police cars with wailing sirens the limousine made its slow way from remembrance station to the custer hotel the bright sunshine the clear blue sky and the palm trees made everything seem wonderful at first glance the grinding despair of the business downturn might have been on the other side of the world or at least on the other side of the united states it might have been but it wasnt even in the couple of miles from the station to the hotel flora saw a soup kitchen a bread line and a lot of men in worn clothes aimlessly wandering the streets thanks to the mild weather getting by without a roof over their heads was far easier in los angeles than in say chicago recognizing the president in the open motorcar one of those men who looked to have nowhere to go shouted coolidge ignore him vice president johnson said quickly its a free country blackford said with a smile he can speak up for whichever candidate he pleases certainly is a pretty day i can see why so many people are coming here we dont have octobers like this in dakota believe you me we dont another man this one wearing a tweed jacket out at the elbows pointed at the limousine and yelled shame this time hiram johnson tried to pass off the heckling with an uneasy chuckle hosea blackford said i have nothing to feel ashamed about ive done everything i could from the moment this crisis began to try to repair it i defy any citizen of either major partyor any republican either for that matterto show me anything i might have done and have not flora reached out and set her hand on top of her husbands she knew he was telling the truth she also knew the toll the business collapse had taken on him hed aged cruelly in the three and a half years since taking the oath of office she sometimes wished coolidge had won the election in then all of this would have come down on his head and hosea would have been spared the torment of fighting a disaster plainly too big for any one man to overcome at the custer hotel a woman reporter called why arent we doing more in the war against the japanese were doing everything we can miss clemens i assure you blackford answered this is a war of maneuver you must understand it isnt a matter of huge masses slamming together as the great war was why werent we ready to fight a war like that ophelia clemens persisted well win it he said thats what counts he and flora managed to get to their suite without too many more questions she tipped the swarthy porterhe spoke with a spanish accent and might have been born in the empire of mexico as soon as the fellow left hosea blackford collapsed on the bed for the love of god fix me a drink he said as soon as i find where theyre hiding the liquor i will she said and im going to make myself one too she held up the whiskey bottle in triumph when she pulled it out of a cabinet her husband clapped his hands the ice bucket was right out in plain sight so were glasses whiskey over ice didnt take long thank you dear hosea sat up and downed half his drink at a gulp he let out a long weary sigh then spoke two words were screwed what flora choked on her whiskey she hoped shed heard wrong she hoped so but she didnt think so what did you say she asked on the off chance she really had been wrong i said were screwed the president of the united states replied calvin coolidge is going to mop the floor with me calvin goddamn coolidge he spoke in sour disgusted wonder half the time no ones even sure if he has a pulse and hes going to clean my clock isnt this a swell old world he finished the drink and held out the glass make me another one will you youve got a speech in a couple of hours you know flora warned yes and ill be all right her husband said not that it would make a dimes worth of difference if i strode in there drunk as a lord how could things be any worse than they are already hed never shown despair till that moment he hadnt had much hope but hed always put the best face he could on it no more as flora poured whiskey into the glass she said you can still turn things around fat chance he said i couldnt win this one if they caught coolidge in flagrante delicto with a chorus girl probably not even if they caught him in flagrante with a chorus boy for heavens sake blackfordburghs he spat the name out in disgust how can i win when my names gone into the dictionary as the definition for everything thats wrong with the whole country its not fair flora insisted its not right she sipped her own drink the whiskey burned on the way down but not nearly so much as her husbands acceptance of defeat when she was a little girl shed watched her grandmother die everyone had known the old woman was going to go but nobodyd said a word up till now the socialists presidential campaign had been like that in public she supposed it still would be but she could see her husband had told the truth no matter how little she liked it hosea blackford said we knew it was going to happen if i couldnt turn things around i did everything i knew how to doeverything congress would let me doand none of it worked now theyre going to give the democrats a chance he took a big swig from the new drink hell if id lost my job and my house i wouldnt vote socialist either itll only be worse under the democrats flora said but people dont know that they dont believe it they dont see how it could be worse they only see that its bad now and that there was a socialist administration while it got this way im the scapegoat you did everything you could do you did everything anybody could do flora said if they dont see that theyre fools it wasnt enough her husband answered they dont have any trouble seeing that and so he finished the drink at a gulp and so sweetheart im going to be a oneterm president he laughed in a way its liberating you know what i mean for the rest of the campaign i can say whatever i please it wont make any difference anyhow before very long an aide knocked on the door and said were ready to take you to your speaking engagement mr president maam were ready blackford declared flora anxiously studied him but he looked and sounded fine as he went to the door more than a little relieved she followed him out to the limousine he spoke at the university of southern california just north of agricultural park the usa had touted the park and the football stadium there as a venue for the olympic games but had lost out to kaiser wilhelms berlin people were talking about another bid in but the confederates were also trumpeting the possibility of holding the games in richmond that year the international decision would come in president blackford got a warm welcome on the university campus the socialist party still attracted plenty of students though flora wondered how many of them were twentyone a handful of signs saying coolidge waved as the limousine went by reactionaries flora muttered friendly applause greeted the president when he strode into the lecture hall where he would speak a young man did shout coolidges name but guards hustled him from the hall the democrats didnt try in any organized way to disrupt blackfords address they probably dont think they need to bother flora thought bitterly theyre probably right too my own husband doesnt think they need to bother either behind the podium hosea blackford waited for the applause to die away weve done a lot for the country the past twelve years he said the democrats will say weve done a lot to the country the past twelve years but thats because theyre part of the problem not part of the solution if they hadnt played obstructionist games in congress weve have an oldage pension in place today wed have stronger minimumwage laws wed have stronger legal support for the proletariat against their fatcat capitalist oppressors we would but we dont the democrats are glad we dont we socialists wish we did thats the difference between the two parties right there its as plain as the nose on your face if you want the proletariat to advance vote socialist if you dont vote for calvin coolidge its really just as simple as that friends he got another round of applause sitting in the front row flora clapped till her palms were sore not all the coolidge backers had left the hall though two or three of them raised a chant bread lines blackfordburghs bread lines blackfordburghs hosea blackford met that head on yes times are hard he said you know it i know it the whole country knows it but answer me this if my opponent had been elected in wouldnt we be talking about coolidgevilles today the democrats would not have made things better in my considered opinion they would have made things worse thats right flora shouted people in the hall gave her husband a warm hand the only trouble was making political speeches to an already friendly crowd was like preaching to the choir these people except for that handful of noisy democrats hadnt turned out to disagree with the president and his words werent likely to sway anybody whod already decided to vote against him nothing was flora knew as much even if she hated the knowledge her husband pounded away at the democrats at coolidge at coolidges engineer of a running mate he got round after round of applause by the noise in the hall he would have been swept back into office but then just as floras spirits rose and even hosea blackford buoyed by the reception looked as if he too felt he wasnt just going through the motions distant explosions made people sit up and look around and ask one another what the noise was then suddenly some of the explosions werent so distant they rattled the windows in the hall through them flora thought she heard aeroplane engines overhead she frowned that was crazy to say nothing of impossible wasnt it she looked up at her husband noshe looked up at the president of the united states i dont know whats going on my friends he told the crowd but i think we ought to sit tight here till we find out he got his answer sooner than he expected a man bleeding from a scalp wound burst into the hall and shouted the japs the goddamn japs are bombing los angeles as if to underscore his words a cannon somewhere in the distance began shooting at the aeroplanes flora wondered if it had any chance at all of bringing them down she had her doubts the crowd the crowd that had been so warm so full of support cried out in horror and dismay a guard tapped flora on the shoulder come with me maam he said were going to get the president and you out of here if the roof comes down helplessly she went with him he and his comrades hustled the blackfords into the limousine and drove off as fast as they could go as they zoomed away from the university of southern california flora saw fires flickering in front of the huts and tents of a huge blackfordburgh in agricultural park and she saw other fires burning farther away fires japanese bombs must have set she put her face in her hands and began to cry now for certain there was no hope at all americanempire thecentercannothold xvi c olonel irving morrell kissed his wife goodbye and headed in to the us army base at kamloops election day at last he said it cant come any later than this but its finally here november the eighth time we throw the rascals out he checked himself and sighed they arent even rascals ive met enough of themi know they arent but they arent what we need either i should say not indignation filled agnes voice after what they let the japs do to los angeles by the pause there shed almost added some pungent modifier to the enemys name that was a nice piece of work we havent been so humiliated since the end of the second mexican war more than fifty years ago now it was just a pinprick but what a pinprick morrell reluctantly gave credit to a very sharp operation two aeroplane carriers a tanker to keep em fueledand one great big embarrassment for the usa they got away clean as a whistle too except for the one aeroplane we shot down and the two that collided with each other over the beach disgraceful agnes was if anything more militant than morrell himself well if president blackfords goose wasnt cooked before la hirohitos boys put it in the oven and turned up the fire he said thats true his wife brightened maybe some good will come of it after all then calvin coolidge wouldnt let himself get caught napping like that i hope not morrell said though he didnt know what the governor of massachusetts could have ordered done that president blackford hadnt he kissed agnes again as far as he was concerned that was always worth doing ive got to go i wish i could do something more useful than guarding a canadian town that isnt likely to rise up but thats what they say they need me for so thats what ill do if they ordered you to do something else youd do that too agnes said and youd do a bangup job at it too whatever it happened to be thanks sweetie morrell would have been happy to stay there and listen to his wife say nice things about him instead he left snow had fallen the week before but it was gone now he couldnt ski to the office sentries came to attention and saluted as he went past he returned the salutes with careful courtesy when he got in his adjutant said sir you have a despatch from the war department in philadelphiafrom the general staff no less youre kidding morrell said captain horwitz shook his head so did irving morrell in bemusement what the devil do they want with me i thought theyd long since forgotten i even existed i hoped they had to tell you the truth i just put it on your desk sir horwitz replied it got here about fifteen minutes ago if you like you can probably catch up with the courier and ask him questions lets see what the order is first morrell said one way or another itll probably tell me everything i need to know he went into his office as an afterthought he closed the door behind him that might miff his adjutant if it did too bad hed find a way to make amends later meanwhile he wanted privacy if the general staffspecifically if lieutenant colonel john abellwas taking some more vengeance he wanted to be able to pull himself together before he faced the world there lay the envelope as horwitz had said morrell approached it like a sapper approaching an unexploded bomb it wouldnt blow up if he opened it he had to remind himself of that though before he could make himself take the folded paper out of the envelope and read the typewritten order the more he read the wider his eyes got he sank down into his seat the swivel chair creaked under his weight when hed neither come out nor said anything for several minutes captain horwitz cautiously called are you all right sir nine years morrell answered horwitz opened the door sir nine years morrell repeated he looked down at the order again nine miserable stinking years thrown away wasted wiped off the map gone he could have gone on cranking out synonyms for a long time but his adjutant broke in i dont understand sir morrell blinked it was all perfectly clear in his mind he realized horwitz hadnt read the order feeling foolish he said theyre sending me back to fort leavenworth captain oh for a second that didnt register with horwitz but only for a momenthe was sharp as the business end of a bayonet then he leaned forward like a hunting dog taking the scent to work on barrels sir thats right to work on barrels morrell didnt even try to hide his bitterness the very same project they took me off ofthe very same project they closed downalmost nine years ago well his adjutant put the best face on it he could its a good thing they are starting up again wouldnt you say that was true morrell couldnt begin to deny it but he also couldnt help asking where would we be if we hadnt stopped nine years before theyd had a prototype of what a barrel should be it was a machine much more agile much less cumbersome than the lumbering armored behemoths of the great war it carried its cannon in a turret that rotated degrees not in a mount with limited traverse at the front of the vehicle it had a machine gun in the turret too and one at the bow not half a dozen of them all around the machine it took a crew of half a dozen not a dozen and a half it ran and shot rings around the old models but the prototype was powered by one truck engine it could be because it was made of thin mild steel not armor plate no one had wanted to spend the money to go any further with it manufacturing real barrels would undoubtedly reveal a host of flaws the prototype hadnt for that matter morrell didnt even know if the prototype still existed the way things were during the s it might have been cut up and sold for scrap metal he wouldnt have been surprised had the usa gone on building and developing barrels instead of letting them languish it would have had the best machines in the world nowadays as things were the confederates mexican stooges had built barrels at least as good as the prototype during the long civil war between maximilian iii and the usbacked republican rebels they hadnt only made prototypes either theyd had real fighting machines what theyd had the csa either had already or could have in short order morrell knew the same thing wasnt truewasnt even close to truein his own country well he said ive got a lot of work to do dont i yes sir captain horwitz said congratulations sir thanks ike morrell laughed though it wasnt really funny i bet i know what finally got the socialists off the dime whats that sir his adjutant asked the japs bombing los angeleswhat else and the sad part is no matter what i do with barrels even if i get it all done day after tomorrow it wont matter much how could it where are we going to use barrels fighting the japanese beats me sir beats me too morrell tapped the order with his fingernail ive got to let the base commandant know ive been transferred and ive got to let my wife know what will she think horwitz asked i hope shell be pleased morrell answered we met in leavenworth agnes and i she was living in town and i was stationed at the fort i wonder how much its changed since we left captain horwitz looked sly one thing siryou can leave your skis behind no mountains in kansas well no irving morrell agreed but i think ill take emthey do get enough snow for crosscountry skiing he got to his feet tucking the order into the breast pocket of his tunic and now id better tell brigadier general peterson hes going to have to live without me brigadier general lemuel peterson was a lean lanternjawed new englander he said congratulations colonel i was wondering if youd end up in command here when they sent me somewhere else but youre the one who gets to go away instead and youre actually going to do something useful i hope so anyhow morrell said if they give me twentynine cents for a budget and expect me to put barrels together out of railroad iron and paper clips though you never can tell with those cheapskates in the war department peterson said if morrell reported that to the powers that be he might blight his superiors career he intended no such thinghe agreed with brigadier general peterson the commandant at kamloops went on maybe well see a little sense from now on because it looks like the democrats are going to win this election yes sir colonel morrell nodded heres hoping sir lemuel peterson could have used that against himexcept few officers would have quarreled with the sentiments he expressed why dont you go on home for the rest of the day peterson said youre ordered out of here within a weekyoull be as busy as a onearmed paper hanger with hives you should let your family know what will your wife have to say as he had with his adjutant morrell explained how hed met agnes in kansas peterson nodded thats a point for you go on then do you have a wireless set yes sir morrell answered one more thing to pack true but thats not what i was thinking of brigadier general peterson said you can listen to election returns tonight oh morrell nodded yes sir we will do that i expect agnes exclaimed in surprise when he showed up at the front door she exclaimed in delight when he told her about the order i dont care about kansas one way or the other she said but this is wonderful youll be doing something important again not just makework i know he kissed her thats what im really looking forward to he kissed her again and i knew youd understand ive got a couple of steaks in the icebox and some good canadian beer too agnes raised an eyebrow after that who knows what might happen the wench grows bold he patted her on the bottom good i like it what happened after dinner was that he played with mildred on the livingroom floor while the wireless blared out endless streams of numbers every so often his little girl would complain because his mind wasnt fully on their game youre listening to that silly stuff she said youre right he said im sorry he was sorry to disrupt the game he wasnt sorry not in the least about what he was hearing what everyone had thought would happen was happening calvin coolidge was trouncing hosea blackford even as he listened coolidges lead in ohio went up to a quarter of a million votes and coolidge is also ahead in indiana which last went democratic in the election of the announcer said morrell clapped his hands in not quite childish glee mildred gave him a severe look a schoolmarm would have envied he apologized again his daughter eventually went to bed morrell and agnes stayed up a while longer to let her fall asleep and to hear some more returns coolidge kept capturing state after state by the time they went to bed too they had a lot to celebrateand they did c incinnatus driver knew a certain amount of local pride the new vice president he was borned in iowa he said how bout that his son sent him a jaundiced glance and he moved away as fast as he could go too achilles retorted he moved as far as he could go tooall the

dont like it but if i got to i got to deliberately he made himself take a bite of tongue he usually liked it it had been a treat when he was growing up but anger spoiled the flavor you got his goat but he got yours too elizabeth said he started to deny it then realized he couldnt he let out a long sigh yeah he done did he raised his voice come on back an eat your supper achilles i wont talk no more bout politics if you dont that was as far as he was willing to go from the long silence that followed he wondered if it was far enough to satisfy his son at last though achilles said all right pa thats fair enough he returned to the table probably aint even had time yet to get cold elizabeth said no ma its fine as if to prove as much achilles made tongue and potatoes and carrots disappear mighty good he said may i have some more please he had manners when he remembered to use them ill get it for you elizabeth said she turned to cincinnatus as soon as shed picked up achilles plate he sure do like his food thats true cincinnatus wasnt sure it was a compliment especially during hard times but he could hardly deny it after supper achilles went off to do his homework hed never lost his liking for school that pleased cincinnatuspleased him all the more because even though achilles seemed to want to disagree with everything he said his son hadnt rejected the idea that education was a good thing the next morning cincinnatus scrambled into his ford truck and hurried out to the railroad yards he got there before the sun came up but he wasnt the first man there looking for whatever hauling business he could get these days cargo wasnt always the only thing that traveled in boxcars as a freight train pulled into the yard a couple of men in tattered clothes leaped down even before it had completely stopped they started running they didnt disappear quite fast enough come back here you sons of bitches a railway dick shouted he had a nightstick and a on his belt feet pounding on gravel he lumbered after the fleeing freeloaders gotta be crazy to ride the rails like that cincinnatus said to the conductor with whom he was dickering over the price of hauling a load of office furniture to the state capitol gotta be desperate anyway the conductor answered why the hell anybody who was ridin would want to get off in des moines he shrugged i dont know about crazy but you sure gotta be stupid as he had with achilles cincinnatus said this aint a bad town suh beats covington kentucky all hollow and thats the truth well sure if thats what youre comparing it to the other man said with a laugh but you run it up against los angeles or san francisco or portland or seattle or denver or albuquerque or you get the idea what im saying buddy ive seen all them places i know what im talking about cincinnatus knew his standards of comparison were limited he was familiar with des moines and with covington and with very little else he knew cincinnati a little as it lay right across the ohio from covington but san francisco might have been on the far side of the moon for all he knew of it the newspaper had talked about building a bridge across the golden gate one day that didnt mean much to cincinnatus either he knew rivers and bridges over rivers the pacific ocean hed never even seen a lakenot a big one anyhow he got back to the business at hand i may not know nothin bout them places mistuh gideon but i knows haulin and i knows i got to have another dollar to make this here trip worthwhile he ended up with another four bits that was less than hed hoped for more than enough to make the journey worth his while he stacked desks and swivel chairs and oak file cabinets in the back of the ford till it wouldnt hold any more and the springs wouldnt bear much more for good measure he squeezed two more swivel chairs into the cabin with him the conductor nodded approval one thing i always got to give you cincinnatusyou work like a bastard thank you kindly to cincinnatus that was high praise getting to the capitol took only a few minutes it lay not far south of the railroad yardslike them on the east side of the des moines river across the river from cincinnatus apartment building the gilded dome atop the ornate building was a landmark visible all over town for that matter since the iowa countryside was so flat the dome was visible from quite a ways outside of town too men in fancy suits bright silk neckties and expensive homburgslegislators lawyers lobbyistsclimbed the stairs to the capitols front entrance times might be hard but men of that stripe seldom suffered they were of course uniformly white cincinnatus with his black skin dungarees wool sweater and soft cloth cap drove past the front entrance with hardly a glance he pulled up at the freight entrance and backed his truck up to the loading dock a white man in an outfit almost identical to his own came over to the truck clipboard in hand how you doin cincinnatus he said not too bad lou even after most of a decade in des moines calling a white man by his first name still wasnt something cincinnatus did casually his upbringing in confederate kentucky ran deep hows yourself damn cold weather makes my wound ache lou set a hand on his haunch if id known getting shot in the ass would stick with me so long i wouldntve left it up there for them confederate sons of bitches to aim at idve stuck my head up insteadaint like i got the brains to worry about gettin em blown out he pointed to the truck so what the hell you got for us this time office furniture cincinnatus told him bout time that shit started gettin here lou declared all them fancypants bastards in there who waste our money been bellyachin like you wouldnt believe about how their goddamn desk drawers squeak and they cant screw their secretaries on the old swivel chairs lou respected nothing and nobody least of all the elected and appointed officials of the great state of iowa cincinnatus on the whole a straitlaced man hadnt thought about screwing in a chair swivel or otherwise now that he did he liked the ideaprovided he and elizabeth could both be home at the same time while their children werent which might not prove easy to arrange he got out of the truck with a clipboard of his own i got papers for you to sign off on lou laughed and flourished his clipboard which made the papers on it flutter listen pal this here is state business i got more papersn you do and you can take that to the bank aint nobody in the goddamn world got more papersn you need to do state business unless maybe its them cocksuckers in philly again cincinnatus knew nothing about the habits sexual or bureaucratic of philadelphians from other trips to the state capitol he did know how many papers hed have to sign before his delivery was official lets get on with it he said resignedly and signed and signed and signed lou went through the relative handful of papers on cincinnatus clipboard in nothing flat once cincinnatus had got to the bottom of lous pile of paperwork he asked what do they do with all these here forms let the mice chew em upwhat the hell you think lou answered he raised his voice to a fullthroated bellow ivan paddy luigi get your asses over here and get this crap outa my buddys truck you think hes got all day the workmen descended on the truck lou pulled a flask from his hip pocketthe opposite side from his war wound want a snort iowa was a dry state that took being dry very very seriously that didnt stop liquor from getting made there or smuggled in cincinnatus experience was that it did keep good liquor from entering the state the nip he took from lous flask did nothing to change his mind do jesus he said when he recovered the power of speech tastes like paint thinner an possum piss im gonna tell that to my brotherinlaw lou said laughing he cooked up the shit he dont like you in particular or he dont like nobody cincinnatus asked still trying to get his breath back lou laughed again and aimed a lazy mock punch at him as lazily he ducked he tried to imagine himself sassing a white man like that back in kentuckytried and felt himself failing lou asked you got the whole kit and caboodle here or is there more of this shit back on the train theres more plenty more some o them fellers should be bringin it any time soon as you get me unloaded im goin back see if i can get me another load ill give you another slug of this stuff when you get back lou patted the pocket with the flask damn good reason to stay away cincinnatus said lou laughed yet again for all the world as if hed been joking j onathan moss wasnt used to getting shaken awake at two in the morning wuzzat he said muzzily he wasnt used to waking up under any circumstances without a steaming cup of coffee or three at his elbow to make the transition easier lauras voice however turned out to do the job well enough jonathan youd better take me to the hospital now because the pains are only four minutes apart and theyre getting stronger jesus moss sat bolt upright why didnt you tell me a while ago his wife shrugged ive watched plenty of cows and sows and ewes give birth i know what happens as well as you can till it happens to you i wasnt going anywhere much now i amand so wed better get moving right he said theyd packed a bag for her a couple of days earlier he had clothes draped over the chair ready to throw on as he got out of bed he gave her a kiss congratulations sweetheart youre saving us some money im not doing it on purpose believe me laura said i know the lawyerly part of moss mind operated automatically but if juniord waited another week and a half it wouldve been and then we couldnt write him off this years taxes having doffed her long wool nightgown laura was putting on a long wool maternity dress a tent would have had no more material and been no less stylish she draped a coat over the dress it was snowing outside somehow or other taxes arent my biggest worry right this minute she said her voice as chilly as the weather moss lit a cigarette and patted her on the bottom really babe why is that do you think she did her best to make her glare withering he did his best not to wither going downstairs was another adventure he carried the case in one hand and held his wifes hand with the other she had to pause on the stairs while a labor pain passed he didnt want to think about what would happen if she fell he didnt want to and so he didnt he did however let out a loud sigh of relief after they made it to the lobby went down a few more stairs and reached the sidewalk his breath would have smoked without the cigarette when he inhaled the air cut like knives in conversational tones laura remarked the auto had better start dont you think what you dont want to hang around waiting for a cab moss said which earned him another glare he opened the bucephalus door and carefully handed her in then flung the overnight bag onto the back seat he slid behind the wheel and slammed his door shut that got him out of the icy wind when he turned the key he uttered something between a prayer and a curse past two on a cold winter night would the engine turn over the starter made a grinding noise the engine didnt start he tried again still no luck come on you goddamn fucking son of a bitch he growled wishing for a groundcrew man to spin the prop laura looked down at her swollen stomach dont listen to him she advised the baby hold your hands over your ears hes just a barbarous yank and he doesnt know any better i dont know any better than to keep driving this miserable old rattletrap moss said and twisted the key once more with savage force grind grind grind he was about to throw up his hands in despair when the engine belched like a man after three quick beers he came down hard on the gas hoping hoping another belch and then a fullthroated roar steam and smoke poured from the tailpipe there is a god moss shouted i should hope so laura said and i doubt hes very amused at what you said a minute ago too darn bad moss said now that the bucephalus had started he was willing to make his language less incandescent but he didnt back down i wasnt very amused with him a few minutes ago either jonathan i think what ever his wife thought was lost as another labor pain seized her when she could speak again she said i think youd better get me to the hospital as fast as you can i will he promised i want to make sure the engine warms up before i put it in gear though if it quits on me that would be not so good laura nodded they might argue about a good many things but she wasnt going to disagree with that even though the streets of berlin were almost deserted he drove with great care skidding on snow would have been bad any time skidding on snow while his wife was in labor was one more thing he didnt care to contemplate beside him laura let out a sharp hiss she couldnt say anything more for most of a minute at last she managed i wont be sorry for the ether cone or what ever it is they give you to make the pain go away were almost there he said nothing in berlin was too far from anything else he could have driven for quite a while longer in chicago of course chicago also boasted more hospitals than berlins one as he took laura toward the door another auto pulled up behind his a flivver even more spavined than his bucephalus the woman who got out was as extremely pregnant as laura her husband said they cant pick two in the afternoon to do this eh doesnt seem that way moss agreed nurses took the two women off to the maternity ward moss and the other man stayed behind to cope with the inevitable paperwork after theyd dotted the last i and crossed the last t another nurse guided them to the waiting room which boasted a fine selection of magazines from moss sat down on a chair the other fellow on the leatherette sofa they both reached for cigarettes noticed the big red no smoking fire hazard signs at the same time and put their packs away with identical sighs nothing to do but wait the other man said he was in his midtwentiestoo young to have fought in the great war more and more men these days were too young to have fought in the war moss felt time marching on himfelt it all the more acutely because so many of his contemporaries had gone off to fight but hadnt come home again nodding now he said i wonder how long itll be you never can tell his companion said our first one took forever but the second one came pretty quick this is our first one moss said congratulations the other man said thanks moss yawned enormously i wish they had a coffeepot in here then he looked at the no smoking fire hazard signs again well maybe not not unless you want cold coffee i wonder why its a fire hazard the canadian said ether maybe moss answered remembering what laura had said just before they got to the hospital he sniffed all he smelled was a hospital odor strong soap disinfectant and a faintest hint of something nasty underneath they waited moss looked at the clock the younger canadian man did the same after a while he said youre a yank arent you thats right jonathan admitted wondering if he should have tried to lie but his accent had probably given him away american and canadian intonations were close but not identical another pause then the canadian asked is your wife a yank too moss laughed no shes about as canadian as can be her first husband was a canadian soldier but he didnt come back from the war oh the younger man said and then shrugged none of my business really most americans would have kept on peppering moss with questions canadians usually showed more reserve as this one had of course some canadians still wanted to throw all the americans in their country back south of the border once more moss knew his own wife was one of them if they hadnt been lovers if she hadnt warned him of the rebellion a few years before that might have been worse he might have got caught in it too instead of coming through unscathed with another yawn he picked up a magazine the lead article wondered how many seats in the confederate congress the freedom party would gain in the elections not very many the writer predicted shows how much you know moss muttered and closed the magazine in disgust he shut his eyes and tried to doze he didnt think he had a prayer he was worrying about what would happen in the delivery room and the chair was stiff and uncomfortable but the next time he looked at the clock an hour and a half had gone by he blinked in astonishment his companion in the waiting room had slumped onto one arm of the sofa he snored softly daybreak came late as it always did in canadian winter moss wished for coffee again and when his stomach growled for breakfast the canadian man slept on and on moss slipped out to use the mens room down the hall he disturbed the other fellow not a bit a nurse came in at a little past ten mr ferguson she said moss pointed at his sleeping comrade mr ferguson she said again louder this time the canadian man opened his eyes he needed a moment to figure out where he was as he straightened the nurse said congratulations mr ferguson you have a baby boy and your wife is fine whatll you call him moss asked sticking out his hand ferguson shook it bruce he answered after my wifes uncle he asked the nurse can i see elspeth now and the baby just for a little while come with me the nurse said as she turned to go jonathan asked her excuse me but how is mrs moss doing shes getting there the nurse answered some time this afternoon for her i expect this afternoon moss said in dismay the nurse only nodded and led mr ferguson out of the waiting room to see his wife and his son who hadnt waited around before coming out to see the world it was half past four as a matter of fact with night falling fast and itchy stubble rasping on moss cheeks and chin before another nurse came in and said mr moss thats me he jumped to his feet is laura all right the nurse not only nodded she cracked a smile hed thought that was against hospital regulations yes shes fine you have a little girl not so little in facteight pounds two ounces dorothy moss whispered a boy would have been peter can i see her uh them come along the nurse said your wife is still woozy from the anesthetic laura didnt just look woozy she looked drunk out of her mind the peaches are spoiled she announced fixing jonathan with a stare that said it was his fault its all right honey he said and bent down and kissed her on her sweaty forehead lookweve got a daughter the nurse holding the baby in a pink blanket lifted her up a little so both mosses could get a look at her she was about the size of a cat but much less finishedlooking her skin was as thin and prone to crumple as finest parchment and bright bright pink she screwed up her face a thin furious yowl burst from her lips shes beautiful laura whispered at first jonathan moss thought that was still the ether talking dorothys head was a funny shape and much too big for her body her skin was a weird color she made her tiny squashed features even stranger when she cried and the noise that filled the maternity room put him in mind of a dog with its tail stuck in a door those doubts lasted a good three or four seconds then he took another look at his new daughter youre right he said and he was whispering too she is beautiful shes the most beautiful baby in the world f ive days into a new year nellie jacobs couldnt make herself care her husband wouldnt see the end of hal probably wouldnt see the end of january he might not see the end of the week and this was thursday he lay in the veterans ward of remembrance hospital not far from the white house if it werent for his distinguished service medal they wouldnt have admitted him for he hadnt formally been a soldier and if it werent for the oxygen they gave him he would have been dead weeks before nellie wasnt sure they were doing him any favors by keeping him alive but they also gave him morphine so he wasnt in much pain she got dressed and went downstairs and made breakfast for herself and clara shed just sent her younger daughter off to school when her older one came in hello edna nellie said thank you very much she didnt like being beholden to ednaor to anyone elsebut here she had no choice and edna didnt say anything but its all right ma go on down to the hospital spend all the time you can with him i know theres not much left ill mind the shop for you it aint like i never done it before nellie couldnt resist a jab no handsome confederate officers coming in nowadays thats all right too edna answered i made my catch and im glad i did after a small hesitation she went on i wont say im not glad to get out of the house every once in a while myself no i wont say that balked because her daughter hadnt sniped back nellie set a hat on her head picked up her handbag and said ill be back before you have to go take care of armstrong sure ma edna nodded be careful when youre going down to the trolley stop though its cold out there and the sidewalks are icy you dont want to fall im not an old lady yet nellie said sharply though she was when she stopped to think about it closer to sixty than fifty shaking her headshe didnt like thinking about thatshe hurried out of the coffeehouse the bell over the door jingled behind her her breath fogged out around her as she hurried up the street a man in an ancient ragged army greatcoat stepped out of a doorway and whined got any spare change lady nellie walked past him as if he didnt exist he didnt bother cursing her he must have been ignored a thousand times before he just shrank back into the doorway and waited for someone else to come along three men and a woman were waiting for the trolley when nellie got to the stop any minute now one of the men said he carried a dinner pail which probably meant he had a job thank you nellie saidnot good or anything of the sort she would have given anything she had not to be making this trip the one shed made every day she could while hal lay dying in the hospital how much it tormented her measured how much shed come to love him sure enough the trolley clanged up to the corner a couple of minutes later nellie threw her nickel in the fare box the car was already crowded a middleaged man with a scar on his cheek stood up to offer her his seat here you go maam he said thank you nellie said again this time in real astonishment she couldnt remember the last time that had happened who would have thought any gentlemen were left in the world she thought and then who would have thought there were ever any gentlemen in the world except for her husband her soninlaw and her grandson she still had no use for the male half of the raceand she knew her grandson was an unruly brat even if he was blood kin well merle can always take armstrong to the woodshed a little more often thats all her stop was only a few minutes away from the coffeehouse presidentelect coolidge in washington to meet with cabinet picks a newsboy shouted waving a paper at nellie she shook her head and hurried on to remembrance hospital built after the end of the war the hospital was an immense brutally modern building that resembled nothing so much as a great block of granite with windows the stairs leading up to the front entrance were too wide for nellie to take them in one step too narrow for her to take them in two the hitching strides she had to make annoyed her every morning by the expressions some of the other people going up and down those steps wore they didnt like them eitheror maybe they had other worries of their own as nellie did the only happy people she saw coming out of the place were a young couple the man carrying a crying baby maternity wards are different nellie thought as she went past them i bet theyre the only place in a hospital where people win instead of losing she knew the way to the veterans ward by now shed come often enough to be a regular a nurse in the corridor nodded to her as she walked past a couple of the nurses had even dropped in at the coffeehouse when they came off their shifts two long rows of metalframed beds facing each other stretched the length of the ward hal lay in the sixth bed on the lefthand side as nellie came in just beyond him lay a younger man a fellow about forty whose lungs were killing him faster than hals hed been gassed in tennessee in and had been dying by inches ever since nellie had never seen anyone come to visit him he nodded to her his lips a little bluer than they had been the day before like hal he had a rubber attachment that fit over his nose to feed him oxygen hello darling hal said his voice rasping and weak his lungs werent all that was troubling him not any more the flesh had melted from his bones over the past few months his skull seemed to push out through the skin of his face as if to announce the death that lay not far ahead how are you feeling as nellie always did she fought to hold worry and pain from her voice hal didnt need her reminders to know what was happening to him how am i he wheezed laughter one day closer thats all he paused to fight a little more air into the lungs that didnt want to hold it any more were always one day closer but usually usually we dont think about it hows clara shes fine nellie said ill bring her saturday she wants to see you but what with school and all now that new years is gone school is important hal said what could be more important than school he stopped to gather breath again maybe its better she doesnt see me like this let her remember me like i was when i was stronger oh hal nellie had to turn away she didnt want her husband to see the tears stinging her eyes all she cared about was making sure he stayed as happy and comfortable as he could till the end finally came a man in the row of beds facing hals lit a cigarette hal said do you know what i wish nellie shook her head he lifted a bony hand and pointed with a forefinger that still showed a yellowish stain i wish i had one of those thats what they wont let me smoke on account of this oxygen gear fire you know thats terrible nellie rose im going to see if i cant get em to change their minds as far as she was concerned cigarettes were more important for hal than oxygen right now the oxygen helped keep him alive yes but so what cigarettes would make him happy as he went for he was going to go out at the nursing station a starched woman of about ednas age shook her head at nellie im sorry mrs jacobs she said not sounding sorry in the least but i cant deviate from the attending physicians instructions nellie might have asked her to commit an unnatural act well who is the attending physician and where the devil do i find him nellie asked his name is dr baumgartner and his office is in room near the front entrance the nurse answered reluctantly i dont know if hes in even if he is i dont think you can get him to change his mind well see about that nellie snapped she hurried off to room with determined strides dr baumgartner was in writing notes on one of his patients he was in his late thirties and wore the ribbon for a purple heart above his collar the side of his neck was scarred nellie wondered how far down the scar ran and how bad it was shoving that aside she told him what she wanted he heard her out then shook his head im sorry mrs jacobs but i dont see how i can do that they dont call cigarettes coffin nails for nothing what difference does that make nellie asked bluntly hes dying anyhow i know he is maam baumgartner answered but my job is to keep him alive as long as i can and to keep him as comfortable as i can thats what the oxygen is for thats what the cigarettes are for nellie said the comfortable part i mean before dr baumgartner could answer an ambulance came clanging up to the front door of the hospital the physician jumped to his feet and grabbed a black bag that sat on a corner of his desk you have to excuse me maam he said there might be something i can do to help there we arent done with this argumentnot by a long shot were not nellie said and followed him as he hurried out of the office to her surprise policemen rushed in through the entrance ahead of the men getting a stretcher out of the back of the ambulance some of them had drawn their pistols most people shrank away from them in alarm dr baumgartner eyed the pistols with the air of a man whod known worse what the hells going on he demanded come quick doc one of the policemen told him do what ever you can hed gotten out of the bathtub they tell me and he was shaving when he keeled over whos he baumgartner asked and since when does an ambulance need a squad of motorcycle cops for escort since its got calvin coolidge in it is since when the policeman answered he keeled over like i say and nobodys been able to get a rise out of him since oh dear god nellie said nobody paid any attention to her the stretcherbearers brought their burden into the hospital sure enough the presidentelect lay on the stretcher his face pale and still dr baumgartner knelt beside him the doctors hand found coolidges wrist he has no pulse baumgartner said he peeled back an eyelid his pupil doesnt respond to light he took his hand away from coolidges face the presidentelect stared up with one eye open the other closed nellie could see what dr baumgartner was going to say before he said it hes dead baumgartners expression and voice were stunned cant you do anything for him doc a cop asked thats why we brung him here youd need the lord he can raise the dead i cant dr baumgartner answered still in that dazed voice if id been standing next to him the minute it happened i dont think i could have done anything coronary thrombosis or a stroke id say although i cant begin to know which without an autopsy corowhat the policeman scratched his head whats that in english heart attack baumgartner said patiently thatd be my guess without a postmortem though its only a guess what happens next nellie asked he was president i mean he was going to be president now she looked down at the body then quickly turned away close his eye please while baumgartner did that the policeman said yeah what the hellscuse me ladydo we do now we never had nothin like this happen before that damn blackfordscuse me againbetter not get to be president on account of he finished second that wouldnt be right not after cal here kicked his tail no no no it doesnt work like that dr baumgartner shook his head the electoral college met yesterday so the results are official the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect and then he becomes president on the first of february well thats a relief the cop said thanks doc and nellie might have been the first one to taste the name and title the whole united states would know before the day was up president herbert hoover she paused in thought then slowly nodded and repeated the words president herbert hoover she paused again i like the sound of it a long with her daughter mary jane sylvia enos crunched through snow to stand on the boston common and pay her last respects to calvin coolidge george jr would have come with them toosylvia was sure of thatbut his fishing boat was bringing in cod out on georges bank for a moment she wondered if he even knew then she shook her head feeling foolish the whitecap had a wireless set aboard so he was bound to like her and mary jane most of the people in the square wore black it seemed all the more somber against the snow up on a rickety wooden platform a newsreel photographer swung his camera over the crowd it doesnt seem fair sylvia said he wasnt an old manhe was only sixty mary jane gave her an odd look but then mary jane was only twenty and to twenty sixty was one with the pyramids of egypt sylvia knew better and wished she didnt she went on and it doesnt seem fair he died before he could be president especially when weve been stuck with socialists the past twelve years hoover is a democrat too mary jane said but then before sylvia could she added but hes not from massachusetts he certainly isnt sylvia said born in iowa then on to california she sighed hes from about as far from massachusetts as he can be and stay in the usa hes mary jane broke off as heads swung toward a string of black autos approaching the state house behind a phalanx of motorcycle policemen here comes the funeral procession a hearse carrying coolidges mortal remains led the cortege behind it came an open limousine in which sat presidentelect hoover behind his autos were a stream of others all full of dignitaries civilian and military when the hearse halted an honor guard of soldiers sailors and marines lifted coolidges flagdraped casket from it and set the coffin on a temporary bier whose black cloth cover was half hidden by redwhiteandblue bunting i wish pa could have got a funeral mary jane said suddenly not a fancy one like this but any kind of funeral at all you were a little girl when the confederates torpedoed his ship sylvia said and he was away at sea so much before that do you remember him at all not very much her daughter answered but i do remember one time when he was home on leave and he kept telling my brother and me to go to bed i didnt much like that then so i guess it stuck with me sylvias face heated despite the chilly weather a sailor home on leave wanted his children to go to bed so he could toowith his wife sylvias own life had been empty that way since george was killed she sighed exhaling a cloud of fog when she had wanted a man poor ernie hadnt been able to do anything about it that seemed so horribly unfair it made her want to cry from sheer frustration she couldnt do that now instead she lit a cigarette it helped take the edge off what ever bothered her look mary jane pointed hoovers going to make a speech sure enough the new presidentelect get out of his limousine and black top hat on his head made his way towards a podium set up beside the catafalque on which calvin coolidges remains rested wires ran from the podium back into the state house microphones sprouted from it one to amplify hoovers words for the crowd actually there the rest to send those words across the united states by wireless an announcer who also wore a somber black suit waited behind the podium to introduce him the man reached out and shook hoovers hand they spoke for a moment too far away for the microphones to let anyone hear their words then the announcer stepped up to the podium and said ladies and gentlemen the new presidentelect of the united states mr hoobert heever did i hear that sylvia wondered beside her mary jane let out a small startled giggle others rose from the crowd too so sylvia supposed her ears hadnt tricked her after all if herbert hoover noticed his name being butchered he gave no sign of it he said ladies and gentlemen people of the united states i would give anything i own not to stand here before you today in this capacity i wish with all my heart that governor coolidge were still the presidentelect and that he not i would take the oath of office as president on february first of this year a polite round of applause followed sylvia joined it she didnt see what else hoover could say with his round bluntfeatured face and strong chin he looked very determinedhe put her in mind of a bulldog ready to sink its teeth into something and not let go no matter what he continued since fate has thrust me into the highest office in the land i pledge to you today that i will to the best of my ability continue the policies on which governor coolidge campaigned and which the american people overwhelmingly chose in the election two months ago we shall go forward more applause again sylvia clapped along with everybody else again she didnt see how hoover could say anything else but he said what needed saying well ever since this crisis struck our country almost four years ago he went on the socialist administration has tried every quack nostrum under the sun to set things right but not a single treatment has worked to our sorrow we have seen that only too clearly governor coolidge campaigned on the democrats fundamental belief that business has seen altogether too much regulation these past twelve years and that if left to itself it would find its own way out of the mire in which it finds itself i believe this with all my heart and it will be the guiding principle of my administration again people clapped their hands again sylvia was one of those people she had no great love of businesses theyd treated her like dirt in the years after the war but whatever the socialists had done hadnt worked the whole country could see thatthe whole country had seen that maybe what coolidge had proposed and what hoover now promised would be better sylvia didnt see how it could be much worse hoover plugged ahead with his speech we are currently engaged in an unfortunate war by now the empire of japan has plainly seen it cannot subvert the united states of americas hold on the territories we conquered at such cost during the great war japan has also seen that we are ready to respond strongly to any challenge facing us any time the japanese are ready to seek an honorable peace i shall listen to their proposals with great attentiveness what does that mean mary jane whispered i dont know sylvia whispered back the war had cost both sides some ships after hitting los angeles japanese bombing aeroplanes had attacked the sandwich islands from carriers but they were spotted on the way in did little damage and took losses from us fighters based near pearl harbor if neither side could hurt the other much why go on fighting maybe hoover hoped the japs would figure that out for themselves the presidentelect stuck out his formidable jaw regardless of that our first goal is restoring prosperity at home conditions are fundamentally sound the fundamental strength of the nations economy is unimpaired hoover shook his head maybe he hadnt meant to use variants of the same word in backtoback sentences he gathered himself thanks to the american system of rugged individualism we shall certainly prevail over any and all obstacles governor coolidge epitomized that system i promise you here today that i shall do everything i can to walk in his footsteps with gods help we will triumph over adversity and if it does not defeat us it will make us stronger in the end we are a great nation the burden that has fallen on my shoulders leaves me awed and humbled i know governor coolidge would have succeeded all i can do is my best with gods help again that will suffice thank you and may he bless the united states of america he stepped away from the podium and walked over to the catafalque there very solemnly he took off his top hat and bowed to coolidges casket the soldiers and sailors and marines whod borne the coffin from the hearse saluted hoover returned the salute hed done his two years as a conscript well before the turn of the century and had been a major in engineering during the war the wireless announcer introduced the new governor of massachusettsand incidentally got his name right more praise for calvin coolidge came forth this time in the familiar accents of home not hoovers flat midwestern speech sylvia listened with half an ear mary jane began to fidget when the lieutenant governor came to the podium and began saying everything for the third time sylvia asked shall we go her daughter nodded they began making their way toward the back edge of the crowd it wasnt so hard as sylvia had feared not least because they werent the only ones slipping away from the boston common the newsreel photographer up there on his platform wasnt taking pictures of the crowd shrinking good day mrs enos there stood joe kennedy with his sharpfaced wife beside him he wasnt going anywhere not till the last speech was made even the way he stood was an effort to make sylvia feel guilty about leaving it didnt work he wasnt paying her now that the campaign was done behind them the lieutenant governors empty words kept blaring forth through the microphone good day mr kennedy she answered weve got to be getting home and after a while everything sounds the same that made rose kennedy smile when she did her face lit up she looked like a whole different person her husband though frowned he didnt look like a different person sylvia had seem him frowning plenty of times voice stiff with disapproval he said we should all take notice of the praise for governor coolidge he would have made a fine president and he would have done a lot of good for the state now he shrugged now a lot of that will go somewhere else he thought like a politician sylvia didnt know why she was surprised in fact after she thought about it for a moment she wasnt surprised any more she said if youll excuse us of course joe kennedy was barely polite to her his whole manner changed when his gaze swung to mary jane the last time i saw your daughter mrs enos she was a little girl shes not a little girl now no shes not sylvia said shortly kennedy was practically undressing mary jane with his eyes there right in front of his wife didnt she notice didnt she care or had she seen it too many times before to make a fuss about it if george had looked at another woman like that sylvia knew she wouldnt have kept quiet she touched mary janes arm come on we have to go if theres ever anything i can do for either one of you charming ladies dont be shy kennedy said sylvia nodded all she wanted to do was get away as she and mary jane descended into the subway entrance her daughter said hes an interesting man i didnt think he would be not from the way you talk about him ill tell you what hes interested inhes interested in getting you someplace quiet and getting your knickers down sylvia said and ill tell you something else too any man wholl run around for you will run around on you any chance he gets mary jane laughed i wasnt going to do anything with him mother i should hope not sylvia said she and mary jane lined up to trade nickels for tokens for the ride back to the flat by t wharf t he red light in the studio went on the engineer behind the glass pointed to jake featherston as if to say he was on he nodded and got down to business im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth all across the confederate states from the atlantic to the gulf of california people would be leaning forward to listen to him the wireless web knit the csa together in a way nothing else ever had before all the parties used the wireless these days but hed been doing it longer than anybody else and he thought he did it better than anybody else he wasnt the only one who thought so either by the way whig newspapers flabbled about their partys ineffective speakers they too knew he scored points every time he sat down in front of a microphone here im here to tell you the truth he repeated ive been trying to do that for a long time some of you kind folks out there didnt much want to believe me on account of what i have to say isnt the sugarcoated pap youll hear from the usual run of stuffed shirts in richmond no it isnt sweet and it isnt pretty but its true up in the usa theyve got themselves a brandnew presidentnot the one they elected but another democrat just the same herbert hoover he spoke the name with sardonic relish he got famous up there for helping out in the big flood back in of course that hurt us a lot more than it did the yankees but even so they voted for him up there because of the good he did what did we do here where it was so much worse ill tell you what we voted for the people who let it louse up the country thats what and if thats not a judgment on us i dont know what is before that who ever had a platform that says throw the rascals in that made the engineer laugh which convinced jake it was a good line the man was a staunch whig he was also a good engineer and conscientious enough to make sure he gave his best to whoever was using the wireless featherston wished the freedom party attracted more men like that when we win we will he thought and this time by god were going to win they say the sky will fall if the whigs lose an election he went on aloud weve been our own country the past seventy years and theyve won every time and i tell you something else friendsweve paid for it weve paid through the nose what have they given us lately a losing war two states stolen and chunks carved out of three more money you took to the grocery store in a wheelbarrow the worst flood since noahs with nobody doing much to clean up the mess and now this here littlebusiness turndown they call it he snorted if business turned down any more itd turn dead and they say everythingll be fine in the morning but then the morning comes and were still in the middle of it i say its time to roll up our sleeves and get to work i say its time to build dams to keep the mississippi from kicking us like that again i say we can use the jobs building those damsll give us and i say we can use the electricity well get from em too i say its time to stand on our own two feet in the world and to weed out all the traitors who want to see us stay weak and worthless and i say seventy years is too long the whigs have had their chance theyve had it and they fouled it up im not telling you any secrets friends you know it i know it the whole country knows it its time to give somebody else the ball give it to the freedom party in november give it to us and watch us run thats it for tonight he had fifteen seconds left remember we wont let you down the whigs already have the engineer swiped a finger across his throat the red light went out by now after going on ten years of sending his voice over the wireless web featherston could time a broadcast almost to the second he gathered up his papers and left the studio hed be back in a week pounding his message home the country should have been ready to listen to him in he still thought it would have been if grady calkins hadnt murdered president hampton son of a bitch had it coming jake muttered but even he couldnt help adding not like that dammit saul goldman was waiting in the hallway as usual featherston was glad he didnt seem to have heard those mutters in the years since jake started coming to the studio the little jew had put on weight lost hair and gone gray jake was glad time didnt show so much on his own rawboned frame and lean harsh features goldman said another fine broadcast mr featherston thank you kindly saul jake answered youve done the party a lot of good you know when the day comes youll find we dont forget we dont forget enemies and we dont forget friends either that is not why i did it you know the wireless man said jake slapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him yeah i know pal he said you get extra points in my book for that you dont lose any when the time comes howd you like to be running all our broadcasts all over the country do you mean all the broadcasts of the freedom party or all the broadcasts of the confederate government goldman asked six of one half a dozen of the other jake replied before very long well be the government you know and when we get our hands on it well have a lot of cleaning up to do well do it too by god goldman didnt say anything he didnt back the freedom party because he was wild for revenge against the usa or because he wanted to punish the blacks whod risen up and stabbed the confederacy in the back he was just relieved the party kept quiet about jews jake had never seen the need to get hot and bothered over jews there werent enough of them in the csa to matter negroes now saul goldman had never hidden his reasons for riding along on the freedom partys coattails featherston gave him credit for that the jew said if the time comes ill do what i can for you swell featherston staggered him again with another swat on the back youre a man of your word saul ive seen that and so am i wait till we win your telephonell ring jobll pay good too youll get rich what more could a jew want but all goldman said was well worry about that when the time comes shrugging jake went out to his automobile the guards who accompanied him everywhere in public these days came to attention his chauffeur bounced out of the motorcar and held the door open for him across the street a man in an overcoat with a couple of missing buttons waved and yelled freedom freedom jake called and waved back he ducked down into the birmingham virgil joyner closed the door behind him and got back into the auto himself as he settled in behind the wheel he asked straight back to party headquarters sarge yes jake said and then in the same breath no he laughed at himself he didnt usually change his mind like that he went on take me around capitol square first i want to have a good long look at the mitcheltown there in the usa they called shantytowns like this one blackfordburghs featherston wondered if they would change the names of such places to hoovervilles now that they had a new president he doubted it theyd been saying blackfordburgh for almost four years that was plenty of time for the word to grow roots here in the csa burton mitchel got the blame well by god when i take over nobodys going to call a shantytown fort featherston or any damn stupid thing like that jake thought anybody tries it hell be sorry as long as he livesand the son of a bitch wont live long joyner put the motorcar in gear the guards piled into two more autos and followed they didnt take any chances with featherstons health he wondered if the party could win without him maybewith times as hard as they were now people were panting to throw the whigs out on their ear but he didnt want anybody to have to find out hed waited too long now his hour was come round at last he intended to stay right here and enjoy it huts and tents huddled in the shadows of the statues of george washington and albert sidney johnston they would have lapped up against the confederate capitol too had a barbedwire perimeter patrolled by soldiers not held them at bay men in wrinkled colorless clothes smoked pipes and cigarettes women gossiped or hung up washing on lines that stretched from one makeshift dwelling place to another children scampered here and there in a football game a boy threw a forward pass that was a yankee innovation but it had conquered the confederate states joyner ignored the football shame and a disgrace when youve got to use wire to keep the people away from the politicians he said i saw thinner belts than that when i was in the trenches i know i was thinking the same thing featherston said well well set that to rights too a little more than a year before the next inauguration day the united states had moved up the date from march the confederate states always more conservative hadnt jake didnt care one way or the other he had good guards he figured he would last where now sarge the chauffeur asked him when theyd gone around the square now back to headquarters jake answered i hope ferds still there ive got something i need to talk to him about one of the reasons he hadnt wanted to go straight back was that he didnt want to talk with ferdinand koenig he had to he knew it but he didnt want to hed known koenig since the other man had backed every play he made backed it to the hilt without ferdinand koenig the freedom party probably would have been stillborn this wasnt going to be easy koenig was not only there he was waiting in the entranceway when featherston came in good speech jake he said its getting ripe isnt it you can feel it there ready for you to reach out and pick it yeah jake said come on up to my office will you we need to chin for a few minutes whats up koenig sounded surprised and curious jake only went upstairs he didnt want to do this in public he didnt want to do it at all but he saw the need and need came first lulu still clattered away at a typewriter in the outer office she looked surprisedand miffedwhen jake didnt explain anything to her he knew hed have to make it up to her later that would be later now now he poured a shot for koenig and another for himself ferd sipped the whiskey lit a cigar and asked his question again whats up give it to him straight jake thought give it to him straight then pick up the pieces made up my mind about something he said when i run this summer im going to put willy knight in the numbertwo slot to make sure we take texas and some of the other states west of the mississippi ferdinand koenig slowly turned red you goddamn son of a bitch he said in a low deadly voice so im not good enough for you all of a sudden is that it ill kick your stinking ass around the block you dont think i can lets go outside and find out easy easy easy featherston had known it would be bad he hadnt known it would be this bad he hurried on vice president isnt worth a pitcher of warm spit anyhow let willyboy have it hell think its greattill he figures out he hasnt really got anything give him the slot if he wants it so bad but ill give you something thats really worth having what is it koenigs voice remained hard with suspicion well now ill tell you featherston proceeded to do just that he hadnt had such a tough audience since the early meeting that had left him master of the party and ferd had been on his side then now he had to talk an old friend an old comrade around at last he asked is it all right koenig stuck out his hand yeah jake it is all right dont worry about it featherstons clasp was full of relief americanempire thecentercannothold xvii h ere papa let me show you how its done georges galtier dug his pitchfork into a bale of hay and flung food to the livestock in the barn when he got to the horses stall he said i dont know why you dont turn this miserable animal into glue and food for pampered poodles in montreal tabernac lucien galtier said and shook his head at his younger son i could never do that what does he do but eat georges persisted he doesnt take you into riviereduloup any more he doesnt pull a plow what good is he he listened to me for years he listened to me lucien answered whenever i would hitch up the wagon i would talk to him he knows every thought i had all the more reason to get rid of him georges said absurd as usual dead horses tell no tales but even as he mocked the old beast he gave it more hay than lucien was in the habit of doing with help like yours lucien shook his head the trouble with you is you think i can do nothing for myself any more the trouble with you is you think you can still do everything for yourself georges said by the good god i can lucien said hotly im not sixty yet and even sixty doesnt mean one foot in the grave he grimaced wishing he hadnt put it like that poor marie had never seen sixty his son said papa you are a formidable man georges praise alarmed him more than anything else he could think of the younger galtier continued even so will you tell me you are as formidable as you were when you were my age will you say that well no lucien wanted to say yes but it would have been a lie he knew it as well as georges didbetter his joints were stiff he got tired more easily than he had his wind wasnt what it had been even for a young man farm work isnt easy georges said i ought to know there are times when i wish i were still in my twenties twenties lucien laughed at that for him the twenties seemed as long gone as caesars conquest of gaul he wished he were in his forties that would no doubt have horrified georges who had yet to see them lucien said thanks to you and your brother and my sonsinlaw i do not have to do everything by myself i am not ready to walk away from the farm did you think i would no not really georges replied but one day you know it could be that you might need to if you think about it now you will be readier when the time comes mauvais tabernac lucien said which summed up what he thought about that osti he added for good measure i will worry about such things when the time comes and not until then meanwhile lets get this work done hereor would you rather stand around and gab you always were a lazy one nonsense georges said with dignity i am merely efficient you are the most efficient i have ever seen at getting out of work lucien said but between them they quickly finished off the rest of what needed doing cold smote when they left the barn as always the land around riviereduloup laughed at the calendar which insisted spring was only a couple of weeks away snow blanketed the ground more danced in the air lucien took it altogether for grantedand then all at once he didnt how would one explain something so curious to someone from say the confederate state of cuba or the us state of california or someplace else where it didnt snow it wasnt like rain which simply fell splat it fluttered on the breeze it swirled it twisted would a stranger who didnt know about it take your word when you described it i wouldnt believe it myself lucien muttered stamping up the stairs toward the kitchen door georges on his heels asked wouldnt believe what i wouldnt believe what a nosy son i have lucien opened the door but come in anyhow and ill see what i can find for you to eat i know youll waste away if i dont charles his older son was small and lean like him and marie georges somehow had grown up a great strapping man most of a head taller than lucien and broad through the shoulders his appetiteall his appetitesseemed in proportion he sighed as he followed lucien out of the snow every time i come in here i keep thinkingi keep hopingill see chere maman at the stove baking something good i know lucien sighed too i feel the same but it will not happen not this side of heavenwhich means a couple of sinners like us had better mend our ways this is a better reason to be good than most others i can think of georges said and what do we have cold chicken in the icebox lucien answered bread on the counter thereall the ladies for miles around give me bread for they know i am no bakerand a good jug of applejack in the pantry even for a walking steam shovel like you it should be enough nestce pas steam shovel i believe ive been insulted georges said do you know papa i permit only two people in all the world to insult meyou and sophie you do not need to permit your wife to insult you lucien said pouring two glasses of applejack it will happen whether you permit it or notof this you may be sure he handed one glass to his younger son then raised the other your good health and yours georges knocked back the drink whew he whistled respectfully a good thing i didnt have a cigarette in my mouth or i think my lungs would have caught fire thats strong stuff lucien sipped the applejack like most of what he drank didnt conform to the republic of quebecs tedious rules about licenses and taxes a nearby farmer cooked it up from the harvest of his orchard as a result quality varied widely from one batch to the next as georges had said this jug was on the potent side here lucien said slice the bread and get some butter for it ill cut up the chicken if you want it hot i can build up the fire in the stove dont bother georges told him if the stove were electric like everything else here so it was easy but now cold is fine all right cold it will be then as lucien got out the chicken and a knife he felt maries ghost hovering there he could almost hear her telling him he was making a clumsy botch of things that he didnt keep the kitchen clean enough to suit her no matter what he did he knew he couldnt hope to match her standards he tried as hard as he could though he wanted her to know he was making the effort georges sighed as he dug in i ate a lot of suppers in this house he said no matter where i live this will always be what i think of as home it is your patrimony lucien said simply it is where i grew up georges said which wasnt quite the same thing but wasnt far removed from it either he sighed again it was another time when you were a boy it was another country lucien said i dont think about canada much any more georges said considering whats happened to the rest of it were lucky to be where we are yes considering lucien galtier could hardly disagree with that he poured himself some more apple brandy you were young when the change happenednot so hard for you to get used to it i was a grown man there were times when i felt torn in two especially when the americans treated us so badly in the first part of their occupation i did all the small things a man can do to resistall the small things but none of the large i had not the courage for that not with six children and four of them girls and now you have an american soninlaw and a halfamerican grandson georges said and what do you think of that leonard odoull is a fine man even you will not deny he is a fine man lucien said and georges didnt lucien went on and the boy who bears my name he is as fine a boy as a grandfather could want i wish he had brothers and sisters but that is in the hands of le bon dieu he suspected it was in dr odoulls hands at least as much as in gods contraception was of course illegal in staunchly catholic staunchly conservative quebec if anyone could get around such laws though a doctor could and his soninlaw while a good catholic was also a man who thought his own thoughts a priest probably would not hear everything he might have to confess well charles has three susanne has three denise has four my sophies expecting her third and even jeanne is going to have her second in a few weeks georges said lucien may lack for brothers and sisters but he doesnt lack for cousins this is good this is all good galtier said repeating himselfwas the applejack hitting so hard was he getting old so he couldnt hold his liquor or was he getting old so he talked too much whether he was drunk or not he was getting old however much hed been at pains to deny it to georges he knew better than to deny it to himself georges said sure enough we galtiers will end up taking over quebec before were through and why not lucien said after all someone has to and if we dont its liable to be people like bishop pascalsexcuse me pascal talonstwins his son laughed not all children can have such a distinguished father he was always out for whatever he could get always lucien said he served god so he could help himself he served the americans so he could help himself and if the americans had lost if the englishspeaking canadians and the british had won instead he would have wormed his way back into their good graces too he certainly wormed his way into his lady friends good graces georges said twins thats what i said at the time lucien agreed a priesteven a bishopis also a man this is true beyond a doubt but twins are excessive excessive theres a good word georges nodded this time he was the one who filled the glasses with apple brandy tell me papado you not think it is also excessive to begin sending our young men from quebec to help the americans hold down the parts of canada they occupy they have asked us to do this for a long time galtier said slowly up till now we have always managed to get around it now they say that because they are fighting this war with japan they need our help more than ever georges said i dont see how we can get around it any more so what do you think what i always thought when the americans recognized the republic of quebec they didnt do it for us quebecois they did it for themselves they are the big brother the rich brother we are the little brother the poor relation and we have to do what they say that is how they see it anyhow how do you see it before answering lucien drained the glass georges had poured for him how do i see blurrily but that is not what you asked the united states are very large they are very rich they are the ones who made us a country they say is free but if we truly are free we can tell them no if we like and suppose they dont like it after that will they go to war with us because they dont like it i have my doubts whether our politicians in quebec city have the wit to see this malheureusement that is another question we will probably end up doing what the americans want without even thinking about whether we should what do you think i think youre right i think its too bad and i think nobody cares what either one of us thinks georges answered lucien reached for the jug of applejack i think that calls for another drink he said c larence potter smelled trouble as soon as he walked into whig headquarters in charleston the first thing he did was go over to a neat rank of bottles set against one wall and pour himself a whiskey thus armed he buttonholed braxton donovan who by his red face had started drinking quite a while before donovan was typical of the men in the hall more than whiskey which he held well made him look as if hed been hit in the head with a club a speechless lawyer was a novelty potter had thought he would relish but he turned out to be wrong god damn it snap out of this funk potter said crisply why donovan answered breathing whiskey fumes into his face i dont even know why im going through the motions its only march but you can already see how the freedom party is going to kick our ass come november whats the use of pretending anything different of course those knownothing bastards will winif nobody stands up and tries to stop em potter said thats what were here for isnt it what can we do what can anybody do donovan said whos going to vote for us with one white man in four out of work christ if id lost my job i wouldnt vote whig either yes i believe that withering scorn filled potters voice youd be out there yelling freedom and wondering how to spell it the lawyer glared fuck you clarence potter beamed now youre talking donovan stared at him he nodded emphatically and repeated himself now youre talking i say if you can get pissed off about me you can get pissed off about the freedom party too and youd betterif you dont the confederate states are going right down the drain but braxton donovan no matter how angry at potter he might be couldnt or wouldnt turn that anger where it might do some good he said i can deal with you how are we supposed to deal with featherston grady calkins way if you want to know the truth ive heard ideas i liked less potter answered the freedom party without jake featherston is like a locomotive without a boiler odds are it wouldnt go anywhere and it wouldnt take the country with it fine sort of republic you want donovan said anybody disagrees with you off with his head oh rubbish potter said ive got no quarrel with the radical liberals i think theyre wrong but the world wouldnt end if they got elected and you know why too they play by the same rules we do but the only thing the freedom party cares about when it comes to the republic is using the rules to take it over if featherston wins the election look out what can he do donovan asked weve got the constitution if he does get in he has to play by the rules too he had a pointof sorts it was enough of a point to make potter draw back from more direct argument he said i hope youre right and let it go at that of course i am donovan said which made potter regret being conciliatory the lawyer fixed himself another drink then added the regular meetings going to start in a few minutes if you intend to fortify yourself before it does youd better do it now god forbid i should face it sober potter built himself a tall one after the minutes and other routine business the meeting might have been a reaction against the freedom party people talked about more effective campaigning on the wireless they talked about recruiting tough young men to protect whig street rallies and even to try to break up the freedom partys they talked about getting the whig message out to disaffected voters that made potter raise a hand with the look of a man doing something against his better judgment robert e washburn recognized him mr chairman what is our message potter asked sorry youre out of work and well see if we can do better next time that didnt do the socialists up in the usa much good bang went the gavel mr potter you are out of orderagain washburn said not meim fine potter insisted the countrys out of order were supposed to be trying to make it better i was under the impression that was what we were doing the chairman said forgive me if im wrong whats our message potter asked for the second time why should anybody vote for us if you ask me the only chance weve got is to make jake featherston look like a dangerous lunatic that shouldnt be too hard because the son of a bitch really is a dangerous lunatic but we arent working hard enough to make him out to be one bang went the gavel again i repeat youre out of order mr potter hang on that was braxton donovan clarence has a point by god we cant campaign on what we did this past presidential term thats for damn sure and if we cant make ourselves look good wed better try to make the freedom party look bad otherwise we are stone cold dead ill be damned clarence potter muttered somebody had listened to him he wasnt used to that even the clients who paid him pretty decent money to find out this that or the other thing often ignored what he learned when it didnt gibe with what they thought they already knew donovan went on we ought to pass that notion on to the national party in richmond they may not have thought of it for themselves he made a sour face who knows how well theyre thinking up there these days reluctantly washburn nodded let it be noted in the minutes he said he was a good man hed been a good man for a long timehe had to be seventy near enough potter wondered if the freedom party had any city chairmen that old he would have bet money against it as far as he was concerned nothing else of any importance happened during the meeting since he hadnt expected anything at all important to happen he left feeling ahead of the game not easy not for anyone who cared about the whig party in maybe just maybe the whigs could keep jake featherston out of power one more time by making him look like a raving maniac potter felt like horatius at the bridge doing everything he could to keep the enemy from breaking into the city he started back toward his neat little flat behind him donovan called wait a second potter i had an idea clarence stopped congratulations smartybritches your pa should have walloped you more when you were little but the lawyer spoke without heat he went on you ever see anne colleton these days no potter said shortly that he didnt still pained him theyd got on very well in a lot of ways they were two of a kind but they hadnt come close to seeing eye to eye about politics and they both took politics too seriously to let them stay together so much for bedfellows strange or otherwise he thought maybe you ought to try again donovan said if you can convince her that featherston needs a straitjacket and a rubber room youll hurt the freedom party i would potter said but i dont think shes likely to pay any attention to me what have you got to lose donovan asked if you havent got the price of a longdistance telephone call i can pay for it he reached for his hip pocket ive got it ive got it potter waved for him to stop and he did what have you got to lose it was a good question how would he be worse off if anne hung up on him or told him to go peddle his papers oh his selfrespect would take a beating but that didnt have anything to do with the whigs and their hopes such as those were he nodded to braxton donovan all right ill take a shot at it dont say i never did the party a good turn heaven forbid such a thought from ever crossing my mind donovan sounded pious as a preacher such fine phrases meant exactly nothing as potter knew perfectly well maybe donovan would remember them maybe he wouldnt potter also knew which way he would guess being in the line of work he was he had a telephone back at his flat as he took the mouthpiece off the hook a black excitement filled him operator id like to make a longdistance call please he said and gave the telephone number hed never scratched out of his address book one moment sir while i place the call the operator replied and whom shall i say is the calling party potter gave her his name the call took longer than the promised moment to complete he listened to clicks and pops on the line and a couple of faint almost unintelligible conversations between operators then a telephone rang he heard that quite plainly hello there was anne colletons voice almost as clear as if she were down the block instead of halfway across the state telephones had come a long way since the great war the operator announced the longdistance call and gave her potters name yes ill speak to him anne said at once and then how are you clarence whats this all about im fine he answered how have you been havent talked to you in a while noyou chose your party and i chose mine anne said when november rolls around well see who chose better clarence knew then his call was hopeless he went ahead anyway thats what i wanted to talk to you about youve met jake featherston you must know as well as i do hes got a few screws loose up there lord knows were sinners here in the csa anne but do we really deserve jake for president what ever we may have done to make god angry at us its not that bad anne laughed what does he say thats wrong that we need to get back on our feet we do that the niggers rose up and stabbed us in the back they did that the war department didnt know what was going on till way too late it didnt that we ought to stand up to the united states we should if any of thats crazy then im crazy too wherever you want to go there are lots of ways to get there potter said stubbornly as long as they were talking hed give it his best try even if he was sure it wasnt good enough featherstons going over the rocks and through the swamp you ask me hes more likely to put us on our backs than on our feet i didnt ask you clarence anne said you made this call im trying to tell you the mans dangerous i know he isto everybody who wants to keep us down no to us potter insisted is he going to pay the niggers back or scare them into another uprising wasnt one bad enough if they try it twice theyll never try it three times anne sounded almost as if she looked forward to crushing another negro revolt even so potter went on if he cleans out the war department who goes in instead his drinking buddies will they be any better how could they be any worse anne returned i dont know i dont want to find out either and do you really want us to fight the united states again and lose no i want us to fight those goddamn sons of bitches again and win anne said and so does jake featherston and i think we will how potter demanded think straight anne i know you can if you want to theyre bigger than we are theyre stronger than we are they would be even if they hadnt stolen two of our states and pieces of others whatever we want to do to themand i dont love them either believe me i dontwhat chance have we got to actually do it we havent got any chance if we dont try anne said goodbye clarence she hung up potter wondered if he ought to call her again and try to make her see reason slowly he shook his head she wouldnt do it that seemed only too plain with a soft curse he set the mouthpiece back in its cradle l ike most confederate veterans jefferson pinkard belonged to the tin hats they werent nearly so important in his life as the freedom party he paid his dues every year and that was about it still when amos mizell the longtime head of the tin hats came to birmingham to make a speech on a bright spring sunday jeff went over to avondale park to hear what he had to say taking the trolley to the east side of town just past the sloss works made him mutter to himself he hadnt gone that way very often since losing his job at the steel mill even the air here tasted different full of sulfur and iron the first good lungful made him cough the second one made him smile hed lived with that taste that smell for most of his adult life he hadnt even known he missed it till he found it again he wore a clean white shirt and butternut trousers the notquiteuniform of the freedom party most of the people on the trolley car were men about his age and many of them had on the same kind of outfit he did he didnt see anybody with a bludgeon this wasnt supposed to be that kind of meeting you could belong to the tin hats without being a freedom party man and some people did when the trolley stopped at the sloss works half a dozen more men got on he recognized two or three of them they nodded to one another good to see you one of them said how are you doing not too bad tony pinkard answered no not too bad party found me a job after i got canned so im eating and things look mighty good when the election rolls around sure do tony said about time too the trolley stopped brakes screeching the motorman clanged his bell avondale park he said loudly by the time men finished getting off the car it was almost empty under that warm hopeful sun jeff walked toward the rostrum from which amos mizell would speak confederate flags and tin hat banners fluttered in the breeze here and there in the swelling crowd men waved freedom party flags the confederate battle flag with colors reversed red st andrews cross on blue those though were unofficial or were they up there on the rostrum chatting with mizell stood caleb briggs the head of the freedom party in birmingham the leader of the tin hats leaned closer to hear what briggs had to say even nowadays briggs couldnt talk above a rasping whisper the damnyankees had gassed him during the great war somebody yelled freedom in an instant the cry was deafening jefferson pinkard shouted it out at the top of his lungs the freedom party was the most important thing in his life these days if it werent for the party he hardly would have had a life caleb briggs grinned out at the crowd his teeth were white and straight a good thing toohe was a dentist by trade if hed had a couple of missing choppers he wouldnt have made much of an advertisement for his own work he waved the cries of freedom redoubled amos mizell grinned and waved too a few people started singing the bonnie blue flag the song the tin hats had taken for their own only a few thoughthe bonnie blue flag was hard to make out among the shouts of freedom mizells grin slipped although he kept waving as at the rally so across the csa these days the freedom party spoke with a louder voice than the tin hats that hadnt always been so had things gone a little differently mizell might have been standing in jake featherstons shoes he had to be thinking about what might have been then caleb briggs stepped up to the microphone in his ruined voice he said this is a tin hats rally boys not one of ours and he started singing the bonnie blue flag that tipped the balance following his lead the freedom party men in the crowd sang the tin hats anthem amos mizell tipped his hat to briggs he still didnt look perfectly happy though the men werent singing the bonnie blue flag because theyd thought of it themselves but because a freedom party big wig had asked them to that had to sting jeff pushed and elbowed his way toward the front of the crowd trying to get as close to the platform as he could a lot of other determined men were doing the same thing he didnt get quite so close as he would have liked still he was taller than most and he could see well enough when the loud chorus of the bonnie blue flag ended caleb briggs walked up to the microphone again he raised both hands in the air asking for quiet little by little he got it lets give a big hello to a man whos done a lot for the cause of freedom in the confederate states he said and paused to draw in a wheezing breath he sounded as if hed smoked a hundred packs of cigarettes all at once friends heres mr amos mizell mizell towered over briggs he held up both hands too he was missing his left little fingerone more man whod spilled his blood for the confederate states the fat cats had got the csa into the war pinkard thought and then theyd sat back in richmond miles away from the trenches and let other people do the fighting well their time was coming his smile had nothing to do with mirth yes their time was coming fast weve been through it mizell said weve all been through it and we wonder why the devil we went by the time we were done the confederate states were worse off than when we started and thats not how things were supposed to work we were patriots they told us we were going to teach the damnyankees another lesson and then what happened ill tell you what my friends they left us in the lurch we had to stand up to gas before we could give it back we had to face barrels before we had any barrels of our own we were fighting the usa but we had to fight our own civil war too on account of they were asleep at the switch and didnt know the niggers were going to rise up and kick us in the the slats i see some ladies here the veterans who made up most of the audience snickered they knew what mizell would have said if he were say sitting in a saloon with a whiskey in his hand the few women surely knew too but he hadnt said it so their honor was satisfied he went on and then after we did everything we could do we lost anyway i dont reckon we would have if the niggers had stayed and done their work but we did and what about the folks who sent us out to die they kept on getting rich they let the money go down the drain but you didnt see them missing any meals thats right jeff growled and his was far from the only angry baying voice in the crowd he turned to a man beside him and said we should have strung those bastards up a long time ago oh hell yes the other man said as if the idea that anyone could disagree was unimaginable he slammed a hand against the side of his thigh hell yes mizell was continuing no chance the whigs will fix their own house theyve been in power too long all they know about is hanging on to what theyve already got and the radical liberals he made a scornful gesture losers theyve always been losers theyll never be anything but losers no if were going to set our own house in order what we need is his voice trailed away he waited expectantly he didnt have to wait long the cry of freedom roared from almost every throat after that first great yell it settled down into a steady chant freedom freedom freedom pinkard shouted it along with all the others his fist pumping the air amos mizell raised his hands once more slowly reluctantly silence came mizell said thats right friends the tin hats know what this country needs we need a new broom a broom that will sweep all the old fools out of richmond we reckon the freedom party is the right one for the job thats why i want all the tin hats in the country regardless of whether theyre registered in the freedom party or not to vote for jake featherston i tell you we need to do everything we can to make that man president of the confederate states of america well throw everything weve got behind him on account of hell make this a country we can be proud to live in again he paused freedom freedom freedom the chant rang out again and then a little at a time another chant began to supplant it feather ston feather ston feather ston the heavy thudding stress on the last syllable was almost hypnotic feather ston feather ston feather ston jefferson pinkard shouted it too hed been a freedom party man ever since the first time he heard jake featherston speak not long after the war ended hed come this far with jake he wanted to go further and now it looked as if he could as if the whole csa could as he looked around the crowd he saw knots of men in white and butternut from whom the chant of feather ston came loudest he smiled to himself no caleb briggs didnt miss a trick he must have given some of the boys special instructions the only thing that surprised pinkard was that the local party boss hadnt recruited him to help change the chant he shrugged briggs did as briggs pleased feather ston feather ston mizell seemed startled to hear the freedom party leaders name the cry of freedom hed undoubtedly expected this no well too bad jeff thought you back the freedom party youve got to back jake featherston too no way around that even if you wish there were by his manner up there on the rostrum maybe the head of the tin hats wished exactly that no matter how he wished things had turned out his outfit was in second place not first hearing jakes name roared in his face at his own rally had to show him he would never run first caleb briggs stepped up to the microphone it helped his harsh nearwhisper carry were all in this together friends freedom party tin hats the redemption league out west all the people who see whats wrong and whove got what it takes to stand up and fix it when jake featherston wins this fall we all winevery single one of us and every single group thats what weve got to take away from this rally today just like we were in the trenches were all in this together only difference is this time by god were going to win no chant rose this time just a great roar of agreement jeff pumped his fist in the air again and his was far from the only one raised high up on the rostrum briggs put a hand on amos mizells shoulder he was smaller than the man who led the tin hats but still somehow had the air of a father consoling a son after a moment mizell straightenedalmost to attention as if he were back in the army again he went to the microphone and said dr briggs is right when jake featherstons president we all win and we will win come november he got his own round of applause then somebody in the crowd started singing dixie maybe it was one of the men with instructions from briggs maybe someone whod had a good idea on his own either way in the blink of an eye everyone sang it along with the rest of the men and women in avondale park pinkard bawled out the words tears stung his eyes this was what mattered this feeling of being part of something bigger more important than himself when the last raucous chorus ended briggs went over to the microphone remember this folks he said remember it good what weve got here today the whole country gets when we win only a smattering of applause answered him no more than a handful of people understood what he was talking about but jefferson pinkard was one of those few he beat his palms together till they were red and sore that was what he wantedthe whole country like a freedom party rally what could be better nothing he could think of the way things looked the whole country wouldnt be able to think of anything better either that seemed very fine indeed to jeff s omething tickled anne colletons memory when she checked into the excelsior hotel in charleston it tickled harder when she got into her room the tickling wasnt of the pleasant sort after she looked around the room she realized why roger kimball had tried to rape her here almost ten years ago now shed given him a knee between his legs aimed a pistol at him and sent him on his way in short order he was dead shot by that woman from boston anne sighed kimball had been loyal to jake featherston come hell or high water anne was loyal to nobody but herself not like that shed thought featherston was a loser and shed broken her ties to the freedom party that was the biggest reason she and roger had broken up the biggest reason she hadnt given herself to him the biggest reason hed tried to take her by force and now here she was back in charleston back in the freedom party she tasted the irony there had roger been right all along anne shook her head she didnt care to admit that even to herself after shed walked away from featherston the country had changed that was what had brought her back still she granted herself the luxury of another sigh it was too bad shed never found anybody who could match roger kimball in bed a glance in the mirror on the dresser told her she probably never would a good start on a double chin lines on her face no powder could hide the harshness of dye to hold gray at bay she wasnt a young beauty any more now she had to get her way with brains which wasnt so easy and took longer what cant be cured she said and deliberately turned away from the mirror the only alternative to getting older was not getting older the yankees had gassed her younger brother jacob theyd gassed him and the negroes on the marshlands plantation had murdered him in the uprising of hed never had a chance shed taken some revenge on them after the war more still waited shed never disagreed with the freedom party about that she unpacked her own suitcase once upon a time shed have had a colored maid to do it for her the last one shed had came much too close to murdering her in the long aftermath of the uprising no more once everything was put away she went downstairs a man sitting on an overstuffed chair in the lobby a chair whose upholstery had seen better days got to his feet and took off his hat evening miss colleton he said freedom good evening mr henderson anne answered a beat slower than she should have she added freedom herself the party greeting still struck her as foolish but shed made the bargain and she had to go through with it hope you had a pleasant drive down james henderson said he held out his hand she briskly shook it his eyes widened slightly he hadnt expected so firm a grip he was a few years younger than anne everyone is a few years younger than i am these days she thought unhappilylean as a lath with a face so bony it might have come off the label of an iodine bottle he wore the ribbon for the purple heart on his lapel it was all right anne said some people drive for the sport of it i drive to get where im going sensible henderson said men said that to her a lot these days as theyd once said beautiful she missed the other this would have to do beauty didnt last brains did shed realized that a long time ago shed had brains even then though men had done their best not to notice henderson went on shall we eat some supper we can talk then and figure out where to go from there all right anne said not so many years earlier he would have wanted to go back to her room and take her to bed now he probably didnt that made doing business simpler most of the time she appreciated it because it did every once in a while she found herself pining for days gone by hotel restaurant suit you or would you rather go somewhere else henderson was doing his best to be polite a fair number of freedom party men either didnt bother or didnt know how the hotel restaurant is fine she answered she ordered crab cakes she took advantage of charleston seafood whenever she came down to the coast henderson chose fried chicken they both ordered cocktails the colored waiter who took their orders went back to the kitchen without writing them down odds were he couldnt write james hendersons eyes followed him wonder where he was in and what he did he looks too young to have done anything much anne said of course you never can tell sure cant henderson scowled he needed a visible effort to draw himself back to the business at hand lets talk about congress and the legislature right anne said briskly henderson might be skinny enough to dive through a soda straw without hitting the sides but he came to the point she liked that she went on we can figure that jake featherston is probably going to win this state doesnt mean we wont campaign for him here henderson said no of course not anne agreed we dont want any nasty surprises but the rest of the ticket has to run well too freedom party congressmen will help jake get his laws through the state legislators need to back us tooand theyre the ones who choose cs senators were still weak in the senate because we didnt start getting a lot of people elected to state legislatures till james henderson nodded he began to say something more but the waiter came back with drinks and then with dinner the fellow started to give anne the chicken she pointed to her companion to show where it should go sorry maam the colored man said he set things right then withdrew henderson looked around to make sure he was out of earshot before resuming cant trust em the freedom party man said anne couldnt quarrel with him there henderson continued anything they hear the rad libs know tomorrow and the whigs the day after anne wasnt so sure about that but didnt care to argue with it either all she said was they know they have to try to stop us any way they can they know but i dont think they can do it have to make sure they dont we have to make sure any way we need to henderson let her draw her own pictures she had no trouble doing just that we dont want to go too far she said if we do itll only hurt us cost us votes the average lawabiding confederate has to think were the right answer not the wrong one weve shot ourselves in the foot before when we pushed too hard we need to pick our spots the skeletal man across the table from her nodded see whos really dangerous he said and bared a lot of teeth in a grin wont be so dangerous once we run over em with barrels a few times anne thought that was a figure of speech she wasnt quite sure though and didnt care to ask theoretically the armistice with the usa banned barrels from the csa the government had never admitted to having anynor could it without risking yankee wrath if a couple of them should suddenly clatter down a street with freedom party men inside if that happened anne wouldnt have been astonished she said looks to me like were thinking along the same lines mr henderson do you want to get some more chicken hed reduced half a bird to bones in nothing flat dont mind if i do henderson waved for the waiter as the negro took the request back to the kitchen henderson gave a half apologetic smile always been scrawny no matter how much i eat i wish i could say that corsets had been out of fashion for a good many years now but anne was tempted to get back into one to help her remind the world she did still have a waist she wished she could wear a corset under her jaw too to fight the sagging flesh there in fact there were such things intended to be put on at night three different doctors though had assured her they did no good the waiter returned with another whole chicken leg henderson devoured it he patted his pale lips with his napkin hit the spot good even if she envied him at the same time anne couldnt help liking a man who put away his food like that she went on we have to hit the spot in november too we have to if we lose this time i dont think well ever get another chance after grady calkins assassinated president hampton after the confederate currency stabilized when the usa eased back on reparations the freedom party had sunk like a stone and had stayed down though almost all the s if it failed again she was sure it wouldnt revive she couldnt stand the idea of trying to make peace with the whigs once more this run had to reach the top dont you worry about that maam james henderson said jake featherston he isnt about to lose so four hundred years before a spanish soldier seeing the might and wealth of the inca empire might have spoken of pizarro the spaniard would have been right anne thought the freedom party man was too even if that maam rankled henderson wasnt so very much younger than she was she said its not just jake remember we want to grab with both hands think youre right henderson said legislators congressmenevery place where we can win well fight like the devil thats right mayors and county commissioners and sheriffs too some of those people can appoint judges and the more judges on our side the better same with sheriffs a lot of themand city policemen toohave been on our side for a long time better be henderson said nodding the waiter came up with a coffeepot after hed filled cups for anne and henderson he retreated once more henderson waited poured in lots of cream and sugar tasted added more sugar yet and then continued by the time were done well have this state sewed up tight you bet oh yes anne said softly and not just south carolina either by the time were done well have the whole country sewn up tight thats the idea henderson said anne wondered if jake featherston had thought he could come within arms reach of ruling the confederate states when he first joined the freedom party what would he say if she asked him and would what he said be true would he really recall here in what hed thought and hoped and dreamt back in even if he did would he admit it she had her doubts the waiter returned again dessert folks apple pie is mighty fine today or weve got cherry or lemon meringue or pecan too apple henderson said at once slap some ice cream on top too yes suh the waiter looked to anne anything for you maam she shook her head i couldnt possibly james henderson could and did he had a second cup of coffee to go with the pie a la mode too and doctored it as thoroughly as he had the first with a sigh of regret he pushed away the empty plate yeah that hit the spot if we do as well in november as you did at the supper table here the whigs are in even more trouble than i thought anne said he grinned well clean em up and wash em down the drain just what theyve got coming anne nodded she felt victory in the air too w hen scipio walked into erasmus fish store and cafe he knew right away something was wrong his boss looked like a man whose best friend had just died without preamble erasmus said i gwine shut her down xerxes do jesus scipio said hed spent a lot of time here hed thought the place would go on foreveror at least as long as erasmus did which had looked as if it might be the same thing why for you do dat he demanded you recollect how once upon a time them freedom party bastards come by here erasmus said they was gonna take money from me so nothin happen to the store i recollects uhhuh scipio said then the freedom party go down de drain an dey dont come back no mo theys back all of a

thing i told cassius the same thing he wouldnt listen to me he was sure the revolution would carry everything before it he was sure and he was wrong and now hes dead scipio couldnt say a word of that he had a new name here he had a new life here remembering things hed done long ago in another state and in another state of mind what point to it none he could see especially since timeyellowed creased wanted posters still proclaimed his other self fugitive from what south carolina called justice erasmus went on sorry i got to let you go like this here i know it aint right times is hard an you gots young uns but i cant help it xerxes cant stay in business no more you hook on somewheres else mebbe mebbe scipio didnt really believe it how many places were hiring waiters even asking the question of himself made him want to laugh but it wasnt funny it was anything but funny as a matter of fact bathshebas housekeeping work brought in some money but not enough he would have to find something to do and find it fast i could be the best butler augusta georgias ever seen if hed passed muster for anne colleton he could pass muster here true he had no references but he was good enough to show what he could do even without them and rich people always had money people like that were always looking for good help when he opened his mouth and showed he could talk like an educated white man he shook his head and shivered as if coming down with the influenza when i show that i put a noose around my neck he knew what a good servant he made if he started playing the butler again word would spread among the rich whites of augusta old soandsos got himself a crackerjack new nigger best damn butler you ever saw word wouldnt spread only in augusta either st matthews south carolina wasnt that far away anne colleton would hear before too long and when she did he was dead shed gone back to helping the freedom party hed seen that in the newspapers she wouldnt have forgotten him so far as he knew she hadnt tried very hard to find him after hed escaped south carolina for georgia but if he did anything to bring himself to her notice he deserved to die for stupiditys sake erasmus reached into the cash box and took out two brown twentydollar banknotes he thrust them at scipio here you is he said wish it could be more but i druther give it to you than to them freedom party trash pride told scipio to refuse he had no room in his life for pride thank you kindly he said and took the money god bless you he done bless me plenty erasmus said hope he watch out for you too someone else had pressed money on scipio when he lost a job waiting tables he snapped his fingers reckon i go see me mistuh john oglethorpe anybody in this here town got work reckon he know bout it good idea erasmus nodded not all white folks is freedom party bastards these days scipio ventured out of the terry only with trepidation he didnt like the way white men looked at him when he walked along the streets outside the colored district they looked at him the way they had to look at possums and squirrels and raccoons when they hunted for the pot freedom party posters and banners and emblems were everywhere he saw several white men with little enamelwork freedom party pinsthose reversedcolor confederate battle flagson their lapels more than anybody else they glared at him as if he had no right to exist he kept his eyes down on the sidewalk giving back look for look was the worst thing he could do if one of those pinwearing fellows decided he was an uppity nigger he might not get back to the terry alive when he walked into oglethorpes restaurant aurelius was taking care of the breakfast crowd whites sat on one side of the room negroes on the other theyd always done that it wasnt law but it was unbreakable custom scipio perched at a small table aurelius nodded when he recognized him aint seen you in a long time he said what kin i git you bacon and eggs over easy and grits and a cup o coffee scipio answered i see mistuh oglethorpe when things slows down i tell him yous here aurelius said how come you aint at erasmus place he shuttin down scipio said and the other mans eyes widened in astonishment in a voice not much above a whisper scipio explained they wants too much money for he to stay open he didnt explain who they were aurelius would know hey aurelius a white man called i need some more coffee over here comin mr benson aurelius hurried off to take care of the customer and then another one and then another one after that he didnt get back to scipios table till he set plate and coffee cup in front of him thank you kindly scipio said and dug in john oglethorpe was in no way a fancy cook but few of his kind could match him the breakfast was easily as good as any erasmus made high praise indeed scipio hadnt eaten grits in his days as anne colletons privileged servant hed thought of them as fieldhands food hed remade their acquaintance since and found he liked them with aurelius filling his cup every time it got low he hung around in the restaurant till the rush thinned out john oglethorpe emerged from the kitchen then his hair had gone gray and pulled back at the temples he wore thick bifocals he hadnt had before and was thinner and more stooped than scipio remembered whats this nonsense i hear about erasmus goin out of business he demanded he cant do that hes been cooking even longer than i have no mo scipio said freedom party fellas they wants too much money from he oh those people the white mans voice went flat and hard ive always been a whig and so was my pappy and so was his pappywell he was a democrat before the war of secession but that doesnt count some people thoughsome people think yelling something loud enough makes it so free dom aurelius didnt yell it but the scorn in his voice ran deep scipio blinked the cook and the waiter had worked together for god only knew how many years even so as far as scipio could remember this was the first timeoutside the brief chaotic madness of the congaree socialist republiched ever heard a negro mock a confederate political party where a white could hear yellin aint all them freedom party fellas does scipio said erasmus reckon somethin bad happen to he if he dont pay so he done quit thats a shame and a disgrace oglethorpe said that is nothing but a shame and a disgrace this town needs hardworking folks like erasmus a hell of a lot more than it needs blowhards like those freedom party yahoos did he know gullivers travels or was he using the word as a general term of contempt scipio didnt see how he could ask that might involve trying to explain how he knew gullivers travels he kept trying to bury his past but it lived on inside him all he said was yes suh and then he got down to the business that had brought him out of the terry mistuh oglethorpe i gots me a family to feed i been workin fo erasmus a good long time now aint like you an aurelius but a long time you know somebody lookin for a waiter i does janitor work too an i cooks some aint as good as you an erasmus but i aint bad neither oglethorpe frowned i was afraid you were gonna ask me that why else would you come up here scipios face heated the restaurant owner only shrugged i dont mind if you know somebody you better ask him only trouble is i cant think of anyone whos short of help right now what about you aurelius you know the terry a damn sight better than i do i ought to boss dont you reckon but aurelius smile didnt stick on his face no i dont know nobody neither wish to heaven i did damn scipio spoke quietly but with great feeling may not be so bad oglethorpe said this isnt like some businessesslots do open up now and again you pound the pavementyoull find something you can use my name too dont reckon youll need to though you tell people you worked for erasmus all these years theyll know youre the straight goods hope so do jesus i hope so scipio drummed his fingers on the tabletop hope somethin come up pretty damn quick dont wanna end up in no mitcheltown as soon as he said the word he wished he hadnt it wasnt that he didnt feel that fear he did but the shantytowns named after the confederate president were a judgment on the whigs calling them by that nameeven thinking of them by that nameonly helped the freedom party trouble was everyone in the confederate states called them mitcheltowns just as they were blackfordburghs in the united states whoever chanced to be in power when the disaster struck got the blame good luck xerxes john oglethorpe said wish to god i could do something more for you thank you kindly suh scipio answered i thanks you very kindly an i wishes you could too a s hipolito rodriguez had seen when he went up north to fight in texas spring could be a wonderful time of year a time when the land renewed itself after the chill and gloom of winter it wasnt like that in sonora here it was the time when the rains petered out the weather got warmer yes but it had never really turned cold hed seen snow in the trenches of texas the memory still appalled him he eyed the streams coming down from the mountains if they dried up his crops would dry up with them they seemed all right he worried anyhow hed never known a farmer who didnt worry even the white men beside whom hed fought had worried about what was happening to their farms while they went to war hed plowed hed planted his corn and beans and squashes now he and the rest of his family watched them growand weeded to make sure they would grow work on a farm was never done even so he sent his children into baroyeca for schooling as often as they could go he wanted them to have a chance at a life that wasnt work work work every minute of every day he didnt know how much of a chance they would have but any chance was better than none teachers taught in english of course rodriguez worried about that only every now and againwould the children forget their heritage more often he thought it good that they learn as much of the dominant language of the csa as they could magdalena knew very little english with his wife rodriguez stuck to spanish because of that his sons and daughtersespecially his sonsthought he understood less english than he really did they started using it among themselves to say things they didnt want him to follow silly old fool miguel called him one day smiling as if it were a compliment rodriguez boxed his sons ears he smiled too though he doubted whether miguel appreciated it silly young fool he said also in english after that his children were a lot more careful when they had something to say either to him or about him he went on about his business more amused than otherwise life taught all sorts of lessons and only some of them came from school no matter how tired he was at the end of a day he tried to go into baroyeca one evening a week for the freedom party meeting magdalena had given up complaining about that when she saw he came back neither drunk nor smelling of a puta s cheap perfume as far as rodriguez was concerned the scent of victory in the air was headier than liquor sweeter than the dubious charms of baroyecas handful of women of easy virtue with the closing of the silver mines a lot of the whores had moved to other towns towns where they hoped to do better for themselves the business collapse had had all sorts of unexpected unfortunate consequences robert quinn did his best to fan that scent all over the countryside baroyeca still had no electricity quinn couldnt call people together to listen to jake featherstons weekly speeches on the wireless he did the next best thing he got the text of the speeches by telegram and translated them into spanish himself even though it wasnt his native tongue he spoke well and plainly believed every word he said those speeches gave hipolito rodriguez a window on a wider world a world beyond baroyeca after one of them he said senor quinn you are a traveled man is it true what senor featherston says that these politicians in richmond are nothing but criminals if jake featherston says it you can take it to the bank quinn answeredhe would sometimes translate english idioms literally into spanish considering the sad state of banking in the csa these days this one lost something in the translation even so rodriguez understood it quinn went on how can you trust the party if you dont trust what jake featherston says you cant its as simple as that you do trust the party dont you of course i do rodriguez answered quickly he knew a dangerous question when he heard one that didnt mean he wasnt telling the truth though without the party what would we be bad off thats what quinn replied but as long as we follow what jake says well be fine hes the leader he knows whats what all we have to do is back him up thats our job comprende si senor rodriguez said as the other men at the meeting nodded bueno quinn grinned if jake was wrong he couldnt have come as far as he has now could he he couldnt see what all was wrong with los estados confederados either eh weve got a lot of work to do to win this election and well have even more to do after we win it carlos ruiz asked a question that had also been in rodriguezs mind after senor featherston wins the election what will the confederate states be like thats easy carlos robert quinn answered thats real easy to tell you the truth once jake featherston gets to be president we will fix everything thats wrong with the confederate states of america everything by god and once we fix everything thats wrong inside the country then we start thinking about getting even with los estados unidos too how does that sound i like it ruiz said simply rodriguez nodded so did the rest of the local men at the freedom party headquarters how could anyone not like such a program the united states were a long way off yes but they deserved vengeance the room was full of veterans theyd all fought the usa during the war someone behind rodriguez said i dont want to go back into the army but i will if i have to that drew more nods to his own surprise rodriguez found himself contributing one hed had all the war he wanted and then some but if it was a matter of turning the tables on the usa he knew he would redon the color the confederates called butternut you are all good patriotic men i knew you were quinn said in his deliberate spanish but i have a question for you i know your patron is not such a big man as he was in your grandfathers day how many of you though have a patron who tries to keep you from voting for the freedom party two or three men raised their hands carlos ruiz was one of them he said don joaquin says the freedom party is nothing but a pack of bandidos and must be stopped does he well well well robert quinn grinned again a grin that was all sharp teeth we have a saying in english who will bell the cat does don joaquin think he can put the bell on the partido de la libertad i dont know what you mean senor quinn ruiz answered he thinks he can tell people how to vote of that i am certain and you do not think he ought to quinn asked ruiz shook his head the local freedom party leader said perhaps he should change his mind don joaquin is a stubborn man ruiz warned quinn showed his teeth again but didnt say a word not then as the meeting was breaking up he asked ruiz and rodriguez and three or four other men to stay behind it would be a shame if anything happened to don joaquins barn he remarked it would be an even bigger shame if anything happened to his house he has guards carlos said they carry pistols quinn opened a closet inside were neatly stacked tredegar rifles do you think the guards would listen to reason he asked if they decide not to listen to reason do you think you could persuade them the locals looked at one another no a patron wasnt what his grandfather had been still the idea of attacking his grounds of attacking his buildings hadnt crossed their minds up till now if we do this hipolito rodriguez said slowly we have to win and senor featherston has to win in november if either of those things fails we are dead men you understand this i hope oh yes quinn nodded this is not the army this is not even the way it is in some of the other confederate states i am not going to give you orders but if you want to teach this fellow a lesson i can help you he pointed to the tredegars the question is how badly do you want to be free a few nights later rodriguez slid quietly through the darkness a military rifle in his hands he hadnt carried a tredegar since but the weight felt familiar so did the crouch in which he moved a dog barked somebody called whos there silence except for the barking a moment later a yelp punctuated it along with the sound of a kick stupid dog don joaquins sentry muttered rodriguez waited one of his friends was going forward the brief sound of a scuffle no shoutsonly bodies thrashing a fresh voice called come on the freedom party men hurried past a body there stood don joaquins house the grandee had only two sons and a daughter but his dwelling was four or five times the size of hipolito rodriguezs and the stable and barn not far away were even bigger how much livestock did he have how much did any one man need a guard paced around the barn he paced yes but he wasnt looking for trouble it found him all the same silent as a serpent a raider sneaked up behind him and clapped a hand over his mouth he let out only a brief horrified gurgle as the knife went home when the raider let the body sag to the ground another man ran forward with gasoline he splashed it on the wooden doors and the wall of the barn then stepped back lit a cigarette and flipped it into the pool of gas that had run down from the doors yet another freedom party man gave the stables the same treatment flames leaped and roared through their growing din rodriguez heard horses and mules and cattle and sheep neighing and braying and bellowing in terror he also heard don joaquins guards shouting in alarm their booted feet pounded on gravel and dirt as they ran to see what they could do hed been waiting for that waiting behind a boulder that gave him splendid cover almost of itself the tredegar leaped to his shoulder he hadnt fired one in a long time but he still knew what to do the range was ridiculously short and the flames lit up his targets for him if only things were so easy during the great war he thought and squeezed the trigger one of the targets fell he tried to think of them like that as he had during the war he wasnt the only freedom party man shooting another guard toppled and another and another the guards had fought against the usa too they dove for whatever hiding places they could find and started shooting back the cracks of their pistols seemed feeble beside the tredegars roars but when one of their bullets pinged off the stone behind which rodriguez crouched he reminded himself any gun could kill away carlos ruiz called no shouts of freedom here don joaquin might suspect whod done this but what could he do what would he dare do without proof he had to know the raiders could as easily have burned his house with him and his family in it rodriguez slipped back to another sheltering boulder and then to one behind that then he was far enough from the blazing buildings to stop worrying about the flames giving him away before too long people would be scouring the countryside looking for him and his friends he intended to be back in bed by then magdalena and his children would say hed been there all night and don joaquin would know better than to tell people with guns of their own how to vote americanempire thecentercannothold xviii s pring in dakota was a riot of burgeoning green and of glorious birdsong it was one of the most beautiful things flora blackford had ever seen she would have given a great deal not to be seeing it now if hosea had won the election but he hadnt hed got trounced how badly hed got trounced still ate at flora the shock of presidentelect coolidges death less than a month before he was to take office had jolted her no less than the rest of the american political world after that though the pain returned her husband had to go down to washington to hand over the reins of power to a man who hadnt even beaten him in novemberone more humiliation piled on all the rest as soon as herbert hoover took the oath of office the blackfords had gone on what the papers called an extended holiday the papers for once were polite hosea blackford had gone back to his home state to lick his wounds and taken his family with him flora turned away from the farm window that showed great plains spring to such good advantage when do you think we should go back east she asked her husband set down his coffee cup he managed a crooked smile are the wide open spaces starting to get on your nerves yes floras vehemence startled even her hosea had put it better than shed managed to even in her own mind i grew up in new york city remember on the lower east side even philadelphia seems roomy im so sorry for you hosea blackford sighed and im sorry but i really dont feel like going back yet people here leave me alone nobody in philadelphia or washington leaves you alone i think its against the law there but the countrys in trouble we need to do something flora said he sighed again i spent the last four years doing everything i knew how to do none of it seemed to help much im willing to let someone else worry about it for a whileespecially since the people have shown they arent willing to let me worry about it any more he sounded tired worse he sounded old flora had seen how cruelly hed aged in four hard years in powel house he was she reminded herself past his seventieth birthday when theyd married his being close to twice her age hadnt bothered her it still didnt not in most ways but this loss of vigor of resiliency troubled her she was sure that when shed first come to know him when shed first fallen in love with him he would have bounced back stronger and faster on the other hand nobody whod spent three years in the trenches during the great war came out afterwards the same man hed been when he went in hosea had spent four years in the presidential trenches and hed lost the war she didnt suppose expecting him to stay unchanged was fair when we do go back she said i wonder if i ought to take a flat in the fourteenth ward aha her husband said and smiled something makes me think you want to go back to congress im thinking about it flora said i dont like seeing my old district in the hands of a democrat i dont like seeing a lot of our districts in the hands of democrats neither do i hosea blackfords smile was sour i dont think any of our candidates will ask me to hit the campaign trail for them next year though theyd probably want me on the stump for their opponents instead its not that bad flora insisted noodds are its worse hosea answered i cant think of anything less welcome in a political party than a president whos just lost an election after a while ill get to be an elder statesman but right now im nothing but a nuisance with a mournful shake of the head he added by the the time i get to be an elder statesman ill probably be so elder im dead god forbid flora exclaimed no one in her family no one among the immigrant jews of the lower east side spoke of death straight on like that words had power to speak of something was to help bring it into being the rational part of her mind knew that was nonsense but the rational part of her mind went only so deep down underneath it superstition still flourished its true her husband said we both know its true even if you dont want to talk about it i dont need to take out pencil and paper to know how old i am i get reminded whenever i look in the mirror id like to stay around long enough to see joshua grow up but how likely is that ive already beaten the odds by lasting as long as i have thats nothing but flora began the truth hosea finished for her you know it as well as i do too and if you dont ask the next insurance salesman you happen to run into hell tell you what the actuarial tables say flora wanted to tell him that was nonsense she couldnt and she knew it the best she could do was change the subject lets talk about something else fine now her husbands grin showed real amusement do you think this new professional football federations going to last that wasnt what shed had in mind i dont care she said tartly what i think is its disgraceful to pay men so much to run around with a football when so many people cant find work at all talk about a waste of money its an amusement the same as an orchestra is an amusement her husband said nothing wrong with them we need them especially in hard times we need them an orchestra is worthwhile flora said a football game she shook her head a lot more people go to watch the philadelphia barrels than to the philadelphia symphony hosea said since that was true flora could only stick out her chin and say even so amusement is where you find it hosea said im not going to be elitist and look down my nose at anything to a good socialist elitist was a dirty word flora tried to turn it back on her husband when the top football players make more than the president of the united statesand some of them dotheyre the elitists they asked one of them about that two or three years ago did you happen to see what he said hosea blackford asked flora shook her head she paid as little attention to sports as she could one of her husbands eyebrows rose what he told the reporter was i had a better year than he did all things considered how could anyone tell mr gehrig he was wrong a choleriyeh on mr gehrig flora said furiously nothing that happened was your fault that eyebrow lifted again the party told that to the voters we told them and told them and told them and herbert hoover is president of the united states today and here i am in dakota if youre there its your fault it isnt fair flora said hosea laughed out loud which only made her angrier joshua might try to use an argument like that but you shouldnt he said its the way politics works what have you done for me lately is the question voters always askand maybe its the question they should always ask teddy roosevelt won the great war they didnt give him a third term though because of all the strikes and unrest that came afterwards thats how upton got to be presidentand how i got to be vice president if you remember im not likely to forget she answered i was so proud of you and im still proud of you and i still think you ought to be president not that that lump of a hoover as a matter of fact i agree with you i think youre sweet too he added unfortunately fiftyseven percent of the voters in the united states had a different opinion and theirs counts for more than ours he sighed it was even worse in the electoral college of course not right flora muttered whats not right mama that was joshua still in his flannel pajamas he was yawning from somewhere on one side of the family or the other hed found a taste for sleeping late on the lower east sideor for that matter on a dakota farmhe would have had to get up early whether he wanted to or not as the son of a man first vice president and then president he could usually sleep as late as he wanted to privilege is everywhere flora thought but she had to answer him its not right that your father lost the election oh joshua tried to frown but a yawn ruined it why not the other guys got more votes didnt they hosea laughed thats it in a nutshell josh the other guys got more votes josh flora didnt like the onesyllable abridgement of a perfectly good name joshua blackford was rolling majestic josh blackford sounded like someone who wore overalls and a straw hat and if thats elitist too bad she thought hosea didnt see the problem the point is the other guysshe used her sons phrase as if it had quotation marks around itshouldnt have got more votes joshua muttered something under his breath flora thought she heard stinking japs without a doubt the japanese bombing of los angeles had been the last strawor rather the last nail in the coffin if joshua wanted to think his father would have won without that he could flora wanted to think the very same thing the only problem was she knew better looking at the last nail in the coffin meant ignoring all the others and there were a lot of them youll win again in four years though wont you father joshua had a boys boundless confidence in his father he also had a boys strange notions about the way time worked neither of his parents said anything hosea blackford would be too old to nominate in even if hed never lost an election in his life since hed lost the way he had the socialists would be trying their best to forget hed ever existed wont you joshua asked again i like to think i would win against mr hoover hosea said slowly he doesnt seem to me as if hes moving things in the right direction but i dont know if i would want to run again and i dont know if the socialist party would nominate me if i did we would have to see how things look in before we could know flora added the next election for president is almost four years from now thats a long time especially in politics her husband added joshua nodded hed just turned seven to him four years were a very long time indeed he said i think you still ought to be president thank you son hosea blackford said i think the very same thing flora said and ruffled joshuas hair he was dark like her but otherwise looked more like his father with a long face prominent cheekbones and a straight pointed nose he also had more of his fathers temperament he was steadier than flora and not given to sudden enthusiasms that took control of him for days or weeks at a time who do the socialists have that could be any better than you dad he asked he couldnt imagine anyone better flora ruffled his hair again neither could she but she knew the practical politicians in the socialist party would have a different opinionand hosea really would be too old to run again in he probably would have been too old to run in if he hadnt been the incumbent one way or another everything will work out fine she said joshua believed her he was still only a little boy t he remembrance steamed west across the pacific accompanied by three destroyers a light cruiser a heavy cruiser and two battleships sam carsten wished one of the battlewagons would have been the dakota but no such luck his old ship was off doing something else he had no idea what repairs in seattle had been as quick as the navy yard there could make them he did his best not to worry about that back during the great war the dakota had been hastily repaired after battle damageand her steering had never been reliable again her steering probably still wasnt reliable so far as sam knew the japanese torpedo hadnt damaged the remembrance s steeringbut what had it damaged that hasty repairs might not discover he hoped heand the shipwouldnt find out the hard way commander van der waal wasnt aboard broken ankles healed at their own pace you couldnt hurry them a new damagecontrol officer a lieutenant commander named hiram pottinger was nominally in charge of antitorpedo work but pottingers previous service had been in cruisers sam knew the remembrance backwards and forwards and inside outliterally inside out after the torpedo hit off the canadian coast most of the burden fell on his shoulders hed led the sailors in the damagecontrol parties when things looked black that had earned him respect he could have got no other way it had also earned him thin new gold stripes on his cuffs hed been promoted to lieutenant junior grade for what hed done glad as he was of the promotion he could have done without some of the respect he feared he would end up trapped in an assignment hed never wanted martin van der waal had always insisted it was an important assignment even had sam been inclined to argue the experience of getting torpedoed would have changed his mind but he agreed with his injured superior important antitorpedo work definitely was that still didnt mean he cared to make a career of it he spent as much time as he could on deck that meant more tinfoil tubes of zincoxide ointment but he did it anyhow watching aeroplanes take off and land never failed to fascinate him he got plenty of chances to watch for the remembrance flew a continuous air patrol the japanese navy had ships out here too and who found whom first would have a lot to do with how any fight turned out the way the arrester hook caught the cables stretched across the deck and brought a landing aeroplane to an abrupt halt still fascinated him one perfect morning he was taking the air on the flight deck after breakfast when alarms began to sound klaxons hooting in his ears he ran for his battle station wishing it werent deep in the bowels of the aeroplane carrier he wanted to be able to see what was going on as usual the navy cared not at all for what he wanted whats the word sir he panted as he came up to lieutenant commander pottinger nothing good his superior answered one of our machines spotted a whole flight of aeroplanes with meatballs on their wings heading this way theres no jap base within a couple of thousand miles of where were at sam said the light went on in his head before pottinger needed to enlighten him weve found a japanese aeroplane carrier or two the other damagecontrol officer shook his head not quite their aeroplanes have found us but we havent found them yet heading back along their bearing would be a pretty good bet carsten said lieutenant commander pottinger nodded he was a tall lean man with a weathered face hollow cheeks a long narrow jaw and a pointed nose he looked like a new englander but had a midwestern accent i expect youre right he said this is liable to be a damn funny kind of naval battle you know were not even in sight of the enemys fleet but our aeroplanes are going to slug it out with his as if to underline his words one machine after another roared into the sky the noise of the straining engines loud even several decks below the one from which the aeroplanes were taking off longrange artillery thats what theyve turned into sam said they can hit when our battleships cant pottinger nodded again thats right battleships are probably obsolete though plenty of men will try and run you out of the navy if you say so out loud he made a disdainful noise plenty of men likely tried to run people out of the navy if they spoke up for steam engines and ironclads too i wouldnt be surprised sam had known more than a few officers who never stopped pining for the good old days something burst in the water not far from the remembrance he felt the carrier heel into the sharpest turn she could make and then a moment later into another one in the opposite direction more bombs burst around her hiram pottinger might have been talking things over back on shore for all the excitement he showed zigzags he said approvingly thats what you do against submersibles and thats what you do against aeroplanes too well yes sir carsten said thats what you do and then you hope like hell it works you get hit by a bomb that could put a little crimp in your morning he did his best to imitate his superiors nonchalance onepounders and other antiaircraft guns on the deck started banging away at the attacking aeroplanes so did the fiveinch guns in the sponsons under the flight deck the noise was terrific they could reach a lot farther than the smaller weapons but couldnt fire nearly so fast i wonder whats going on up there sam said i wonder how nasty it is its no walk in the park pottinger said i didnt figure it was sir sam said a little reproachfully hed seen plenty of nasty actionit didnt come much nastier than what hed been through in the battle of the three navies a moment later he realized pottinger if hed ever been in a battle before had probably gone through it down here maybe this was harder carsten wouldnt have believed it beforehand but it might have been true when he was fighting a gun he had some idea even if only a small one of what was going on here here it might have been happening in a distant room the only difference was what happened in that distant room might kill him later he wished he hadnt had that thought at that moment the remembrance shuddered when a bomb burst on her flight deck lieutenant commander pottinger said oh shit which summed up sams feelings perfectly then pottinger added well time for us to go to work yes sir carsten agreed that was how he got up to the flight deck in the midst of combat he wanted to be there but not under those circumstances the flight crew were already doing what they had to do manhandling steel plates across the hole the bomb had torn in the deck and doing everything they could to flatten out the torn lips of steel well done pottinger shouted we have to be able to land aeroplanes and get them in the air again yes sir sam said again his boss might be new to carrier duty but hed just proved he understood the essence of it sam went on they could have done a lot worse if theyd fused the bomb differently what do you mean lieutenant commander pottinger asked if theyd given it an armorpiercing tip and a delayed fuse it would have gone through before it blew up sam answered then wed really be in the soup urk pottinger said which again matched sams thought sam said theyre like us theyre still learning what all they can do with aeroplanes and carriers too an aeroplane with the red rising sun of japan painted on wings and fuselage roared overhead machine guns in the wings blazing the engine was even louder than the guns the fighter couldnt have been more than fifty feet above the deck bullets struck sparks from the new steel plates others smacked flesh with wet thuds men shrieked or crumpled silently streams of tracers from the remembrance s antiaircraft guns converged on the japanese machine for a dreadful moment sam thought it would get away in spite of all the gunfire but then flames and smoke licked back from the engine cowling toward the cockpit the fighter slammed into the sea scratch one fucker sam shouted exultantly a sailor next to him was down and groaning clutching his leg red spread over his trousers it hurts he groaned it hurts bad george sams exultation turned to dismay in the space of a heartbeat hed known george moerlein ever since first coming aboard the remembrance seeing him down with a nasty wound made sams stomach turn over by the way the petty officer was bleeding he needed help right away sam tore off his belt and wrapped it around moerleins thigh above the bullet wound tight as he could give me a hand over here he yelled lets get him down to sick bay sir a sailor said he helped carsten haul george moerlein up moerlein moaned and then mercifully passed out as they hauled the petty officer towards a passageway another japanese fighter strafed the remembrance bullets cracked past sam and clattered off the flight deck he breathed a sigh of relief when he had steel between him and the deadly chaos overhead as soon as he saw a sailor though he said here take over for me get this man below ive got duty topside he hurried back up to put his life on the line again though he did his best not to think of it like that off to starboard one of the american destroyers was on fire from bow to stern and sinking fast boats and men in life jackets bobbed around her even as sam watched the destroyer rolled over and went to the bottom in these waters the bottom was a long long way down sam shivered at how far down it was a bomb burst in the sea not far from the remembrance drenching carsten and most of the others on deck even so a sailor with wigwag signals guided an aeroplane to a landing maintenance men fueled it its prop started spinning again down the flight deck it rolled bumping over the hasty repairs and up into the air again didnt think we could do that sam said to lieutenant commander pottinger he must have been flying on fumes or he never would have tried coming in pottinger agreed lucky the japs have let up a little i wonder what were doing to them sam said worse than this i hope wed better be by god yes wed better be but how can we know pottinger said theyre over the horizon the only ones who have any real idea how the fights going are our pilots no sirnot even them sam said his superior raised an eyebrow he explained they dont know what the jap pilots are doing to us just like the japs cant be sure what were doing to them maybe the fellows in the wireless shacksours and theirshave the big picture maybe nobody does wouldnt that be a hell of a thing lieutenant commander pottinger laughed we wont know who won till day after tomorrow when we read it in the newspapers yeah it wasnt exactly funny but carsten laughed too as long as we live through it weve come out all right a japanese aeroplane and an american machine both splashed into the pacific within a quarter of a mile of the remembrance sam hoped somebody would live through the fight t he kansas city star was the daily published closest to leavenworth that was actually worth reading irving morrell had discovered that during his last stay in kansas now of course the wireless supplemented the paper back then wireless had only started passing from morse code to voice even now the newspaper gave him a far more detailed picture than the quick reports on the wireless could i dont think anybody knows who won this stupid battle agnes he said two days after reports about the sea fight north of the sandwich islands started coming in i really dont if you look at our claims we sank the whole jap fleet and didnt take a scratch if you look at theirs they did it to us his wife shrugged and poured him another cup of coffee my bet is both sides are lying as hard as they can my bet is youre right morrell answered i suppose well sort it out in time for mildreds children to study about it in school hearing her name made his daughter look up from her scrambled eggs study what in school she asked a big naval battle in the pacific her father said she rolled her eyes for heavens sake who cares agnes laughed if everybody felt that way we wouldnt have to fight any more wars that wouldnt be so bad would it that would be wonderful morrell said with the deep conviction of a man whod seenwhod taken part inthe worst man could do to his fellow man he gulped the scalding coffee that would be wonderful but its not going to happen any time soon no matter how much i wish it would speaking of which im off to the barrel works all right dear agnes got up too and came over to give him a kiss ill see you when you get back some more things should be out of boxes by then good morrell was convinced he could no more escape from boxes than a bug could get out of a spiderweb he wondered how many times hed moved in the course of his military career he didnt try to count them all up that way lay madness barbed wire enclosed a field in which sat the experimental barrel hed been working with ten years earlier the machine hadnt been in the field all those years it would have been a rusted useless hulk if it had even though the socialists had stopped work on new barrels for so long the army had carefully greased this one and stored it in a garage in case it was ever wanted again morrell gave the general staffnot his favorite outfitreluctant credit for that he didnt know what he would have done if hed had to start altogether from scratch sentries at the gate saluted good morning colonel they chorused morning boys morrell pointed into the field whos working on the barrel sergeant pound sir one of the sentries answered i might have known morrell opened the gate and went inside one of the sentries closed it after him as he hurried toward the barrel he called youre up early today sergeant oh hello sir sergeant michael pound was a broadshouldered muscular man with closecropped brown hair and a neat mustache showing the first silver threads the carburetor still isnt what it ought to be you know im not surprised seeing how long the whole vehicles been sitting there doing nothing morrell answered how are you going to get it clean sergeant pound held up a coffee can theres this new solvent called carbon tetrachloride it gets grease off of anything he said enthusiastically he was wild for any new invention that was what had drawn him into barrels in the first place its wonderful stuffnonflammable a really excellent cleaner only one drawback he plopped the carburetor into the can whats that morrell asked as he was surely supposed to if you use it indoors its liable to asphyxiate you pound replied some people are fools of course congressmen get excited about that sort of thing they want to ban the stuff if you ask me anyone whos dumb enough not to read the label deserves whatever happens to him he had no patience with incompetent people no doubt because he was so allaround competent himself morrell slapped him on the back its damn good to see you again sergeant to hell with me if its not thank you very much sir michael pound replied i felt i was wasting my time these past few years in the artillery of course the army would have thrown me out on my ear if id tried to stay in barrels but the men in charge of things arent exactly the smartest ones weve got are they i believe ill plead the fifth on that one morrell said laughing do you think you could do a better job of it sir im sure i could pound wasnt joking because he did so many things well he thought he could do anything sometimes he turned out to be right sometimes he was disastrously wrong occasional disasters did nothing to damage his selfconfidence how did you put up with going back to the artillery after the barrel works closed down morrell asked well for one thing sir like i said if i hadnt they would have found something else even worse for me to door they would have thrown me out altogether and that wouldnt have been good not when the collapse came pound said and besides i always thought the politicians would eventually come to their senses i just never imagined theyd take so long who did morrell said hed asked for sergeant pound by name when he came back to leavenworth the man was worth his weight in goldwhich considering his massive frame was no mean statement if he occasionally suffered delusions of omnipotence well nobody was perfect knaves fools and knaves he said now one of his favorite phrases youd better be careful morrell warned him youre starting to sound like you belong in the freedom party oh no sir i didnt say they were a pack of traitors who need to be lined up against a wall and shot pound had no trouble imitating the freedom partys impassioned rhetoric he added besides that featherston is a dangerous lunatic if he gets elected this fall hes liable to show just how dangerous he is i wish i could tell you you were wrong morrell said hes liable to prove as troublesome to us as those action francaise people are to the kaiser pound said what can you do about a government that hates you if a majority voted it into office get ready to fight morrell answered thats what were doing here how soon before we have a real barrel with specifications based on the experimental model here sergeant pound asked taking the carburetor out of the carbon tetrachloride and setting it down on a rag theyre saying six or eight months in pontiac morrell replied thats what theyre saying but ill believe it when i see it bet on a year maybe longer disgraceful pound said so much time not even frittered away thrown away for heavens sake he rubbed the carburetor with the rag then passed it to morrell this thing is better though i think its really clean now clean enough to work the way its supposed to i hope youre right morrell said put it back in the engine sergeant well gas up the beast and see if it runs right sir pound opened the louvers on the engine compartmentone improvement over great war barrels the experimental model did boast was a separate engine compartment which drastically reduced noise and noxious fumes for the crew as pound turned a wrench he went on you know we really ought to have a diesel engine in here not one fueled by gasoline a fire starts gasoline goes up like a bomb diesel fuel just burns quietly the men in the fighting compartment have a much better chance to get away thats a good idea morrell said pound was full of ideas good bad and indifferent model after next we ought to think about incorporating it he pulled a notebook from his breast pocket and scribbled a few lines so the idea wouldnt be lost why waste time sir sergeant pound asked why not put it right into the model theyre working on now that way wed have it wed have iteventually morrell answered how many plans would they have to change to put a new engine in that compartment how many dies and stamps and castings would they have to revise i dont know the exact number but its bound to be a big one we ought to do this right pound insisted we willeventually morrell used that word again right now that were doing it at all is miracle enough if you ask me just remember i was in kamloops a few weeks ago and you were an artilleryman lets get something finished and then we can set about improving it everything ought to be right the first time pound muttered not everything is thats why they put erasers on pencils morrell said or are you one of those people who fill out crossword puzzles in ink he was fond of those puzzles himself their popularity had exploded since the collapse they gave people something interesting to do and you could buy a book of them for a dime michael pound looked puzzled of course sir doesnt everybody he sounded altogether innocent was that sarcasm or did he really believe people were so generally capable morrell suspected he did like most men he judged others by his own standards and those standards were pretty high after bending to get a better look at the connection he was making he said ive got a question for you sir go ahead morrell told him where do you suppose we could be if we hadnt spent all this time lying fallow and how big a price will we pay because we did wed be a lot further along than we are now and well have to find out there arent i profound thats hardly the word id use sir michael pound replied he didnt say what word he would use which might have been just as well morrell said shall we see if this miserable thing actually runs now it had better pound said he was properly a gunner by trade but he could drive he slid down through the turretan innovation when the experimental model was new but a commonplace in barrel design nowadaysand into the drivers seat at the left front of the vehicle next to the bow machine gun when he stabbed the starter button the engine wasted no time roaring to life you see sir he said in his best itoldyouso tones i see morrell answered all right shut it down for now were not ready to go anywhere not with a twoman crew we could if we were at war pound said we could if we were but we arent so we wont morrell had to listen to himself to make sure that came out right actually we are at war but barrels wont do much against the japs now we have to revive some more of the old machines to have opponents to practice against he wished real barrels modern barrels would be so easy to face t hese days nobody around baroyeca was likely to tell anybody how to vote hipolito rodriguez hadnt been sure things would work out that way but they had the unfortunate accidents that happened to don joaquins barn and stableto say nothing of the even more unfortunate accidents that happened to don joaquins guardshad quickly persuaded the prominent men in this part of sonora not to push too hard against the freedom party you understand what it is robert quinn said at a freedom party meeting a couple of weeks after those unfortunate things happened it has been a very long time since anyone told a patron no senor you may not do this they needed a lesson now they have had one i do not think they will need any more what could we have done if they had come after us with everything they have rodriguez asked quinn looked steadily back at him it is like this the rich men around baroyeca have so much the freedom party has so much he held his hands first close together then wide apart if you put them in a fight who do you think is going to win but suppose they talked to the governor rodriguez said stubbornly suppose they said call out the state militia we have to put down these freedom party men with guns muy bien suppose they did that the freedom party organizer sounded agreeable suppose they did exactly that how many soldados in this state senor rodriguez do you suppose are freedom party men ahh rodriguez said and his voice was just one in a small delighted chorus of oohs and ahhs that filled freedom party headquarters he went on you mean they cannot trust their own soldiers did i say that quinn shook his head i did not say that would i say anything that would go against the state government of course not of course not carlos ruiz agreed in sly tones we dont want to go against the state government we want to take it over ahh hipolito rodriguez said again he found winning a national election easier to imagine than toppling the state government richmond was far away and wouldnt matter so immediately a freedom party administration in hermosillo would send shock waves rippling through sonora of course a freedom party defeat in november would send shock waves of a different sort rippling through the state quinn said remember we have to win or the lesson don joaquin learned goes for nothing he didnt say who had taught carlos ruizs patron that lesson he certainly didnt say the men whod taught that lesson had got their rifles and ammunition from him some things were better unadmitted quietly hipolito rodriguez said that lesson had better not go for nothing whether we win or lose if they push us too hard we can still fight you are a brave man a bold man quinn said you are the sort of man we want the sort of man we need in the freedom party rodriguez shrugged if a patron wants to stay a radical liberal that is all right with me i used to be a radical liberal myself i changed my mind they have no business telling me i may not change my mind i would never try to tell them any such thing yes you have reason that is how it should be ruiz said several other men nodded but robert quinn said once we win well other parties will just have to get used to that the difference between the freedom party and the other parties in the confederate states is that we have reason and they do not if they are wrong why should we let them pretend they are right they are political parties too ruiz said one of these days they will win an election i do not think so quinn said i do not think one of them will win an election for a very very long time once we take over what do you mean ruiz asked sometimes you win sometimes you lose that is how politics works not always rodriguez said how many times in a row have whigs been presidents of the confederate states every single time thats how many if the freedom party is good enough to win it will win just as many elections thats what you meant isnt it senor quinn sure it is senor rodriguez quinn said easily with a small laugh that is exactly what i meant rodriguez wondered why he laughed because he hadnt meant exactly that if he hadnt what had he meant what could he have meant rodriguez shrugged whatever it was he didnt think he needed to worry about it very much someone asked senor quinn how do we make certain the freedom party wins in sonora this november that is a good question that is a very good question now robert quinn sounded not only serious but altogether sincere we ourselves here can only make sure we win in baroyeca he waited for nods to show everyone understood that then went on we have to do a few things we have to let people know what the party will do for them once it wins we have to let them know what it will do for the country once it wins we have to show them the other parties cannot do the things they promise and that most of what they promise is not good anyway and we have to do everything we can to keep them from having the chance to tell their lies hipolito rodriguez understood all of that but the last what do you mean senor quinn he asked how do we keep them from doing that however we have to the freedom party man said bluntly however we need to don joaquin had a sad accident verdad again he waited for nods again he got them everybody here knew what kind of accident don joaquin had had nobody much felt like talking about detailsbetter safe than sorry quinn continued when they come here to make speeches and stir up their followers we do not let them we shout we heckle we make enough of a disturbance to keep them from talking to an audience if they cannot talk they cannot get their message out eh si senor several men said it together rodriguez wasnt one of them but he nodded if the freedom party got to talk and no one else did that was surely a large advantage but he held up his hand quinn pointed his way senor how do we keep them from talking on the wireless he inquired ah senor rodriguez you do ask interesting questions as always quinn was scrupulously polite he treated the men whod joined the freedom party as if they were dons most white men thought of sonorans and chihuahuans as nothing but greasers if quinn did he kept it to himself that was another reason his following grew and grew he continued we cannot stop that not altogethernot yet but it does not matter so much here in sonora because fewer places here have electricity than is true in most of the confederate states carlos ruiz clicked his tongue between his teeth that is not fair that is not right i agree with you senor ruiz quinn said it is one of the things the freedom party will fix once we have power but whether we like it or not it is true and we have to take it into account he paused and looked around the room are there any more questions no all right then this meeting is adjourned rodriguez was the first one to start out of the freedom party headquarters from across the street a shot rang out whoever held that gun didnt really know what to do with it the bullet cracked past rodriguezs head and thudded into the planking of the building behind him automatic reflex made him throw himself flat another bullet sang through the air where hed stood a moment before glass shattered chunks rained down on him he rolled back into the building blow out the lamps he cried the headquarters plunged into darkness here someone pressed a tredegar into his hands if they want to play such games he crawled up to the shotout window one of the men whod fired at him was running across the street straight toward the headquarters a lighted kerosene lantern in hand that made the fellow an even easier target than he would have been otherwise he wanted to fight fire with fire did he the rifle leaped to rodriguezs shoulder he squeezed the trigger the man with the lantern shrieked whirled and crumpled clutching his belly the lantern fell on his chest burning kerosene poured out and made him into a torch never shoot twice in a row from the same place unless the cover is very goodone more lesson rodriguez had absorbed during the great war staying low he wriggled over to the other side of the window another tredegar banged this one at the back of party headquarters no cry of anguish from outside but a triumphant yell from inside the building robert quinn shouting in english take that you fucking son of a bitch for good measure he added chinga tu madre bang bang bang somebody emptied a pistol into the headquarters as fast as he could shoot behind rodriguez a man yowled at least one of those bullets had struck home rodriguez fired at the muzzle flashes he worked the bolt fired again and then rolled away from that spot he didnt know whether hed hit the enemy but no more shooting came from that direction so he hoped he had running feet in the street these from the direction of the alcaldes house a sharp cry of vamonos came from behind freedom party headquarters rodriguez heard more running feet these running away quinns tredegar barked again the freedom party leader whooped again the high shrill cry englishspeaking confederates called the rebel yell madre de dios an officer of the guardia civil a policeman in other wordsstared at the burning corpse in the middle of the street he crossed himself not bothering to take the heavy pistol from his hand first then pulling himself together he strode up to freedom party headquarters in a loud voice he demanded what happened here i will handle this robert quinn declared to the policeman he said they tried to murder us they tried to burn down our building and roast us inside of it they wounded one of our meni do not know how badly poor carlos is hurt all we did was defend ourselves some defense the officer muttered if youd done any more defending nothing would be left of baroyeca come out here now with your hands up all of you he sounded nervous as well he might have if the freedom party men felt like fighting instead of obeying the alcalde the mayorprobably didnt have enough force to make them follow orders but quinn said we are lawabiding citizens the freedom party is the party of law and order and i told you we have a wounded man we will come out in a low voice he added hip stay behind and cover us in case this pendejo is not to be trusted si senor rodriguez whispered the other freedom party men strode past him and out into the street carlos ruiz walked unsteadily his right hand pressed tight to his left shoulder a couple of more men from the guardia civil came up they spoke with quinn and the rest of the freedom party men in low voices then led them away nobody made any move to shoot anyone not now hipolito rodriguez set down his tredegar as quietly as he could he crawled to the back door and left no one waited for him thereno one living anyhow two bodies lay in the alley behind the headquarters magdalena wouldnt be happy with him he was happy just to be breathing he expected he could deal with his wife she argued much less than a bullet e arly summer in nashville made a good practice ground for hell of course that was true through most of the confederate states jake featherston had brought the freedom party nominating convention to the capital of tennessee for a couple of reasons moving it off the atlantic coast reminded people the party was a national outfit and looking just a little north into stolen kentucky reminded them what was at stake flash bulbs popped when jake got off the train from richmond purple and iridescent green spots danced before his eyes supporters on the platform shouted freedom freedom freedom others called his name again and again feather ston feather ston feather ston the two cries merged and blended in his ears together they felt sweeter than wine stronger than whiskey despite those spots before his eyes he waved to the crowd despite those shouts his bodyguards formed up around him protecting his flesh with their own one bastard with a rifle had gunned down a confederate president and sent the freedom party on a tenyear journey through hell another one now could wreck things again if they put willy knight in the top spot instead of number two could the party win in november probably jake thought this year probably but it wouldnt be the same he was sure of that willy knight had a handsome face and handled himself pretty well on the stump jake jake had plans maybe just maybe knight had plans too maybe just maybe those plans involved a heros funeral for jake featherston that was another reason the bodyguards in their almostconfederate uniforms didnt leave an assassin a clear shot what will you do if youre elected mr featherston a reporter shouted through the din put this country back on its feet jake answered as he had so many times before settle accounts with everybody whos done us wrong who would that be the eager beaver asked you know who you know what we stand for traitors better run for the hills niggers better behave themselves the confederate states have been too soft for too long we wont be soft any more would you the reporter never got to finish the question the phalanx of guards with featherston at its core pushed off the platform and through the station towards a waiting limousine freedom party men and women waving confederate and party flags surrounded them hands reaching between the bodyguards to touch jake if only for an instant he shook some of them when he squeezed one womans soft plump fingers she moaned as if she were coming right where she stood he almost laughed out loud hed seen that before and heard it too the limousine took him to the heritage hotel the lobby was full of painted scenes of confederate victory in the war of secession and the second mexican war a plaque said they came from the brush of gilbert gaul there were no scenes from the great war perhaps because gaul died in but more likely because there were no victories to record the hermitage hotel had come through the war without much damage most of nashville hadnt been so lucky when custers first army seized it from the confederate defenders in the memorial auditorium across the street from the hotel was a postwar building what ever had stood there before wasnt standing when the damnyankees grudgingly gave the land south of the cumberland back to the csa in exchange for the bit of kentucky they hadnt overrun jake reluctantly acknowledged that that was smartwith all of kentucky in us hands no confederate senators and representatives from the rump of the state could fulminate in congress about how it needed to be redeemed his suite looked out at the memorial auditorium confederate flags and freedom party banners flew above it inside delegates would be going through the motions of a political convention going through the motions was all theyd be doing unlike whig and radical liberal conventions this one was sewn up tight as a drum and i know who did the sewing featherston peered into a mirror with a gilt frame of rococo extravagance his lean leathery features suddenly lit up in a grin me he said aloud and pointed at his own reflection hed just fixed himself a drink when someone knocked on the door he had guards in the hallway they wouldnt let anyone dangerous past he opened the door without hesitation there stood ferdinand koenig whod come west from richmond with him come on in ferd he said willy here yet koenig asked as he stepped into the suite featherston shook his head but then another door down the hall opened out stepped knight dapper in a gray pinstriped suit with swordsharp lapels he waved and walked down the hall toward the two longtime freedom party men pat him down boss one of the guards asked out of the side of his mouth no its all right jake whispered back nothing to worry about the guard looked dubious so did koenig they both played it jakes way though everybody plays it my way from now on he thought and smiled everybody maybe willy knight thought the smile was meant for him he grinned back and stuck out his hand jake took it the clasp turned into a quiet trial of strength knight was a little taller and a lot wider through the shoulders but featherstons rawboned frame carried more muscle than it seemed to when the two men let go knight was the one who opened and closed his hand several times to ease the pain and bring it back to life come on in jake said genially have a drink dont have to ask me twice in spite of the hand that was surely throbbing willy knight managed another grin you barely have to ask me once they all went into jakes hotel room he closed the door behind them the guards looked even less happy he still wasnt worried knight wouldnt plug him himself that wouldnt just take jake off the ticketit would take him off too he didnt want that he wanted to be number one but hed settle for number two jake made himself another drink ferdinand koenig and willy knight fixed whiskeys for themselves too he raised his glass in salute first to knight then to koenig mr vice president he said mr attorney general mr president the other two men said together all three drank its going our way featherston said weve got what it takes and the country finally knows it what we have to do now is make sure the rad libs and especially the whigs are whipped dogs long before november rolls around i like whats happening down in sonorasomebody hits you in the cheek hit him back so goddamn hard you knock his head off koenig chuckled thats not quite what jesus said yeah and look what happened to him jake answered maybe we dont want to come on too strong willy knight said weve spent the last ten years trying to live down that grady calkins son of a bitch but now weve done it featherston said i want people to knowtheyll be sorry if they even think about going the wrong way we backed down ten years ago we had to we dont have to any more were going to win in november you can take it to the bank but even if we dont by god were going into richmond anyways knights bright blue eyes widened thats treason he said and finished his drink with a gulp its only treason if you dont bring it off jake said calmly if we have to grab it well win were getting things ready all nice and quietlike like i told you i dont reckon well need it wed better not willy knight said still jolted christ youre talking civil war jeff davis wasnt afraid of it we shouldnt be either jake answered i keep telling you and telling you this is just in case youve got to cover everybody who can carry the ball and thats what i intend to do he almost hoped he would have to try to seize power by force storming the war department would be as sweet as marching into philadelphia would have been during the great war once were in however were in well make everything legal koenig said if youre in you make the rules and thats just what well do knight managed a sheepish smile as if realizing hed shown weakness you dont think small do you jake never have never will featherston replied as long as you can imagine something you can make it real thats what the freedom partys all about we know the confederate states can be great again we know we can pay back all the bastards who held us while the damnyankees suckerpunched us we can do it and were gonna do it right right willy knight said jake was watching him he seemed as hearty as he should have maybe hed just had cold feet for a moment featherston shrugged how much did it really matter as vice president all willyd do was make speeches and jake intended to make sure of what was in them before they came out of the handsome puppets mouth knight still hadnt figured out hed been condemned to oblivion that only proved he wasnt so smart as he thought he was jake and ferdinand koenig looked at each other koenig nodded ever so slightly the more hed thought about it the more hed liked escaping the worthless numbertwo slot and being promised one where he could actually do things featherston had plans for the attorney generals office once im elected three days later he took another step toward the gray house in richmond when he strode up onto the speakers platform at the memorial auditorium to accept the freedom party nomination the roar from the assembled delegates left his ears as stunned and battered as any artillery barrage ever had the klieg lights blazing on him put the sun to shame a thicket of microphones in front of him amplified his voice for the delegates for people listening on the wireless web and for the newsreels that would soon show his image all over the confederate states hello friends jake said to all the millions who would see and listen to him you know me you know what i stand for ive been up here in front of you before im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth the freedom party men bellowed featherston nodded thats right im here to tell you the truth ive been doing that for a long time now i think youre finally ready to listen the truth is this country needs to put peoplewhite people decent peopleback to work and we will the truth is this country needs to put the niggers who stabbed us in the back in their place and we will the truth is kentucky and sequoyah and that joke the usa calls houston still belong to the confederate states we ought to get em backand we will he had to stop then the applause was too loud and too long to let him continue when at last it ebbed he went on the truth is the whigs have had seventy years to run this country and theyve run it into the ground somebody else needs to do it and do it right and we will another great roar he held up his hands silence fell completely and at once into it he said if you like the way things have gone the past few years vote whig but if you want to tell those people what you really think of em vote freedom that cry outdid all that had gone before and then the delegates began to chant feather ston feather ston feather ston jake stood tall on the platform waving to the crowd waving to the country glorying in what he had and reaching out for what he wanted b ouncing around south carolina from charleston to columbia to greenville and to the smaller towns in between anne colleton felt more than a little like a tabletennis ball when she got out of her birmingham in st matthews her brother greeted her with hello didnt i know you once upon a time funny tom she answered meaning anything but very funny for gods sake fix me a drink her own flat looked unfamiliar to her maybe her brother hadnt been joking after all he mixed whiskey and a little water for her and plopped in a couple of ice cubes after hed made himself a drink too he said well youve got jake featherston and it looks like hes going to win are you happy you bet i am she would have said more but a long pull at the whiskey came first thank you thats a lifesaver i ought to go places with a little cask around my neck like those st bernard dogs in the alps tom colleton said id be glad to see you thats for sure anne took another sip yes im happy ive waited for this day ever since the end of the war even though i didnt know what i was waiting for at first you walked away from featherston once tom said i made a mistake anne said arent you glad you never made a mistake in all your born days now that you mention it yes tom was irrepressible anne snorted her brother went on ill tell you one mistake i didnt make once i got out of politics i didnt get back in you wouldnt have talked that way before you got married anne said it made you soft was what she meant to anyone else she would have said that said it without a moments hesitation with tom she hesitated he understood what she meant whether she said it or not with a shrug he answered maybe you wouldnt talk the way you talk if you had nothing to cure the fire in your belly like a little boy maybe anne said tonelessly some small part of her wished she had settled down with roger kimball or clarence potter or that texas oil man or one of her other lovers a husband a child to carry on after her those werent the worst things in the world but they werent for her and never would be im on my own tom too late to change it now her brother eyed her and heaven help anybody who gets in your way he said anne nodded of course what happens if featherston decides youre in his way she wished he hadnt asked that particular question for a long time shed been a big fish in the small pond of south carolina politics and not the smallest fish in the much bigger pond of confederate politics going from the whigs to the freedom party back to the whigs and now back to freedom had cut her influence down to size so had getting older as she was all too ruefully aware what if jake featherston decided she was in the way what if president jake featherston decided she was in the way she saw only one answer and gave it to her brother in that case id better move dont you think you say that you tom looked and sounded as if he couldnt believe his ears you dont move for anybody if its a question of move or get squashed ill move anne said and jake has more clout than i do jake has more clout than anybody does she spoke with a certain somber pride she might have been saying yeah i got licked but the fellow who licked me was the toughest one of the bunch she shook her head might have no she was saying exactly that tom shook his head too in wonder whats going to happen to the country if a fellow who can make you pull in your horns starts running things well all go in the same direction and itll be the right direction anne said weve owed a lot of debts for a long time dont you want to pay them back i know i do well yes but not if i have to go bust to do it we wont anne said positively hell do what needs doing instead of fumbling around the way burton mitchel has ever since things went sour maybe i hope so her brother said hell ill probably even vote for him myself but thats all i intend to do you can go running around the state if you want to me ill stay home and tend my garden had he read candide she doubted it she couldnt imagine a book that seemed less her brothers cup of tea she said the whole confederacy is my garden youre welcome to it tom replied its too big for me to get my arms around south carolinas too big i think even st matthews is too big but i can try that my wife and my little baby boy now that i understand just fine hed gone into the war a captain and a boy himself hed come out a lieutenantcolonel and a man now he was a family man but that seemed a pullingin not a growingout it made anne sad youve got a lot of time left she said i hope you do anyway you can do whatever you want with it what im going to do with mine is im going to put this country back on its feet i hope so tom got up and kissed her on the cheek what im going to do is im going home to my family take care of yourself sis i worry about you he went out the door taking her chance for the last word with him im going home to my family ever since theyd lost their parents when they were small shed been his family she and their brother jacob who was dead he didnt think that way any more he didnt care about the country any more either anne made herself another whiskey tom might have his wife and a little boy she had a cause and a cause on its way to victory she slept in her own bed that night she couldnt remember the last time shed slept there it had been weeks she knew her own mattress felt as unfamiliar as any of the hotel beds where shed lain down lately when morning came she was on her way again driving down to charleston featherston was coming into town in a couple of days for a rally that should finish sewing up south carolina for the freedom party she hurled herself into the work of making sure everything went off the way it was supposed to things were more complicated than they had been when she first started planning rallies making sure the wireless web and the newsreels were taken care of kept her busy up until an hour and a half before featherstons speech began saul goldman did a lot of work with themmore than she did in fact she wondered if the head of the freedom party knew just what a smart little jew he had running that part of his operation hello there featherston said coming up behind her as she peered out from the wings to make sure the lighting arrangements were the way she wanted them she jumped she wasnt the sort of person who jumped when someone came up behind her but jake featherston wasnt the ordinary sort of person coming up behind her oh hello she hated herself for how callow she sounded no one had any business making her feel so unsure so weak was the only word that seemed to fit no one had any business doing it but jake did he eyed the hall with the knowing gaze of a man whod given speeches in a lot of different places good to have you back in the party he said his attention returning to her i wasnt even close to sure it would be in spite of the pretty speeches you made me but it is youve given me a lot of help here and i do appreciate it happy to do anything i can anne said a great thumping lie she knew she was doing things for featherston doing them as a subordinate she wasnt used to being a subordinate wasnt used to it and despised it once she and roger kimball had thought they would guide jake featherston to power and then enjoy it themselves with him in the role of puppet the only small consolation she had was that they werent the only ones whod underestimated him at one time or another almost everybody in the csa had underestimated featherston he said theres a lot of people i owe and im going to pay every single one of them back but you you owe meyou owe me plenty for walking out on me when i really needed a hand he hadnt forgotten he never forgot a slight no matter how small anne knew as much and hers hadnt been small not at all she said i know im trying to pay you back her gesture encompassed the hall where hed speak the answer seemed to catch him by surprise slowly thoughtfully he nodded well youre doing better than a lot of folks i can think of he said good anne didnt like the way he looked at her hed been an artilleryman during the war not a sniper but he eyed her as she thought a sniper would all cold deadly concentration she was used to intimidating not being intimidated being on the receiving end of a glance like that chilled her but featherston sounded warm and lively when he went into his speech i never had a fancy name he declared i was only one more confederate soldier with a stamped tin identity disk around my neck but every great idea draws men to it every idea steps out before the nation it has to win from the nation the fighters it needs so one day its strong enough to turn the course of destiny our day is here the hall erupted anne found herself clapping as hard as anyone else in the building when she listened to jake on the stump she always believed what he said while he was saying it she might not believe it later when she thought about it but at the time she shivered though she also went on clapping she hadnt met many people who frightened her he did he thundered on lots of people in the confederate states think the freedom party cant do the job if we get in theyre fooling themselves today our movement cant be destroyed its here people have to reckon with it whether they like it or not we recognize three principlesresponsibility command and obedience weve built a partya party of millions mindbased on one thing achievement and if you dont like it we say well fight today well fight tomorrow and if you dont fancy our rally today well hold another one next week even bigger he slammed his fist down on the podium more applause interrupted him anne looked down at her carefully tended carefully manicured hands her palms were red and sore shed broken a nail without even noticing im not just here to ask you for your vote or to ask you to do this or that for the party featherston said im here to tell you the truth and what i aim to do what ive got to give is the only thing that can pull our country back on its feet again if all you confederates had the same faith in your country that our freedom party stalwarts do we wouldnt be in the mess were in we will pull ourselves together were on the way and i know youll help im already helping anne thought proudly not being in charge didnt bother her so much any morenot as long as she was listening to jake anyhow americanempire thecentercannothold xix i n an odd way colonel abner dowling was glad to have something to worry about that didnt involve keeping the mormons in salt lake city from erupting the desultory war with japan hadnt done the job hed wanted to go fight and the war department hadnt let him that brought nothing but frustration looking with alarm at events south of the border though did a fine job of distracting him he rounded on his adjutant one morning growling what the devil are we going to do if that featherston maniac really does get elected in the csa come november i dont know sir captain toricelli answered what can we do if he wins the election we cant very well tell the confederates to go back and vote again no but i wish we could dowling said that man is nothing but trouble waiting to happen he wants another go at us he hardly even bothers hiding it any more i dont see how we can stop a politician from making speeches sir angelo toricelli said if he gets to be president and then starts building up the cs army and violating the terms of the armistice the confederates signed we can do something about him till then he shrugged but will president hoover do anything dowling said he certainly hasnt done much since he landed in powel house six months ago toricelli gave him a sly smile would you rather we still had president blackford good god no dowling exclaimed hed always been a solid democrat but i would like to see hoover doing a little more if things are any better than they were when blackford went home to dakota i havent seen it it wont happen overnight sir his adjutant was a democrat too most officers were obviously dowling said i do wish it would show some signs of happening at all though the whole world has troubles toricelli said and dowling nodded for that was obviously true utah probably has more troubles than the rest of the world abner dowling corrected himself utah certainly has worse troubles than the rest of the world maybe thats why were not seeing things looking better here he spoke as if trying to convince himself hoping he could convince himself but he remained incompletely convinced he said if more people here had jobs we wouldnt need to worry quite so much about this place going up in smoke yes sir captain toricelli agreed his adjutant was nothing if not polite but toricelli was also stubborn he went on if you know how to arrange that sir you should have run for president last year general custer had always claimed hed had a shot at the presidency in there were any number of ways in which dowling didnt want to imitate the officer under whom hed served for so long he couldnt imagine any job he wanted less than that of the president especially in these thankless times and yet he snapped his fingers you know captain we could put a lot of people to work if we cleared temple square of the rubble thats been sitting there for almost twenty years now toricelli frowned yes sir we could but isnt the point of keeping the rubble there to remind the mormons we gave them a licking theres not going to be a new temple in salt lake city any more than theres going to be one in jerusalem dowling muttered under his breath not only was captain toricelli polite and stubborn he was also smart but dowling still liked the idea or part of it all right suppose we cordon off the part of the square that held the temple and get rid of the rest of the rubbish he said the tabernacle and the other buildings werent holy ground he waited wondering what his adjutant would make of that toricelli spent close to a minute thinking it over then he said shall i draft a telegram for you to send to the war department yes captain if youd be so kind dowling beamed he suspected captain toricelli made a tougher audience than any hed face back in philadelphia the wire went out two days later the afternoon it did dowling got a wire from the war department winning hearts and minds in utah desirable your idea forwarded to secretary of war for approval the printed signature on the sheet of yellow paper belonged to lieutenant general sam sturgis chief of the general staff he heard from the secretary of war the next day president hoover personally controls all decisions on utah the wire said i have passed this proposal to him recommending approval which is expected dowling understood that this cabinet official a distant relative of the last democratic president before hoover remained in the service of his country despite being confined to a wheelchair by some rare debilitating disease though captain toricelli already knew what was in the telegram dowling set it on his desk anyhow if the chief of the general staff says yes and if the secretary of war says yes how can the president say no he exulted i dont know sir his adjutant replied i hope we dont find out but they did the very next day the telephone in dowlings office rang he picked it up abner dowling speaking colonel dowling this is herbert hoover and it was dowling had heard his voice on the wireless and in newsreels too many times to have any doubt he stiffened to attention in his chair its a privilege to speak with you sir maybe you wont think so when im done the president said your proposal for makework for the people of utah is not to go forward do you understand me it is not to go forward dowling repeated i hear you and i will obey of course but i have to say i do not understand we have had too much of socialiststyle individualismsapping false nostrums the past twelve years hoover said paternalism and state socialism have done a great deal of harm to the country they stifle initiative they cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of the people and i will not have them under my administration well thats that dowling thought but he couldnt help asking sir dont you think utah is a special case every case has partisans who insist it is special hoover answered i recognize none of them i believe none of them the same principles must apply throughout the united states quickly dowling said i meant no harm mr president hed never heard hoover sound so vehement not in any of his speeches he hadnt imagined the new president could sound so vehement i believe you colonel i am not angry at you president hoover said which made dowling feel a littlethough only a littlebetter hoover went on im sure the socialists meant no harm either but you know which road is paved with good intentions yes sir dowling said all right then the president said well say no more about it but my decision is final i do not want this issue raised again yes sir dowling repeated good hoover hung up dowling emerged from his office feeling like a man whod survived a bomb going off much too close thanks to the confederates during the war and that damned canuck afterwards he knew more about bombs going off too close than hed ever wanted to learn what he felt must not have shown on his face though for captain toricelli said i heard you talking to the president sir may we go ahead his voice said he was confident of the answer well abner dowling had been confident of the answer too much good his confidence had done him he shook his head his jowls wobbled back and forth no captain in fact were ordered not to go ahead and so we wont toricelli gaped but why sir the president feels the scheme smacks of socialism he says weve had enough government programs trying to get us over the hump and he doesnt want another one but his adjutant said again hes the president what he says goes dowling said and he and coolidge did campaign against government interference and they did get elected if i look at it that way maybe im not so surprised but toricelli said once more after a moment he gathered himself and managed something else were not competing against any private firm clearing temple square there is no private firm clearing temple square if you care to call powel house captain go right ahead dowling said as for me im sure i know what the president wants done and what he doesnt and he doesnt want us giving the mormons even a dime to haul rocks out of temple square a few days ago we were saying he didnt seem to want to do much of anything his adjutant observed dont you think this goes too far though what i think is hes the president of the united states if you set my opinion next to his i know whose comes out on top weve been ordered not to proceed that being so we wont proceed i cant argue with you there sir toricelli said good dowling said im glad for your sake im glad its a free country you can disagree with the president nobody will say a word but when he gives an order we follow it of course sir captain toricelli replied as any officer in the army would have done a few days later dowling received heber young in his office young a handsome man in his early thirties was a grandson of brigham young given the number of wives and children brigham had had that was hardly a unique distinction in utah these days this particular young came as close to being an official leader as the mormons had since under martial law the church of jesus christ of latterday saints was proscribed he couldnt be very official but he wasnt exactly unofficial either what can i do for you mr young dowling asked after greetings that were what diplomats called correct polite and chilly people here need work colonel heber young replied people all over the country need work sir dowling said will you tell me the problem is not worse here young asked if it is whose fault is that dowling said i was with general pershing when a mormon fanatic murdered hima mormon fanatic weve never caught for other mormon fanatics have sheltered him for all the years since i dont know how you can say that colonel when the us government insists again and again that there is no such thing as the mormon church in utah these days young spoke with surprisingly mild irony it was still enough to raise a flush on dowlings plump cheeks funny mr young very funny come to the point if youd be so kind all right i will young looked serious to the point of solemnity we could usewe desperately needa publicworks program to give men jobs help them support their families and most important of all give them hope dowling sighed as it happens i have discussed that very notion with president hoover in the past few days he opposes such programs not only here but anywhere in the usa dont expect them dont hope for them you will be disappointed heber young proved he could quote the old testament as well as the book of mormon murmuring mene mene tekel upharsin thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting as god said to belshazzar so i say to hoover and he walked out of abner dowlings office without a backward glance s cipio hadnt got so dressed up since his days as anne colletons butler the huntsmans lodge was as fine a restaurant as augusta boasted and expected its waiters to look the part it paid no better than any other restaurant and worse than some it expected the men who served food to make most of their money from tips the customers tipped no better there than anywhere else one reason theyd got rich enough to afford to eat at the huntsmans lodge was their reluctance to part unnecessarily with even a penny walking to the restaurant in boiled shirt black tie and tails was torture for scipio in the sodden heat of late august if he hadnt needed work of any sort so badly but he did and he was glad to have any at all so many men in augusta negro and white didnt walking to the huntsmans lodge in formal attire was or could be torture in more ways than one it exposed him to the wit such as that was of the white citizens of augusta he could usually see trouble coming before it struck that did him no good what ever of course looky what we got here a fellow in straw hat and bib overalls whooped pointing at scipio we got us a nigger all tricked out like a penguin aint that somethin other whites coming down marbury street smiled one or two laughed three or four stopped to see what would happen next scipio hoped nothing would happen next sometimes one joke was enough to get the meanness out of a white mans system smiling what was probably a sickly smile scipio tried to walk on by as he came closer to the man in overalls he saw a freedom party pin glittering on one overalls strap his heart sank that was likely to mean worse trouble than he would have got from somebody else and sure as hell the white man stepped into his path and said what the hells a nigger doin dressed up like hes king shit when scipio tried to walk around him the man blocked his way again he had to answer he did as meekly as he could is a waiter suh i gots to wear dis gitup he should have knownhe had knownnothing he said would do him any good scowling the white man demanded how come you got a job when i aint god damn you wheres the justice in that scipio tried to escape with a shrug it didnt work the man shouted answer me you goddamn motherfucking son of a bitch because i have a brain and you havent because my mouth isnt hooked up to the toilet because ive had more baths this week than you have this year if scipio said any of that he was a dead man he looked down at the sidewalk the picture of a submissive negro softly he said suh i been waitin table forty year now is right good at it what are you good at besides causing trouble not much ill bet one more thing he dared not say you know how many white folks is hungry and youre marchin off to work in your goddamn fancy penguin suit the man in overalls snarled i ought to kick your black ass around the block a few times teach you respect for your betters he drew back his foot as if to do just that all scipio could do was take it or try to run he intended to runhe didnt want his outfit damaged getting it repaired or worse having to buy a new one would cost him money he didnt have but then one of the other white men said hell let him go aint his fault he has to dress up like a damn fool to go to work thank you suh scipio whispered i thanks you from de bottom of my heart the white man with the freedom party pin glanced around at the little crowd most people nodded at what the other fellow had said scowling the freedom party man said all right all right for now goddammit but when jake featherston gets elected well put every damn nigger in his place not just the ones in the fancy suits he strutted down the street as if he were a mover and shaker not a man with no more than a fiftyfifty chance of being able to write his own name thank you scipio said once more i didnt do it for you said the man whod urged he be left alone i did it on account of i purely cant stand the freedom party he laughed bitterly and i wonder how long ill be allowed to say that in public if featherston does win somebodys not blind anyhow scipio thought as he hurried up the street toward the huntsmans lodge but if featherston wins this fellow can change his mind he can say he was for the freedom party all along and hell get on fine im black i didnt choose that and i cant change it as far as he could see he had no choices at all if the freedom party won getting to the restaurant was a relief for one thing he did make it on time if he got in trouble for any reason he could be back pounding the pavement looking for work he knew that all too wellhow could he help knowing for another the rhythms and rituals of work kept him too busy to worry much he was obsequious to the prosperous white men and their sleek female companions who dined at the lodge but that bothered him much less than having to be obsequious to whites on the street a white waiter in new york city would act subservient on the job acting subservient was part of a waiters jobwhich went a long way towards explaining why there were so few white waiters in the confederate states where whites thought subservience the province of blacks alone but that waiter in new york city became his customers equal as soon as he left his job scipio didnt and never would a portly middleaged man eating pheasant looked up from his meal and said dont i know you from somewhere with a small thrill of horror scipio realized the man had danced attendance upon anne colleton at marshlands before the war had his own past come back to haunt him after all these years he shook his head and put on his thickest accent to answer ah don reckon so suh the customer shrugged you must be right the boy i knew spoke better than i do myself boy even then scipio had been in his thirties whites in the csa refused to take negroes seriously he supposed that was why the red uprising during the war had got as far as it had not even clever whites like miss anne had imagined negroes could conceive of grievances serious enough to make them take up arms for redress all that went through his head in a flash to reassure the white manhe was tony somebody and anne colleton had thought him a pompous asshe said ah talks lahk i talks suh dis heah de onliest way ah knows how he wondered if he could speak like an educated white man any more or would that dialect of english have disappeared from his tongue like a foreign language seldom used all right never mind the customer said and went back to his pheasant when he walked out he left a fiftycent tip as if to apologize for bothering scipio noblesse oblige scipio thought and made the silver coin disappear these days there were men desperate enough to kill for half a dollar it was after ten when the huntsmans lodge closed scipio worried less about being on the street in black tie and tails than he had during the day fewer whites would be out there to see him than during the dayand with augustas bad street lighting whoever was there wouldnt be able to get that good a look at him anyhow but as soon as he opened the door he closed it again in a hurry and ducked back into the restaurant whats the matter with you xerxes demanded his manager a skinny energetic young white man named jerry dover go on home get the hell out of here marse jerry i reckons i waits a while scipio answered dem freedom party white folkshe almost said buckra but caught himself before using that word in front of a whiteis marchin down de street dont want them seein me you dont mind too much he had no idea what dovers politics were talking politics with a white man could only be futile and dangerous but whatever else dover might have been he was no fool the other three colored waiters in the place showed no eagerness to leave all right the manager said dont worry about it stay as long as you need to sooner or later those folks out therell be done and then yall can go on about your business but staring out through the small panes of glass set into the door of the huntsmans lodge at eye level scipio wondered if jerry dover knew what he was talking about block after wellorganized block of men and womenmostly menparaded past on marbury street some carried confederate flags some carried freedom party flags some carried torches to make the rest easier to see and the gathering as a whole more impressive a lot of the men marched in step most of the ones who did wore the white shirts and butternut trousers of freedom party stalwarts some few of the disciplined marchers though were in what was almost but not quite confederate uniform they carried tredegars whose bayonets gleamed bloody in the torchlight feather ston feather ston feather ston the endless chant came close to making scipio long for the old cry of freedom that had been a frustrated shout the cry of men who didnt fully understand what they wanted or how to go about getting it this this promised trouble right around the corner and said just what kind of trouble it was too and the parade went on and on and on scipio wouldnt have believed that augusta held so many people let alone that it held so many freedom party backers jake featherston wasnt in town neither was willy knight these people had nothing special to lure them out of their houses but they came maybe that was the scariest thing of all at last after half an hour the procession ended jerry dover hadnt gone outside either he had pushed scipio and the other blacks out of the way a few times to look at things for himself well well well he said when it was over and the raucous cries of featherston at last ebbed away i always wondered but now i know those bastards really are crazy scipio and the other waiters exchanged glances dover didnt need to say that what white man in the csa needed to make negroes like him the question was so ridiculous it might not even have occurred to scipio without the goad of something as massive as the freedom party procession the sheer scope of it got through to dover too he spoke again crazy or not though theres a hell of a lot of em aint there dont see how theyre going to lose the election wish to god i did he made pushing motions at the waiters theyre gone you can disappear too searchlights blazed from allen park not far off to the west with the door open the rhythmic shouting of jake featherstons name grew louder and more frightening scipio scuttled back toward the terry a black dust mote adrift on that dreadful sea of sound j efferson pinkard came to the freedom party meeting in his jailers uniform no time to go back to his apartment and put on the usual white shirt and butternut trousers not if he wanted to be sure of having a place to sit down when he got to the old livery stable party meetings had never been so crowded he saw faces he hadnt seen for years and he saw plenty of faces hed never seen beforemore at every meeting it seemed now people want to hop on the trainwhen it looks like its just about to get to the station he thought eyeing with no small scorn the strangers who suddenly called themselves freedom party men hed been with the party train every inch of the way through ups and downs and derailments hell hed been at the alabama state fairgrounds out at the west end of town when grady calkins murdered president hampton he hadnt given up even then even when things looked blackest he sent the johnnycomelatelies another sour stare would they have stuck with jake featherston when the going got rough not likely not most of them they were here because they wanted to ride a winners coattails not because they believed you could use people like that but could you ever really trust them he had his doubts caleb briggs strode briskly up onto the rostrum he had a microphone up there these days to help his gasruined voice fill the meeting hall despite the buzz from the big crowd in the row behind pinkard a man whod been in the party for a while explained to a couple of new fish who briggs was jeff muttered something incredulous under his breath didnt they know anything evidently not behind the dentist who headed up the freedom party in birmingham stood confederate and party flags he crisply saluted each of them in turn then stepped up to that microphone and said freedom freedom the roar from the crowd made pinkards head spin the new party men were good for something anyhowthey had big mouths briggs smile showed white teeth good to see yall here he rasped old friends and new a few of the longtime freedom party men jeff among them laughed softly caleb knew what was what same as anybody else whod seen the light a while ago smiling still briggs went on a month to go boys and then we get to the promised land weve been in the wilderness a long time now but were almost there pinkard whooped freedom he shouted as if he were a negro responding to a preachers sermon he wasnt the only one either far from it but when briggs held up a hand silence fell just like that by god the freedom party had discipline the one thing weve got to do now he said and paused to draw more air into his ravaged lungs is make sure we dont stumble and fall weve come too far for that this time we win more shouts of freedom rang out so did a chorus of feather ston pinkard tried to imagine waking up the morning after election day and finding out jake featherston had lost again he didnt think the party could survive it he wasnt sure he could weve got to make sure we win briggs went on weve been doing plenty but weve got to do more just for instance hugo black is coming to town saturday a low murmur ran through the crowd the whig vicepresidential candidate was good on the stumpnot so good as featherston or willy knight not as far as pinkard was concerned but still a formidable speaker caleb briggs grinned a sly conspiratorial grin im sure well give him a nice warm birmingham welcome when he pays us a call he waited for the grins and sniggers to stop then held up a hand it may not be so easy the whigs arent ashamed to steal our tricks theyll have their own tough boys at blacks rally you can bet on that well lick em jeff roared before anybody else could somebody behind him clapped him on the back wed better lick em briggs said we need to make damn sure we do i want a show of hands for volunteers every man in the place raised his hand some men held up both hands at once to look more prominent pinkard thought about doing that but didnt one hand was plenty he didnt need to show off up on the platform caleb briggs grinned i knew i could count on you be here saturday at half past twelve blacks speaking at two he reckons he is anyways half past twelve was a good time to gather the men who still worked saturday mornings would have time to put in their half days a lot of businesses had cut back to five days a week men who worked for them wouldnt have any problems showing up either and of course the men who were out of work could come whenever the party needed them as long as they could scrape up trolley fare jeff was scheduled to work all day that saturday he traded shifts with another jailer a man who despised politics of all sorts almost as much as he despised prisoners of all sorts he got to freedom party headquarters fifteen minutes early his shirt was so white it gleamed like polished marble his pants were the exact color of the uniform hed worn during the war hed put on a pair of steeltoed shoes he hadnt worn since leaving the sloss works they werent a required part of a stalwarts outfit but they let him kick like a mule across the street from the headquarters a couple of whigs were arguing with a grayclad policeman theyre preparing for a riot in there one of them said loudly youve got to do something to stop them the cop shrugged broad shoulders i cant arrest anybody till he commits a crime he said its still a free country you know as the whigs started to expostulate he smiled and sank his barb freedom they jerked as if stung the loud one cried why you miserable stinking shut up buddy or ill run you in the policeman set a hand on his nightstick i thought you couldnt arrest anyone till he committed a crime disturbing the peace is a crime what do you think the freedom partys going to do the whig demanded thats a political demonstration thats different into the old livery stable pinkard went when he came out again a stout bludgeon in his hand the whigs were still yelling at the cop they withdrewhell they ran for their livesas soon as the freedom party started coming out jeers chased them down the street the day grady calkins killed wade hampton v tredegarcarrying state militiamen had held the stalwarts away from the president of the csa nobody had called out the militia this timeso caleb briggs insisted back in the early s people had thought they could suppress the freedom party the governor of alabama wouldnt dare try it now the legislature might not impeach him convict him and throw him out on his ear if he did on the other hand it might down the street toward the park marched the freedom party stalwarts several hundred strong people on the sidewalk either cheered or had the sense to keep their mouths shut people in autos drove away in a hurry the ones who didnt got their windscreens and windows smashed pinkard supposed if the whigs had been ruthless enough they could have sent cars smashing through the ranks of freedom party men featherstons followers would have done it to the whigs in a minute if they thought it would help the whigs didnt try it jeff was up in the fifth or sixth row of marchers the leaders let out whoops when they turned the last corner and saw ingram park near city hall dead ahead shouts followed the whoops a heartbeat later as the whig stalwarts charged them the whigs aimed to fight in the narrow confines of the street and not let the freedom party men into the park at all that probably means we have got more men than they do jeff thought then the first whig swung a club at him and he stopped thinking he blocked the blow and aimed one of his own at the whigs head they stood there smashing at each other for a few seconds then someone tripped the whig jeff hit him in the face with his bludgeon kicked him in the ribs with those steeltoed shoes and strode forward looking for a new foe he and another man in white shirt and butternut trousers teamed up on a whig they both stomped the fellow once he was down shouting freedom they pressed forward shoulder to shoulder freedom jeff yelled again featherston and freedom longstreet the whigs yelled back longstreet and liberty samuel longstreet a grandson of the famous james was a senator from virginia he wasnt bad on the stump either longstreet and black a rash whig shouted that gave the freedom party men an opening longstreet the niggerlover they yelled and pushed forward harder than ever pinkards left arm ached where a club had got home another one had laid his forehead open above his left eyebrow he kept shaking his head like a restive horse trying to keep the blood out of his eyes step by bitter step the freedom party men forced the whigs back toward the end of the street if they broke out into the crowd theyd win the day rampaging through the crowd and wrecking hugo blacks rally a pistol barked jeff saw the muzzle flash rather than hearing the report that was lost in the din of battle the freedom party man next to him grunted and clutched his belly and folded up like a concertina as soon as the first shot was fired pistols came out on both sides freedom party men and whigs blazed away at one another from pointblank range the whigs had fired firstpinkard thought they had anyhowbut the freedom party men had more firepower and more determination or maybe just more combat experience they kept going forward smashing down or shooting the last few whigs who stood against them freedom pinkard bawled as he ran across the grass toward the people whod thought they were going to hear the whig vicepresidential candidate speak freedom his fellow stalwarts howled at his side and behind him this had to be what a breakthrough felt like what the damnyankees had known when they smashed the confederate lines in tennessee and virginia during the war he whooped with delight when more freedom party men burst out from another street and charged the assembled whigs then the stalwarts were in among the crowd some clubbing some kicking some shooting a few of the men in the crowd tried to fight back most of the tough ones though had tried to hold the freedom party men out and were already down from the podium hugo black cried out this is madness he was right not that it did him any good madness it was madness engulfing his party madness engulfing his country after the third bullet cracked past him after the birmingham police did nothing to slow down the freedom party stalwarts he leaped down and made his escape pinkards club broke when he hit a richlooking man in the head the whigs skull broke too jeff could feel it he waded on through the fray with fists and heavy shoes freedom he yelled exultantly featherston and freedom w hig headquarters in charleston a week before the election reminded clarence potter of army of northern virginia headquarters a week before the confederate states had asked the united states for an armistice he was among the walking wounded two fingers of his left hand were splinted he sported a shiner and wore a new pair of glasses he couldnt afford and he was all over bruises and all things considered he was one of the lucky ones braxton donovan had a bandage wrapped around his head hed needed an x ray to make sure he didnt have a fractured skull his nod held a graveyard quality almost over now he said everythings almost over now potter said gloomily we showed those bastards we could fight too by god the lawyer nodded then grimaced and reached into his jacket pocket for a vial of pills he washed down two of them with a sip from his drink wonderful stuff codeine he remarked its especially good with whiskey doesnt quite make the headache go away but it sure makes you stop caring yeah we showed the yahoos we could fight too fat lot of good its done us how many dead a couple of dozen here in charleston even before potter went into intelligence hed always had figures at his fingertips over a hundred in the state all over the country who knows more than a thousand or i miss my guess close to fifty men killed in that one shootout in birmingham all by itself hugo black is lucky to be alive if you want to call it luck ha funny donovan drained the whiskey he scowled i hope those pills hurry up my head feels like it wants to fall off if that bastard had hit me just a little harder youd be counting one more dead man here i know potter held up his left hand i got these broken keeping another one of those stinking stalwarts from caving in my skull we have made them pay though even if they do win they know theyve been in a brawl if they win it doesnt matter braxton donovan said do you know what i wish hell yes i know what you wish you wish the same thing i do potter said you wish the radical liberals would drop out of the race and throw whatever weight theyve got left behind longstreet and black and you know what what for once potter let a full rich drawl come into his voice as he answered it aint agonna happen thats what it should by god donovan said the rad libs have just as much to lose if jake featherston wins as we do you know that and i know that but hull and long dont know that clarence potter said all they know is weve been kicking their tails every six years as long as thereve been confederate states of america if we were in hell what do you mean if donovan said with jake featherston president if we were in hell and screaming for water theyd throw us a big jar of gasoline to drink potter was damned if hed let the lawyer step on a good line what are we going to do braxton donovan said what can we do only thing left is to go down swinging far as im concerned we battle em all the way up till next tuesday potter replied the more congressmen and legislators we elect the more trouble featherston and his goons will have getting their laws through and the bastard cant run again in so this too shall pass like a kidney stone donovan said morosely by the way he set one hand on the small of his back for a moment he spoke from experience but then he managed a smile and gently touched his bandaged head codeine is starting to work good potter said people were setting down drinks and taking seats on the folding chairs at the front of the hall looks like the meetings going to come to order lets see how exciting it is shall we it was about as bad as hed expected the speakers insisted on staying optimistic long after the time for optimism had passed when potter heard sam longstreet will make a great president of the confederate states for the fourth time he stopped listening he didnt think longstreet was a bad man at allon the contrary but as long as the whigs kept running sons and grandsons and greatgrandsons of the men whod won the war of secession they gave jake featherston an easy target he thought about getting to his feet and saying so in the end he didnt time enough for that at the postmortem the death wasnt official yet the meeting was less quarrelsome than a lot hed been to he doubted he was the only one saving recriminations for after the election quarrels did go on though through the streets of charleston and across the confederate states potter did his share he didnt need his left hand to swing a blackjack he dented a couple of freedom party craniaand had his new pair of spectacles broken only afterwards did he realize he hadnt had to wear them into the brawl hindsight was twentytwenty he unfortunately wasnt and now he had to pay twice for the privilege of seeing straight he was pretty sure the stalwarts hed clobbered couldnt see straight now either that was something tuesday november dawned chilly and drizzly polls opened at eight in the morning jamming a broadbrimmed fedora down low on his forehead to keep water out of his eyes potter made his myopic way to the polling place around the corner from his apartment building election officials had chalked on the sidewalk a hundredfoot semicircle with the polling place as its center inside that circle electioneering was forbidden outside it freedom party men chanted jake featherstons name potter smiled at them go ahead boys make yourselves as obnoxious as you can the more votes you cost your man the better as he walked into the charmed circle one of the men in white and butternut asked whos that smartmouthed son of a bitch names potter another answered lives around the block you dont need to write him down hes already on the list already on the list am i potter thought an honor i could do without behind him the freedom party men resumed their chant where are our men shouting for longstreet and black he wondered he knew the whigs had men outside some polling places not this one the business collapse wasnt the only reason the freedom party looked like winning today however much potter hated to admit it even to himself the opposition was better organized than his own party he would have bet every freedom party manand woman in states where women could votewould get to the polls today he wished he could have made the same bet about whig backers how many of them would sit on their hands too many any at all would be too many he cast his own ballot then walked back the way hed come he didnt think the freedom party men would set on him so close to the polling place where people could see them for what they were they didnt quite they shouted niggerlover and youll get yours at him but they didnt try to give it to him he was almost disappointed for this trip he had a pistol in his pocket not a blackjack having voted he went to work it was less than interesting today a husband wanted evidence his wife was cheating but the wife busy with shopping and the couples two small children gave none potter thought the husband was inventing things to worry about but he kept his opinions to himself for one thing clients seldom paid attention to opinions contradicting their own for another the man paid well if he wanted to throw away his money well it was a free country wasnt it it is till that featherston bastard takes over potter thought on the trolley ride back to his flat after knocking off for the day he passed another polling place police cars were parked in front of it blood stained the sidewalk and nearby walls freedom party men waving their reversedcolor confederate battle flags still stood on the street feather ston feather ston even through the trolleys closed windows the chant lacerated clarence potters ears the police didnt try to run the stalwarts off if whigs had been here they were no longer this skirmish belonged to the freedom party after panfrying a pork chop and some potatoes and washing them down with a stiff whiskey potter went over to whig headquarters to hear whatever he heard dance music blared from the wireless sets the polls hadnt closed yet he pulled out his pocket watch it was a little past seventhirtyless than half an hour to go that gave him plenty of time for another drink or two or three he nodded to braxton donovan who also had a whiskey in his hand and said the condemned man drank a hearty meal funny the lawyer said funny like a crutch oh i didnt mean you potter said if you think i meant you i apologize i meant the country before they execute a man they give him a blindfold and a cigarette what do we do when the confederate states of america go up against the wall donovan studied him i dont think ive ever heard you say you were sorry before you must mean it you dont waste time being polite i try not to waste time at all potter thought but he had nothing to do but stand there banging his gums till clocks in charleston started striking eight all along the eastern seaboard of the confederate states the polls have closed an announcer on the wireless declared well bring you the latest results from the presidential congressional state and local electionsbut first a word from our sponsor a chorus of young women started singing about the wonders of a soap made from pure palm oil potter wondered what could be going through their minds as they trilled the inane lyrics probably something like were getting paid times were hard indeed then the numbers started coming in somebody posted each new installment on a big blackboard at the front of the room that meant the whigs could go on chattering and still keep up as soon as clarence potter saw the early results from north carolina he knew what kind of night it would be north carolina was a solid sensible foursquare whig state the collapse hadnt hit it so hard as a lot of other places jake featherston led there he led by more every time the fellow at the board erased old numbers and put up new ones and he had coattails freedom party congressional candidates were winning in districts where theyd never come close before and it looked as bad everywhere else braxton donovan stared owlishly at the returns he fixed himself another drink then came back to stand by potter and stare some more he didnt say anything for a long long time at last he did jesus christ its like watching a train wreck isnt it potter shook his head no braxton its like being in a train wreck donovan thought that over then slowly nodded and it got no better not from a whig point of view as the polls closed in states farther west back in tennessee had decided the election when it finally went whig this year it went for featherston and the freedom party so did mississippi and alabama potter hadnt expected anything different there but he would have loved to be proved wrong the whigs led in arkansas but arkansas wasnt big enough to matter my god somebody behind potter said what is the world coming to he didnt need to ask the question not when he could see the answer jake featherston was going to be president he would have a majoritya big majorityin the house the senate whose members were chosen by state legislatures rather than popular vote wasnt so obvious even so it all added up to the same thing after seventy years in the saddle the whigs were going into the minority the minority the man in back of potter said when he spoke that thought aloud thats crazy he still seemed unbelieving if you dont get it think like a nigger potter said itll come to you then believe me a long with news of a corruption scandal in the iowa legislature newsboys in des moines shouted about jake featherstons victory down in the confederate states more of them yelled about the scandal which was right there in town the election news hit cincinnatus driver a lot harder he got out of his truck on the way to the railroad yards and bought a paper something he hardly ever did getting there a minute late might cost him a good cargo but today he spread the register and remembrance on the seat beside him and read a paragraph or two whenever he had to stop he was still shaking his head when he got out of the ford at the yards and started dickering with a conductor over a load of beds and dressers and nightstands whats the big deal asked the conductor a white man too young to have fought in the great war who cares what happens down in the confederate states i cares cincinnatus knew that was bad grammar even without achilles telling him so i grew up in kentucky when it was part of the csa glad it aint no more i got out of there once the usa took it over this heres a better place if youre colored the conductor was not only white he was a blond who couldnt have got any whiter if somebodyd thrown him into a tub of bleach he said i dont know nothin about that all i know is you may be colored but you haggle like a damn kike if hed been talking about cincinnatus to a jew he probably would have called him a damn nigger cincinnatus took such names in stride hed heard them all especially the one applying to his own race too often to get excited about them he said i tell you mr andersen i dont reckon its against the law to try an git me enough money to make the job worth my while i aint no charity well im a pennypinching squarehead myself and i wont tell you anything different andersen said cincinnatus liked him better after that if he could insult himself as casually as he insulted everybody else odds were none of those insults meant much cincinnatus got fairly close to the price he wanted for hauling the load of bedroom furniture too he drove it over to a furniture store on woodland street on the west side of town only a little north of the bend of the raccoon river after growing up by the bank of the ohio cincinnatus didnt think either the raccoon or the des moines was anything special olaf thorstein who ran the furniture store was even paler than andersen cincinnatus had trouble believing anybody this side of a ghost could be thorstein was a tall thin man of stern rectitude the sort who would skin you in a deal if he could but would walk across town in the snow to give back a pennyor a hundreddollar billyou accidentally left in his store with a similar streak in his own character cincinnatus had no trouble getting along with him thorstein said way you talk you used to live in the confederate states he was not far from cincinnatus age which meant hed likely fought in the great war yes suh thats a fact cincinnatus nodded came to des moines ten years ago aint been sorry neither this heres a lot bettern kentucky he remembered luther bliss and shivered in spite of himself well what do you think of whats going on down there now the white man asked dont reckon youll hear no black man sayin nothin good about the freedom party cincinnatus answered what do you think mr thorstein a surprisingor maybe a depressingnumber of whites werent the least bit shy about saying what they thought of people who didnt look like them had the usa had more negroes it probably would have had something like the freedom party too me i dont know much i have not been there except in the army thorstein said confirming cincinnatus guess the furnitureseller went on i tell you this though i think that man featherston will bring trouble he lies how can you trust a man who lies you cannot and any man who comes on the wireless and says i am going to tell you the truthwell what else can he be except a liar behind bifocals his iceblue eyes flashed plainly he was condemning jake featherston to some chilly hell cincinnatus wished getting rid of the man were that simple but he nodded to thorstein hating dishonesty of any sort the swede might also hate injustice of any sort i got me no quarrel with any o that cincinnatus said how could anyone quarrel with it olaf thorstein sounded genuinely bewildered is it not as plain as the nose on a mans face and yet how could the people in the confederate states have voted for the man if they saw it they must not have seen it this i do not understand sometimes folk dont want to see cincinnatus said i reckon that had a lot to do with it but why would anyone blind himself on purpose thorstein asked seeming more bewildered still cincinnatus had asked himself the same question more than once he said seems to me they got a choice they can look square in the mirror and see how ugly they are or they can be blind looks like they done picked what they aim to do uh huh olaf thorstein chewed on that at last he asked and what would a freedom party man say about what you just said oh that ones easy cincinnatus laughed reckon hed say i was an uppity nigger a crazy nigger reckon hed be right when i used to live in the csa i wouldnt neverve said nothin like that colored fella livin in the csa got to be crazy to talk that way but i been in the usa since now this aint no great place for black folksdont reckon theres anywhere thats a great place for black folksbut you take it all in all an its a lot better than the confederate states ever was i got me a chance herenot a good one maybe but a chance down there he shook his head no way nohow not before the freedom party an not now neither again thorstein thought before he spoke i have never heard a negro talk so freely of these things he said and then shrugged how many negroes are there in des moines for me to talk to not many were thin on the ground here were thin on the ground all over the usa cincinnatus said and maybe thats why things are a little easier for us here he thought white folks in the usa dont like us much but they aint afraid of us like in the confederate states not enough of us here to be afraid of i hope i have not delayed you too much the furniturestore owner said i know you need as much work as you can get who does not the way things are these days its all right mr thorstein dont you worry about it none cincinnatus said for thorstein really did sound concerned when i seen in the paper that that featherston fella won i was so upset i didnt know what to do times gonna be hard for colored folks down in the csagonna be real hard glad i got me a chance to talk about it some he was less glad when he got back to the railroad yard just in time to see another driver go off with a choice load that might have been his had he returned five minutes earlier but he got a load for himself half an hour after that when a train full of canned salmon from the northwest puffed to a stop several groceries were waiting for their fish and he took them a lot of it he was tired but happyhed made good money that daywhen he got back to his apartment building and parked the truck in front of it joey chang the chinaman who lived upstairs was checking his mailbox when cincinnatus walked into the lobby hello cincinnatus said affably enough he got on well with chang who brewed good beer in a dry state hello chang answered his english flavored with an accent unlike any other cincinnatus had heard we talk a few minutes sure cincinnatus said in some surprise whats on your mind your son achilles ask my daughter grace to go to the cinema with him chang replied what you think of this did he cincinnatus said and the other man solemnly nodded achilles had said he thought grace chang was cute as olaf thorstein had remarked there werent that many negroes in des moines if achilles found somebody he might like who wasnt a negro well if he did what then what do you think of that mr chang cincinnatus asked dont know what to think chang said which struck cincinnatus as basically honest he went on your achilles good boy i dont say he not good boy you understand but he not chinese cincinnatus nodded he had similar reservations about grace he asked whats your daughter think she is modern she wants to be modern mr chang made it sound like a curse she says what difference it make but it makes a difference oh yes sure does cincinnatus said the laundryman gave him a surprised look perhaps chang hadnt thought a negro might mind if his son wanted to take a chinese girl to the cinema after scratching his head cincinnatus went on maybe we just ought to let em go out and not say anything about it going to the moving pictures together aint like gettin married and if we tell em no thatll only make em want to do it more to rile us up leastways achilles is like that dunno bout your grace her too chang said morosely the more i do not like the more she does modern he made the word sound even worse than he had before now he screwed up his face yes maybe we do this i talk to my wife see what she say by his tone whatever mrs chang decided would prevail fair enough cincinnatus said ill talk to elizabeth tooand to achilles his wife wasnt home yet neither was his son after graduating from high school achilles was doing odd jobs and lookingalong with so many othersfor something more permanent he got home before elizabeth did and set two dollars on the kitchen table where amanda sat doing homework he was a good kid he brought his pay home every day he worked as casually as cincinnatus could he said hear youre goin to the pictures with grace chang amanda dropped her pencil achilles glared defiance thats right what about it i think some of the money i make ought to be mine to have some fun with dont you having fun with the money wasnt the point having fun with grace chang was but all cincinnatus said was reckon i do its all right with me just wish idve heard about it from you and not from graces pa set for a fight achilles didnt seem to know what to do when he didnt get one oh he said and left his mouth hanging open after a long moment he added i figured youd have a fit another pause even longer maybe i was wrong maybe you was cincinnatus agreed no matter what you think son i aint quite one o them dinosaur things not quite he waited out one more pause at last achilles nodded his agreement made cincinnatus feel hed done a few things right after all t hanksgiving was supposed to be one of the happiest days of the year when chester martin and rita went to his parents apartment for dinner that was in the back of his mind in the front of his mind was the chance to stuff himself till he was about ready to burst at the seams the money his father had given him let his wife and him keep their own apartment and keep eating it didnt let them keep eating well he was sick of cabbage and potatoes and boiled noodles and dayold brown bread turkey he said dreamily as he and rita got off the trolley and walked toward the block of flats where hed lived so long the weather was sunny but crispa perfect late november afternoon roast turkey stuffing with giblet gravy hed eaten a lot of giblets since losing his job but they belonged in gravy mashed potatoes sweet potatoes rolls and butter pumpkin pie apple pie too whipped cream stop it chester rita said im going to drool on my shoes a motorcar went by somebody inside waved the chevrolet parked in front of the apartment building theres your sister and her husband and little pete i see em chester waved back his brotherinlaw otis blake worked in a plateglass plant and still had a job hed never given chester a hard time about losing his he couldnt very well not when his own brother was out of work uncle chester aunt rita pete blake who was five hit chester in the knees with a tackle harder than a good many hed met on the gridiron careful there tiger martin ruffled his hair you almost knocked me on my can you gonna be a tough guy when you grow up tough guy pete yelled then he gave rita a kiss either he wasnt so tough yet or he knew a pretty girl when he saw one chester hugged sue and shook hands with her husband otis blake had his blond hair permanently parted in the middle by a scar from a scalp wound during the war an inch lower and he wouldnt have been standing there how are you he asked now with a shrug martin answered im still here they havent knocked me out yet good blake said thats good come on lets go up to the place sue said she turned to pete you want to see gramps and grandma dont you gramps grandma pete was enthusiastic about everything chances were hed never heard of a business collapse if he had it meant nothing to him chester wished he could say the same wonderful smells filled his nose as soon as he walked through the door when he saw his mothers face a moment later he knew something was wrong no matter how good the odors wafting out of the kitchen were she looked as if shed been wounded and didnt want to admit it even to herself after the hugs after the kisses martin asked what is it ma and dont tell me its nothing on account of i know thats not so sue and otis exchanged glances whatever it was they already knew louisa martin spoke in a low voice as if in a sickroom your fathers been laid off five words five words that changedruinednot just one life but at least two maybe four oh chester said a soft pained exhalationhe might have been punched in the stomach ritas lips skinned back from her teeth like her motherinlaw she was trying to find out how much it hurt laid off it hurt bad martin didnt need to find out how much what after all was the difference between bad and worse not enough to matter a toilet flushed out came stephen douglas martin rubbing his hands together one look at chesters face told him everything he needed to know so you heard already did you yeah chester said harshly i heard what are you going to do pa darn good question his father replied wish i had a darn good answer to go with it almost forty years at that place and then he snapped his fingers im scrap metal thats what i am now scrap metal yesterday was my last day but i tell you one thing im going to have the best darn thanksgiving anybody ever had and you can take that to the bank if louisa and sue and rita hadnt been there and especially if pete hadnt he might have expressed himself more pungently this is a fancy spread chester wouldnt say any more than that lurking behind the bland statement was a notsobland worry if youre out of work how can you afford it casually louisa martin said otis and sue gave us a little help not much just a little chester nodded otis was still working the older martins must have told him so they could make sure they got whatever help they needed for a proper holiday dinner knowing what chester knew took some of the enjoyment away from the feast it seemed too much like sharing a condemned mans last meal but that didnt stop him from eating till he was groaningly full when would his next chance to gorge himself on meat come he had no idea like a savage in the jungle he made the most of the chance he did have about ten oclock pete started getting sleepy and fussy sue and otis took their son and some leftovers and headed back to their place chester had waited for that he needed to speak to his parents without his sister and brotherinlaw listening he started pa the bosses had no business no business stephen douglas martin said ha business is all they had the soandsos yes he had trouble swearing in front of women what i meant was well figure out something now that chesters voice trailed away he thought his father would know what he meant any which way now that the elder martins had no money coming in how could they afford to give anyone else a hand they had to worry about keeping their own place yes well manage one way or another well manage rita said she had the same stubborn pride as anyone born a martin stephen douglas martin said i hear you two were talking about california yes thats true chester said theres no work in toledo or none to speak of if you have a job youre all right if you lose one though you havent got a prayer of finding anything new thanks so much his father said thats just what i wanted to hear im sorry pa im sorry as the devil but that doesnt mean i wasnt telling the truth i know his father said i sure wish it did though what about california rita kept her mind on business ill tell you what chesters father said louisa and i have some money set aside they arent going to throw us in the poorhouse right away so you dont need to worry your heads about that i know this is a hard place to find work on account of youve both done everything you could but you havent had any luck if i stake you two train tickets out west and enough money to keep you going a couple of months well what do you think about that well pay you back chester said without even looking at rita as soon as one of us gets something well pay you back a little bit at a time till its all done you dont need to say that chester his father said with a small smile if i wasnt sure of it you think id offer i dont know chester answered depends on how bad you and ma want to get rid of us i guess chester his mother said reproachfully california rita murmured the word things are supposed to be good there or as good as they are anywhere theyve got the farms and theyve got the moving pictures and theyve got all the people building houses for the people moving there for the other things and the weather chester said if we go to los angeles we can kiss snow goodbye i wouldnt miss it a bit and thats the truth you ready to tear everything up by the roots stephen douglas martin asked if you do this i cant give you much more help till im back on my own feet if i ever am hung unspoken in the air he went on dont want you winding up in a blackfordburgh out there even if you did vote for the fellow i voted for coolidge and hoover this time around chester said rita made a face at him he made a face right back and went on i held my nose but i did it but i dont think hoovers exactly a ball of fire hes a ball of now rita seemed hampered in her choice of language i didnt vote for coolidge she added hes had most of a year to make things better he hasnt done it louisa martin said he hasnt done much of anything not as far as i can see president blackford did everything under the sun for four years in a row stephen douglas martin said he didnt make things better either chesters father was a rockribbedchester sometimes thought a rockheadeddemocrat he continued look how the war with the japs is winding down now neither side ever wanted to fight that one all out though chester said thats why its winding down its not anything special hoovers done they havent dropped any bombs on his head the way they did on blackfords his father retorted he wagged a finger at chester still want to go to los angeles after that yes this time rita spoke up before chester could she sounded even hungrier for california than he was thank you pa from the bottom of my heart chester said if you get work i may come out there myself his father said anybody who thinks id miss snow is crazy california rita said again as if she expected to pan for gold and pull nuggets the size of eggs from a clear cold mountain stream california chester echoed as if he expected to go to los angeles and wind up a motionpicture leading man the day after he got there he went on there are people who hop a freight for a chance like this he had every now and then thought of being one of them i will pay you back pa so help me god i will i told you once i wouldnt stake you if i didnt think you were good for it stephen douglas martin answered only thing i worry about is how many people will be going out there looking for whatever they can find at least there are things to find in california chester said this town is dying on its feet ive lived here all my life except for when i was in the army but i wont be sorry to say goodbye he laughed sorry he hadnt been so glad since the day the guns stopped and he realized hed made it through the great war alive americanempire thecentercannothold xx a t three in the morning on an early december day when the sun wouldnt be up for hours and hours in berlin ontario jonathan moss thought wistfully of california or the sandwich islands or florida or some other place with a halfway civilized climate it was snowing outside it had been snowing for a month it would go on snowing till april maybe may he twisted in bed trying to go back to sleep trust me to move out of chicago for a place with worse weather he thought most of the time such musings carried wry amusement every so often as tonight they felt too much like kidding on the square there laura said from the other bedroom isnt that better mama dorothy said at not quite a year she could say a couple of dozen words that made her advanced for her age she wasnt nearly advanced enough to keep from needing her diaper changed though now lie down and go back to sleep laura said the crib creaked as she put the baby back into it mama dorothy wailed as her mother left her bedroom and came back to the one she shared with jonathan that desperate appeal failing dorothy started crying and screaming and making as much racket as she could all the books said you were supposed to let children cry themselves out when you put them to bed after a while they would get used to the idea that they could settle down by themselves what the books didnt say was how you were supposed to keep from going crazy while the baby had conniptions earplugs might have helped except that jonathan had never found any good enough to keep out the noise his wife lay down beside him what are we going to do she said how is she going to learn to go to sleep by herself if you go in there and pick her up he asked how are we ever going to go to sleep if she screams her head off for the next two hours laura returned jonathan didnt have a good answer for that because it had happened it had happened more than once as a matter of fact the books said it wasnt supposed to dorothy hadnt read the books she wasnt advanced enough to know how to read either the nextdoor neighbors pounded on the wall which meant the babys racket had woken them up that does it laura said and got out of bed i dont care what the books say i dont want the boardmans hating us im going to rock her all right moss didnt want to argue he wanted to go back to sleep and he did as soon as the screaming stopped when the alarm went off a few hours later moss thought it was dorothy crying again turn it off for christs sake laura snarled muzzily he did his wife started snoring again before he left the room he made his own coffee in the kitchen and scrambled some eggs to go with it then he put on his overcoat and went downstairs to see if the bucephalus would start it did a new battery helped as he piloted the auto to the office he imagined he was piloting one of the fighting scouts hed flown during the war aeroplanes were faster these days onedeckers were replacing twodeckersbut then hed flown a onedecker a us copy of the german fokker through a long stretch of the war he figured he could do it again if he ever had to an old ford ran a red light and shot across his path that was moronic any time and all the more so with snow on the ground when stopping was as much a matter of luck as anything else fortunately for moss and the other guy the bucephalus did stop even so he wished its headlights were twin machine guns then he could have given the fool in the ford just what he deserved that was funny in a way he chuckled about it till he got to the office but the world didnt feel so comfortable as it had a couple of years before the sputtering war with japan was only one sign of that with the action francaise in the saddle in france with charles xi on the throne there and sounding fiercer every day with the mosley thugs a noisy minority in the british parliament both the german empire and the united states he thought had reason to worry and with the freedom party set to take over the confederate states the usa had another reason to be anxious one much closer to home idiots moss muttered cautiously applying the brakes at another light how could they have voted for that crazy blowhard actually he knew how or thought he did the confederates didnt just want to put their own house in order like the french they wanted revenge for what had happened to them during the great war of course the french had friends little by little russia was shaking off the trauma of the war and the endless red uprising afterwardsan uprising that made the red revolt in the csa seem a walk in the park by comparison and england wanted another crack at kaiser bill and no doubt at the united states as well a patrol of men wearing greengray and carrying springfields tramped past moss building as he parked the bucephalus that reminded him he was in a landnot a country any morethat also despised his nation his very shingle reminded him of the same thing jonathan moss it said occupation law he got out of the auto he was laughing again as he went into the office not that it was any too funny not a day went by when his marriage didnt remind him he was in a land that despised his nation at least were occupying a place without all that many people he thought the germans would have needed to put half their men in france to keep an eye on all the frogs who hate them that was probably why theyd let the action francaise get off the ground till too late they hadnt seen it as a real threat and now king charles is talking about rearming im sure the kaiser loves that but would he start another war to stop it hes an old man now presidentelect featherston also made loud noises about rearming moss wished he hadnt remembered that not least since no one in the usa seemed much inclined to stop him moss turned the key in his door turned on the lamp in his office and turned the knob on the steam radiator to make the place feel as if it was at least a little south of the arctic circle that done he plugged in a hot plate and got a pot of coffee perking it would be black oily sludge by this afternoon he knew that he knew hed go on drinking it anyway too a letter from a military prosecutor lay on his desk hed left it there when he went home the morning before major lopats secretary had neatly typed we are not obligated to turn over this evidence to you prior to its production in court rules of discovery applicable in civilian cases do not apply here as you are doubtless perfectly well aware if i can be of further assistance to you do not hesitate to call on me then lopat had signed itin red ink for good measure well screw you sam moss muttered what the military prosecutor didnt know was that he already had backchannels photostats of the documents in question theyd come in the same mail delivery as the snotty letter he was gloating about the surprise he had planned for the prosecutor when the telephone rang he was his own secretary picking up the telephone he said jonathan moss a mans voice on the other end of the line youre the yank barrister arent you thats right moss answered who are you what can i do for you if i was you i wouldnt start my motorcar no more the voice said a click followed the line went dead moss looked out the window there sat the bucephalus right where hed left it had someone done something to it there on the street brazen as could be or was somebody just trying to rattle his cage that wasnt the biggest question he realized the biggest question was did he feel like finding out the hard way he didnt he called the local garrison and reported what had just happened the sergeant with whom he spoke knew who he was the noncom thought the call highly amusing youre worth more to the canucks than a dozen of their own kind he said they ought to give you a medal not blow you up funny ha ha moss said will you send your bomb squad out to go over my auto yes the sergeant answered ill do that the squad may take a while to get there though yours is the fifth call weve had this morning a hoaxer then moss said he must want to make people run around in circles and waste time we thought so too the sergeant told him the first two times we sent out the bomb squad nothing the third time there was a bomb theyre still playing with it if you hear a bang and your windows rattle you can bet the squad will be late to your place he laughed again moss remembered such humor from his own days in the army it had seemed funny then it didnt nownot to him anyhow the sergeant enjoyed it you ought to be trying to find out who your practical joker is moss said we could have another arthur mcgregor on our hands dont worry about it mr moss the sergeant said when we do catch this son of a bitch whoever he turns out to be you can get him off the hook so long the bomb squad will be along sooner or later he hung up that shows what my own people think of me moss thought unhappily im not doing anything against the lawim working strictly within it this is the thanks i get he wondered whether the bomb squad would show up at all or whether he would get to find out if his car was wired by going out to it and turning the key he heard no sudden and dreadful boom though he worked with his ears peeled all day toward evening a squad of men whose heavy armor made them look like a cross between modern soldiers and medieval knights showed up and went over his car after twenty minutes or so one of them waddled into the building by the time he got to moss door he was sweating despite the chilly weather how much did that protective clothing weigh if a bomb went off how much good would it do even had moss intended to ask those questions aloud he didnt get the chance the man from the bomb squad asked if he was jonathan moss when he nodded the fellow said no bomb just that asshole running us from pillar to post without waiting for an answer he waddled away thanks moss called after him he raised a gauntleted hand and kept on walking who would want to blow me up or at least to scare me spitless moss wondered the us sergeant was right he had done a lot of good for the canucks they shouldnt have wanted to hurt him they should have wanted to coat him in bulletproof glass do they hate me just because im a yank he shook his head in slow wonder who could be that stupid m ary pomeroy mary pomeroy mary pomeroy no matter how often she wrote her new name trying to get used to it she still thought of herself as mary mcgregor shed been married only a couple of months the change in her name sometimes seemed the smallest of the changes that had swept over her shed known they would be there when she said yes after mort got down on one knee in front of her shed known they would be there but she hadnt had any idea how overwhelming they would prove how could living in rosenfeld for instance be so very different from living on a farm not that far outside of town so shed asked herself before going from the farmhouse where shed spent her whole life to rooms across the street from the diner where her new husband worked with his father so shed asked herself and shed found out electricity for instance shed never had it at the farm so shed never known what she was missing now she felt as if shed spent her life in the dark ages that was literally true kerosene lamps didnt come close to matching light bulbs for brilliance or convenience but there was so much more a refrigerator beat an icebox all hollow a vacuum cleaner was ever so much easier to use and more effective than a carpet sweeper an electric toaster knocked the stuffing out of the wire grid that went over the fire an electric alarm clock didnt stop running if she forgot to wind it an electric phonograph also didnt run down unlike the windup machine the mcgregors had had on the farm and a wireless seta wedding present from morts fatheroffered a window on the world mary had never imagined music dramas comediesall in the apartment all at the twist of a dial if that wasnt a miracle what was she had to keep reminding herself the news that came from the machine on the hour was only what the yanks wanted her to hear the apartment had a telephone too that didnt impress mary so much none of the few people who might have wanted to call her had telephones of their own so they couldnt whenever it rang it was for mort she suspected that would change as time went by the pomeroys were still a very new couple bit by bit they would fit themselves into rosenfelds jigsaw puzzle of class and sociability that thought had hardly crossed her mind before the other half of the pomeroys came out of the bedroom pulling his overcoat tight around himself im off to the diner he said and paused to give mary a kiss oh mort she said her arms tightened around him the kiss took longer and got hotter than hed probably expected he didnt seem disappointed though when they finally broke apart ill see you tonight he said huskily mary nodded some of the other things that went with marriage and a move to town were even more startling even more exciting than electricity although if it wasnt electricity that set her pulse racing now what was it she knew what it was all right tonight she said mort looked as if he had to remind himself he was supposed to go out the door down the stairs and across the street to the diner mary watched him from the window he hurried across when no motorcars were coming in either direction snow flew up from his overshoes as he crossed the street rosenfeld would have a white christmas in a couple of weeks more snow started falling even as mary watched mort opened the front door to the diner ducked inside and closed it after him with a regretful sigh mary turned away what shall i do with the rest of my day she wondered oh she had work to do keeping the place clean and getting supper ready for tonight but that was work for a few hours not work that would devour a day she had no livestock to look after but a cat and mouser like any of his kind looked after himself perfectly well mary laughed i never thought i would miss shoveling manure she said it wasnt that she missed it exactly but she didnt have certainty in her routine any more once she was done with what she had to do she could go out and explore rosenfeld shed done that a lot after coming back from her honeymoon at the canadian side of niagara falls she hadnt wanted to set foot in new york and mort hadnt argued with her she didnt go out into rosenfeld so often as she had on first coming home she hadnt needed long to figure out there was only so much to see and do here compared to a farm rosenfeld was a metropolis compared to a real metropolis rosenfeld might as well have been a farm when she finished her chores today she sat down and turned on the wireless the tubes inside glowed to life she waited for sound to start coming out of the machine this is what its for she realized it fills up the spaces when youre not working she hadnt had to worry about many spaces like that on the farm for she was almost always working or eating or sleeping but town life was different she could make herself a cup of tea sit down in a rocking chair and read a book or a magazine and listen to the wireless and nobody would call her lazy or worthless and she wasnt either shed done everything that needed doing except for making supper and that couldshouldwait till the afternoon the book she had was called i sank roger kimball she didnt remember kimballs death shed been a lot younger then and the confederate states had seemed farther away than the mountains of the moon come to that they still did her honeymoon train ride was the first time shed ever left manitoba and even then shed gone only one province away but sylvia enos travels werent what leaped out of the sparsely written book at her the american womans revenge was shed found out what had happened to her husband and shed paid back the man who did it her government had seemed powerless to do any such thing but shed pulled it off not only that shed got off scot freeand people all across the united states acclaimed her as a heroine part of mary applauded that but it infuriated more of her this enos woman had struck back for her country and politicians in the usa praised her to the sky marys own father had struck back at the usa for canada and hed been hounded and hunted and ended up dying fighting the americans theyd murdered her brother alexander whod also been a patriot murdered him under the disguise of law where was the justice in that and i havent done anythingnot a single solitary thingto pay the yanks back for what they did to alexander and to my pa shame burned marys cheeks her fathers bombmaking tools remained hidden in the barn back at the farm how am i supposed to bring them here one day ill have the chance i suppose but it hasnt happened yet how old will i have to be before i can do something to twentythree even twentyfive looked far away she went through i sank roger kimball at a feverish pace she did it she thought again and again she did it and she got away with it i havent done anything when will i do something will i ever do anything she went to the window and looked outside as if on cue a greengray us army truck rolled slowly up the street the americans had been in rosenfeld for going on twenty years now the most shed ever done to them was flatten a model ts tires with a nail and shed been a little girl then most canadians these days found it easier just to get along with the yanks even people whod called themselves patriots during and after the war were in bed with the americans these days sometimes literally she despised them even more than she despised the yanks americans were wrong but at least they served their own country what could you say about a canadian who did the bidding of the united states mary didnt know any words vile enough for such people shed had thoughts like that before had them and done nothing about them but i sank roger kimball fired her all over again her father hadnt feared to pay the price did she she shook her head it wasnt that life had got in the way shed never expected to fall in love to get married to leave the farm she didnt see how anyone could do that sort of thing and keep fighting the americans that was all rightas long as she eventually got on with the war as far as she was concerned it hadnt ended in it would never end till the yanks left canada and her country got its freedom back she salted and peppered a pork roast and put it in the oven with dried applesthe potatoes could wait till later buying meat at the butchers shop instead of doing the slaughtering herself was one more thing shed had to get used to it was much more convenient even if she couldnt always get the cuts exactly the way she wanted them mort came home carrying a copy of the rosenfeld register heres something funny from ontario he said pointing to a story on an inside page somebody threatened to bomb an american barristers auto in berlin just threatened mary said shame he didnt do it mort pomeroy nodded he didnt love the yanks either mary couldnt have loved him if he had but then he said hes not an ordinary barrister though have you heard of jonathan moss he defends canadians in trouble with the occupation government and he gets a lot of them off no i hadnt heard of him mary said why does he do that if hes an american he must have some kind of angle i dont think so her husband said he is married to the woman whose maiden name was laura secord but he was doing the same thing before he married her and she wouldnt have anything to do with the ordinary run of yank would she mary didnt want to argue with mort even about something like thiswhich proved she was a newlywed and very much in love i wouldnt think so she said and then supper should be ready let me go make sure smells good mort said and mary smiled but she wasnt smiling on the inside she remembered laura secords name from the failed canadian uprising of the mids wasnt the woman supposed to have warned her american lover about it and wasnt it likely that that lover was this moss fellow if that was so the fellow whod threatened to bomb the motorcar really should have done it but with moss wife in the machine mary remembered her scornno her hatredfor collaborating canadians when the rebellion fizzled shed vowed revenge on them then shed vowed and then shed ignored her vow she took the pork roast out of the oven savory steam filled the kitchen mort exclaimed again mary hardly heard him as she plunged her carving knife deep into the roast she knew what she had to do and i will she murmured will what mort asked get some butter for the potatoes mary answered smoothly she took the butter out of the refrigerator shed bought it she hadnt had to churn it one more change from farm to town but that wasnt what shed meant no that wasnt what shed meant at all w hen the door to your flat opens at three in the morning and you wake up at the noise and you smile and murmur oh thank god odds are you are a fishermans relative raising her voice slightly from that relieved murmur sylvia enos called is that you george its me ma he answered also in a soft voice mary jane lay sleeping in the bedroom she now shared with her mother im sorry i woke you up dont worry about it im glad youre here sylvia said mary jane muttered rolled over and started to snore again sylvia went on four days after new years and ive got my christmas present what time did your boat get in last night about five george jr said what sylvia couldnt believe her ears she jumped out of bed and angrily hurried to her son she wanted to shake him but he was too big to shake and what were you doing between then and now drinking away your pay with a pack of worthless sailormen ill betthat or worse she sniffed but she didnt smell beer or whiskey on her sons breath she didnt smell cheap perfume either so maybe he hadnt been doing worse ma im not drunk george jr said and sylvia had to nod for she could tell that was true he went on i didnt do anything else either not like that not what you meant reluctantly sylvia nodded again she didnt think he would lie to her straight out what did you do then she asked why didnt you come home george jr took a deep breath ma i didnt come home because i paid a call on constance mcgillicuddy and her folks i asked her to marry me ma and she said yes oh the word took all the breath out of sylvia she stared up at her tall broadshouldered son in the gloom inside the flat to her he would always be a little boy oh sylvia said again yes shed had to inhale first little boys didnt give her news like that i love connie ma her son said she loves me too well be happy together and shes got a waitressing job that looks like its good and steady well be able to make it with a little luck in times like these how much luck was out there sylvia didnt know times were hard when you had to worry about what your wifetobe could bring in she did know that but george jr was sensible enough to make the calculation instead of ignoring it i did something right sylvia told herself aloud she said i havent even met this girl or her family what do they do she could barely make out her sons smile in the darkness her fathers a fishermanwhat else he knew pa a little i dont think they ever sailed together though he was in a destroyer during the war too he even got torpedoed but he made it to a boat and got picked up he didnt get torpedoed after the damn war was over sylvias voice stayed soft but she could hear the savagery in it even after more than sixteen years what roger kimball had done still felt filthy to her she remembered the weight of the pistol in her hand remembered the way it had bucked when she pulled the trigger remembered the deafening report remembered kimball falling with a look of absurd surprise on his face and blood spreading over the front of his shirt if i had it to do over again would i she wondered she didnt wonder long hell yes id do it in a redhot minute coming back to here and now took a distinct effort of will mcgillicuddy she said shell be irish then catholic does it bother you her son asked it doesnt bother me a bit honest to god it doesnt he laughed at his own choice of words sylvia had to think about how much it bothered her some yes but how much it wasnt as if she went to church every sunday herself shed known plenty of catholics who were perfectly nice perfectly good people how much did it really matter if her grandchildren grew up as mackerelsnappers less than shed expected it to before she looked things over inside herself i guess its all right she said and then nodded firming up her acquiescence yes it is all right thats taken care of then george jr said they dont mind too much that im not that side of the coin hadnt occurred to sylvia her son went on its the united states who you are counts for more than who your folks were president blackfords wife was jewish and nobody made a big fuss about that i suppose sylvia said im still glad he lost the socialists just dont know what to do about the confederate states with this new freedom party taking over who does george jr said i know sylvia hesitated then went on that roger kimball was a grand high panjandrum in the freedom party if he hadnt been i never would have found out about him thats the kind of people that party draws and its the best reason i can think of to figure theyre up to no good we licked the csa once her son said if we ever have to we can lick em again he remembered only the last war unlike people born in the nineteenth century he didnt think of the repeated humiliations the united states had suffered at the hands of the confederacy britain and france before the great war and though his own father was part of the cost of licking the confederate states he didnt think about that either well why would he went through sylvias mind he hardly remembers his father how do you miss what you didnt even know you had she stood on tiptoe to kiss george jr on the cheek go to bed now its late its so late its getting early he laughed at that though sylvia knew perfectly well what shed meant she went on im happy for you connies the most wonderful girl in the world he spoke with absolute conviction did she already let him into her bed to make him that happy sylvia shrugged it hardly mattered not if they were getting married soon the worst that could happen was a baby and most people looked the other way if a first baby came seven or eight months after the wedding instead of the usual nine all right son sleep tight tonight and well talk more in the morning in the morning though george jr was still asleep when mary janes alarm clock went off he didnt wake up either in fact his breathing didnt even change mary jane got dressed while sylvia made coffee for both of them her daughter had landed a typists job neither of them knew how long it would last they both knew she couldnt afford to be late shed got the job when the girl who had it before was late three times in two weeks along with the coffee and eggs over hard sylvia gave mary jane the news thats wonderful mary jane squealed she hugged sylvia wonderful have you met the girl sylvia asked i havent once her daughter answered we were at a dance together wed come separately but we were both there at the same time shes blondgreen eyes pretty enough i guess mary jane shrugged as if to say what men saw in women was largely a closed book to her it was to sylvia too but she said george certainly seems to think so do you care that shes catholic not me mary jane said at once as long as she gets along with george thats what matters thats what i think too were going to have to meet her and her folks you know i wonder what theyll be like sylvia sighed i wonder if they have a telephone if they do i could go to a booth and call them up and arrange it but lord only knows how many mcgillicuddys there are in boston if they have a telephone george will know the number mary jane was bound to be right about that she gulped down the last of the coffee rose from the table and put on hat and overcoat against the cold nasty weather outside she hurried to the door then turned back ill see you tonight gotta run now or ill miss the trolley sylvia had been laid off from a job in a canning plant not long before just as she had after the great war ended she wasnt hurting yet not with mary jane working and with the money shed made in the presidential campaign some of which she still had not going out to look for work one morning didnt worry her george jr emerged from bed still yawning a little before nine they want to meet you too ma and mary jane he said when sylvia asked him about the mcgillicuddys they havent got a telephone though ill set it up when i see connie sylvia and mary jane went to the mcgillicuddys houseit was a house not a flatnear t wharf two days later on sunday afternoon constances father patrick was a redhead going gray her mother margaret had hair whose defiant gold had to come from a dye bottle george jrs intended also had three strapping brothers and a kid sister who couldnt have been much above ten a big black dog named nemo barked and wagged his tail and generally considered the house to be his with the mcgillicuddys tolerated guests whose purpose in life was to keep him full of horsemeat youve got a fine boy there patrick mcgillicuddy said squeezing sylvias hand as she stood in the front hall were glad to have him in the family he didnt particularly talk like an irishman looking mary jane up and down he went on and i think connor and larry and paul will be glad to have his sister in the family his sons grinned im glad to have her in the family too said constances sister whose name was liz good for you dear her father said but i dont think youre glad the way your brothers are the young mens grins grew wider liz look confused whatever the mcgillicuddys were going to tell her about the birds and bees they didnt seem to have told her yet the way connie looked at george jr and the way she clung to him whenever she got the chance told sylvia everything she needed to know on that score her eyes met margaret mcgillicuddys the two women shared a moment of perfect understanding enjoy it while it lasts their faces both said because it doesnt usually last long one of these days im going to read your book patrick mcgillicuddy told sylvia she nodded politely shed heard that a good many times he went on you made a lot of people proud when you went down to the csa and did what you did could have been me you were paying that sub skipper back for easy as not she could tell he spoke from the heart thank you she said that means a lot to me especially since george tells me you were in the navy too only luck im still here he suddenly seemed to remember he had a drink in his hand raising it he said and weve got luck right here in the room with us to connie and george he drank so did sylvia so did everyone else a nother lonely winter night lucien galtier took some fried chicken off the stove he would never make a good cook but hed got to the point where he didnt mind eating what he made after he finished supper he washed dishes and tidied up as meticulously as he could marie would have expected it of him and he didnt want to let her down it wasnt as good a job as she would have done but he hoped she would give him credit for making the effort after he put the last plate in the drainerno matter what his wife had done he couldnt make himself waste time drying disheshe left the kitchen and went out to the parlor the living room people were calling it these days he turned on the wireless and waited for sound to start coming out of it as music began to play lucien tapped the cabinet this is a marvelous machine he said talking to himself as he often did while alone it makes me feel i have company even when i have none the music stopped the people on the wireless began to try to sell him laundry soap he listened to the pitch with half an ear while he lit a cigarette not all the company was welcome another little skit proclaimed the virtues of a brand of tobacco different from the one he smoked he shrugged and took another puff more music came out of the speakera concertina solo he grinned welcome to voyageurs the announcer said lucien settled down to listen all of quebec settled down to listen at half past seven on monday wednesday and friday nights the comedy about fur traders and indians was the most popular show in the country one of the indians started complaining the voyageur had cheated him that was a running gag on the showin fact the indian got the better of the voyageur every time he also spoke french not like an indian but like a jewish peddler which made things funnier and made them funny in a different way as usual everything turned out all rightand turned out absurdwithin the appointed half hour after the show was done lucien turned to a station that played music poured himself some apple brandy and settled down with a french translation of an american story a woman whod gone down into the confederate states to avenge her husband it was a strange kind of french extraordinarily terse and to the point he wondered if the english was the same then he wondered if he could make enough sense out of written english to find out he doubted it but i can ask my soninlaw he said he had to remind himself dr leonard odoull was a born anglophone whenever the two of them talked together they spoke french odoull sounded more like a quebecois every year too losing bit by bit the parisian accent with which hed originally learned his second language at about a quarter to nine someone knocked on the door wondering who could be mad enough to pay him a call at this hour lucien put down the book and went to find out it wasnt snowing at the moment but it had been and it would be and it probably was below zero outside when he opened the door his younger son waited there oh hello georges lucien said i might have known it would be you what are you doing here so late well you wouldnt expect me to leave my house before voyageurs was done would you georges asked reasonably he stepped into the farmhouse where hed been born and grown up lucien closed the door behind him to stop letting out precious heat he went on i am not a rich man to have a wireless set in my automobile i am lucky to have an automobile ive got the applejack out to settle me before i go to bed lucien said would you like some yes thank you mon pere it will warm me up after the chilly drive over the motorcar also lacking a heater ah merci georges accepted the glass and took a cautious sipwith bootleg applejack you never knew what you were getting till you got it he nodded this is a good batch strong enough to feel but not strong enough to burn off the roof of your mouth yes i thought the same lucien agreed is that why you came overto drink my brandy i mean as good a reason as any eh and better than most i think georges looked around he lit a cigarette then sighed and shook his head whenever i come here i keep expecting chere maman to come out of the kitchen and say hello that made lucien pour his own glass full again whenever i come in the house son i expect the same thing but what i expect and what i gethe sighedthey are not the same calisse georges saidalmost more of an invocation of the holiness of the chalice than the usual quebecois curse he saw the book lucien had been reading i went through that a brave woman i remember something about it in the papers when it happened lucien said not much though and of course there was no wireless then strange how weve come to take it for granted in just a few years time my nextdoor neighbor visited me last fall georges said it was a wednesday night and he listened to voyageurs he had no electricity on his farm till then did philippe though he does well for himself he never saw the need a week after that he went out and got it so he could have a wireless set for himself a wireless show decided him i believe you lucien said is this why you came then you wanted to tell me about your neighbor and the wireless and electricity i came because i wanted to visit my father georges replied sour as you are it could be that you find this hard to believe if so well too bad my neighbor philippe cannot visit his father for he has no father to visit i am lucky and i take advantage of my luck he hefted his glass and if i get a knock of applejack in the side this is not so bad either lucien looked down into the pale yellow liquid filling his own glass slowly he said i am going to tell you something i thought i would never say to you in all my days you are a scamp you know and a rogue and a fellow who gets away with everything he possibly can and then with one thing more you never thought you would say this to me georges raised an eyebrow and made a comical face mon cher papa you have been telling me this ever since i could stand up and probably before that too yes before that too the elder galtier agreed but that is not what i intended to say what i intended to say is you are a good son georges it pains me to say it and it must pain you to hear it but there it is you are a good son georges didnt say anything for close to a minute when he did speak his words were slow and thoughtful this means a very great deal to me mon pere he paused again then went on what it means is you are obviously senile and suffering from softening of the brain i am sure my esteemed brotherinlaw dr odoull would have a fancier name for it but that is what it is thank you lucien said and sounded enough as if he meant it to make his younger son give him a puzzled look he explained thank you for showing me you really are the ungrateful wretch i thought you were and not the caring fellow i believed i saw before i dont recognize him and wouldnt know what to do with him if i saw him again oh good georges voice held nothing but relief now we are insulting each other again i know how to do this i know why i should too we understand each other this way the other he shook his head what could we do if we talked to each other like that all the time lucien thought it over lord knows his son got up and poured their glasses full of applejack again we can always get drunk we know how to do that too how much work have you got in the morning the usual lucien shrugged how much have you got the usual georges shrugged too but i have help and you dont with another shrug lucien said its winter i have to feed the animals and muck out past that things can wait its not like plowing or harvest time if you want to get drunk we can get drunk too bad charles and leonard are not here to do it with us winter does not make the brilliant and talented dr odoulls work lighter as it does ours georges said if anything it makes his work worse well just have to drink by ourselves then lucien said what shall we drink to how about drinking to being a small country where not much happens his son suggested the way the world seems to be going these days we may be luckier than we know i confess i pay less attention to the world now than i did when we were part of canada lucien galtier said in those days we had to worry about the united states because the united states used to worry about us now the united states dont care much about us one way or the other we dont bother them any more we cant bother them any more georges replied he paused sipped and then asked what do you think of action francaise it is good to see france feeling strong again what ever else we are we are still french eh lucien said and his son nodded he continued but to be strong france has to get ready for war i do not think this is good not since i have seen war with my own eyes most frenchmen have also seen war with their own eyes his son said those who have will not be eager to fight again even if england goes the same way as france which seems more likely every day an eighteenyearold in france will no more remember the great war than an eighteenyearold here lucien replied it is now come this summer the war will have been over for seventeen years he sipped at his applejack wondering how that was possible but then georges said half a lifetime for meoh not exactly but close enough that truly seems unbelievable but it is so all the time of my manhood i have lived since the war in the republic of quebec so you have lucien also had trouble believing that though it too was so to keep from thinking about the passage of the years he thought some more about how things were across the ocean england he said musingly i dont love englandwhat quebecois who grew up in canada before the turn of the century could but i dont hate her either not quite why not georges asked i know plenty of men your age who do because i always feel that bad as she was she could have been much worse lucien replied after some thought she could have been like the belgians in africa and made her name a stench among the nations she didnt and so i give her some credit ah but would you rather be on her side or on the side of the united states georges asked slyly i would rather be on the side of quebec and of quebec alone lucien said but his son hadnt give him that choice and he knew it f or some reason nellie jacobs couldnt fathom her coffeehouse was full of men from the confederate states one chilly february afternoon three or four of them had served in washington during the war by the cheerful way they reminisced the csa might have won the fight instead of losing it the fellow whod led them here was a genial middleaged man named robert e kent hed not only been in washington but insisted hed been a regular at the coffeehouse nellie didnt remember him she did her best not to remember men but he remembered her and her doings altogether too well what ever happened to that pretty daughter of yours he asked you know the one who was going to marry our officer after the war she married a us veteran nellie said coolly their son armstrong will be twelve this year theyve got a little girl too kent was named for a cs hero her own grandson for one from the usa she used custers middle name as a weapon against the genial confederate another man from south of the border said i saw a girl maybe thirteen or fourteen in here a while ago is that your daughters daughter no nellie said claras my daughter i married hal jacobs who ran the cobblers shop across the street he died last year she looked down at the counter as she said that it still hurt a young italian fellow had bought the cobblers shop he looked to be running it into the ground watching that hurt too sorry to hear it maam robert e kent said politely he fixed my boots once or twice he was right good at it he gave hal the sort of impersonal praise he might have given a whore whod pleased him maybe thinking of that particular comparison was what made nellie ask do you know what else he was good at no maam kent said confederates were polite sometimes even when nellie wished they werent she said he was good at finding out what you people were up to thats what he was a big part of the us spy ring in washington during the warand so was i that proud announcement spawned a considerable silence from the confederates at last kent said well maam you helped your country same as we helped ours he was to nellies way of thinking too polite by half shed hoped to get a bigger rise out of him and his countrymen what good was gloating if the people you were gloating over refused to acknowledge you were gloating to cover her feelings she poured herself a cup of coffee one of the other confederates said maam your country won the last war no doubt about it thats one for you and we cant deny it his compatriots nodded he went on youve got to remember though when jake featherston gets to be president of the csa in a couple of weeks well tomorrow belongs to us almost all of the confederates robert e kent among them nodded again one man looked sour as vinegar nellie would have bet he hadnt voted for featherston the others though the others looked as if they were talking not about ordinary earthly politics but about the second coming kent said hell put us back on our feet by heaven and hell put the niggers in their place another man said if theres anything worse than an uppity nigger i dont know what it is still more nods nellie had the feeling she ought to listen carefully then take what she heard across the street to hal just as she had during the great war but hal wasnt there never would be there any more the italian fellow who had the place now would think she was crazy if she burst in and started babbling about what the confederates were saying in her coffeehouse he might be right too you yankees waited a long time before you finally whipped us robert e kent said you needed to build yourselves up and you went and did it now were the ones who have to do that why nellie asked as if she were still a spy trying to ease important information out of people and not simply a proprietor trying to get her customers to hang around and order more coffee and sandwiches what difference does it make if were going to stay at peace who cares whether one sides built up and the other one isnt kent said maam i think theres two different kinds of peace ones where this fellows strong and that fellows weak and when this fellow says this is how well do things they do em that way on account of that fellows got no choice that there is what weve got nowadays the other kind is where both fellows are strong and neither one pushes the other one around because he knows hell get pushed back that there is what jake featherston is after and i reckon he can get it they all nodded again even the one who plainly hated featherston and the freedom party nodded nellie wondered what that meant probably that he might not have much use for the presidentelect of the csa but that he despised the united states still more nellie had never known any confederates who had much use for the usa not even when they came up here to do business let me have another cup of coffee maam if youd be so kind robert e kent said and if you could get me a ham and cheese sandwich to go with it thatd be good three or four of the others ordered more food and drink too they had plenty of moneyu s coins and greenbacks not the scrip and brown confederate banknotes theyd used during the war nellie was glad to take it from them and they tipped generously all in all it was the best business day shed had in weeks even so she wasnt sorry when they finally left she wanted confederates to know their country was weaker than the united states she wanted them afraid of the usa when she found them cocky instead she worried shed seen the csa bombard washington in the second mexican war as a child and in the great war when she was in the prime of life she didnt want it to happen again when she was an old woman edna came by at closing time as she often did now that hal was dead how are you ma she said how was your day fair no better than fair nellie answered and told her about the confederates her daughter sighed probably thinking of confederate lieutenant nicholas h kincaid and what might have been another world nellie thought and laughed a little if she was going to think of other worlds why not one where the united states won the war of secession and there never was any such thing as the confederate states of america with virginia still in the usa washington wouldnt have been shelled it would still be the capital in more than name too and who would ever have heard of jake featherston nobody at all odds were what are you smiling about edna asked when nellie told her she said wouldnt that be something you ought to write a book ma like that gal from boston didyou know the one who shot the confederate submersible skipper you could get rich maybe i could get richif i could write a book and if pigs could fly wed all carry umbrellas nellie said you wouldnt have to do it all by your lonesome edna said that other gal had somebody else a real writer do most of the work you could split the money and still have plenty i havent got enough ideas for a book nellie said firmly the only other thing im sure of is that we wouldnt have had this stinking collapse if we were one big country and anybody can see that its not worth writing about i suppose her daughter didnt want to give up the idea i know what you could do then write about your life story thats exciting enough for anybody what with the spy stuff during the war and the the other stuff back before the turn of the century by the other stuff of course she meant nellies time in the demimonde i dont want to write about that nellie exclaimed i wish to heaven none of that ever happened i spent all these years getting to be halfway respectable and now you want me to write about that forget it edna too bad edna said itd be exciting peopled pay money to read about it it wasnt exciting it was just nasty nellie couldnt imagine how anybody whod actually been in the demimonde could think it was exciting she hadnt come close to warming up to a man more than a couple of times in all the years since shed left and how much would people want to read about that she expected edna to go on harping about it her daughter refused to believe how foul it had been how foul it had made nellie feel after a man put gold on the dresser got undressed and then did what he wantedand had her do what he wanted but edna didnt nag or not exactly instead she said you remember that bill reach the fellow who hal said ran the whole spy show the fellow who made me out to be a whore in front of a coffeehouse full of confederates nellie thought grimly i remember him she said and not another word i wonder what ever happened to him edna said if you know that you could stick it in the book too i know what happened to him i killed the drunken son of a bitch when he tried to rape me she almost told that to edna just to shut her daughter up how much could it matter now that hal whod idolized bill reach for no good reason nellie could ever see was dead but she swallowed the words shed promised herself she would take that secret to her own grave and she aimed to do it if i had to guess she said after an all but imperceptible pause he got killed when the united states bombarded washington before they took it back an awful lot of people did no story in that though edna said i dont care nellie said thats what im telling you there was no story ma youre a stick well maybe i am i dont care i worked too hard for too long to tell a bunch of fancy lies now that im on the edge of turning into an old lady what would hal say if i did tell the truth then edna said i have been telling the truth nellie lied her daughter threw her hands in the air what am i supposed to do with you ma she said half affectionate half exasperated you could just leave me alone thats what you told me and told me and then i finally went and did it nellie came as close as she ever had to admitting she might have meddled too much and too long in ednas life now maybe i get to tell you the same thing why do you think ill listen any better than you ever did edna asked nellie had no answer to that and not having one frightened her a child outgrew a parents efforts at care but a parent wasnt likely to outgrow a childs m arch was a sunday church bells rang in richmond some of them summoned the faithful to worship others later proclaimed the imminent inauguration of a new president of the confederate states of america at freedom party headquarters lulu fussed over jake featherston fiddling with his collar as if she were his mother and not his secretary he put up with it for as long as he could then he stepped away and said im fine you dont need to fool with it any more i want it to be perfect lulu said for about the fifth time that day come two oclock this afternoon the chief justice of the supreme court is going to swear me in jake said nothing in the worldin the world you hear mecould be more perfect than that he shook his head no i take it back burton mitchel that soandsohe was careful of his language around luluhas to stand there and watch me do it and shake my hand before i do itand afterwards too thats even better than all the rest i mean i want you to look perfect his longtime secretary had said that five or six times too im fine jake answered and he was fine too as far as he was concerned no clawhammer coat for him no white tie and stifffronted white shirt no top hat the butternut outfit he had on was almost identical to what hed worn during the three years of the war he even had three stripes on his sleeve though these were also of butternut not artillerymans red the war department had left him a sergeant had it well all right now the whole country had a sergeant heading it up he wasnt ashamed of that he was proud of it by god willy knight strode into his office the vice presidentelect also wore a quasiuniform one a good deal fancier than featherstons some european armies had a grade one step up from general they usually called it field marshal had the csa used that rank the men who held it would have worn uniforms a hell of a lot like knights whoa jake shielded his eyes against the glare of gold lace and brass buttons you look like the nigger doorman at an expensive hotel you know that go to hell knight said and grinned enormously he stuck out his hand featherston shook it no furtive trial of strength today for once they both had all the strength they needed we did it knights grin got wider jake hadnt thought it could we really did it you bet we did featherston said and this is only the first day what you got to remember willy is that getting heres just the start now weve got to do what we set out to do with the party and with the redemption league willy knight added yeahand with the redemption league jake allowed generously were in we keep going right on forward that was where he had the edge on knight and everybody else he kept thinking about the next step the step to take after the one he was on now he looked at his pocket watch wheres ferd im here ferdinand koenig stepped into the office he wore a plain business suit that seemed all the plainer next to the uniforms then lets get on with it jake said they went downstairs two identical limousines waited there featherston and koenig got into one knight into the other as they drove the short distance to capitol square they traded places in the motorcade several times an assassin wouldnt have an easy time figuring out who was who not in the welter of escorting motorcycle cops and government bodyguards and freedom party bodyguardswho regarded one another like two rival packs of mean dogs that instant rivalry suited jake fine the more everybody stayed on his toes the better at his request the platform where he would take the oath of office had gone up on the south side of the square near the statue of albert sidney johnston and near bank street congressmen and freedom party bigwigs and other important people packed the platform and nearby wooden bleachers party stalwarts in white and butternut and party guards in notquiteconfederate uniform kept order in the square featherston hadnt requested that hed insisted on it among the important people on the platform and in the bleachers were a dozen or so men most of them elderly in perfectly genuine confederate uniforms the highestranking officers from the war department jake chuckled as the limousine stopped near the platform he pointed to the generals i hope those bastards are shaking in their boots if theyre not theyre even dumber than you always said they were koenig answered jake got out of the motorcar the stalwarts sprang to attention the guards presented arms freedom they shouted as one congressmen who werent party membersa minority nowflinched theyd never watched party rallies up close theyd stayed away on purpose in fact they had some lessons to learn and featherston looked forward to teaching them his boots thumped on the wooden stairs as he ascended to the platform knight and koenig trailing him waiting to greet him were president burton mitchel and chief justice james mcreynolds mitchel extended his hand featherston shook it theyd had the four months since the election to get to know each other as mitchel prepared to leave office and featherston to take over getting to know each other hadnt meant getting to like each other on the contrary may i give you one last bit of advice mitchel asked formally with newsreel cameras turning jake couldnt say no without looking ungracious go ahead he answered mitchel looked weary unto death hed become president after a freedom party man murdered his predecessor now he handed his office over to the head of the freedom party and how do you feel about that burton old boy jake wondered the outgoing president said i believe mr presidentelect that you and your followers will find it has been easier to criticize than it will be to govern do you jake said mitchel nodded stiffly for the benefit of the cameras featherston smiled and clapped him on the back well mr president he went on quietly smiling still i reckon some folksll believe anything wont they he stood well away from the microphones he didnt think they would pick that up if by some mischance they did well that bit of film could always end up on the cuttingroom floor burton mitchel winced as if bayoneted willy knight laughed chief justice mcreynolds was a handsome man with a long face a jutting chin and white hair that had receded just enough to give him a high high forehead he had frowned when jake delivered his cut but made himself rally are you ready to take the oath mr presidentelect jake looked out over capitol square over the crowd filling it after the local mitcheltown had been bulldozed to let a crowd fill it and the throngs of people on the sidewalks of bank street am i ready he echoed you bet im ready very well sir raise your right hand and repeat after me i jake featherston do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the confederate states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution thereof there it was official when featherston lowered his hand he did so as president of the confederate states of america chief justice mcreynolds shook hands with him congratulations mr president he said i am the first one to have the privilege of addressing you thus you sure are jake agreed he even smiled but if you think ive forgotten your supreme court let this mitchel bastard run again in youd better think again i havent forgotten one goddamn thing not me and i know how to settle your hash when the time comes you may not think so you fancypants son of a bitch but i do the time hadnt come yet though for now he had to show everybody what a smooth fellow he was he shook hands with burton mitchel again then stepped to the microphones friends im jake featherston and im still here to tell you the truth feather ston feather ston feather ston the rhythmic chant from the crowd in capitol square and across the street rolled over him he drank it in he liked his whiskey as well as the next fellow but the intoxication of a crowd took him higher and didnt leave him with a headache the next morning he held up his hands not everybody who was cheering had party discipline the noise took longer than it should have to die away when it did he went on the truth is were going to make this country work again and were going to make it work better than it ever did before were going to dam the big rivers and keep them from flooding the way they did seven years ago were going to use the electricity from the dams for peoples housesthe houses of honest people working people white peopleand for factories that will make all the things we need and make em cheap enough so folks can afford em more applause again it faded more slowly than it might have once it did he continued and its high time we show the usa that the confederate states are a country that works too its time we stand up straight again and look the united states in the eye and say weve got a few things to talk about we havent been able to do that yet even though the wars been over for a long time we havent been strong enough we will be though this time the rapturous shouts from the crowd were the older party cry freedom freedom freedom they were deeper and fiercer than those that had gone before with more men and fewer women joining in even the generals in their gleaming uniforms looked intrigued whats this boys you think ill put my toys in your hands in the quiet of his own mind jake laughed out loud youre fools too youre worse fools than that stinking mcreynolds only youre too dumb to know it he kept the inaugural address short and sweet that was best for the wireless web and for the crowd there in person after the speech came the parade for the crowd and for the newsreel cameras an army marching band began it behind the band strutted a crack regiment in dress uniform and behind that one regiment came formation after formation of freedom party men from every state in the csa stalwarts in white shirts and butternut trousers smaller units of guards in those almost military uniforms some bands of stalwarts simply marched some carried truncheons like the army regiment the freedom party guards carried rifles and they plainly knew what to do with them look at the generals jake whispered to ferdinand koenig now theyre seeing what weve got and and they want it for themselves scorn filled koenigs voice not likely oh hell no featherston said all that therehe pointed to the paradethats ours we made it and well use it i know just how too by god youd better believe i do
