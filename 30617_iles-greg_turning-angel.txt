greg iles turning angel the second book in the penn cage series society is an artificial construction a defense against natures power camille paglia prologue the rain kept falling swelling the creek until it lifted the girl into its muddy flood she swept down through the town unseen by anyone as she passed the grassy mounds where three hundred years ago indians worshipped the sun she bobbed in the current beneath the highway bridge naked and unbloodied not yet gray limp as a sleeping child she rolled with the creek which wound through the woods toward the paper mill and crashed into the mississippi river in a maelstrom of brown waves the girl made this journey alone and unknowing but soon she would whip the town into another kind of maelstrom one that would make the river seem placid by comparison she never meant to cause trouble she was a quiet girl brilliant and full of life when she laughed others laughed with her when she cried she hid her tears she was blessed with many gifts and took none for granted at seventeen she had already brought honor to the town no one would have predicted this end but then no one really knew her only me chapter some stories must wait to be told any writer worth his salt knows this sometimes you wait for events to percolate in your subconscious until a deeper truth emerges other times youre simply waiting for the principals to die sometimes its both this story is like that a man walks the straight and narrow all his life he follows the rules stays within the lines then one day he makes a misstep he crosses a line and sets in motion a chain of events that will take from him everything he has and damn him forever in the eyes of those he loves we all sense that invisible line of demarcation like an unspoken challenge hanging in the air and there is some wild thing in our natures that makes us want to cross it that compels us with the silent insistence of evolutionary imperative to risk all for a glinting shadow most of us suppress that urge fear stops us more often than wisdom as in most things but some of us take that step and in the taking we start down a path from which it is difficult and sometimes impossible to return dr andrew elliott is such a man i have known drew since he was three years old long before he was a rhodes scholar before he went to medical school before he returned to our hometown of twenty thousand souls to practice internal medicine and our bond runs deeper than that of most childhood friends when i was fourteen elevenyearold drew elliott saved my life and almost lost his own in the process we remained close friends until he graduated from medical school and then for a long timefifteen years i guessi saw him hardly at all much of that time i spent convicting murderers as an assistant district attorney in houston texas the rest i spent writing novels based on extraordinary cases from my career which gave me a second life and time to spend with my family drew and i renewed our friendship five years ago after my wife died and i returned to natchez with my young daughter to try to piece my life back together the early weeks of my return were swallowed by a whirlwind of a murder case but as the notoriety faded drew was the first old friend to seek me out and make an effort to bring me into the community he put me on the school board of our alma mater got me into the country club talked me into sponsoring a hot air balloon and a metropolitan opera singer during natchezs annual festivals he worked hard at bringing this widower back to life and with much help from caitlin masters my lover for the past few years he succeeded all that seems a distant memory now yesterday drew elliott was a respected pillar of the community revered by many held up as a role model by all today he is scorned by those who venerated him and his life hangs in the balance drew was our golden boy a paragon of everything smalltown america holds to be noble and by unwritten law the town will crucify him with a hatred equal to their betrayed love how did drew transform himself from hero into monster he reached out for love and in the reaching pulled a whole town down on top of him last night his legend was intact he was sitting beside me at a table in the boardroom of st stephens preparatory school still handsome at forty darkhaired and athletiche played football for vanderbilta little gray at the temples but radiating the commanding presence of a doctor in his prime i see this moment as clearly as any in my life because its the instant before revelation that frozen moment in which the old world sits balanced on the edge of destruction like a china cup teetering on the edge of a table in a moment it will shatter into irrecoverable fragments but for an instant it remains intact and salvation seems possible the boardroom windows are dark and the silver rain thats fallen all day is blowing horizontally now slapping the windows with an icy rattle weve crowded eleven people around the brazilian rosewood tablesix men five womenand the air is close in the room drews clear eyes are intent on holden smith the overdressed president of the st stephens school board as we discuss the purchase of new computers for the junior high school like holden and several other board members drew and i graduated from st stephens roughly two decades ago and our children attend it today were part of a wave of alumni who stepped in during the citys recent economic decline to try to rebuild the school that gave us our remarkable educations unlike most mississippi private schools which sprang up in response to forced integration in st stephens was founded as a parochial school in it did not admit its first africanamerican student until but the willingness was there years before that high tuition and anxiety about being the only black child in an allwhite school probably held off that landmark event for a few years now twentyone black kids attend the secular st stephens and there would be more but for the cost not many black families in natchez can afford to pay five thousand dollars a year per child for education when the public school is free few white families can either when you get down to it and fewer as the years pass therein lies the boards eternal challenge funding at this moment holden smith is evangelizing for apple computers though the rest of the schools network runs comfortably on cheaper ibm clones if he ever pauses for breath i plan to tell holden that while i use an apple powerbook myself we have to be practical on matters of cost but before i can the schools secretary opens the door and raises her hand in a limp sort of wave her face is so pale that i fear she might be having a heart attack holden gives her an annoyed look what do you need theresa weve got another half hour at least like most employees of st stephens theresa cook is also a school parent i just heard something terrible she says her voice cracking kate townsend is in the emergency room at st catherines hospital they saidshes dead drowned kate townsend can that be right holden smiths thin lips twist in a grimace of a smile as he tries to convince himself that this is some sort of sick prank kate townsend is the star of the senior class valedictorian state champion in both tennis and swimming full scholarship to harvard next fall shes literally a poster child for st stephens we even used her in a tv commercial for the school no holden says finally no way i saw kate on the tennis court at two this afternoon i look at my watch its nearly eight now holden opens his mouth again but no sound emerges as i glance at the faces around the table i realize that a strange yet familiar numbness has gripped us all the numbness that comes when you hear that a neighbors child has been shot in a predawn hunting accident or died in a car crash on homecoming night it occurs to me that its early april and though the first breath of spring has touched the air its still too cold to swim even in mississippi if a high school senior drowned today a freak accident seems the only explanation an indoor pool maybe only i cant think of anyone who owns one exactly what did you hear and when theresa holden asks as if details might mitigate the horror of what is upon us ann geter called my house from the hospital ann geter is an er nurse at st catherines hospital and another st stephens parent because the school has only five hundred students everyone literally knows everyone else my husband told ann i was still up here for the meeting she called and told me that some fishermen found kate wedged in the fork of a tree near where st catherines creek washes into the mississippi river they thought she might be alive so they put her in their boat and carried her to the hospital she was naked from the waist down ann said theresa says nekkid but her word has the intended effect shock blanks the faces around the table as everyone begins to absorb the idea that this may not be a conventional accident kate was bruised up pretty bad ann said like shed been hit with something jesus lord whispers clara jenkins from my left this cant be true it must be somebody else theresas bottom lip begins to quiver the secretary has always been close to the older students especially the girls ann said kate had a tattoo on her thigh i didnt know about that but i guess her mama did jenny townsend identified her body just a couple of minutes ago down the table a woman sobs and a shiver of empathy goes through me like liquid nitrogen in my blood even though my daughter is only nine ive nearly lost her twice and ive had my share of nightmares about what jenny townsend just endured god in heaven holden smith gets to his feet looking braced for physical combat id better get over to the hospital is jenny still over there i imagine so theresa murmurs i just cant believe it anybody in the world you could have said and id have believed it before kate goddamn it snaps bill sims a local geologist its just not fair i know theresa agrees as if fairness has anything to do with who is taken young and who survives to ninetyfive but then i realize she has a point the townsends lost a child to leukemia several years ago before i moved back to town i heard that was what broke up their marriage holden takes a cell phone from his coat pocket and dials a number hes probably calling his wife the other board members sit quietly their thoughts on their own children no doubt how many of them have silently thanked god for the good fortune of not being jenny townsend tonight a cell phone chirps under the table drew elliott lifts his and says dr elliott he listens for a while all eyes on him then he tenses like a man absorbing news of a family tragedy thats right he says im the family doctor but this is a coroners case now ill come down and speak to the family their home all right thanks drew hangs up and looks at the ring of expectant faces his own white with shock its not a mistake kates dead she was dead before she reached the er jenny townsend is on her way home drew glances at me your fathers driving her penn tom was seeing a patient when they brought kate in some family and friends are going over there the fathers in england of course but hes being notified kates father a british citizen has lived in england for the past five years a woman sobs at the end of the table im adjourning this meeting holden says gathering up the promotional literature from apple computer this can wait until next months meeting as he walks toward the door jan chancellor the schools headmistress calls after him just a minute holden this is a terrible tragedy but one thing cant wait until next month holden doesnt bother to hide his annoyance as he turns back whats that jan the marko bakic incident oh hell says bill sims whats that kid done now marko bakic is a croatian exchange student who has been nothing but trouble since he arrived last september how he made it into the exchange program is beyond any of us markos records show that he scored off the charts on an iq test but all his intelligence seems to be used only in support of his anarchic aspirations the charitable view is that this unfortunate child of the balkan wars has brought confusion and disruption to st stephens sadly besmirching an exchange program thats only won us glory in the past the harsher view is that marko bakic uses the mask of prankster to hide more sinister activities like selling ecstasy to the student body and anabolic steroids to the football team the board has already sought my advice as a former prosecutor on how to deal with the drug issue i told them that unless we catch marko redhanded or someone volunteers firsthand information about illegal activities theres nothing we can do bill sims suggested a random drugtesting program but this idea was tabled when the board realized that positive tests would probably become public sabotaging our public relations effort and delighting the board of immaculate heart the catholic school across town the local law enforcement organs have set their sights on marko as well but they too have come up emptyhanded if marko bakic is dealing drugs no one is talking about it not on the record anyway marko got into a scuffle with ben ritchie in the hall yesterday jan says carefully he called bens girlfriend a slut not smart bill sims murmurs marko bakic is sixfoottwo and lean as a sapling ben ritchie is fivefootsix and built like a castiron stove just like his father who played football with drew and me more than twenty years ago jan says ben shoved marko into the wall and told him to apologize marko told ben to kiss his ass so what happened asks sims his eyes shining this is a lot more interesting than routine school board business clearly put off by the juvenile relish in bills face jan says ben put marko in a choke hold and mashed his head against the floor until he apologized ben embarrassed marko in front of a lot of people sounds like our croatian hippie got what he deserved be that as it may jan says icily after ben let marko up marko told ben he was going to kill him two other students heard it macho bullshit says sims bakic trying to save face was it asks jan when ben asked marko how he was going to do that marko said he had a gun in his car sims sighs heavily did he have a gun i mean no one knows i didnt hear about this until after school frankly i think the students were too afraid to tell me about it afraid of what youd do no afraid of marko several students say he does carry a gun sometimes but no one would admit to seeing it on school property did you talk to the wilsons holden smith asks from the doorway bill sims snorts in contempt what for the wilsons are the family that agreed to feed and house marko for two semesters jack wilson is a retired academic and marko seems to have him completely snowed jan chancellor watches holden expectantly shes a good headmistress although she dislikes direct confrontations which cant be avoided in a job like hers her face looks pale beneath her sleek black bob and her nerves seem stretched to the breaking point they must be to bring her to this point of insistence i move that we enter executive session she says meaning that no minutes will be taken from this point forward second i agree jan gives me a quick look of gratitude as you all know this is merely the latest in a long line of disruptive incidents theres a clear pattern here and im worried that something irreparable is going to happen if it doesand if it can be demonstrated that we were aware of this patternthen st stephens and every member of the board will be exposed to massive lawsuits holden sighs wearily from the door jan this was a serious incident no doubt and sorting it out is going to be a pain in the ass but kate townsends death is going to be a major shock to every student and family at this school i can call a special meeting later in the week to deal with marko but kate is the priority right now will you call that meeting jan presses because this problems not going to go away i will now im going to see jenny townsend theresa will you lock up when everyones gone the secretary nods glad for being given something to do while the remainder of the board members continue to express disbelief my cell phone rings the caller id shows my home as the origin of the call which makes me unsure whether to answer my daughter annie is quite capable of pestering me to death with the phone when the mood strikes her but with kates death fresh in my mind i step into the secretarys office and answer annie no says an older female voice its mia mia burke is my daughters babysitter a classmate of kate townsends im sorry to interrupt the board meeting but im kind of freaked out its all right mia whats the matter im not sure but three people have called and told me something happened to kate townsend theyre saying she drowned i hesitate before confirming the rumor but if the truth hasnt already spread across town it will in a matter of minutes our secretary learning the truth from an er nurse was part of the first wave of rumor one of many that will sweep across town tonight turning back upon themselves and swelling until the facts are lost in a tide of hyperbole you heard right mia kate was found dead in st catherines creek oh god i know its upsetting and im sure you want to be with your friends right now but i need you to stay with annie until i get there ill be home in ten minutes oh id never leave annie alone i mean i dont even know what i should do if kates dead i cant really help her and everyone is going to be acting so retarded about it take whatever time you need id rather stay here with annie than drive right now i silently thank jan chancellor for recommending one of the few levelheaded girls in the school to me as a babysitter thanks mia hows annie doing she fell asleep watching a documentary about bird migration on the discovery channel good hey mia says in an awkward voice thanks for telling me the truth about kate thanks for not flipping out and leaving the house ill see you in a few minutes okay okay bye i hang up and look through the door at the boardroom drew elliott is talking on his cell phone at the table but the rest of the board members are filing out the main door as i watch them go an image from our promotional tv commercial featuring kate rises into my mind shes walking onto the tennis court in classic whites and her cool blue eyes burn right through the camera shes tall probably fiveten with nordic blond hair that hangs halfway to her waist more striking than beautiful kate looked like a college student rather than a high school kid and thats why we chose her for the promo spot she was the perfect recruiting symbol for a collegeprep school as i reach for the office doorknob i freeze drew is staring at the table with tears pouring down his face i hesitate giving him time to collect himself what does it take to make an md cry my father has watched his patients die for forty years and now theyre dropping like cornstalks to a scythe i know he grieves but i cant remember him crying the one exception was my wife but thats another story maybe drew thinks hes alone here that i slipped out with all the others since he shows no sign of stopping i walk out and lay my hand on his thickly muscled shoulder you okay man he doesnt reply but i feel him shudder drew hey he dries his eyes with a swipe of his sleeve then stands guess wed better let theresa lock up yeah ill walk out with you side by side we walk through the front atrium of st stephens just as we did thousands of times when we attended this school in the sixties and seventies a large trophy cabinet stands against the wall to my left inside it behind a wooden louisville slugger with thirteen names signed on it in magic marker hangs a large photograph of drew elliott during the defining moment of this institution just fourteen years old he is standing at the plate under the lights of smithwills stadium in jackson hitting what would be the winning home run of the aaaa state baseball championship no matter how remarkable our academic accomplishmentsand they were manyit was this prize that put our tiny single a school on the map in mississippi as in the rest of the south sport overshadows everything else long time ago he says eternity im standing on second base in the photo waiting to sprint for the tying run not so long he gives me a lost look and then we pass through the entrance and pause under the overhang prepping for a quick dash through the rain to our cars kate babysat for you guys didnt she i comment trying to get him to focus on the mundane yeah the past two summers not anymore though she graduateswassupposed to graduatein six weeks she was too busy for babysitting she seemed like a great kid drew nods she was even these days when so many students are overachievers she stood out from the crowd i could point out that its often the best and brightest who are taken while the rest of us are left to carry on but drew knows that hes watched more people die than i ever will his volvo is parked about thirty yards away behind my saab i pat him on the back as i did in high school then assume a tight ends stance run for it instead of playing along with me he looks me full in the face and speaks in a voice i havent heard from him in years can i talk to you for a minute the emotion in his eyes is palpable of course lets get in one of the cars sure he presses a button on his key chain and his volvos lights blink as if triggered by a silent starter pistol we race through the chilly rain and scramble onto the leather seats of the s he slams his door and cranks the engine then shakes his head with a strange violence i cant fucking believe it penn its literally beyond belief did you know her did you know kate at all we spoke a few times she asked about my books but we never got beyond the surface mia talked about her a lot his eyes search out mine in the shadows you and i havent got beneath the surface much either these past five years its more my fault than yours i know i keep a lot inside we all do i say awkwardly wondering where this is going who really knows anybody right twelve years of school together best friends when we were kids you know a lot about me but on the other hand you know nothing the front like everybody else i hope i see past that drew i dont mean to insult you if anyone sees beneath the surface its you thats why im talking to you now well im here lets talk he nods as if confirming a private judgment i want to hire you hire me as a lawyer this is the last thing i expected to hear you know i dont practice anymore you took the payton case that old civil rights bombing that was different and that was five years ago drew stares at me in the glow of the dashboard lights this is different too it always is to the clientim sure it is the thing is im not really a lawyer anymore im a writer if you need a lawyer i can recommend several good ones is it malpractice drew blinks in astonishment malpractice you think id waste your time with bullshit like that drewi dont know what this is about why dont you tell me what the problem is i want to butpenn what if you were sick you had hiv say and you came to me and said drew please help me as a friend i want you to treat me and not tell a soul and what if i said penn id like to but thats not my specialty you need to go to a specialist drew come on hear me out if you said drew as a friend please do me this favor please help me you know what i wouldnt think twice id do whatever you wanted treat you without records whatever he would i cant deny it but theres more than this beneath his words drew has left much unsaid the truth is that without drew elliott i wouldnt be alive today when i was fourteen years old drew and i hiked away from the buffalo river in arkansas and got lost in the ozark mountains near dark i fell into a gorge and broke my femur drew was only eleven but he crawled down into that gorge splinted my leg with a tree limb then built a makeshift litter and started dragging me through the night before he was done he dragged me four miles through the mountains breaking his wrist in the process and twice almost breaking his neck just after dawn he managed to get me to a cluster of tents where someone had a cb radio but has he mentioned any of that no its my job to remember why do you want to hire me drew to consult with the protection of confidentiality shit you dont have to hire me for that he pulls his wallet from his pants and takes out a twentydollar bill which he pushes at me i know that but if you were questioned on the stand lateras a friendyoud have to lie to protect me if youre my lawyer our discourse will be shielded by attorneyclient privilege hes still pushing the bill at me take it penn this is crazy please man i wad up the note and shove it into my pocket okay damn it whats going on he sags back in his seat and rubs his temples like a man getting a migraine i knew kate a lot better than anyone knows kate townsend againthe sense of dislocation i felt in the boardroom was nothing compared to what i feel now again i see drew sitting at the table weeping as though for a family member even as i ask the next question i pray that im wrong are you telling me you were intimate with the girl drew doesnt blink i was in love with her chapter my heart is pounding the way it does on the alltoorare occasions when i run for exercise im sitting in front of the st stephens preparatory school with one of the most distinguished alumni who ever attended it and hes telling me he was screwing a high school student a student who is now dead this man is my lifelong friend yet the first words that pass my lips are not those of a friend but of a lawyer tell me she was eighteen drew her birthday was in two weeks i suck in my breath and close my eyes it might as well have been two years thats statutory rape in mississippi especially with the age difference between you its what twenty years almost twentythree i shake my head in disbelief he takes my arm and pulls it toward him forcing me to look into his eyes im not crazy penn i know you think ive lost my mind but i loved that girl like no one ive known in my life i look away focusing on the playground of the middle school where water has pooled on the merrygoround what to say this isnt a case of some horny assistant coach who got too chummy with a cheerleader in the locker room this is an educated and successful man in the grip of a fullblown delusion drew i prosecuted a lot of child molesters in houston i remember one who had regularly molested an elevenyearold girl can you guess what his defense was what they were in love he snorts with disdain you know this isnt like that do i jesus christ man pennuntil youre in a situation like this you simply cant understand it i was the first to condemn that coach who got involved with that senior over at the public school i couldnt fathom it then but nowi see it from the inside drew youve thrown your life away do you realize that you could go to jail for twenty years i cant even my voice fails because it suddenly strikes me that i may not have heard the worst of what will be revealed in this car tonight you didnt kill her did you the blood drains from his face are you out of your mind what did you expect me to ask not that and theres something pretty damned cold in your tone if you dont like my tone wait till you hear the district attorney you and kate townsend holy shit i didnt kill her penn i take another deep breath and let it out slowly no of course not do you think she committed suicide impossible why because we were planning to leave together kate was excited about it not depressed at all you were planning to run away together not run away but to be together yes she was a kid drew in some ways not many kate had a different kind of upbringing she went through a lot and she learned a lot from it she was very mature for her age both psychologically and emotionally and thats saying something these days these kids arent like we were penn you have no idea by fifteen theyve gone through things you and i didnt experience until our twenties some of them are jaded by eighteen that doesnt mean they understand what theyre doing but ill be sure and run that argument past the jury drews eyes flicker are you saying youll represent me i was joking who else knows about this relationship no one dont be stupid someone always knows he sets his jaw and shakes his head with confidence you didnt know kate nobody knows about us the naïveté of human beings is truly breathtaking whatever you say drew puts his big hands on the wheel and squeezes it like a man doing isometric exercises in the small space of the car his size is intimidating im sixfootone two hundred pounds drew has two inches and twenty pounds of muscle on me and he hasnt let himself slip much from the days he played tight end for vanderbilt its not hard to imagine kate townsend being attracted to him it comes down to this drew says in a steady voice the police are going to start probing kates life and if they probe deeply enough they might find something that connects me to her like what i dont know a diary pictures you took pictures why am i asking of course they did everyone does now did you videotape yourselves too kate did but she destroyed the tape im not sure i believe this but right now thats not the point what about ellen i ask meaning his wife his eyes dont waver our marriage has been dead for ten years you could have fooled me i did you and the rest of the town ellen and i mount a major theatrical production every day all for the sake of tim tim is drews nineyearold son already something of a golden boy himself in the elementary school annie has a serious crush on him though she would never admit it what about tim then were you going to leave him behind of course not but i had to make the break from ellen first ill die if i stay in that marriage they always sound like this before the divorce any rationalization to get out of the marriage i dont want to say anything negative about ellen drew says softly but the situation has been difficult for a long time ellens addicted to hydrocodone she has been for six years ellen elliott is a lawyer who turned to real estate in her midthirties a dynamo who focuses on the upscale antebellum mansions in town originally from savannah georgia she seems to have pulled off the rare trick of breaking into the inner cliques of natchez society something outsiders almost never accomplish ive never known ellen well but the idea of her as a drug addict is hard to swallow my mental snapshot is a sleek and welltended blonde who runs marathons for fun thats kind of hard for me to believe drew you cant imagine ellen popping lorcet plus like m ampms thats the reality man ive tried for years to help her taken her to addiction specialists paid for rehab four times in the last three years nothing has worked is she clinically depressed i dont think so youve seen her shes wide open all the time but theres something dark underneath that energy everything she does is in pursuit of money or social status two years ago she slept with a guy from jackson during a tennis tournament i literally cant believe shes the woman i married was she different when you married her about the money and status i mean i guess the seeds of that were there but back then it just looked like healthy ambition i should have seen it in her mother though i cant help wanting to defend ellen we all start turning into our parents drew im sure you have been too he nods guilty as charged but i try to stay selfaware you know i try to be the best person i can be and that led you to a seventeenyearold girli have more questions but the truth is i dont want to know the gory details of drews personal life ive heard too many drunk friends pour out the stories of how their lives fell short of their dreams and its always a maudlin monologue the odd thing is that by almost anyones estimation drew elliott has led a dream life but as my mother always said you never know whats cooking in someone elses pot and one thing is sure whatever happens as a result of kate townsends death drew elliots touchdown run through life has come to an end i need to get home to annie drew mia needs to leave he nods with understanding so what about it will you help me ill do what i can but im not sure thats much lets see what happens tomorrow he nods and looks into his lap clearly disappointed i guess thats the best i can hope for im about to get out of the car when drews cell phone rings he looks at the led screen and winces jenny townsend my chest tightens shes going to want me to come by the house will you go of course i have to i shake my head in amazement how can you do it how can you look jenny in the eye tonight drew watches the phone until it stops ringing then meets my eyes with the sincerity of a monk ive got a clear conscience penn i loved kate more than anyone on earth except maybe her mother and anyone who loved kate is welcome in that house tonight drew is both right and wrong he will be welcome in the townsend home tonight in fact of all the visitors he will probably be the greatest comfort to jenny but what if jenny townsend knew that her personal physician had been having sex with her teenage daughter that he was about to abandon his family and blow kates perfectly planned future to smithereens ill give you a call tomorrow i say softly drew catches hold of my forearm as i climb out once more forcing me to look into his eyes im not out of my mind it wasnt a midlife crisis that led me to kate id been starving for love for a long time ive turned down more women in this town than you can imagine both married and single when i hurt my knee in that car accident last summer i was home for six weeks kate was there every day watching tim we started talking i couldnt believe the things she talked about the things she read we emailed and imed a lot at night and it was like talking to a thirtyfiveyearold woman when i could walk again i organized a medical mission trip to honduras kate volunteered to come along it was actually ellen who suggested it anyway thats where it happened before we returned to the states i knew i wanted a life with her she was seventeen man what kind of life could you have had with her an authentic life she was only two weeks shy of eighteen penn and she was going to harvard in the fall ive already taken the massachusetts state medical boards i scored in the top five percent ive already put a deposit on a house in cambridge im speechless and now none of that will ever happen drew says his face tight with anger and confusion now someone has murdered her you dont know it was murder his eyes narrow yes i do it had to be i gently disengage my arm im sorry for your pain man i really am but if it gets out that you were involved with kate youre going to be crucified youd better start i dont care about myself its tim im worried about whats the best thing i can do for him i shake my head and open the door to the rain pray for a miracle mia burke is sitting on the porch of my town house on washington street a bulging green backpack beside her i park by the curb looking for annies smaller form but then i see that the front door is open slightly which tells me annie is still sleeping and mia is listening for her mia stands as i lock the car and in the light of the streetlamp i see that like drew shes been crying you all right i ask crossing the sidewalk she nods and wipes her cheeks i dont know why im crying so much kate and i werent really close it just seems like such a waste mia burke is the physical opposite of kate townsend darkhaired and oliveskinned she stands about fivefeettwo with the muscular frame of a born sprinter she has large dark eyes an upturned nose and full lips that have probably sent a hundred adolescent boys into paroxysms of fantasy shes wearing jeans and alifehouse tshirt and shes holding a book in her hand the sheltering sky by paul bowles mia has surprisingly eclectic taste and this has probably confused the same boys who dream about her other attributes youre right i murmur thinking of drew with very little charity it is a waste did she commit suicide penn it occurs to me that mias use of my first name might seem inappropriate to some people its always seemed a natural informality between us but in light of what i now know about drew and kate nothing seems innocent i dont know was kate the type to kill herself mia hugs herself against the chill and takes some time with the question no she always kept to herself a lot especially this year but i dont think she was depressed her boyfriend was giving her a lot of trouble though kate had a boyfriend well an ex really steve sayers steve sayers predictably was the quarterback of the football team i dont really know what the deal was they dated for almost two years then at the end of last summer kate seemed to forget steve existed thanks to drew elliott md the weird thing is she didnt break up with steve shed still go out with him even when she obviously didnt care about him anymore but she stopped having sex with him i know that and he was going crazy from it mias frankness about sex doesnt come out of the blue weve had many frank conversations about what goes on beneath the surface at st stephens if it werent for mias candor i would have as little idea of the reality of a modern high school as the rest of the parents and would be of as little use on the school board did kate tell you she stopped having sex with him i ask no but steve told a couple of his friends and it got around he thought she might be doing stuff with someone else someone from another school maybe what did you think mia bites her bottom lip like i said kate was very private she had this charming persona she could turn on and most people bought into it but that was just the mask she used to get through life deep down she was somebody else who was she im not sure all i know is that she was way too sophisticated for steve maybe for any guy our age i look hard into mias eyes but i see no hidden meaning there what made her so sophisticated her time in england after her parents got divorced she went over to london and lived with her dad for a while she went to an exclusive school over there for three years during junior high in the end it didnt work out for her to stay but when she got back here she was way ahead of the rest of us she was pretty intimidating with that english accent i cant imagine you being intimidated oh i was but last year i started catching up with her and this year i passed her in every subject i feel guilty saying it now but i felt pretty good about that some of drews words are coming back to me you play tennis dont you im on the team im not as good as kate she was a machine she won state in singles last year and she was on her way to doing it again this year didnt kate play competitive tennis with ellen elliott hell yes they won the state open in city league tennis what do you think about ellen mias eyes flicker with interest are you asking for the official line or what i really think what you really think shes a castiron bitch really definitely very cold very manipulative how she treats you depends totally on who your parents are how did she treat kate are you kidding like her personal protégée ellen was number one in georgia when she played in high school i think shes reliving her youth through kate how did kate treat ellen mia shrugs okay i guess she was nice to her but what i dont think kate respected her i heard her say things behind ellens back but then everybody does that what do you mean the women ellen trains with for her marathons talk all kinds of shit about her when shes not around they say shell stab you in the back without thinking twice so why do they hang around with her fear envy ellen elliott is hot rich and married to dr perfect shes the social arbiter of this place in the underforty crowd anyway she has the life all the rest of them want thats what they think mia looks expectantly at me but i dont elaborate i think i know what you mean she says i dont know what dr elliott is doing married to her no one does hes so nicenot to mention hotand shes soi dont know maybe she fooled him too maybe mia is too bright for me to question like this for long you probably need to get going huh she nods without enthusiasm i guess i feel sort of weird you know because of kate yeah but not the way youd think her dying changes a lot of things for me ill be making the valedictory speech now for one thing and i wanted to do that i have some things i want to say to our class and to the parents i didnt want to take any spotlight off of kate by saying them in my salutatorian speech now i can say them i guess but i didnt want it like this well you certainly earned it kate only beat you out bywhat a sixteenth of a point on the cumulative mia smiles wryly she wasnt as smart as people think she acted like she never studied but she did bigtime i dont know why im telling you this i guess i have some anger toward her im not even sure why try to tell me mia sighs and looks at the sidewalk kate knew how to make you feel like shit when she wanted to she would tear out your heart with a few words then act like it was an innocent comment she got star student because she outscored me by one point on the act and she always made sure people knew that but i outscored her by forty points on the sat you think she ever said one word about that what did you make fifteenforty wow so you two were basically rivals not friends mia nods thoughtfully im more competitive than i should be but for kate winning was an obsession we were always the top contenders for everything she was homecoming queen im head cheerleader a strange look crosses mias face i guess some people might say i had a motive for killing her like that cheerleadermom thing in texas i dont think you have to worry about that ive never heard anyone say a bad word about you an ironic laugh escapes her lips oh plenty gets said about me but thats another story and dont get me wrong about kate she had a tough family life her dad was a real asshole when she showed her vulnerable side it was hard not to feel for her especially for me but i had to deal with the same shit and i dont use my intelligence to hurt people mia gazes down washington street one of the most beautiful in the city and shakes her head as though dismissing some useless thought mias father left her mother when mia was two and hes hardly seen his daughter since economic support was the bare minimum dictated by the courts and even that came on a sporadic basis as far as kate dying mia says i guess i cant really believe it yet it just doesnt make sense its so random high school kids die in accidents like everyone else i know but this is different why after i called you i got a few more calls people are saying it wasnt an accident at all theyre saying somebody killed kate did you know that could drew be rightwhy are they saying that some of the nurses at the hospital said it looked like kate was strangled and hit on the head despite my friendship with drew an image of him choking kate fills my mind and i shudder you know natchez and gossip mia anything could have happened to kates body while she was floating down that creek but why was she half naked and why from the waist down i suppose she could have been skinnydipping but with who she wasnt with steveor at least he claims she wasnt it makes me wonder if maybe steve was right at this point kates classmates probably know twice as much about her death as the police department right about what about kate having another boyfriend someone none of us knew about someone who might get mad enough or crazy enough to kill her can you see kate making someone that angry oh yeah when kate got on her high horse she could piss you off beyond belief and as far as making someone crazya guy i meanshe was a very sexual person we talked a few times about it she really thought she might be a nymphomaniac that term isnt even used anymore mia a lot of girls first experimenting with sex probably feel that way she gives me a knowing look im not talking about experimentation im no saint okay but kate knew about things id never even heard of she was as intense as any person i ever met and she believed in giving herself pleasure she uh this is kind of embarrassing but she showed me a couple of toys once and it shocked me i know she freaked steve out with some of the things she asked him to do and that was over a year ago sex toysdrews words come back to me with fresh impactthese kids arent like we were penn you have no idea i know you want to look in on annie mia says picking up her backpack and slinging it over her shoulder ill get out of your hair sorry if i was too frank about that stuff i step to my left and give her plenty of room to pass dont worry ive seen just about everything in my day she gives me a sly look that belies her age have you i figured you for a straight arrow i asked my mom about you but she wont tell me anything she obviously likes you but she gets all cryptic when i bring you up i feel myself flush be careful driving your minds not going to be on the road mia takes her cell phone from her purse and holds it to her ear it must have been set to vibrate she didno waythats just weirdi will later she puts the phone back in her purse and stares blankly up the street again what is it i ask mias eyes betray a puzzlement ive never seen in them before that was laura andrews her moms one of the nurses who tended to kate she just told laura that kate was raped what she said kate had a lot of traumadown there you know my thoughts return to drew if kate was raped i hope he never has to know it but of course he will like everyone else in town it suddenly occurs to me that by hoping to protect drew from this knowledge im assuming he is innocent of the crime thats a dangerous assumption for any lawyer to make but ive already made it i simply cannot imagine drew elliott raping any woman much less a high school girl lets hope thats not true i murmur recalling the shattered rape victims i tried to avenge as a prosecutor in houston yeah mia echoes thats too horrible even to think about so dont think about driving mia forces a smile no worries do you need me tomorrow i may if you can spare the time im thinking of drew and his request for help just call my cell she walks to her car a blue honda accord and climbs in i watch to make sure she gets safely away then walk up the steps into my house as i close the door my study phone rings i trot to my desk and look at the caller idandrew elliott md drew i answer can you talk he asks his voice crackling with anxiety sure what is it im at kates house i just got a call on my cell phone from who i dont know but he told me to leave a gym bag with twenty thousand dollars in it on the fiftyyard line of the st stephens football field he said if i dont hell tell the police i was screwing kate townsend shityou told me nobody knew about the affair nobody did i have no idea who this could be my mind is whirling with memories of similar situations when i worked for the da in houston when does he want the money one hour from now chapter penn drew says breathing shallowly are you there my old friends words have paralyzed me in the study of my house twenty thousand dollars cash in an hour at nine oclock at night thats crazy thats impossible no its not i have the cash we have a safe here in the house three actually one for documents one for guns one for cash and jewelry i should have guessed drew elliott lives in a stunning victorian palace sited on five acres in one of the affluent subdivisions near st stephens a mansion that contains every technological gadget known to man do you think the blackmailer knows that he said he knew i had the money did you recognize the voice no but it sounded like a black kid a black kid are you sure pretty sure he asked for drugs too drugs prescription drugs painkillers anything i have he said i should consider this drop as a down payment his words a sign of good faith i hear something in your voice i dont like drew i know what youre going to say but youre not delivering that money brother you have two choices ignore the call or phone the police and tell them everything right now drew is silent for too long theres a third choice he says drew listen to me there is no upside to paying this money just by showing up youd be admitting some guilt you could also be taking your life into your hands because the caller could be kates killer thats what you were thinking right he has me i guess so thats what im thinking too then you should call the cops at this point an act of god couldnt keep your affair with kate from becoming public you have to think damage control now its a hundred times better if the police learn the story from you than from someone else better for your family too think of tim i have until tomorrow morning to make that decision dont assume that penn the guy who called me probably murdered kate i want to see his face i want to i know what you want to do forget it go home mix yourself a stiff drink and start thinking about whats best for your son that ought to be a change drew sucks in air as though ive knocked the wind out of him i know tim needs me okay you havent been acting like you do tim would be lost without you and if you really think ellen isnt a good person thats twice the reason to keep yourself out of jail more silence youre right goddamn it i just need to dosomething about kate theres nothing you can do its time to suck it up and be a man kates beyond help shes gone all you can do now is pick up the pieces of your own family daddycomes a small voice glancing toward the hall i see my daughter poke her head around the kitchen door frame annie is a physical echo of her mother a tawnyhaired beauty with eyes that miss nothing this is both a blessing and a curse as i am continually confronted by what is essentially the ghost of my dead wife annies calling me drew i need to go you go home and calm down ill call you in a bit and well decide what youre going to do silence drew i will hows jenny handling it its destroyed her i had to sedate her she ought to be asleep soon jesusokay ill talk to you later by the time i hang up annie is standing in front of me her cheek pressing into my stomach the one eye that i can see is full of sleep she yawns then says wheres mia mia had to go home boo aww mias fun i know shell probably be back tomorrow she said you fell asleep during the movie i guess i did i already knew what was going to happen are you going to call caitlin tonight probably will you do it now lets get you in the bed first then she can tell you good night annie smiles then tugs me toward the stairs i follow but she stops at the base of the staircase will you carry me daddy nine years old youre pretty big to get carried these days you can do it yes i cani say silently for some reason thinking of annies mother sarah will never carry her child up the stairs again an ache passes through my chest like the pain from an old wound and then i sweep annie up into my arms and march up the steep staircase to the secondfloor bedrooms the old victorians in natchez have stairs seemingly designed to keep pro athletes in peak condition i turn into annies room bend my creaking knees enough to pull back the covers then slide her underneath them she laughs and yanks the blanket up to her neck now call caitlin she squeals i take my cell phone from my pocket and speeddial caitlins cell phone shes working a special assignment in boston as an investigative reporter for the herald i met caitlin when her father a newspaper magnate who owns the natchez examiner and ten other papers in a southern chain sent her down here to whip theexaminer into shape we got close during my efforts to solve a decadesold civil rights murder and during the trial that followed caitlin grew to love natchezand mebut after the excitement of that trial faded along with the glow of the pulitzer she won for her stories covering it she realized that natchez might not be the most exciting place to spend your days especially when youre under thirty and hungry for challenges after a year of living next door to annie and me caitlin began taking assignments in other cities mostly working on investigative stories for other papers in her fathers chain weve remained committed to each other and to our plan of marrying one day but following through with that plan would mean changes that caitlin isnt ready to handle yet annie would begin to see caitlin more as a mother and would expect her to be around much more consistently caitlin has asked me about moving to a cityafter all i lived in houston for fifteen yearsbut to my surprise i find myself reluctant to leave the town where i grew to adulthood caitlins phone kicks me to voice mail this is penn and annie i say were trying to get a longdistance goodnight kiss call us when you can voice mail i tell annie trying to sound unconcerned she must be working you should hurry up and marry her annie says then she can be my real mom then she can live here i cant help but feel some resentment when the herald offered caitlin a plum assignment investigating further sexual abuse in the archdiocese of boston she almost turned it down the job meant at least two months away from natchez and though we talked about flying to see each other on weekends we knew that probably wouldnt work out but the offer came from a renowned editor for whom caitlin had worked as an intern while at radcliffe and i sensed that if she said no she would eventually resent it im glad she took the assignment but our fears about visiting have proved true the sum of our recent contact ive flown to boston once and she flew down to baton rouge for a weekend with annie and me she works this late annie asks lately its become more and more difficult to reach caitlin at night its not that late for grownups maybe shes working undercover yeah she does that sometimes annie says thoughtfully like a spy yep now shut those eyes annie opens her eyes as wide as possible then giggles like a twoyearold i poke her in the side youre a pain in the youknowwhat more giggles i give her a kiss then walk into the hall and descend the long staircase see you in the morning i call not if i see you first she yells back in the kitchen i raid the refrigerator and construct a colossal turkey poboy i only had a salad before the school board meeting and im starving to keep my mind off drew and his problems i click on cnn but theres no escaping cnn makes me think of caitlin and thoughts of caitlin bring me back to drew the essential problem that has kept caitlin and me from marrying is our age difference at thirtythree she is very much in the midst of proving herself in her chosen profession which requires her to leave natchez often at fortythree ive already succeeded in two different careers and the only thing i have left to prove is that i can raise my daughter well having endured the problems that come with a tenyear age difference i cant help but view drews dream of a real life with kate as absurd did he plan to divorce ellen and commute by air between natchez and boston in order to see tim he couldnt have continued practicing medicine in natchez the local society women would have risen as one to boycott his practice and ostracize the former darling of st stephens prep how would drew have introduced kate to fellow doctors in boston this is my wife she just graduatedfrom high school of course drew wasnt concerned about such mundane matters he loved kate and the rest of the world could go to hell but now the world may have its way with him as the cnn anchor reads a litany of global crises i make a list of the threats drew faces first statutory rape given the age difference between him and kate he could get twenty years in parchman prison and since kate was his patient he could lose his medical license even if he doesnt the mere rumor of such an affair in natchez could kill his practice if kate was raped and physical evidence links drew to her corpse he could be charged with capital murder for homicide during the commission of another felony in mississippi conviction for capital murder brings with it the very real possibility of death by lethal injection if kate was in fact murdered the police have a tough job ahead of them by carrying her body to the emergency room rather than leaving it where they found it the fishermen who found kate deprived investigators of any chance to examine her body in situ they might have lost or destroyed critical evidence and since kate was found wedged in the fork of a tree during high water the actual crime scene is probably upstream somewhere along st catherines creek with todays heavy rain the police may never find out where she actually died right now detectives are probably focusing on the helpful fishermen since these samaritans may well have raped and killed kate before taking her to the hospital st catherines creek has never been noted for its fishing and its quite dangerous for boats during heavy rains after interrogating the fishermen the police will move on to kates mother her boyfriend and any close friends who might have information about her last hours that could take much of the night and will probably continue through tomorrow if the blackmailer didnt existand if drew is right about kate not confiding their affair to anyonedrew might just be safe but the blackmailer does exist and my experience as a prosecutor tells me its unlikely that drew will escape entanglement in this case if he had sex with kate in the last seventytwo hours she may have traces of his semen inside her a phone call from the blackmailer to the police would focus their attention on drew any confirming piece of evidence linking drew to kate in an inappropriate way would prompt police to request a dna sample from him that would bring disaster in three to four weeksthe time it usually takes to get the dna results in a rush situation and when the police start searching upstream in st catherines creek for the murder scene they will eventually come to the bend where the two most exclusive subdivisions in natchez come together one of those subdivisionspinehavenis where kate townsend lived the otherjust across the creek and through the woodsis sherwood estates where drew elliots victorian mansion stands in the absence of other evidence this juxtaposition might not suggest anything but if the blackmailer gets the rumor mill churning the microwave clock tells me forty minutes have passed since i last spoke to drew feeling a little anxious i pick up the kitchen phone and call his cell phone he doesnt answer i wait about a minute then try again nothing i hate to call his wife given all that ive learned about their marriage but i need to know that drew is safely drunk somewhere and not on his way to the st stephens football field with a bag of cash hello says a groggy female voice ellen its penn cage penn whats going on is drew with you i knew itno i was actually calling for him wellloud snuffling rustling of clothi thought i heard him pull up outside a while ago but then he didnt come in maybe hes out in his workshop he goes out there sometimes when hes feeling moody is there any way to check without you having to get up intercom just a sec theres a burst of static drew drew are you out there more static hes not answering he called a while ago and told me he was leaving the townsends house maybe he got called to the hospital on his way home i think hes covering tonight thats probably it you get back to sleep ellen sleep godi had to take a pill to even have a chance at sleep i was really close to kate you know i knew you played tennis with her that girl was gifted penn i think she would have made the team at harvard god wouldnt that have been something yes it would im sorry ellen i hear a sound i cant identify we raise these children she murmurs we pour everything into them all our hopes and dreams and then something like this happens if i were jenny townsend im not sure i could handle it i might do something crazy i really might well i hope she finds the strength to deal with it its good to talk to you penn we dont see you enough you should come by for a drink i really liked your last book i want to talk to you about some of the characters i think i recognized a few i give ellen an obligatory laugh and ring off where the hell is drew im afraid i already know the answer i start to dial my parents house but its too late to ask my mother to come over instead i dial mias cell she answer after two rings penn afraid so is there any chance you could come back for about an hour annies asleep but i need to go out um i guess so is it important of course it is you wouldnt call if it werent are you with your friends now such as they are everybodys pretty freaked out but im not far away from you actually i can be there in five minutes thanks ill pay you double your usual rate you dont have to do that im on my way i hang up and walk back to my bedroom the only one on the ground floor of the house in the top of my closet is a ninemillimeter springfield xd with a fifteenround clip i carried acaliber revolver in houston but recent experience taught me the wisdom of having a large magazine i keep the weapon close albeit with a trigger lock to protect annie unlocking the guard mechanism i slip the pistol barrel into the pocket of my jeans and grab a waterproof windbreaker from the closet waiting on the front steps for mia i call drews cell phone again when he fails to answer i consider calling the police for helpbut only for a moment the risks to drew are too great when mia pulls up to the curb i give her a wave and walk to my saab hoping to avoid any explanations everything okay she calls i turn back to her fine annies still in bed i just need to run an errand mia nods but i see suspicion in her eyes ive never called her on such short notice before what else have the kids been saying i ask all kinds of things but its mostly bullshit you know how people are like you saidnatchez i should be back in less than an hour but if im not you can stay right ill be here when you get back i move toward my car i really appreciate it mia is that a gun in your pants i look down the butt of the springfield is sticking up in front of my windbreaker mia isnt looking at the pistol but at me her eyes questioning i start to give her an explanation but nothing would really make sense as casually as possible i pull the tail of the windbreaker over the gun penn are you okay yes mia you i didnt see anything she says her face radiating assurance im sure you know what youre doing if only that were truekeep a close eye on annie i will bye she turns and hurries into the house i climb into my saab and start the engine wondering what kind of insanity ill find when i reach st stephens chapter buck stadium was called simply the bowl when i was a student at st stephens and the reason was plain back then the stadium was only an oval hole in the ground surrounded by pine and hardwood trees spectators sat on its grassy sides to cheer during bucks games until enough money was raised to build rudimentary bleachers tonight three new school buildings stand on the south side of the bowl and wide concrete steps march all the way down to the field the bleachers are massive prefab units like those at college football stadiums and huge banks of overhead lights can turn night into day at the flick of a switch fancy dressing rooms and a workout center stand on a terraced shelf halfway down the hill and a blue rubberized track surrounds the football field the year we fought our way to the state football championship drew and i practiced in a cow pasture filled with holes and played under dim security lights like the ones in supermarket parking lots despite all the improvements theres still only one narrow access road to the bottom of the bowl which is probably why the blackmailer chose the football field to pick up his payoff he can easily detect the approach of any police vehicles and the surrounding woods offer infinite avenues of escape once he crosses the cyclone fence that surrounds the track i cut my headlights as i climb the main driveway of the campus then park on the south side of the elementary school to remain hidden from the eyes of anyone in the bowl with the springfield weighting my right front pocket i walk quietly along the side of the building toward the bowl standing in the shadows beside the building is a honda atv commonly called a fourwheeler in this area the camouflage paint scheme vanderbilt bumper sticker and gun boot mounted on the handlebars mark this fourwheeler as drew elliots like most men in and around natchez drew is an avid hunter the only good news is that the gun boot contains a remington deer rifle which means drew probably didnt go armed to deliver his payoff to the fiftyyard line below twenty yards from the elementary school the ground drops precipitously into the bowl transecting that space is the asphalt road that curves down to the track staying in the shadows by drews fourwheeler i try his cell phone one last time theres no answer but for a moment i think i hear the chirp of a ringing cell phone crouching low i scuttle to the edge of the bowl and look down its like staring at a bottomless black lake the light from the security lamps mounted on the stadiums press box dies after only a few yards whatever is happening on the floor of the bowl i cant see it as i stare into the blackness the whine of a small engine rises out of the hole the whine seems to be coming toward me then a single headlight flicks on cutting a bright swath down the length of the football field sitting at midfield is a small gym bag where the hell is drew what sounds like hoofbeats suddenly rises out of the bowl followed by the sound of panting im reaching for my springfield when drews face appears out of the dark he pulls up short his eyes filled with shock penn come on he races past me to the fourwheeler far below the motorcycle stops beside the gym bag what are you doing here drew calls over his shoulder trying to keep your ass out of trouble i answer dividing my attention between the distant motorcycle and drew he cranks the atv with a rumble kicks it into gear and lurches up beside me you can help me or you can stand here with your thumb up your ass he says youve got three seconds to decide a highpitched revving echoes out of the bowl and then suddenly the headlight is tearing away from us again back in the direction from which it came certain that nothing will dissuade drew from pursuit i hike my leg over the seat and clamp my arms around his waist he hits the throttle and the honda flies over the lip of the bowl descending as though in free fall this is nuts i yell in his ear you know that he grabs something from his pocket and holds it over his shoulder until i take it it looks like a small kaleidoscope whats this nightvision scope if he kills his headlight keep that scope on him night visionwhy am i surprised this is exactly the kind of useless toy that your affluent mississippi hunter possesses did you recognize the guy on the motorcycle hes wearing a helmet with a black visor gloves too so i dont know if hes black or white we hit the floor of the bowl with a bonejarring impact then zoom across the track onto the football field a hundred yards ahead the motorcycle slows to a near stop he must be negotiating an opening in the cyclone fence drew guns the atv and we hurtle up the football field at fifty miles an hour what are you going to do if you catch him ask some questions drew shouts pushing the honda still harder find out what he knows the rest of drews words are lost in the roar of wind past my ears as we race toward the end of the bowl look he shouts pointing at the almost stationary headlight weve got him the smaller engine whines like a chainsaw and then the headlight begins moving jerkily uphill fuckbellows drew suddenly the entire bowl is blasted by white light as though god ripped back the night sky to expose a hidden sun in the blinding light i see a narrow gap cut in the cyclone fence drew steers toward it you cant make it i scream realizing the hole was cut for a motorcycle to pass through dont do it drew jolts across the track with abandon thenrealizing he cant break the laws of physicshits the brakes throwing the honda into a skid the ass end of the fourwheeler spins forward and suddenly its me whos most likely to slam into the fence but the grass is slick from rain we spin once more and then the front bumper of the atv just kisses the loose wire of the cyclone fence come on baby drew pleads trying to restart the engine which died during the skid give it up man let him go as the rattle of the motorcycle grows fainter the steel fence post beside me sings as though struck by a hammer almost instantly that sound merges into a deafening boom that echoes around the bowl like cannon fire only then do i realize that the supersonic crack of the rifle bullet escaped me altogether for a moment i wonder whether despite the evidence of my eyes drew has drawn and fired his deer rifle at the fleeing motorcyclist but he hasnt somebodys shooting at us i yell clapping him on the shoulder no shit he grunts finally cranking the honda to life get off and hold the fence back as i dismount the atv a second rifle shot blasts across the bowl drew yanks his own rifle from the boot and shoves it into my hands you know where the switch is for the stadium lights i nod blankly shoot back sooner or later that assholes going to hit one of us i scramble through the gap in the fence move to the side of the opening then lay the rifle barrel through one of the diamond shaped holes in the fence and sight in on the staircase at the base of the press box the switch box is mounted on the wall just above it i see no one there and im glad for it as drew tries to bull the honda through the gap in the fence i draw a bead on the metal circuit box that contains the light switches the remington bucks against my shoulder three times before the blazing lights go dark get on drew yells the fourwheeler suddenly beside me in the darkness i shove his rifle back into the gun boot and climb onto the seat behind him shocked by my exhilaration at having neutralized the threat from above but the greatest threat to my safety probably wasnt the shooter in the stadium its the man whose waist im clinging to in the dark theres no path through the trees but this doesnt deter drew he accelerates up the incline like a whiskeycrazed redneck in a mudriding contest dodging pines and briar thickets with inches to spare as we crest the first hill i feel the front wheels rise off the ground and for a second im sure the honda is about to flip backward and crush us a manner of death all too common in mississippi but drew stands erect and leans over the handlebars restoring enough equilibrium for us to ramp over the hill and land in one piece on the other side to my surprise he brakes to a stop and switches off the headlight now we face a darkness so deep it makes the bowl seem hospitable by comparison this is the darkness of the primeval forest youll never catch him i say softly shhh says drew killing the motor listen sure enough somewhere below us and to our left i hear the faint protest of a small engine being pushed hard hes running the creek bed whispers drew drew is probably right but thats no great help he could come up out of that creek in a dozen different neighborhoods i point out well never get him now watch says drew cranking the honda again i hug him tight and clench my thighs around the seat as he flicks on the headlight and plunges down the hillside he must have hunted these woods before theres no other explanation for the speed with which he navigates the forest in the dark we fly along one ridge as though pursued by the devil then plunge down an almost perpendicular drop and splash into swiftly running water after struggling through the stream for a dozen yards we climb onto a gravelcovered sandbar and race along the creek bed all i can do at this point is hang on and pray that drew knows where hes going twice more im doused by creek water but then i hear a whoop of triumph as he sights a solitary taillight ahead somehowi can only assume its because of superior knowledge of the terraindrew is closing the gap between us and the motorcycle the note of the hondas engine climbs in pitch as he pushes the atv to its limit easy i shout youve got him now hes seen us hes speeding up if i push him he might wreck wemight wreck in thirty frantic seconds drew closes the gap to twentyfive yards the taillight disappears as the motorcycle whips around a bend but three seconds later we round it too and i sight the light again suddenly the darkness gives way to a plain of white sand shining in the moonlight the creek is a black snake slithering over it and somehow the motorcyclist has reached the opposite side of that snake drew aims the honda at the narrowest part of the stream instinct tells me this is a mistake since shallows tend to be broad while narrows indicate deepcut channels but this is drews home ground not mine as the motorcycle escapes over the sand drew punches the gas and we hit the narrows at thirty miles an hour its like plowing into a guardrail the rear end of the honda flies over my shoulders and the next thing i know im sucking water and clawing mud knowing that the sinking fourwheeler could pin me to the creek bottom i scrabble over the slime and burst up into the air i see no sign of drew or the fourwheeler only a cloud of steam rising from the water behind me diving back beneath the surface i feel my way to the overturned vehicle and burn my forearm on the exhaust pipe then my hand closes on a bulging calf drew is pinned beneath the atv struggling around to the upstream side of the honda i plant both feet firmly on the creek bottom then squat and grab the handlebars hoping the current will function like a second person i heave upward and lunge downstream with all my strength the atv rises about a foot then stops i redouble my efforts but the weight of the engine is just too much as my back starts to give way the main current of the creek suddenly lifts the atv out of my hands and carries it several yards downstream i fall and float behind it for a couple of seconds then i get my feet under me and turn expecting drew to break the surface he doesnt drew nothing but the sound of water i know a guy who snapped both femurs in a fourwheeler accident exactly like this one and drew took the brunt of the impact when we hit the creek the waters not much more than four feet deep here but the current is strong if drew was knocked unconscious he could be thirty yards downstream already i take a deep breath and go to the bottom then let the current carry me along in less than ten seconds i collide with the atv again its being dragged sluggishly down the creek im feeling my way around it when a strong hand grabs my shirt and pulls me to the surface drew looks wildly at me his eyes white with fear jesus i thought you were hurt bad i was looking for you his face is half covered with blood most of it flowing from a cut above his eye theres blood on his chest too are you okay i ask he nods then looks off into the woods that bastard got away though just as with annie when she does something dangerous my fear turns to fury as soon as i know drew is all right what kind of juvenile bullshit was that god damn it you act like youre still in high school junior high his head is cocked as though hes still listening for the motorcycle hes gone i rail your moneys gone too and you damn near killed us to pay the bastard drew looks back at me his eyes glinting with dark light i dont care why not because that motherfucker killed kate i start to argue but something stops me maybe its the strange light in his eyes or maybe its the realization that he truly risked our lives to catch the guy on the motorcycle something the drew elliott i know would not normally do hes never been a hothead hes a logical and intelligent man how do you know the blackmailer is the killer drew because he was there when kate died thats how he knows about us at the sound of certainty in drews voice a new stillness settles over me how do you know he was there drew finally turns full on to me his eyes are slits in the dark his lips compressed he looks like a man deciding whether or not to tell a priest the darkest secret of his life because i was the one who found kates body chapter drew makes me wait until we have wrestled his fourwheeler out of the creek and stripped half the thing down before hell tell me anything about finding kate hes one of those rare whitecollar guys who actually knows how to fix things he approaches machines with the same familiarity that he does the human body now he stands beside the steaming atv waiting for the air intake box to drain and the carburetor to dry im sitting on a rotten log nearby trying to catch my breath all right start talking i snap he walks away from me and stares up the hill that the motorcycle disappeared over with his rifle slung over his shoulder he looks like a marine standing guard in some lost jungle my springfield is gone it must have fallen out of my pocket at some point during our charge through the woods drew has promised to find or replace it but at this moment a lost pistol is not my highest priority i want to know what he held back from me earlier tonight it was this afternoon he says still looking off into the dark whatever led to kates death started this afternoon i remain silent leaving him to fill the vacuum i hope he doesnt take long its about fifty degrees but with the wind hitting my wet clothes it feels like deep winter kate was late getting her period drew says softly only five days but she was usually as regular as clockwork she was worried so drew has been sleeping with kate for several months at least i told her to buy a home pregnancy test but she didnt want to the truth is i think she sort of hoped she was pregnant why he turns to me but his expression is indistinct in the moonlight because that would have forced everything to a head if she was pregnant all would have been decided she wouldnt have got an abortion i would have asked ellen for a divorce and would ellen have given you a divorce i think so it would have cost me dearly but it would have been worth it go on i was supposed to meet kate tonight after ellen went to sleep thats usually when wed meet during the week shed slip across the creek and come over to my workshop jesus it was pretty safe actually ellen never goes out there she just calls on the intercom anyway for some reason kate couldnt wait until tonight maybe she took that pregnancy test after all he nods thoughtfully maybe so what did she do this afternoon she sent me a text message on my cell phone it said i really need to see you the creek or the cemetery the cemetery the city cemetery was our backup place the creek meant st catherines creek we met there a lot in the beginning at the bend between sherwood estates and pinehaven you used cell phones to communicate never directly she sent me that message from a computerprobably one at st stephens there was no traceable link to her cell phone sherwood estates and pinehaven the two most expensive subdivisions within the city limits at the rear of each wooded bluffs drop down to muddy canecovered flats that border the creek during heavy rains the creek rises several feet in hours and becomes a fiftyfootwide torrent filled with logs and other debris kate would take her dog down there like she was exercising him drew says id just jog down there if we needed to talk during the day it was a good place during the day youre nuts why not just get her a cell phone in your name or something like that drew shakes his head too dangerous in the past couple of months ive had the feeling ellen might be having me followed its very easy to eavesdrop on cell phones and you can monitor their gps position simply by calling a company that specializes in that no warrant required okay go on i dont know how long kate was waiting at the creek i got the text message at my office it was timestamped one fiftyfour pm she was almost certainly at school then she probably left the building at three i left my office at threethirty it took me ten or twelve minutes to get down to the creek i guess i didnt park at home because i was impatient i parked at the back of an empty lot in pinehaven and came in from the south did anybody see you i dont think so but they could have the blackmailers for example they could have seen your car and followed you maybe but i dont think so you cant see the back of that lot from the street i motion for him to continue drews voice drops in volume forcing me to strain to hear him i saw her from forty yards away she was lying on the creek bank with her head trailing in an eddy of water i told myself it couldnt be her my mind totally rejected the visual evidence cognitive dissonance i think its called but at some level i knew i sprinted up to her and looked down and i justshed been wearing her tennis outfit her izod shirt and sports bra had been pushed up to her neck but she was naked from the waist down there was fresh blood on the side of her headpetechiae around her eyes i cradled her head and drew covers his mouth with one hand unable to go on a muffled sob comes from his throat then he speaks in a monotonic voice her eyes were wide open glassy the pupils fixed and dilated i was sure she was dead but i tried to resuscitate her anyway i gave her cpr for ten minutes but i couldnt get a heartbeat you didnt call id left my cell phone in my car i wonder if this is true would you have called for help if youd had it hell yes was she still warm drew goes still yes okay so you knew she was dead what happened then i went insane i literally came apart suddenly everything id been holding inside for months just burst out of me i was crying talking to myself screaming at the sky like captain ahab is this when you saw someone else there i didnt see anybody else but there was someone there how do you know drew clenches and unclenches his right fist i felt him how the way you do in horror movies your scalp is itching and you start to sweat you can feel someone looking at you this is a popular notion but entirely untrue extensive experiments have proved this type of intuition false that was probably just paranoia drew shakes his head with absolute conviction ive hunted all my life there was a human being close to me in those woods but he stayed concealed he knew how to use cover or id have seen him watching me i finally ask the obvious question if this is really how it went down why wasnt it you who reported kates death drew looks at me as though puzzled about this himself it almost was my first instinct was to cradle her like a baby and carry her up to my car i was going to take her home to her mother and confess everything as reckless as this sounds i sense that hes telling the truth as a prosecutor i heard many confessions in which murderers expressed this urge and some even followed through with it did you actually pick her up no it was at this point that i sensed the other person i felt an urge to run but i didnt only a coward would run i told myself i had to face the situation but as i sat there staring at her blank eyeseyes id looked into the night before as we made love eyes so alive you cant imagine themi started to see the situation from outside myself what would i accomplish by confessing the affair kate was beyond help if i confessed id lose my medical license and probably go to jail i might even be suspected of killing her at that moment i honestly didnt give a shit about myself but what would it do to my family my parents what would happen to tim i wouldnt be there to raise him but worse what would he think about me hed grow up believing i was a total shit and maybe even a killer so you left the scene drew nods i pulled kate clear of the water but i left her in the open so that shed be easily found i was going to make an anonymous call did you a silent shake of the head why not he bends down and examines the hondas carburetor id been there for a while im no detective but ive read enough to know that you leave trace evidence everywhere you go it was raining pretty hard i figured the rain would wipe away any evidence that i was there by morning that and more i say softly wondering more and more about drews actions it also washed away any evidence of the real killer and it damn near washed kate down to the mississippi river he says nothing you dont come out looking too heroic in this buddy a cop would be reading you your rights about now drew looks at me with a direct gaze probably so but kate wouldnt have wanted me to destroy tims image of me for the sake of her postmortem dignity her mother might have you said the blackmailer sounded like a black kid what would a black kid be doing down at st catherines creek i dont remember ever seeing any down there when was the last time you were down there when we were kids i guess that was thirty years ago penn a couple of apartment complexes you think of as white have gone black in the past ten years a lot of the kids play down there smoke dope have sex whatever do you think some random black kid would have recognized you why not i have a lot of black patients but earlier you said that whoever was watching you was probably the killer i think so yeah you think kate was murdered by some random black kid why not some crazy teenager were talking about capital murder drew murder during the commission of a rape happens all the time doesnt it it does in houston or new orleans but natchez is a universe away from there houston had two hundred and thirtyfour homicides last year i think natchez had two the year before that nobody got murdered here yeah but in the last twenty years weve had some seriously twisted crimes hes right not even natchez has gone untouched by the scourges of the modern erastrangermurder and sexual homicide only now im thinking it wasnt one kid he says we just got shot at while we chased the guy on the motorcycle that means two people at least maybe there were more maybe kate was waiting for me at the creek and it was just the wrong time to be down there maybe a crew of horny teenagers was down there messing around and they saw her maybe they decided they wanted her whether she wanted them or not like that wilding thing in central park remember i dont answer as a prosecutor i found that whenever a crime victims relative suggested minorityassailant murder cases as parallels i needed to look more closely at that person what ive learned in the past five minutes has fundamentally altered my perception of kates death and drews relationship to it when the school secretary interrupted the board meeting tonight drew already had a good idea of what she was about to say when theresa cook choked out that our beloved homecoming queen was dead drew felt no surprise only hours before he had been pounding on her chest and kissing her dead lips trying to breathe life back into her body ive never thought of drew as duplicitous but i guess were all capable of anything in the interest of selfpreservation what happens now he asks you tell the police about your involvement with kate if you dont youre at the mercy of whoever was on that motorcycle and his buddy with the rifle what happens if i do tell the cops at the very least you can count on a statutory rape charge from jenny townsend drew shakes his head jenny wouldnt do that are you crazy of course she would he steps closer to me close enough for me to see his eyes clearly jenny knew about us penn about kate and me i blink in disbelief and she was okay with it she knew i loved kate and she knew i was going to leave ellen every time i think i have my mind around the reality of this case drew moves the boundaries drew were through the looking glass here if you have any more earthshaking revelations id just as soon hear them all now thats the only one i can think of right now my mind is spinning with new permutations of motive and consequence a minute ago you said you were thinking of carrying kate up to her mother and confessing everything now you tell me she already knew about you which is it confess was the wrong word i meant tell jenny how kate died that id found her i felt it was my fault i still do i guess i said confess because if id done that everything would have become public i mull over this explanation given whats happened jenny might change her mind about your relationship with kate we were fine tonight that house was full of grieving people but jenny and i were the only two who truly knew what was lost when kate died jenny doesnt know you were at the crime scene does she no but im probably going to tell her i wouldnt rush into that even if she remains your biggest fan if your affair with kate becomes public jenny may feel she has no choice but to demand your head on a platter if it were known that she sanctioned your relationship shed be crucified right along with you jennys never been too concerned about the opinions of others this is a little different thanoh hell the points moot anyway if your affair becomes public the police or the sheriffs department will probably charge you with murder spurred on by the district attorney of course shad johnson drew says softly even the name makes my gut ache shadrach johnson is a black lawyer who was born in natchez but raised in chicago five years ago he returned to natchez to run for mayor an election he lost by percent of the vote a year later he won the post of district attorney taking the office from a white man who had never distinguished himself in the position the mayoral race johnson lost happened to be going on during my investigation of the unsolved civil rights murder and during the stress of that case shad revealed his true colors to me the man has one interesthis own political careerand he doesnt care who he steps on black or white to advance it shad would charge you in a heartbeat i murmur he has wet dreams about getting a case like this anything for headlines drew agrees im starting to think drew may have been right not to call in the cavalry when he discovered kates body my chivalrous side is revolted by his callousness but the modern world is not a chivalrous place in this world no good deed goes unpunished what will the blackmailers do now drew asks you gave them the whole twenty thousand yeah i thought about stacking some bills over a newspaper but the geometry of the stadium wasnt right for that i knew hed have too much time to check the bag before i could get him im surprised you didnt just take your rifle down there and shoot the guy when he showed up drew looks uncomfortable i figured whoever it was would be watching me looking for a gun so i didnt take it down with me i figured i could sprint back up to the fourwheeler before he got to the bag id scanned the whole stadium with the nightvision scope before i went down and i knew nobody was close to the fiftyyard line actually you did make it in time to shoot him i observe only i showed up drew nods but i cant read his emotions so what will our motorcyclist do now will he try to milk me or will he turn me in no way to know but he knows one thing for sure after tonight blackmailing you is risky business he probably didnt realize you were such a psycho i think hell keep playing me for a while if he turns me in he wont get another penny out of me no more drugs either you gave him drugs drew shrugs just some samples nothing big you know that guy on the hill couldnt shoot worth a damn he may not have been trying to hit us only to slow us down drew snorts at the idea of such half measures can we get out of here yet i ask he leans over the atv where the big padded seat usually sits and checks the rectangular box that holds the air filter then he snaps the seat back on pulls out the choke and turns the ignition key the engine turns over a few times dies he tinkers with something then turns the key a second time this time the motor sputters resentfully to life he nurses the throttle with a lovers touch and soon the motor is roaring with power ready he says with a satisfied smile the trip back to st stephens is much more agreeable than the rollercoaster ride out here if it werent for the wind chilling my wet clothes i might enjoy it several times we startle deer which freeze in our headlight with wide yellow eyes then explode into chaotic motion like panicked soldiers all the way we watch the ground for my springfield but we dont find it drew brings us out of the woods on the high rim of the stadium then drives swiftly around to the elementary school i worried that there might be a police car waiting but my car is still parked by itself in the shadows a police patrol would probably be drawn to the glaring stadium lights before rifle fire its not uncommon to hear rifle shots on this end of town after dark as poachers spotlight deer out of season did you drive all the way here on your fourwheeler i ask getting off the atv no my pickup is parked behind the main building do you need help loading this thing nah ive got some ramps i reach for the door to my saab then turn back to drew when was the last time you had sex with kate last night did you wear a condom he shakes his head shes on the pill she got pregnant while she was on the pill its highly unlikely he says thats what i kept telling her she always took it on time so the chance of pregnancy was really nil unless she got pregnant on purposei think but i only nod and open my door what is it drew asks by tomorrow a sample of your semen is going to be on its way to a dna lab somewhere new orleans is my guess and if the cops get any reason to test your blood against that sample youre going to look guilty of murder theres only one way to prevent that perception drew tell the police i was having an affair with her i nod again right now dont wait five minutes he cuts the hondas engine if i do that the first thing theyll do is ask me for a dna sample its still better than the alternative you tell them first they see you as trying to help you dontyoure guilty as hell drew ponders this if i were going to tell them who would i call the sheriff or the chief of police not shad johnson right like many communities natchez has suffered from a longrunning rivalry between city and county law enforcement and kates body was found right at the border of the city limits which could cause serious jurisdictional problems whoever you tell its going to get to shad eventually you might as well tell him first the only way to play this kind of thing is get out ahead of it and stay there if you volunteer the information people can get angry but they cant paint you as a liar think of ted kennedy at chappaquiddick tell it now drew before anyone beats you to the punch everything even that i found kates body i didnt hear that question brother he looks confused what do you mean we have a saying in the legal profession every client tells his story once meaning the first and only time you tell your story is on the witness stand that wayuntil that dayyou have time to adjust the truth to emerging facts disgust wrinkles his face a cynical view i admit i tell him but experience is a hard teacher if i hear you tell me one story tonight i cant put you on the stand and let you tell a different one later but im innocent he says i told you that drews handsome face is a study in the complexity of human emotion yes you did but youre not acting like a man with nothing to hide chapter mia burkes eyes go wide when i walk into the living room of my town house god what happened to you she asks i got a little wet she rises from her chair and drops the sheltering sky onto an ottoman youre bleeding am i yeah she walks into the hall and motions for me to follow her to the bathroom in the mirror over the sink i see abrasions all over my neck and arms and one long scrape on my left arm the burn on my right forearm is red and throbbing shitshe says softly yuck what your back is worse than your front it looks like youve got a bad cut under your shirt great youd better let me look i feel a little awkward in the bathroom with mia two days ago i wouldnt have thought twice about it but nowjust pull it up and see if i need stitches she laughs at my cautiousness then slowly lifts my shirt which is stuck to my back its a slash really it doesnt look too deep but its dirty are you about to get in the shower yes if i rub some soap into it you can rinse it out in the shower that should take care of it she slips around me and turns on the hot water tap then rubs soap into a blue washcloth until she has a thick lather are you going to cry she asks holding up the cloth and stepping behind me again lets find out the soap stings like sulfuric acid but mia has shamed me into silence are you crying she asks scrubbing like a hospital nurse i can feel her pulling apart the skin to clean inside the cut thinking about it whats lifehouse i ask remembering her tshirt a band old man youd like them ill make you a disk the humor disappears from her voice did whatever you went to do work out all right not as well as i hoped but at least nobody got killed thats good right right at last she removes the burning cloth from my back im going to leave the soap in there if you want it to stop hurting go take your shower thanks i can handle it from here she laughs her eyes flickering with humor despite the days events can you do you need me tomorrow after school if you can make it okay see you then she starts down the hall but i call after her have you heard anything else about kates death mia walks back to the bathroom door steve sayers and his dad are down at the sheriffs office right now answering questions steve was kates boyfriend figure of speech only do you know where he was this afternoon he told john ellis he drove down to his dads hunting camp near woodville after school to clean the place before turkey season woodville is a small logging town thirty miles south of natchez alone thats what steve told john there may have been somebody down at the camp when steve got there i hope so for steves sake this time of year i doubt it sosteve sayers may not have an alibi mia bites her lower lip and looks down the hall toward the front door shes wearing small sapphire studs in her ears ive never noticed them before suddenly she looks back at me her dark eyes intense you dont really think steve could have killed kate do you i dont know him his parents either what kind of boy is he hes okay kind of red i guess hes no brain surgeon his dads a game warden what can i say hes a jock of average intelligence violent mia shrugs hes been in a couple of fights but then most of the guys i know have the jocks anyway has the sheriffs department talked to anybody else that you know about no the police talked to mrs townsend not long ago thats what i heard anyway they asked for the names of kates closest friends do you know whose names she gave them no the truth is kate didnt have any close friends not for the past year or so i mean we all thought of her as a friend but nobody was really in her business you know half the time no one even knew where she was the police are going to find this fact very interesting did you ever ask her where she was or try to figure out where she might be not really steve did of course like i told you he always insisted she had some secret boyfriend one she was ashamed for us to know about but no one ever saw her with another guy im tempted to ask mia if she ever saw kate alone with drew she and her classmates might have seen them together and not thought twice about it but theres no point in alerting her to the true nature of that relationship was kate tight with any of the black kids at st stephens mia looks curiously at me why im not going to tell her about the blackmail call or drews assessment of the possible caller it might be important dont tell me theyre going to try to railroad a black guy for this why do you say that well from what ive read that used to happen all the time around here in the old days you know how it was thats why you took that civil rights case right yes and no the truth is im worried about them railroading a white guy for kates murder what about my question well we only have four black guys in our class were a pretty small class so everybody knows everybody but kate didnt have any special thing with any of the black guys you talking about sex not necessarily any special relationship ill ask around but tonight my answer is no okay i pull the towel tight across the cut on my back thanks for staying tonight im going to hit the shower now she smiles and gives me a little wave bye hey did caitlin call while i was gone no no calls her eyes probe mine for a hidden reaction to this news thanks her gaze lingers a moment longer and then she walks down the hall to the front door tell annie ill see her tomorrow afternoon i will thanks again the front door slams img stylewidth height hspace vspace src im almost asleep when the telephone rings beside my bed im too tired and sore to roll over and look at the caller id i took three advil after my shower knowing that without them id hardly be able to move in the morning the answering machine can get this one for me penn caitlin says after the beep her voice sounding clipped and very northern after mias soft drawl im sorry i didnt get your earlier calls i was at a party for a reporter whos leaving theherald and the band was so loud i couldnt hear anything im sure youre sleeping now look i got a call from one of our reporters at theexaminer she said a st stephens girl named kate townsend was murdered today raped and strangled she said or at least thats what it looks like no autopsy until tomorrow morning have you heard about that i think i played tennis with this girl at duncan park she was really sharp going to harvard she said welli guess i wont talk to you until tomorrow i hope we can see each other soon i know this sucks im really getting a lot done though i may crack this thing soon i hope the new books going well talk to you tomorrow i love you bye i was near to picking up the receiver when caitlin signed off im not sure why i didnt but i cant help wondering why a natchez reporter was able to get through to caitlin when i wasnt and half of her message was about kates murder almost as if she were calling me to get details for a story its not that i dont want to share things with her but i want her to be here to share actual experiences with me not call for reports when things sound interesting a wave of relief goes through me when the phone rings again i roll over onto one elbow and answer hey babe i murmur sorry i was half sleep before penn says a male voice yeah drew what is it i was surfing the web and i found a site maintained by the mississippi supreme court theyve got the whole criminal code posted there and from what i can tell statutory rape only applies to girls under sixteen not eighteen i blink in the darkness are you sure i remember the statute pretty well of course i learned it before moving to texas for fifteen years the legislature could have changed it heres the applicable language the crime of statutory rape is committed when any person seventeen years of age or older has sexual intercourse with a child who one is at least fourteen but under sixteen years of age there are qualifications but they all deal with even younger victims and the age difference between victim and perpetrator it also says neither the victims consent nor the victims lack of chastity is a defense to the charge of statutory rape they must have changed the statute i say in disbelief but even as relief courses through me a sense of foreboding rises in my mind drewi think i read somewhere that some states were moving in this direction because there were so many suits being brought by parents who hated their daughters boyfriends youve got two seventeenyearolds having consensual sex the guy turns eighteen and bam the girls parents try to lock him up for statutory rape so im in the clear under that statute i say uneasily but somehow i dont think youre out of the woods yet what is it i wonder searching my memory for the source of my anxiety theres definitely a sexual harassment issue here but of course thats a civil matter its criminal charges were worried about felonies in particular suddenly a voice is sounding in my head the voice of my old boss the district attorney of houston lascivious touching or handling of a minorcontributing to the delinquency of a minor and then the big one sexual drew are you still at your computer yes look up sexual battery i stare up at the dark ceiling listening to the clicking of keys and praying that my instinct is wrong what does it say just a minute okayuh read it aloud herea person is guilty of sexual battery if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a another person without his or her consent im okay there keep reading b a mentally defective mentally incapacitated or physically helpless person c a child at least fourteen but under sixteen years of age if the person is thirtysix or more months older than the child thank god drew sounds so relieved that im tempted to let him hang up and get a good nights sleep but im almost certain that bad news is coming keep reading okay theres a second paragraph a person is guilty of sexual battery if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a child under the age of his voice falters drew eighteen he whispers it says eighteen here keep reading oh god oh no please read it for me if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a child under the age of eighteen years if the person is in a position of trust or authority over the child including without limitation the childs teacher counselor physician psychiatrist psychologist minister drews voice sounds like that of a man being sedated before an operation a monotone fading into nothingness you can stop drew he continues as though he cant hear me over the print screaming from his computer monitor priest physical therapist chiropractor legal guardian parent stepparent aunt uncle scout leader or coach drew listen to me are you listening out of a deep well of silence comes a single sob drew its all right i know youre feeling terrible guilt right now seeing it written down like that you may feel for the first time that youre guilty of a crime shes dead he says in a shattered voice and if i hadnt crossed this line with her shed be alive right now you dont know that youre not god listen to me buddy i love you i love you and i respect you youre just human like the rest of us wait a minute he says wetly im looking for the penalty dont leave that for tomorrow i need to see it no you donti say silently its going to be thirty years jesus christ its thirty years thats not going to happen drew i promise you that oh my god he says with fresh dread what what is it for a second offense its forty years timmy would be turn off that computer thats not the real world drew are you sure hell yes i was a prosecutor for fifteen years thats why you wanted my advice about all this remember and my advice is to go to sleep and let me do the worrying for you thats what youre paying me for twenty bucks doesnt pay for much worrying i dont reply for some time then i say you saved my life and you risked your own to do it if you hadnt my daughter would never have been born that buys you a lot of worrying you never asked for this no but i can handle it youve got to stay in control for me though youre not leaving town or anything tomorrow are you no way now what are you going to do about the blackmail issue are you going to come clean with the cops after what we just learned i dont know youre a smart guy drew lets talk about probability okay how often did you see kate i dont mean platonically how often were you alone with her intimate with her every day or night rather unbelievablefor how long for the last seven months i guess ever since the mission trip to honduras after that we couldnt stand to be apart get out ahead of this thing drew its your only chance i hear you i let the silence do its work for a while do you its tim thats holding me back i dont want him to have to know about this if he doesnt have to i dont want him to have to go through the grief hell get at school because of it i dont even wantellen to have to deal with it now that kates dead theres just no reason anymore yes there is this thing is beyond your control now no matter what you do its eventually going to come out im not so sure if kate said she didnt tell anybody she didnt then whos blackmailing you kates killers i grunt noncommittally imnot so sure i know but i am he breathes steadily into the phone thanks for tonight penn i mean it night buddy the open line hisses in my ear i hang up chapter drews blackmailers lost no time making him pay for his indecisiveness at the next morning i was helping my mother paint some bookshelves in her garage when my cell phone rang the screen showed drew as the caller i walked out of the garage under the pretext of getting better cell reception then answered by saying are you as sore as i am you were right he said im fucked a current of anxiety shot through me but experience kept my voice calm whats happened i just got off the phone with shad johnson he got an anonymous call this morning let me guess the caller said you were having an affair with kate townsend and that you might have killed her yep did he give any details johnson didnt say so what did shad ask you during the call did he ask straight out if the accusation was true no he basically said doc i hate to have to call you about this but i got this call with an accusation and i wouldnt be doing my duty if i didnt ask you about it he was pretty friendly actually shad johnson is not your friend i understand that i was just giving you his tone he said he wanted to give me a chance to deny it as soon as possible so that it doesnt become any kind of thing thing that was his word yeah its already a thing drew you can bet your ass on that did you flatout deny that you were seeing kate no i sighed with relief i acted stunned he said which i was i told him i was too shocked even to respond to such an outrageous accusation that kate was a close friend of our family and that wed been shattered by her death shad said he understood he said hed like to talk to me about it at his office he said i might have information about kate that could help them piece together a better picture of her than they have now what did you say to that what could i say i told him i wanted to do everything i could to assist the investigation okay when is this meeting lunch today fifty minutes from now shitwas it a short call long what short thats because shad got what he wanted he thinks hes going to question you on his territory hes not not unless youre a complete moronwhich after last night im starting to believe penn damn it why didnt you volunteer the information last night like i told you to you know why i didnt want tim and ellen to have to deal with it if they didnt have to well now they have to what do i do penn you really need a lawyer now i told you that last night and i told you i wasnt your guy not for this the meetings in fifty minutes i bowed my head in resignation the odds of finding a natchez lawyer qualified to take that meeting were low and the odds of adequately briefing one in time were nil where are you now at my office seeing patients youre off at twelve yeah you just had an emergency drew was silent for a moment im skipping the meeting im going in your place is that the best thing we need to get some idea of what shad is thinking id also like to know what the autopsy turned up shad probably has the pathologists report in hand by now i dont want to think about that this is kate were talking about youd better get used to itsorry nowwe have a tricky little problem to deal with think before you answer me okay okay the first thing shad is going to ask me is where you were when kate was murdered he wont be obvious about it but hell ask and i happen to know you were at the murder scene where did you go after you left the creek home i was silent long enough for drew to realize that if he was lying he had better come clean then or stick with his story was ellen there no she was at her sisters place what about tim the maid had taken him to his music lesson so nobody can verify that you were home i answered some emails soon after i got there couldnt we use those maybe but depending on how narrow a window theyve established as time of death the emails probably wont put you in the safety zone tim got home around five and ellen about six okay its also possible that someone saw your car parked in that vacant lot in pinehaven for that reason and for others i cant predict now i may decide i need to tell shad the truth everything today the affair the blackmail everything drew said nothing in fact the more i think about it the more i think coming clean may still be the best option we have even lying by omission digs a hole they can bury you in later a woman on drews end of the line called out a blood pressure reading drew lowered his voice youre my lawyer penn i trust your instincts say whatever you think you need to im innocentof murder anywayand im not going to hide anything except to protect my son what could i say to that ill call you when the meetings over keep your cell phone wired to your hip and dont answer any calls until you hear from me dont talk to anybody i wont i hung up and turned back to the garage my mother was watching me with a quizzical look on her face in that moment i realized just how far my life had already slid off its accustomed track after dropping annie at school this morning i drove down to the football field and searched it for my lost pistol failing to find it i went up to the high school and told coach wade anders to keep an eye out for it anders is the athletic director of st stephens and he promised to have his assistants search the bowl again before any kids were allowed into it he also asked if i knew anything about the switch box for the stadium lights being shot up i told him i didnt but that id send someone to install a new box as soon as possible he looked at me in silence for a little while then nodded as though we shared a special understanding like everybody anders was building up capital where he could the lost gun problem didnt end there the land that drew and i chased the blackmailer over is owned by a group of investors who use it as a hunting camp i called the doctor who heads the group to tell him i might have lost a pistol on their land and to ask his members to keep an eye out for it when he asked what i was doing on their land i made up a story about a troublesome armadillo rooting up the st stephens football fieldan armadillo i chased onto their land in my singleminded quest to kill it remarkably he laughed as though he understood completely mom im sorry i said but i need to go take care of something is everything all right she asked her eyes making it clear that she knew better yes its not annie is it no no are you and caitlin all right were fine mom this is just some legal business she went back to painting the shelves with long smooth strokes of her brush at sixtyeight she works with the strength and flexibility of someone twenty years her junior being raised in the country does that for some people when i arrived at the house this morning mom held up the newspaper and asked me about kates death thankfully caitlins staff had reported only the known facts which left my mother as curious as the rest of the town and like most of the town mom believes drew elliott hung the moon she often says that drew is the only young doctor who practices medicine with the conscientiousness of my father what would she say if she knew that he was sleeping with kate townsend until the day she died be careful mom called as i walked to my car i will i called thinking that was good advice to follow when dealing with shadrach johnson img stylewidth height hspace vspace src the district attorneys office is on the third floor of the waterworks building in lawyers alley across from the massive city courthouse in a town filled with architecturally significant buildings the waterworks is nothing special a threestory concrete block with one glassbrick corner enclosing the staircase i park under the courthouse oaks and cross the street waving at one of my parents neighbors as she walks into the dmv office theres no receptionist behind the door on the ground floor just a staircase as i climb the stairs my errand weighs heavy below my heart ive got to tell shad johnson the truth as i know itup to a point anyway drew had sex with kate the night before she died so i have to assume that the state pathologist has already recovered his semen from her body and while no judge would order drew to take a dna test based solely on an anonymous telephone call shad may already have more proof connecting drew to kate last night drew told me hed been intimate with kate for the past seven months how many seventeenyearold girls could sleep with a fortyyearold man that long without telling a single friend about it if kate told her mother about the affair why not her best friend and with kate dead at the hands of a killer how long will it take jenny townsendhowever much she may like drewto tell the police what she knows shad may already have proof of the affair he may have called this meeting simply to see if drew will lie about it using the lesser crime of sexual battery as a litmus test for deception before questioning drew about the murder i did the same thing many times as a prosecutor when i reach the third floor a heavy female secretary with dyedorange hair and a flowerprint dress gives me a quizzical look from behind a glass partition five years ago shad had a male factotum who dressed like malcolm x but he vanished shortly after shads mayoral defeat this woman was obviously expecting drew who is known on sight by most natchezians im pretty wellknown myself but in a small town no one ever quite attains the celebrity of the best doctors my father is testament to that fact he cant walk twenty yards in walmart without being stopped by adoring or inquisitive patients im mr johnsons noon appointment i tell the secretary no youre not you expecting dr drew elliot she looks confused thats right im his attorney her lips form a perfect o just like they do in cartoons youre penn cage i am im dr elliotts attorney the expression of surprise morphs into an uncertain glare i know about you your boss and i once went a few rounds over a civil rights murder she picks up the phone and begins speaking in a hushed tone my statement about the civil rights murder is true the irony of that case is that i the white lawyer was crusading to solve the twentyyearold murder of a black man while shad the black politician was trying to bury the case to keep from upsetting the white voters he needed to win the mayors office the secretary hangs up and buzzes me through the door end of the hall she says curtly as soon as i enter the blandly painted corridor a door at the far end opens and a black man a few inches shorter than i peers out an expression of annoyance on his face son of a bitch he says without a trace of southern accent i was having a good day until now hello shad the district attorney shakes his head then walks back into his office squaring his shoulders for combat as he goes i follow him inside and wait to be invited to sit as usual shadrach johnson is dressed to the nines in a bespoke suit and italian shoes his hair has a little more gray in it than the last time we locked horns but his eyes still flash with quick intelligence my first impression of him was of a brash personal injury lawyer and nothing in the intervening years has changed that shads jutting jaw greets the world with a perpetual challenge his eyes project arrogance and mistrust and his shoulders stay flexed under the weight of an invisible yet enormous chip your buddys not playing this right cage he says taking a seat behind an enormous desk that looks like an antique an innocent man doesnt send his lawyer to speak for him in a situation like this have a seat go for iti tell myself turn on the gravitas and recite the lines you rehearsed on the way over this is a very serious matter shad dr elliott was indeed seeing the dead girl but he did not kill her you and i have to set aside our personal history and help the police to find a dangerous killer dr elliott wants to assist the investigation in every way but he also wants to keep this unfortunate matter from escalating into something that could ruin reputations and break up families unnecessarily i was prepared to say those things but now that im actually facing shad johnson something stops me it all seemed so clear in the car pay the shortterm price for a longterm gain but this office as modest as it is gives me the old feeling i had when i worked for the da in houston irrevocable decisions are made in this room decisions about who will be punished and who will not who will spend decades in prison who will die at the hands of the state for any prosecutor drew elliott would be a juicy target but for a man like shad johnsona man who dreams of being governor and moredrew is a prize elephant theres no doubt that drew would look better to a future jury if he told the truth now but what other consequences might result natchez is a small town and when smalltown cops are handed a likely suspect they dont look too hard for another truth be told city cops arent much different and confessing to the affair with kate would immediately open drew to a sexual battery charge that shad could use to jail him should he choose to no better to keep my cards close to the vest thats a lot nicer desk than the one the last da had i observe stalling for time as i take the chair opposite shad the district attorney cant help but brag its his nature i got it out of storage from the old natchez museum he says rubbing the finely grained wood it came from the attic of one of the antebellum homes longwood i think ironic isnt it me working at a cotton planters desk i had it appraised its worth sixty grand i give shad a level gaze i hope youre not one of those people who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing shads eyes narrow what are you doing here penn wheres dr elliott he had an emergency at his office he had to stay and handle it bullshit your clients scared his dicks got him tangled up in a capital murder case and hes terrified shad must have more than the anonymous call in his pocket how do you figure that did elliott tell you about the call i got this morning he said you mentioned an anonymous caller who told you some story about him being intimate with kate townsend thats right and the good doctor did not deny it did he confirm it thats what this meeting was for for him to confirm or deny now hes sent you in his place the bigtime mouthpiece i didnt think you practiced anymore i wasnt practicing when i took the del payton case either shad looks like he just bit into something sour my punishing del paytons murderers after shad had resisted reopening the case cost him just enough support in the black community to take the mayoral election away from him but thats old news ive got to get a handle on his present intentions before i paint myself into a corner shad lets stop he says jabbing a forefinger at me youre here because you want something hes right i would like to know what was discovered during kates autopsy shad studies me for several moments and you think im just going to give that to you if you continue to pursue my client ill get it one way or another why dont we try to foster a spirit of cooperation here you havent done any cooperating with me so far he lifts a sheaf of fax paper off his desk and flips to the last page but im feeling generous what do you want to know time of death shad shakes his head well pass on that for now cause strangulation there was also head trauma that might have killed the girl if she hadnt been strangled first interesting there are rumors going around town about rape nurses at the hospital did some talking was the girl raped or not the pathologist says she was genital trauma shad nods slowly did they recover semen from her affirmative both holes his crudeness is meant to shock but i saw too much rape and murder in houston for this to bother me so the killer had some time with her shad shakes his head a strange smile on his face not necessarily the pathologist already ran serology on the semen samples they came from two different men a glimmer of hope sparks in my soul multiple assailants you could read it that way what other way is there you have a different scenario in mind after the call i got this morning you cant blame me for speculating a little im listening shad leans over his desk and steeples his fingers lets say dr elliott was having an affair with this high school girl in his mind its true love then he finds out his prom queens been sharing the poonanny with somebody else when hes not around her old boyfriend say the doc finds out and he flips out maybe kate is cruel about how she tells himyou know some women so your client starts choking her trying to make her shut up before he knows what hes doing hes shut her up for good by that scenario the girl wasnt raped at all shad waves his hand as though at a minor annoyance rape is a subjective finding in a dead girl shes not accusing anybody so she had some genital trauma rough consensual sex can cause that hell ive had women get mad if i didnt traumatize them down there youre reaching shad he settles back in his chair i dont think so ill tell you something else for free the st stephens homecoming queen was pregnant shithow far along a little over four weeks and that according to the laws of the great state of mississippimakes this a double homicide counselor shad arches his eyebrows in mock concern the communitys going to be very upset by that idea the murder of an unborn baby you know i can see some people speculating that dr elliott was just playing with this poor girlgetting a little on the sideand when she turned up pregnant he saw his nice little life crashing down around him he saw thirty years in parchman for having sex with a juvenile patient so he killed her i suddenly see a glimpse of the future this case is going to trial and drew elliott will be the defendant whether he deserves to be or not thank god i didnt march in here spouting his secrets the public shouldnt be able to make that kind of speculation i say evenly because they shouldnt associate my clients name with this case in any way shad smiles and shakes his head weve got a simple situation here counselor somebody is making telephone calls saying your client was screwing the dead girl i cant control that callers actions so youve got to assume that dr elliots name is going to be in the street soon the best thing drew can do for himself is provide us a dna sample and clear his name as quickly as possible if his dna doesnt match what the pathologist swabbed out of the girl nobody can ever say a word against him check and mateif im going to come clean about the affair before the trial now is the time but the truth as i know it will only lend credence to shads first scenariomurder committed in a jealous rage you asked about time of death shad reminds me if youll tell me where dr elliott was during the hours surrounding it ill give you the time of death no deal were getting way ahead of ourselves shads eyes glint with a predators love of the hunt what about the fishermen who found the girls body i ask trying to take shads mind off drews alibi have you ruled them out theyre down at the hospital providing dna samples as we speak they couldnt wait to do it damnand kate townsends boyfriend steve sayers same deal shad taps the cherry desktop with manicured fingernails the boys alibi is a little weak but he couldnt wait to get over to the hospital and give blood he offered to whack off in a cup right here in my office says he hasnt had sex with the victim in months seems miss townsend just up and stopped putting out no explanation and before that she was as hot as they come according to the sayers boy kinky he said shad gives me a cagey look you think she got religion i keep my face impassive shad smiles and leans back in his chair the bottom line is this i need dna from everybody who might have known the townsend girl in the biblical sense and any reasonable man would have to include your client on that list now everybody but your client is chomping at the bit to give me said sample your client on the other hand has sent his celebrity mouthpiece down here to talk for him so ill ask you straight out is dr elliott going to provide a dna sample to the state in the interest of expediting this investigation or is he not i choose my words with great care no judge would order my client to give a blood sample on the basis of an anonymous call alone shad concedes this with a slight inclination of his head that may be true but in the interest of protecting the community what innocent man would object to it in a perfect world id agree but if it got out that you asked drew elliott to give a dna sample in connection with this murderand itwould get out if he compliedthe rumor alone could destroy him its practically a child molestation charge the stigma would never go away you cant keep his name out of this mess cage our mystery caller didnt telephone just me this morning i cover my mouth and swallow hard who else sheriff byrd and the chief of police our callers a persistent fellow he seems to believe strongly in his cause did you trace the source of the calls from phone records they originated from a pay phone on the north side of downtown the black section shad inclines his head again this fits what drew told me about the blackmailers voice did the police fingerprint the phone theyre working that angle but no matches yet shad suddenly gives me a look of honest puzzlement the thing is penn accusing dr elliott of this affair seems so out of left field its hard to imagine anyone making it up you know if its not true who would eventhink of it somebody who hates drew elliott shad turns up his palms from what i gather the good doctor hasnt got an enemy in the world everybody talks about him like hes a saint theres a reason for that hes a genuinely good man another beatific smile then hes got nothing to worry about the way i see it providing a dna sample is about the only way dr elliott is going to be able to preserve his sterling reputation theres no way im letting drew go down to the st catherines hospital lab for a dna test the mans on staff there for gods sake word would shoot through that building in less than an hour by nightfall everybody in town would know about it shad leans back and speaks in a cold voice im sorry to hear that because if he doesnt ill be forced to consider other alternatives such as well ive been sitting here thinking about that one thing its the first week of the month that means the grand jurys in session probably will be for two more days they might be real interested in hearing about this situation about the anonymous call and about the strange coincidences like how dr elliott lives upstream on that creek where the girls body was found they might just decide they want a dna sample from the doctor on their own jesusthats unethical shad youd be perverting the purpose of the grand jury it doesnt exist to investigate crimes and for your information at least a thousand people live upstream on that creek maybe more shads eyes brim with confidence just a thought counselor but emotions are running high in this town people want a brutal killer like this caught and punished thats my sole interest here and im not going to let the fact that your client is white and rich stop me from getting to the bottom of this poor girls death that kind of miscarriage of justice stopped the day i took over this office like a chess player experiencing a flash of insight i suddenly see a dozen moves down the board and what i see sends a rush of adrenaline through my veins this conversation isnt about murder at allits about politics i should have realized that before i walked in the door the mayoral election shad lost five years ago was the most hotly contested in natchez history he lost to riley warren a twoterm white incumbent with a flamboyant style and a love for backroom business schemes that earned him the nickname wiley while some of those schemes benefited the city others weighed it down with suffocating debt and by the end of his termlast summereven wileys supporters suspected that hed enriched himself more than the city he was elected to serve shad might have defeated warren then but he was only halfway into his first term as district attorney it wouldnt have looked good for him to resign after the promises hed made to rectify racial inequalities in natchezs criminal courts despite dwindling support wiley warren ran for mayor a third time his enemies polled local worthies in search of an opposition candidatemyself included like most who were asked i declined to enter the fray ultimately warrens enemies ran a rather dim bulb named doug jones against their nemesis and despite joness utter lack of distinction or vision he handily defeated warren in the primary the only black candidate to step forward was a funeral director with a checkered past a man with enemies of his own in the black community black turnout was low on election day and doug jones won by a to percent margin the newly honorable mayor jones took office and promptly became the invisible man if he took no bold new initiatives for the city neither did he make any tragic mistakes he managed this by doing almost nothing at all but shortly after christmas he finally did do something he held a press conference and announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and would resign his office within ninety days that was two months ago if mayor jones pulls the trigger within the next four weeks as promised then the chief executive office of the city will be up for grabs local election rules dictate that once the mayors office is vacated a special election must be held within fortyfive days sitting here in this office i realize just how important that fact is to shad johnson if shad were to convict a rich white doctor of capital murder he could pronounce his election promises to the black community fulfilled and enter the mayoral race with a united front behind himsomething that didnt happen five years ago the seemingly boundless confidence in shads eyes triggers another revelation he doesnt even have to convict drew even if shad loses he wins politically in the black community just for making the effort he can always blame a courtroom loss on the white mans secret manipulation of the system i look shad hard in the eyes but speak softly youre going to run for mayor again he blinks like a reptile basking in the sun no comment counselor you think putting drew elliott in parchman is your ticket to a unified black electoral base shad attempts to dispose of my theory with a wave of his hand our business here is to rule out dr elliott as a murder suspectif we canso that my officers can get on with the investigation of this heinous crime spoken as though for reportersmy new understanding of the political situation has sent my mind racing down a dozen different paths but im not here to figure out the future of natchez im here to protect drew elliott all right i say in a tone of surrender what about this dr elliott has a laboratory in his office send over a couple of police officers right now during his lunch hour his lab tech can draw the blood you needdo a buccal swab whateverand the cops can attest that its his the chain of custody remains intact and so does dr elliotts reputation shad nods i can live with that i look at my watch id better call him i thought he had an emergency hes probably handled it by now i get up and offer shad my hand he takes it but he squeezes gently rather than shakes then withdraws his hand i hope your boy comes up clean penn if he doesnt he will shad looks surprised by my statement but i was talking about kates murder nothing else im almost to the door when he says penn about the mayoral situation i turn and regard him steadily yes i heard some local power brokers asked you to run against wiley warren last year thats right i wasnt interested not interested in running against warren or not interested in being mayor both neither shad studies me with unguarded curiosity the towns in a lot different place than it was a year ago youre right im sad to say it kills him to ask the next question are you still not interested i turn up my palms then smile easily no more than you have a good day shad outside the das office i stand in the sun and stare across the street at the courthouse somewhere inside a simple white man named doug jones is wrestling with his fear of death and deciding when to resign the office of mayor im surprised hes waited two months given the gravity of his diagnosis i watched an uncle die of lung cancer and ive forgotten neither my horror nor his pain but while mayor jones struggles with his mortality shad johnson watches from across the street like a hungry vulture waiting to draw life from death my new appreciation of shads deeper motive has clarified drews situation if shad can get sufficient evidence he will rush drew to trial in record time hoping to convict himor at least garner a weeks worth of headlinesbefore mayor jones resigns but drews legal jeopardy is not the sole reason for my interest in shads political intentions for the past six months despite my decision not to seek the office of mayor a year ago i have been pondering the idea of entering the special election my reasons are simple one month into doug joness administration the international paper companythe largest employer in the countyannounced that it would close its natchez mill after fifty years of continuous operation the shock to the community still hasnt passed closure came swiftly and about a month ago the severance pay of former employees began to peter out so did their heath insurance benefits and ip was merely the last in a short but devastatingly complete line of local manufacturing companies to shut down triton battery armstrong tire and rubber johnsmanville that leaves tourism the only industry pumping outside dollars into natchez and tourism is a seasonal business in a single year natchez has been transformed from a fairly healthy city into a community on the edge weve lost more than five hundred families in the wake of the ip closure and more are leaving every week in natchez boasted more millionaires than every city in america except new york and philadelphia the money flowing in as cotton flowed out by the hundreds of thousands of bales but as the soil was slowly depleted cotton farming moved north to the delta and natchez entered a period of decline then in oil was discovered practically beneath the streets by the year i was born the city was flush with millionaires again and natchez became a truly magical place in which to grow up but in the price of oil crashed and the reagan administration sacrificed domestic oil producers in his battle to win the cold war the number of local oil companies dwindled from sixty to seven and by the time the price of oil began to climb again there wasnt enough industry left to exploit what remained of our depleted reserves without visionary leadership natchez will soon shrink to a quaint hamlet of ten or twelve thousand peoplemostly retirees service workers and people on welfareand the thriving city of twentyfive thousand that i grew up in will be only a memory when i first heard about doug joness terrible diagnosis i sensed the hand of fate offering this city a final opportunity for salvation and to my surprise i felt a powerful surge of civic responsibility swelling in my heart shad johnson will tell voters he felt a similar call to public service but i know him too well to believe that five years ago he left his chicago law firm to return to natchez and run one of the most cynical campaigns ive ever witnessed on either a local or national level im proud that my efforts in the courtroom helped snatch victory from his grasp but it was black voters who ultimately did that enough of them saw through shads theatrical skills to tip the balance against him they closed their eyes gritted their teeth and voted for what they hoped was a harmless white man but as shad himself said earlier natchez was a different city a year ago now we are in crisis and a man who does nothing during a crisis is as bad as a man who causes one as i stare at the great white courthouse my cell phone rings i climb into my saab and answer are you out of the meeting drew asks in a tense voice did you see the autopsy report no questions about his future only about what happened to kate is that because he loved her so dearly or because he has something to fearshe was strangled drew thats what i thought he says quietly from the petechiae around her eyes was she pregnant yes four weeks along a sharp intake of breath thats why she was so desperate to see me jesus what about stop talking drew we can go into details later right now we have a problem the district attorney wants a sample of your dna silence the pathologist found semen inside kates body theres no point in telling drew that the pathologist found the semen of two different men and in two different locations of course i expected that given what you told me about the previous night im listening shad wants to prove you murdered kate he wants to prove it badly does he really think im capable of that all men are capable of that drew we can talk about shads motives later right now under these circumstances giving him the sample is the best thing you can do itll buy us three or four weeks while the lab does the test and time is what we need more than anything right now why because the police may have caught the real murderer long before the test is completed or even begun and by that point it wont matter nearly so much that you were having sex with kate townsend in fact if shad gets a confession from someone else i might be able to persuade him to cancel the test altogether youd probably have to make a massive contribution to his next political campaignwhich will be sooner than anyone suspectsbut i think you could live with that okay fine but what about the autopsy what else did the report show latershad wanted you to waltz into the st catherines hospital lab and give the blood sample but i worked out a compromise which is can you trust your lab technician susan sure shes been with me nine years good because in the next hour a couple of cops are going to show up at your office and watch susan draw some blood from your arm okay and drew yes from now on dont answer any questions from anybody without talking to me first nothing you got that okay youd better get things straight with susan i will are you going to be here when they draw the blood is your office empty during lunch like a cemetery all right ill come by and make sure they dont hassle you for pubic hairs or anything like that thanks as i hang up and start my car a tall bigbellied white man wearing a brown uniform and a gray cowboy hat swaggers by my car and turns into the doorway of the district attorneys office he is billy byrd the sheriff of adams county as sheriff byrd pulls open the das door he glances back at me and gives me a superior smile as though he already knows exactly what transpired in the office upstairs a few minutes ago and of course he does welcome to mississippi politics chapter shads emissaries arrive at drews medical lab before i do but theyre not cops as i expected theyre sheriffs deputies i can tell by the big yellow star on the door of the white cruiser parked outside this tells me that in the investigation of drew elliott the district attorney has chosen to align himself with the fat man in the cowboy hat who walked by my car a few minutes ago rather than with the chief of police who by any standard of common sense should be handling this matter drew practices in a suite of offices maintained by natchez doctors hospital which is located behind the cluster of primary care clinics that feed patients to the main facility the front door of drews office is unlocked i enter to find his waiting room dark theres light in the corridor beyond it but the door to the hall is locked after i bang loudly a young womans face appears behind the receptionists window she waves then buzzes me into the corridor drews lab is right across the hall a brightly lit rectangle containing centrifuges microscopes and expensive blood chemistry machines against the far wall a blue phlebotomists chair stands beside a white refrigerator drew himself is reclining in the chair one shirtsleeve rolled up past his elbow i step in and find two deputies standing with their backs to the wall opposite drew they look uncomfortable i recognize one of them tom jackson was the top detective at the police department until the sheriff hired him away which wasnt hard to do the county pays cops about five thousand a year more than the city does jackson is as tall as drew and his handlebar mustache gives him the look of a cowboy in a frederic remington painting he gives me a friendly nod but his partnera short blackhaired man with pasty skindoesnt even acknowledge me tom says drew this is penn cage a buddy of mine i know penn jackson says in a deep voice both deputies must know why im here but drew seems to want to preserve the illusion of a friendly gettogether he nods past me and i turn to see the whiteuniformed woman who let me in shes in her midthirties with short brown hair and a heartshaped face distinguished by intelligent brown eyes penn this is susan salter my med tech nice to meet you susan she manages a slight nod she looks the least comfortable of us all well says drew lets get this over with susan takes a long white box from a cabinet and looks at the deputies you said four tubes thats what our evidence technician told us says tom jackson i guess they want to make sure they dont have to ask for more blood later susan removes four vacuum tubes with purple stoppers from the box and lays them flat on one arm of the chair then she straps a velcro tourniquet around drews left biceps and slaps his antecubital vein three times a vein like a rigid blue pipe stands up at the place where drews arm muscles insert at the inner elbow susan pushes the stopper end of one of the tubes into a vacutainer syringe then with a single deft motion pricks the needle into drews vein and presses the stopper of the tube down onto the rear of the needle with her thumb a fountain of dark blood begins filling the tube sucked inward by the vacuum inside it the short deputy looks away i need to use the restroom he mumbles down the hall to your right says drew the deputy disappears as susan replaces the full tube with an empty one i realize her hands are shaking shes playing out a scene she couldnt possibly have imagined an hour ago how much has drew told her i wonder tom i say taking advantage of the other deputys absence what do you figure the time of death was jackson looks warily at me you dont know the da wouldnt tell me he sighs and shakes his head people are acting mighty squirrelly about this case id like to help you out though will you wellwe know the girl didnt leave the school until three the fishermen say they found her about sixtwenty what did the body temperature tell you jackson glances uncomfortably at the door i dont know about all that i heard theyre not sure how long she was in the water best guess the short deputy walks through the door looks at jackson and smiles it seems a strange thing to do but it shuts jackson up when the four tubes lie full of blood on a table and the tourniquet has been removed from drews arm tom steps forward with a plastic evidence bag and holds it open susan drops the tubes inside drew shakes his head looking more than anything like an innocent man doing his best to humor overzealous cops that it guys jackson nods thats it doc sorry to bother you with this how long do you think it will take to get the dna results i ask usually takes a month at least tom replies theyll probably rush this considering the situation but two and a half weeks is the fastest ive ever seen out of new orleans anyway this is exactly what i expected drew stands and offers tom his hand and jackson gives it a strong shake in all likelihood tom is a patient of drews but when drew offers his hand to the shorter deputy the man turns without a word and leaves the lab tom shrugs sheepishly then follows his partner out drew looks at susan i guess i screwed up your lunch hour she forces a smile thats okay im not hungry drew gives me a pointed glance and i realize he needs to speak further with susan in private ill give you a call later i tell him starting for the door wait he says have you had lunch yet im starving i was about to get something why dont we eat together we ought to talk about a couple of things i dont want to risk talking about this situation in public tell you what ill grab some food and come back here we can eat in your office drew looks dismayed but then he seems to get it okay see you in a few minutes no hamburgers i leave the office and go out to my car my mind on susan and her ability to keep quiet i feel like thai food but the only thai restaurant is downtown and it would take too long to get there and back to drews office the only options on this side of town are fast food and ruby tuesdays i pull into the drivethrough lane at taco bell and order a couple of zesty chicken bowls some tacos and two mountain dews which the restaurant delivers in record time then i pull back onto the bypass and get into the turning lane for jefferson davis boulevard the street that leads to drews office while i wait for the light to change the blare of a police siren pierces my ears several vehicles behind me pull onto the grassy median and then a police car with blue lights flashing screeches to a stop behind me with nowhere else to go i shoot across two oncoming lanes of traffic and pull my right wheels onto the curb of jeff davis boulevard the squad car roars past me this kind of thing is pretty unusual in natchez at midday maybe thats what triggers my intuition but in any case i hit the accelerator and take off in pursuit of the squad car the blue lights swerve into a parking lot on the right side of jeff davis boulevard sure enough its drews office what the hell could have happened so fasti wonder skidding into the lot behind the police car and then i see a muscular man in a blue cap is brandishing a wooden baseball bat at drew who stands in a half crouch with his hands held out from his body susan salter is screaming at the man to put down the bat two uniformed cops leap from the squad car as one draws a can of pepper spray from his belt i see two other men lying on the ground not far from the man with the bat one rolls over onto his back clutching his bloodied face in pain drop that batyells one of the cops whos holding a deadly steel baton called an asp the man with the bat jerks his head toward the cop and at that moment i realize something alarming the blue cap hes wearing is a st stephens bucks baseball cap which almost certainly makes him not a man at all but a boy from the rear his size and muscularity gave him the appearance of an adult but when i read the letters on the back of his jerseysayerseverything clicks the boy with the bat is steve sayers kate townsends exboyfriend why are you pointing that at mesayers screams at the cop his eyes blazing with anger or fear and maybe both hesthe one look what he did steve points to the men on the ground and i recognize one of them as a st stephens senior what the hell is going on as the cop yells again for sayers to drop the bat steve swings the louisville slugger in a great roundhouse arc drew ducks beneath the whistling wood and steve keeps spinning as the bat comes around a second time drew springs forward and snatches it from steves hands get back steve he shouts i dont want to fight you but sayers is beyond rational thought he lunges for drews throat his eyes filled with rage with a lightning motion drew thrusts the fat end of the bat into steves midsection theres an explosive grunt and steve folds over the bat and drops to his knees sucking for air in the same moment a cloud of pepper spray envelops steve and drew steve screams and drew begins clawing at his eyes with his free hand thats enoughi yell at the cop thats dr drew elliott im his attorney theres no more danger drop the bat doctor the cop yells at drew again drop it drew i shout but steve sayers isnt done somehow he gets to his feet and charges drew like a blind bull drew must be blind himself because he takes the brunt of the charge in his belly from reflex he pops steve across the upper back with the bat and this time the boy drops to the cement and stays there drew tosses the bat away and holds up his hands in surrender the cop with the pepper spray takes a pair of handcuffs from his belt rushes up to drew and cuffs his hands behind his back i was defending myself drew protests tears streaming down his face penn these kids attacked me i tried to talk to them but they wouldnt listen hes telling the truth shouts drews med tech stepping forward the other cop has cuffed steve sayers and is now checking the other boys on the ground what happened here maam asks the first cop susan salter swallows and tries to collect herself dr elliott and i were just standing here talking and these kids drove up and started cursing they picked the fight i have no idea why it was crazy dr elliott did everything he could to avoid it whats your name maam susan salter im dr elliotts medical technologist the cop turns to me youre dr elliotts lawyer yes i am officer penn cage as you saw my client was clearly defending himself but as serious as this looks its still misdemeanor assault and i very much doubt that my client will press charges he knows these boys and im sure it was all a misunderstanding isnt that right drew drew looks in my direction with tears streaming down his face uhthats right officer we were just horsing around and it got out of hand bullshit yells one of the boys on the ground that bastard tried to kill us he broke my fucking nose the cop points at steve sayers in that kids hands a baseball bat is a deadly weapon it looked like aggravated assault to me the cop is right steve sayers is at least sixfootone and he has the hyperinflated musculature i associate with the use of anabolic steroids all three boys do come to think of it which makes me think of marko bakic and his little drug business at st stephens aggravated assault is a felony officer i say evenly steves a good kid theres no reason to put a felony arrest on his record everybody wait right here says the cop who looks young enough to be a rookie hes not going to make decisions involving prominent citizens without some advice from a superior as he goes back to his squad car to use the radio i turn to one of the seniors on the ground what the hell were you guys doing kiss my ass he barks that bastard needs his ass kicked fucking cradlerobber pervert then it hits me they know about drew and kate id like to question drew but the second cop is standing too close to him i try to catch drews eye but the pepper spray has rendered those organs useless for the time being when the young cop returns from his car he walks right past me informs drew that hes under arrest for aggravated assault then begins reading him his miranda rights the other cop takes his cue and does the same to steve sayers what are you guys doing i ask in the calmest voice i can muster dr elliott was clearly defending himself you heard what he said during the fight judgell decide that says the young cop step back sir the most you can arrest him for is simple assault im just doing what the chief told me to do the chief of police told you to do this thats right you got a problem take it up with him ill do that i reply but what im thinking is son of a bitch this situation is becoming more political by the minute the police chief should have ordered the patrolman to let drew go or at most to arrest him for simple assault then release him on a recognizance bond an arrest for aggravated assault can only mean one thing the chief wants drew and steve in his custody and the only reason i can see for that is the longrunning turf war between the police department and the sheriffs office in the arena of that conflict the police chief has been handed a gift from the gods he can now hold sheriff byrds two main murder suspects in his jail for at least one night the boys cuss and spit at drew as the cops haul them to their feet ones face is a mass of blood below the nose the others left eye is already swelling shut for a man defending himself against three assailants drew did a lot of damage a second squad car pulls into the lot as the police herd their charges into the cars i promise drew ill meet him at the station then i pull susan salter into the courtyard of drews office building shes hyperventilating now and her tears are flowing nonstop i dont understand she says in a stunned voice this morning everything was fine and noweverythings upside down it doesnt make any sense how could they think dr elliott could do anything against the law is she talking about the fighti wonder or about kates murder i take hold of susans thin wrists and speak in a reassuring voice listen to me susan i dont know how much drew told you about his situation but i do know this he trusted you with his life he told me youd worked for him nine years and that he had absolute confidence in you what you just saw will be the talk of the town by tonight if you add to that talk it can only hurt drew do you understand she sucks her upper lip into her mouth as though thinking hard then nods and wipes her nose dont worry about me saying anything i hate gossip thats why i quit the hospital all they do over there is cheat on their spouses and gossip about it afterward i think they like the talking better than the cheating will you tell me what you saw in the parking lot she nods helpfully it happened just like i said we were standing there talking about recombinant dna and this big pickup truck screeched to a stop beside us she points at a jackedup orange pickup parked thirty yards away there were three guys inside they looked like high school kids but big you know i think dr elliott knew them because he waved and spoke to the driver but then a guy jumped out of the backseat and started screaming at dr elliott what did he scream curse words mostly try to remember exactly susan has a primitive baptists reluctance to utter profanity you motherfucker i think he said first you sick motherfucker it was you it was you all along oh wowthis is only a preview of the community reaction to drews secret private life did drew say anything back no he looked too shocked to speak go on you need your ass kicked i think the boy said next and then he jumped at dr elliott like he was going to hit him dr elliott called him by name then he told steve to calm down and get back in the truck but the kid just threw up his fists and kept jumping forward like he was going to hit dr elliott i was kind of freaked out but not really scared at that point it was so weird but then the other two guys jumped out of the truck is that when the bat came into it no that only happened after drew knocked the other two guys down who threw the first punch the first kid steve did drew fight back not at first he kept trying to calm steve down but after steve hit him five or six times dr elliott shoved him backward steve fell down and i think that really embarrassed him he screamed for the other guys to help and at that point the other two guys jumped dr elliott what happened then susan shakes her head as though in wonder im not really sure i mean it happened so fast it was like dr elliott knew how to fight and they didnt they were really mad and they were screaming and throwing punches everywhere but it looked sort of like my husband wrestling with my tenyearold son the second it got serious it was like over how did the baseball bat come into it steve went down first but while dr elliott was handling the other two steve grabbed the bat from the truck susan shakes her head as if reliving the fight it was scary ive never seen dr elliott like that i saw him once at the hospital picnic he played softball with his shirt off and he was like ripped you know i know i grew up with him but he wasnt that competitive not like the other guys he was just out there for fun but todaydr elliott did everything he could to stop that fight but once he knew it was going to happen he justswitched on ive never seen anything like that i can understand susans awe steve sayers and his buddies have been pumping iron seriously for two or three years but their steroidplumped muscles are no match for the speed and strength that genetics bestowed upon drew elliott at birth and their teenage anger couldnt begin to compare with the deadly resolve of a man who sensed he was fighting for his life but in your mind it was the other guys fault i ask oh totally absolutely they wanted a piece of dr elliott and they pushed him until they got it dear lord all right susan will you be okay if i go on to the station now she nods uncertainly i think so thanks for staying with me glad to do it and youre not going to talk to anybody about this other than the police no i understand she looks suddenly upset again mr cage is drew going to be all right the look in susan salters eyes tells me shes more than half in love with her boss but i dont even want to go there i nod at her as though any other outcome would be impossible you take care okay i will as i hurry back to my saab one thought fills my head how did steve sayers find out that drew was involved with kate but once in the car another more frightening thought takes its place who else knows about it chapter natchez police headquarters is a onestory building sandwiched between a pizza hut and an abandoned strip mall on the north side of town the pd used to be downtown but that more stately building was razed to make room for a modern juvenile justice center by the time i arrive at the station both drew and steve sayers have been processed and taken to detention cells in the rear of the building the other two high school boys were booked on simple assault and now await their parents in holding cells a sixhundreddollar bond will free them i demand a meeting with the chief of police and almost immediately im escorted to his office chief don logan sits waiting for me behind his desk hes a thin man in his forties who looks more like an engineer than a policeman his spartan office reflects his reputation as a managerial type chief logan has family photos on his desk and more computer manuals than law enforcement texts on his bookshelves hes known for being careful about procedure so its all the more surprising that hes made the political move of arresting drew hello chief logan i say equably he regards me coolly over a steaming cup of coffee in my seven years as chief he says ive never seen anything like the furor over this situation i understand the emotional side of course a pretty young girl so much potential a prominent physician suddenly associated with her murder but people are losing their perspective over this thing theres a mob mentality developing out there nobody seems to want to let matters take their normal course to let the system work including the district attorney i prompt chief logan raises one eyebrow but he doesnt take the bait im sure youre wondering why weve charged your client with aggravated assault you read my mind chief im going to lay my cards on the table penn we have a troubled history with the sheriffs department you know all about it im sure the city of natchez is under the jurisdiction of the police department but technically the sheriff has jurisdiction over the entire county which includes the city in general we have a working agreement whereby we work crimes inside the city limits and the sheriff takes the county but logan takes a sip of coffee but billy byrd is a political animal and when a highprofile case comes along the sheriff believes its his godgiven right to storm in and take over the investigation billy ran roughshod over the last police chief and hes tried to do the same to me on occasion hes actually had his deputies try to arrest one of my officers at a couple of crime scenes they almost came to blows ive requested several legal opinions from the attorney generals office in jackson but nothing they send us is ever definitive enough i understand your problem i dealt with some of the same issues in houston chief logan nods as though encouraged im glad you do because today im drawing the line kate townsends body was discovered just within the boundary of the city which alone makes it our case but she almost certainly died farther upstream in that creek which removes any doubt whatever about jurisdiction sheriff byrd wont see it that wayyoure preaching to the choir chief tell me about the assault charge since thats a felony charge dr elliott and the sayers boy will have to spend the night in this building ill have a chance to talk to them without any interference from sheriff byrd now as dr elliotts lawyer you can stop me if you want to but know this my sole interest is in solving kate townsends murder im not railroading anybody to judgment in order to grab some headlines here or anywhere else this is good news indeed if dr elliotts guilty logan goes on then he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law but if hes not the man deserves some protection the chief shakes his head drews reputation will be blown to hell by suppertime tonight and as far as i can tell theres nothing against him but some anonymous phone calls and a fistfight which he didnt start i point out the chief waves his hand as though shooing away a fly the judge will throw out the assault charge tomorrow morning the bottom line is i think dr elliots safer in my jail than anywhere else in this town tonight i sit back in my chair and study the chief hes the first rational man ive spoken to in some time i hear you loud and clear i dont have isolation cells here he says but i do have some eightman units that are empty ive put drew in one and the sayers boy in the other theyll be safe and relatively comfortable until tomorrow i try to suppress a smile at the thought of shad johnson learning about this development have you spoken to the da about this assault arrest chief logan looks out his solitary window and gives a longsuffering sigh i try very hard to get along with the district attorney but i have a feeling mr johnson isnt going to like this one bit he looks back at me his dark eyes hard with conviction you know what tough titty this aint right and i aint going along with it theres not a damn thing mr johnson can do about this arrest before tomorrow unless he wants to call a judge and have dr elliott released on the strength of the das word and given mr johnsons main political support base i dont think hell want to do that i stand and shake hands with logan im quite satisfied that procedure has been followed chief do you have any problem with me speaking to my client before i go ill have him brought to the visitors room on my way out i stop and turn back do you know kates time of death yet logan watches me in silence for a few moments then he says from the body temperaturewhich they did take when the fishermen got her to the erthe me figures she died between three and fivethirty pm thats pretty exact logan nods they know she left the school alive at two fiftyfive and she hadnt cooled much by seventhirty when they took the temp the me says he feels pretty confident about that window does he have any idea how long she was in the water its hard to say given how quickly everything happened if he did know that we might be able to figure out how far upstream she died but that creek moves very fast in flood she wouldnt have to be in it long to be swept miles downstream and remember kate was found at sixtwenty no matter what the me says a maximum of only three hours and twenty minutes could have passed after death even if someone strangled her the minute she walked out of st stephens i dont think the body temperature is going to tell us what we want to know penn okay so as of now suspects need alibis from three pm to fivethirty yep thanks chief he smiles you didnt hear it from me five minutes later drew is escorted into the tiny visitors cubicle and seated behind a glass partition with a metal screen in it he looks pale and drawn and his eyes have the dull sheen i associate with lifers in the walls unit at huntsville texas where i used to spend quite a bit of time has thirty minutes in a cell done this to one of the toughest friends i ever had when am i getting out penn not until tomorrow im afraid i expect anger but drew hardly reacts maybe his listlessness is a symptom of grief maybe the attack by the st stephens teenagers has punctured his illusions about his relationship with kateor maybe his image of himself as a good man chief logans done you a big favor i explain hes isolated you from sheriff byrd who would love to use you to grab some headlines hes also put you at more of a remove from shad johnson who wants to use you as a steppingstone to higher office both men would like to interrogate you at their leisure but i doubt either one will be bothering you in here you never gave me the details of kates autopsy drew says his eyes boring into mine i gave you the main points the rest is medical jargon his eyes dont waver dont bullshit me dont try to spare me i focus on some dried pink bubblegum on the glass between us the pathologist thinks she was raped based on genital trauma drew looks confused by this go on they found semen from two different men inside her body he closes his eyes like a man fighting bonedeep pain why didnt you tell me that before i wanted you sane when the deputies came to collect your blood he shakes his head as though ive betrayed him drew i have to ask you this is there any chance that kate was having consensual sex with someone else besides you a slow blink then an odd smile you still dont get it do you kate loved me she loved me absolutely if youd told me earlier that they found two different semen samples inside her i could have told you right away that shed been raped welli wish there were some way to prove absolute love because i think the da is going to paint you as a jealous older man who went crazy when he found out his teenage mistress was sharing her natural bounty with someone else drews mouth wrinkles with disgust i dont care what he does youd better start youd better give the whole situation some serious thought tonight try to conjure up some idea of who might have wanted to rape or kill kate because the fact that she was pregnant means that you could be charged with double homicide drews blue eyes are impenetrable to me after a time he says what happens tomorrow tomorrow ill have the assault charge against you dismissed you dont want to charge steve sayers for attacking you no all right fuck drew exclaims his face suddenly flushed what abouttim hes going to see the newspaper kids are going to tell him his dads in jail i wish there was something i could do to ease drews mind about his son but theres not tims going to have a bad time throughout this thing i say evenly you have to accept that ill get you out as early as i can tomorrow and you can talk to him yourself drew shakes his head his eyes flicking back and forth in helpless rage something else youd better get used to i add steve sayers and his buddies are a pretty typical example of how the people in this community are going to feel about you for a while drews eyes fix upon me all i care about is tim you get me out so i can help him understand this after that ill find out who killed kate theres an undertone in drews voice that sends a tingle along my forearms its the emotionless timbre of the man who put down three musclebound jocks without breaking a sweat he said after that ill find out who killed kate the same way he might say after dinner ill take out the garbage i nod and stand in the little cubicle ill see you in the morning drew leaves the visiting room without a word by the time i pick up annie from school ive taken several cell calls and my phone is still ringing most of the calls have been from school parents pumping me for information about drew and kate but a few were more serious and more disturbing one was from holden smith the president of the st stephens school board holden had heard a distorted version of the afternoons fight from steve sayerss father and he was livid at drew about the only fact he had right was that steve and drew were being held in jail on felony assault charges i did my best to explain that drew wasnt at fault but holden didnt buy my argument thats not even the point he said weve got a member of the school board brawling with three of our students thats simply unacceptable drew should know better than to let something like that happen i told you he tried to stop it holden the fight couldnt have been avoided okay okay but look what the fight was about everybody in town knows drew was having sex with kate townsend and that he might even have killed her do you nobody knows that i snapped thats pure speculation so what do you realize what that kind of rumor will do to st stephens to our public image do you know what kind of lawsuits were going to get over this what are you telling me holden a brief silence we want drew off the board whos we everybody you want him to resign if he doesnt well vote him off tonight in a special session we have no choice thats bullshit the board could give drew its qualified support based on his years of dedication to the school did that thought enter anyones head dont even pretend thats an option holden said in a dismissive voice you know how this town works and that brings up another issue what about you penn are you drews lawyer now im not sure well if you are youre not going to be able to remain on the board either holden was right about that as a board member ill be named in any civil suit arising out of the present situation i cant remain on the board and also defend drew in a civil or criminal proceeding of course resigning would cut off my flow of inside information but i wasnt about to align myself with gutless holden smith drew and i will both resign i said with disgust youll have our letters in the morning wed prefer to have drews tonight i hung up on him while i drove along in a funk caitlin called me from boston apparently a reporter for the natchez examiner had called her and delivered a summation of the rumors spreading across town caitlin was stunned that i was being mentioned as drew elliots lawyer she knows drew but only superficially and she has no special reason to believe hes innocent of the crimes being attributed to him exactly when were you going to tell me you were representing drew she asked or were you going to tell me at all im not sure im going to represent him i thought you didnt practice anymore drew is a lifelong friend and he needs help right now im acting primarily as a friend this wasnt strictly true but ive been deceiving myself as well as caitlin about that when i see how this develops ill make a decision about the legal side of things penn why didnt you tell me about all this last night caitlin sounded hurt but she hasnt been very communicative to me about her recent situation either i couldnt get you on the phone last night you were at your party you could have called me this morning yes but you already had reporters working the story you may even end up working it yourself weve been in that situation before and we handled it fine but not without tension a little laugh tensions okay we can live with tension its deception we cant live with i agree more silence whats that supposed to mean i just agreed with you you had a tone no tone look things are breaking fast on this ill call you tonight and give you a better idea of where i stand okay her sigh told me she was far from happy with this arrangement did drew kill her penn im asking as your lover not a journalist you know i cant answer that even if i knew the answer but he was involved with her you wont report my answer no yes he was in love with her but i dont think he killed her classic midlife crisis i dont think its that simple drew says he and ellen have been living a charade for ten years he was starved for affection and he finally found exactly what he was missing and now here we are what about the two semen samples no more i cut in ill talk to you tonight i love you caitlin said after an awkward silence you too when annie gets into the car i set my phone on silent i also keep quiet about the fact that ive spoken to caitlin annie would want to call her back immediately and i dont want to deal with that right now annie says she needs to go to walgreens for some school supplies so we make a run to the drugstore one of my few sources in town for iced green tea by the time we get home my phone shows eight missed calls while i scroll through the list an incoming call pops up its from sonny cross a sheriffs deputy assigned to the mississippi bureau of narcotics sonny has two young boys at st stephens and through me hes spoken to the board a few times about marko bakic our croatian exchange student sonny suspects that marko has gotten involved in the local drug trade but so far hes been unable to prove it sonny i say whats up im calling to give you a headsup cross says in his laidback urbancowboy voice marko bakic again among other things last night there was a big party out at lake st john a rave there was a lot of x there and a lot of st stephens kids too lake st john is a horseshoe lake about thirty miles up the mississippi river on the louisiana side its thronged with natchez natives in the summer but this time of year most of the lake houses are deserted was it only st stephens kids no thank god the catholic school and the baptist boys were well represented did you bust the party no we didnt find out about it until it was over whoever organized it did just what they do in the cities the kids get word over their cell phones to go to such and such a place when they get there they find a sheet of paper taped to a pole with a coded message a rhyme only the kids will understand after they get led around to four or five different spots they know where the rave is and they know whether theyre being followed or not i know the routine word is these raves have been going on for a couple of months now different location every time and im hearing our boy marko is behind them great yeah you know most of the x in mississippi gets brought up from the gulf coast the asian gangs down there control the trade and markos been down to gulfport and biloxi a couple of times that i know about i wanted you to know were going to be stepping up surveillance on him i appreciate it i just want to try to minimize the damage to st stephens if we have to take marko down you know once you get x into a community you usually get lsd too it tends to be cooked and sold by the same crews one of my sources said some kids may have been doing acid last night at the lake party and check this marko bought out a roadside fireworks stand and put on a psychedelic show at the end of the night sailed out on a party barge and let off five grand worth of rockets sorry i missed it but where does a poor exchange student get the money to do that thats no mystery bubba its proving it thats the bitch hey do you know where marko was yesterday between three and fivethirty sonny cross laughs darkly already thought of that my man checked it out too marko was with coach anders from three until nearly six at the school no at anderss house wade has just about wangled the kid a football scholarship at delta state just what the world needs right one more soccerstyle kicker anyway i called wade and he told me he worked the phone for the kid about an hour marko was right there with him doing homework then wade tried to help marko with his chemistry cross laughs again the blind leading the blind anyway no luck there thanks sonny i really appreciate the information sometimes i think youre the only one you ask me some of those people on the board have their heads most of the way up their asses to be honest with you im resigning from the board tomorrow but ill do all i can to help with the marko situation silence can you tell me why youre resigning its the drew elliott thing huh i dont see why youd have to resign because of that but you know more about it than i do i hate to see you go man thanks ill keep you posted you ask me drew elliott is a standup guy like the oldtime docs he actually gives a shit how youre doing i think youre right look i hate to go but one last thing penn that townsend girl wasnt the allamerican lilywhite virgin some people are making her out to be suddenly my haste is gone what do you mean ive done a lot of surveillance in this town and ive seen kate townsend in some places good girls just dont go if you get my drift im not sure i do she hung with some pretty bad company sometimes and shes no stranger to drugs weed or worse worse i think this might be really important sonny important to drew where exactly have you seen kate brightside manor this is the last thing i expected to hear the brightside manor apartments are a dilapidated group of buildings on the north side of town the closest thing to a slum inside the city limits its occupants are poor and black and the complex is named frequently in the newspaper as the site of crimes from domestic abuse to shootings what the hell was kate townsend doing there im not sure but ive spotted her there several times over the last few months ive even got videotape of her going in and out about once a month now that i think about it you think she was buying drugs maybe i wasnt going to bust her to find out being who she was but the thing is girls like kate townsend get their drugs from friends not dealers and looking like she did kate wouldnt have tobuy drugs at all you know im listening sonny well brightside manor is where cyrus white lives whos that the top drug dealer in the city of natchez and its cyruss building that ive seen kate go in and out of jesus thats why i say she wasnt buying weed if kate townsend was visiting cyrus white to get drugs she was there for some heavy shit powder cocaine or maybe even heroin every new sentence out of crosss mouth freaks me out more do we have heroin in natchez brother every town has every drug you just have to know where to look wonderful do you know anything else about kate no but ive got a theory if you want to wrap your mind around something scary im listening shes wasnt going there to buy anything she was there to see cyrus you mean thats what i mean cyrus has a real taste for white girls a welldocumented taste kate townsend doing a drug dealerthat sounds too crazy sonny cyrus aint your average drug dealer in past years most natchez dealers were punks barely out of their teens cyrus is thirtyfour and smart as a whip by the time i heard he was in business all his competition had been wiped out ruthlessly but i couldnt pin a thing on him cyrus is thirtyfourdrew is forty did kate have a thing for older men in general cyrus is a veteran of desert storm if you can believe it sonny continues he was in the air force ive been trying to bust him for over a year but nothing sticks hes the teflon nigger sonnys use of the nword is completely unselfconscious he belongs to that group of southerners who modify their vocabulary by the company theyre in around whites he knowsand probably suspects hes bustingsonny says nigger without even a shading of caution around strangers hes as politically correct as the next guy but theres no question how he really sees the most frequent targets of his profession theres also no question that his prejudice is part of what makes africanamericans his primary targets rather than the kate townsends of the world but that prejudice isnt unique to redneck sheriffs detectives in mississippi it thrives in the blood of the american judicial system all the way up to washington does sheriff byrd know about kates connection to cyrus i ask the narcotics agent doesnt answer for some time then he says its not that i dont trust the sheriff penn i just dont like him messing around in my cases until its time to move on something he can be a disruptive influence i hear you sonny i appreciate you telling me all this anything else you get on kate please let me know will do and ill do anything i can to help out dr elliott i hang up my mind spinning with the new information how well did drew really know kate did he see her as an allamerican lilywhite virgin as sonny described her or did he know about her shadow side if not that hidden part of her life might hold the key to the second semen sample found in her corpse and thus the key to freeing drew its that question that occupies me as i sit at my dining room table with annie in the fading light of dusk annie is doing her homework and now and then she throws a question at me more out of boredom than from needing help im supposedly working on my new novel but what im really doing is trying to tease out the secret threads of drews and kates lives my new awareness of cyrus white has completely changed my perspective on drews situation one thing that keeps coming back to me is drews assertion that the blackmailer who called him that first night and told him to leave the money on the football field sounded like a black kid i doubt that a thirtyfouryearold war veteran would sound like a kid but sometimes peoples voices surprise you heavyweight champion and convicted rapist mike tyson sounds like a fiveyearold boy when he speaks but the more likely answer is that a bigtime drug dealer like cyrus white probably has dozens of kids working for him and thats who hed get to make a call like that it wasnt just money they wantedi recall with sudden clarity the blackmailers wanted drugs from drew as well but does that point toward cyrus white why would a drug dealer ask for drugs as i ponder this question my front doorbell chimes im not expecting anyone but given all thats happened today theres no telling who it might be when i open the door i find the last person i would have expected jenny townsend kates mother jenny is tall and cleareyed like kate and shes holding a worn jimmy choo shoe box in front of her hello penn she says in a controlled voice jenny i say awkwardly will you come in she takes a deep breath and seems to gather herself before answering no thank you i saw annie through the window i know youre busy its all right really no she says shaking her head i dont think i could take it i used to help kate with her homework just like that after her father left what does one say at these moments theres nothing appropriate so i remain silent jenny actually looks grateful that im not forcing her to make small talk ive heard a lot of rumors today she says with obvious difficulty some were pretty terrible one was that youre representing drew elliott so thats what this visit is about drew is an old friend jenny you know that i cant begin to imagine what youve gone through but i feel obligated to try to help drew through this oh you misunderstood me she says i didnt mean that you representing drew was terrible in fact i was glad to hear that thats why i brought you this she gestures with the box but doesnt quite offer it to me what is that kates things her private things i havent looked at all of them im not sure i could bear it and it wasnt meant for my eyes anyway jenny brushes a strand of hair out of her eyes then flinches at some inner pain katie kept this hidden in the attic theres a diary some souvenirs and some computer disks i think thats where she kept her pictures of drew i think some of them are probablyintimate pictures i see i say softly penn i dont know what happened to my daughter yesterday the police tell me she was raped and murdered i dont know anything for certain right now but i do knowor at least i believethat drew could not have hurt my katie a flood of relief washes through me im so glad to hear that jenny i believe the same thing thats why im leaving this box with you i nod but say nothing she looks down at my welcome mat and speaks with a new tension in her voice the police and the sheriffs department have gotten more aggressive with their questioning they want to search my house from top to bottom for clues to kates recent lifestyle i dont want them to see whats in this box jenny looks up her chin quivering those men have no right to invade my daughters privacy this is a difficult thing for me to do penn if it turns out that drew did harm kate perhaps without even meaning to this box contains the only physical evidence of their relationship maybe you should keep it then she shakes her head i cant and theres no one else i have no close family here and even if i did i wouldnt trust them with it im not even sure i trust myself with it thats why im not putting it in a safedeposit box im trusting you because of who you are and who your father is your father was my doctor when i was young tom cage has more integrity than any man ive ever known and i dont think the apple fell far from the tree i respect what you did in solving that old civil rights murder for not giving a damn what people around here thought about it i start to interject but she motions for me to be quiet and pushes on i dont know whats going to happen about katie in the next few weeks but if somewhere along the way you come to believe that drew hurt my baby i expect you to make sure that the right people see whats in this box i nod slowly not quite believing that this is happening jenny holds out the box i want you to give me your word as a gentleman penn i know that word is sort of outdated but i still believe it applies in some cases you have my word jenny even as i accept the box and cradle it under my right arm i wonder what im doing how can i defend drew in court if ive vowed to make sure he is punished if he turns out to be guilty maybe thats why im taking the box maybe its my way out of defending drew at trial daddy annie calls from the living room who is it im going to run on jenny says i dont know what to say jenny she turns away walks to the top step then looks back the district attorney told me kate was pregnant it must have been drews baby i nod slowly do you think he would have married her penn tell me the truth jenny thats the one thing in this whole mess that im absolutely sure of hed have married her tomorrow if he could she tilts back her head and blinks away tears then gives me a shattered smile and hurries into the night in the silence on my front steps i feel tears coming to my own eyes how did we bring ourselves to this pass jenny townsend in her solitary grief drew sitting alone in jail kate townsend lying dead on a slab somewhere in jackson an ugly yincision stitched into her torso an empty chair at harvard that will now be filled by some luckier kid who will never know what tragedy brought him or her there did all this result from drews forbidden love of kate or do i trace it back to drews wife and the hydrocodone addiction that drew says killed their marriage or daddy annie calls from the door cant you hear the phone no boo i say softly im coming i walk to the kitchen and pick up the telephone this is penn penn walter hunt it takes me a moment to switch gears walter hunt is an accountant who lives in sherwood estates and a neighbor of drews he has two kids in st stephens what can i do for you walter nothing for me but i thought youd like to knowellen elliott is piling up furniture and all kinds of stuff in her front yard looks like drews stuff to megolf clubs and skisguns too to tell you the truth it looks like shes building a bonfire jesus christthanks walter im on my way wheres tim timmys over here with us my wife went over and slipped in their back door dont let anybody call the police ill be there in no time hurry penn ellens so toasted she can barely walk chapter im sitting on my front steps with annie waiting impatiently for mia burke to arrive annie is playing scoobydoo on her game boy advance im trying to focus on the perfume of a white narcissus which blooms liberally on washington street this time of year but at this moment its hard to enjoy anything my mind wont leave the jimmy choo shoe box i just hid atop the armoire in my upstairs guest room the box that contains the secret history of kate townsends life with drew i shudder to think what would be happening now if the police had discovered that box during a search of jenny townsends house the only thing keeping me from going through kates personal things right now is my fear that ellen elliott may do something to hurt drew as badly as she can out of revenge after failing to reach ellen by phone i called mia who agreed to watch annie until i get back before she hung up mia told me she had something to tell me about the kate situation but she refused to say more on her cell phone since mia is plugged into the high school information grid she may know things that i or the police couldnt discover in a year of asking questions annie looks up from the glow of her game boy and fixes me in a serious gaze daddy everybody keeps asking me why i wasnt in the pageant this year why cant i tell them i take a deep breath and sigh the confederate pageant has been the center of white social life in natchez for the past seventy years replete with hoop skirts sabers and rebel uniforms this celebration of precivil war life in the deep south is one of the most politically incorrect spectacles in the united states yet it remains an institution that most of the affluent children in town participate inas velvetclad toddlers dancing around a maypole cleancut high schoolers waltzing with flattered tourists or intoxicated college kids trekking home three times a week during march to don confederate regalia and march to the strains of dixie as members of the confederate court being asked to take part in the pageant is a mark of social distinctionbased largely on ones mothers or grandmothers service to one of the powerful garden clubsand certain roles confer star status on those offered them annie has already played starring roles in the pageant and this year she was offered a spot in the big maypole one of the vignettes with roles for fourthgraders this made my mother happy but i was ambivalent about it mom believes annie will be damaged more by not participating in the pageant with her friends than by acting in a racially questionable production whose subtleties she cant even understand after all she asked what harm did it do you you were in the pageant from the age of four to twenty and youre as liberal as they come i laughed but annie proved her wrong a nineyearold with black friends can easily grasp the issues and when i explained them to annie she asked me to decline the role for her which i did i also asked her not to make a big deal of it at school since so many kids in her class would be taking part but i mean annie says in an exaggerated voice whats the point of not doing something if you dont tell people why youre not doing it as usual she sounds five years older than her true age and also as usual shes right if youre going to try to change things by example you have to let people know what youre doing and why even if youre only nine youre right punkin go ahead and tell them why youre not doing it but youd better expect some strong reactions maybe even from your teacher things change slowly around here she nods seriously ill think before i talk i wish some adults i know would do thatgood girl dad annie asks in a tone of some anxiety yes timmys mom came and picked him up early from school today images of ellen elliott fill my mind again did anyone say why no but i heard some teachers talking in the hall they said dr drew was in some kind of fight and that hed done something bad damn gossipsdid they say what hed done no but one of them called him a bad name which teacher did that mrs gillette a cranky old sourpussi silently mark mrs gillette down for further attention dr drew hasnt done anything for kids to worry about you dont pay any attention to people gossiping okay i know i just wanted to tell you cause timmys seemed really sad lately as i put my arm around annie and hug her tight a pair of headlights comes up washington street at slightly over the speed limit then slows and darts to the curb in front of our house mia jumps out of her accord with a smile on her face and a cd case in her hand were gonna do some dancing girl she says to annie popping out her hip in a move that seems to travel up her spine and out to her stiffened fingers by some occult law of physics annie leaps to her feet what kind of dancing cheer dancing annie claps and hugs mias waist shes practically jumping out of her skin with excitement this type of giddiness a father simply cannot generatenot in my experience anyway run inside and put this on your boom box mia says cutting her eyes at me ill be right there hurry annie says taking the disk and disappearing into the house what is it i ask quickly what do you know mias smile vanishes do you know about the grand jury tell me this afternoon four girls in my class got subpoenas to appear before the grand jury my chest tightens appear when this afternoon it already happened damn did they tell you what they were asked i havent talked to them myself but i heard they got questioned by the district attorney the black guy who ran for mayor last time shad johnson right all i know is that it was about kate and dr elliott this is unbelievable shad actually used drews name i dont know for sure i can try to find out please no ones supposed to talk about what happens in the grand jury room but thats probably all those girls are talking aboutalong with half the grand jury membersi add silently oh definitely theyre major mouths do you think they knew anything intimate about kate no i dont even know why those four got subpoenas shads taking potshots thats all he knows to do and hes abusing the hell out of the grand jury system how i click the button on my key ring opening my car door a grand jury isnt an investigative body its constituted to decide whether people should be tried for a crime or not based on evidence uncovered by law enforcement shads using the grand jury to bypass some important legal protections like like not questioning juveniles without their parents present police officers cant do that shad could also call drew in there and question him without an attorney present but he has no grounds whatever to do that drew hasnt even been charged with murder if shad brought his name up to the grand jury the only justifiable reason would be in connection with the fight this afternoon but drew hasnt even been arraigned on that charge everybodys talking about that fight mia says i heard dr elliott busted steve up pretty bad i saw the other two guys myself ray and jimmy they looked like theyd been hit by a truck the fight happened at lunchtime why werent those guys in school they ditched most of the seniors ditched today a lot of them were scheduled to be questioned by the police or by sheriffs deputies and the rest just used that as an excuse what are people saying about drew the word is mixed believe it or not really i want to ask more but something tells me that ellen elliott cant wait ive got to run mia but i want to hear about this when i get back and please find out all you can about what happened in the grand jury room she holds up her cell phone no problem see you when you get back the front lawn of drews house looks like a garage sale from hell the grass is littered with tennis rackets golf clubs water skis guns cameras and assorted furniture books and clothing lie strewn around the yard most notably a tuxedo draped over a weight bench and a formal gown hanging from a low oak limb i have to steer around a shattered flatscreen tv to negotiate the pebbled driveway as i get out of the car the front door of the massive victorian bangs open and ellen staggers into the yard carrying a compound bow i hold up both hands to show im not a threat ellen has killed more than a few deer with that bow and shes quite capable of taking me out with a razortipped broadhead ellen i call its penn cage youre not welcome she says in a flat voice youre the wrong kind of lawyer go home shes wearing some sort of floral housecoat thats falling open from the waist up her usually wellcoiffed hair hangs in limp strings around her face and her eyes are puffy and red only her dark tan communicates any impression of health but thats an illusion purchased at the local spa id really like to talk to you ellen so would half the town my socalled friends especially they want to express their sympathy right those jealous bitches are so giddy with glee they could just shit ellen is clearly drunk maybe not on alcohol though maybe its hydrocodone as drew warned me last night or maybe both she flings an arm toward the street look at them vultures every one across the street the porch lights of two houses are burning brightly looking closer i see neighbors standing in little knots in the yards staring unabashedly at ellen and me i cant make out walter hunt but he must be there ellen tosses the bow into the yard takes two steps toward me and gives me a withering glare well is it true are you representing drew im just trying to be a friend ellen a friend she says skeptically yeah ill bet i know how you guys stick together you probably knew about it all along didnt you about what little katiepoo of course the backstabbing slut absolutely not she gives me a knowing gaze be honest penn you didnt sit around over a couple of scotches while drew told you how great it is to squeeze a pair of seventeenyearold tits again i had no idea anything like that was going on ellen thats gods truth she waves her hand dismissively and turns away from me whatever youre probably doing mia over at your place every chance you get whatmy face heats with anger are you out of your mind come on she says looking back over her shoulder as much as caitlin is out of town i know these girls penn i hear them talk theyre nothing like the girls i went to school with no guilt no repression those days are gone honey these girls are the lucky ones how so she gives me an intoxicated smile you know what the difference is between then and now babe what these days good girls do i hold up my hands in a beseeching gesture ellen im just here to offer any kind of help i can she swings her head around and bellylaughs as though ive just told a dirty joke get real penn youre here for damage control admit it you want to know what ive told the cops or what i might tell them tomorrow is that really the reason ive come i wonder id like to think im the gentleman that jenny townsend believes i am but maybe ellen is right i wont deny id like to know that it could have great impact on drews future ellen grins slyly you bet your ass it could hes sweating it over there in jail isnt he have you seen him another preening smile yes i have and it was pretty goddamn satisfying its a new experience for him ill tell you that jail is about the last place our golden boy ever thought hed wind up but thats where he belongs if you ask me itll give him a littleperspective remind him of whats important in life which is family sacrifice thats what it comes down to in the end you can do what you want to do or you can do whats right and the two arent ever quite the same im not sure thats always true ellen gives me a piercing look you know it is i was thinking of my wife a shadow of regret crosses her face im sorry sarah was as good as they come but drew aint i used to think he was once but hes just like the rest of them the rest of who mensugar a wild light flashes in her eyes when its all said and done they only care about one thing whats that ellen thrusts out her left hip and slaps her rump dipping their wick in a piece of ass thats attached to a smiling subservient and preferably young woman and if not young then different from what theyre used to capisce her gesture has caused one surgically enhanced breast to fall out of her housecoat when she sees me looking she does nothing to cover herself see what i mean she drawls nothing stirs a mans loins like a little strange right penn oh i know the story well she covers herself with a jerk of her gown and surveys the wreckage of her husbands possessions ellen if you want to be crude about this lets be crude what happened to you and drew is simple he was unhappy and his dick led him astray youre worldly enough to understand that oh i understand that all too well i went astray myself one night in jackson with a darling little tennis pro her eyes flicker at a memory that cuts through her chemical haze but thats not what this affair was about no sir this was love capitalluv didnt drew tell you this was soul mates poetryandcandlelight iwanttohaveyourbabyanddomissionworktogetherinperu stuff drew you stupid assholei curse silently couldnt you keep your mouth shut did you think youd confess your secret dreams about your mistress and your wife would understand like many men who have come to the point of needing a lawyer drew elliott is his own worst enemy and thanks to him theres not much i can accomplish here ellen let me just say this because of kates death drews smallest actionsand yourscould have far more serious consequences than you might imagine weve got a politically motivated district attorney whod like nothing better than to convict a rich white doctor for murder yes we do ellen drawls that black boy is definitely hungry for some white meat and hes got his eye on drew all right he already asked me to come down and talk to the grand jury my blood pressure plummets what did you tell him id think about it did shad threaten to subpoena you hes not that stupid shadrach was sweet as pie honey he knows he cant force a wife to testify against her husband a wave of relief rolls through me but ellen instantly dashes it dont look too secure shad may not have to worry about that problem too much longer i dont want to encourage her by asking but i have no choice why not tomorrow im driving up to jackson and hiring the meanest divorce lawyer in the state ellen you dont dont what she cocks her perfectly plucked eyebrows do you have a comment counselor do you think im un justified in this course of action i shake my head slowly its your life im just sorry to hear this i think something brought you and drew together all those years ago and there has to be something left of that tim at the very least for the first time i see tears in her eyes little silver drops that she quickly wipes away i used to think there was she says in a hoarse voice but i was a fool and whatever hope i had left drew just crushed in about as public a way as he could i couldnt go back to him now if i wanted to ellen dont talk to me about swallowing my pride for tims sake i dont like the taste of it im not going to watch drew mourn that little bitch for the rest of my life timmys better off with me alone than with a father whod run off with his goddamn babysitter theres nothing more to be said ellen is dead set on a scorchedearth campaign and the only thing that could possibly change that is time time and maybe sobriety i get into my car back away from the gingerbread castle and head home chapter when i get back home im ordered to sit down and watch a performance by annie and mia given that ive been gone less than thirty minutes the dance is truly amazing mia moves with the bonesnapping precision of a girl in a hiphop video which doesnt surprise me since ive seen her do the same as a cheerleader at st stephens football and basketball games what amazes me is annie shes only nine years old yet she mimics mias moves as though shes wired to the older girls brain she doesnt quite have mias precision but the flexibility and rhythm are there its only a matter of practice her mother was a great dancer too and even after five years the memory brings a lump to my throat when they finish dancing i jump to my feet yelling and clapping in approval annie glows with pride and mia watches her with real affection bath time mia says doing a quick sequence of moves to keep annies attention aww annie moans im clean thats bull says mia laughing we just sweated two gallons at least your armpits are already stinky i smell them from here annie sniffs cautiously beneath her left arm uh uh uh huhget going stinky annie giggles and then cartwheels into the hall will you still be here when i get out mia shakes her head ive got way too much homework to stick around here im gone as soon as your dad pays me are you coming back tomorrow mia looks at me absolutely i tell them knowing im bound to be caught up in drews mess whether i want to be or not as annies footsteps fade down the hall mia takes a seat on the ottoman in front of my chair and pulls the elastic band from her ponytail dark hair cascades around her shoulders she puts the band between her teeth and shakes her head then gathers her hair again and binds it into a looser ponytail i talked to stephanie james she says shes one of the girls who got questioned by the grand jury she said the da didnt use dr elliots name at first he kept asking if kate had ever confided anything to stephanie about an older man after stephanie said no about ten times johnson got really aggressive he acted like she knew about the affair but was holding back on purpose stephanie said she actually started crying she also said she knew several people sitting in the chairs out there the grand jury members some of them were st stephens parents great is it bad oh its bad what can i do to help nothing im afraid but youve been a huge help already i dont feel like i have dr elliotts in trouble and i really like him he helped me with my science fair project last year he was really nice i start to ask if she ever sensed any improper attention from drew but then i decide against it as if reading my mind mia says no i never got a hint of weirdness from him i never even caught him looking at my butt which most older guys do every time i turn around i cant help but laugh at mias awareness of the reaction her body causes in men ive admired her derriere myself on occasion you told me youve heard mixed reactions about drew and kate tell me about that well from the parents its all bad of course they blame him totally for the affair some of them say kate always looked old for her ageand acted a lot olderbut they say thats no excuse but the kids are different mia tilts a flattened hand back and forth to indicate ambivalence the girls mostly the guys are calling him a perv and talking all kinds of shit about what they ought to do to him but the girls understand it why she smiles to herself i think a lot of them have fantasized about doing the same thing kate did are you serious hell yeah make out with a hot guy like dr elliott but hes twenty years older than they are so mia looks genuinely puzzled soi dont know ellen elliots words come back to me in a rushthese girls arent like the girls i went to school with you tell me i think youd be surprised at what we talk about mia says with a sly smile water gurgles through the pipes in the wall annie has started her bath for instance umthe hot dads list the what the hot dads list thats the fathers of kids at st stephens who still rank as hot i shake my head in wonder who keeps this list the senior girls mostly some juniors its not written down or anything just something we talk about dads wed hook up with if we got the chance and drew was on this list the very top really oh yeah youre on it too my face reddens im not saying youre on my list she says with an apologetic smile but ive heard a lot of girls name you and these girls think it was okay for drew to be sleeping with kate pretty much i mean kate wasnt going to be with some high school boy anyway if dr elliott was unhappyand anybody who knows his wife knows he had to bethen what happens is what happens you know its natural adultery is natural mia shrugs it is to these girls half of them come from broken homes more than half probably god what have we come to and the guys are only acting so pissed because theyre scared mia goes on they know they cant possibly compete with a guy like dr elliott even on their own primitive level i mean look what he did to the jocks who tried to beat him up so they say hes pervy and all but every one of those guys would do that or worse if they thought they could get away with it so would the fathers who are trashtalking dr elliott some of the most selfrighteous of those guys give me looks that totally creep me out when i run by them in tight shorts they practically drool on me im not even sure i want to know more at this point the girls defending drew arent doing so on the basis of forgiving human frailty theyre saying you cant blame a guy for doing something most other men would do if given the same chance morality doesnt even come into it what do you think about kate and drew mia bites her lip and takes some time to think it makes me sad for timmy do you know him yeah hes a sweet kid he really is and his life is going tosuck for a while for some reason my mind jumps off track to one of the phone calls i got this afternoon what do you know about marko bakic mias face closes almost instantly why do you ask his name has come up in connection with some things what kind of things drugs she nods almost imperceptibly are you nodding because you know markos involved in drugs just keep talking ill answer what i can what the helldo you know anything about a rave party out at lake st john last night maybe were you there she looks at her fingernails maybe was there a lot of ecstasy there there could have been what about lsd see any of that mia draws her legs up beneath her and sits indianstyle on the ottoman shes wearing loose gym shorts over a skintight nike running suit with her careful expression she looks like someone judging a gymnastics competition in what capacity are you asking these questions she asks with a strange formality is it just for your personal interest or are you asking as a member of the school board im not sure myselfa concerned parent lets say i know something about x and lsd from my work in houston and im getting the feeling that i need to know more about marko bakic if i want to protect the students at st stephens mia slowly shakes her head i cant say much about that subject why not are you afraid another long pause it wouldnt be cool a lot of people could get in trouble whats your personal opinion of marko her jaw muscles work beneath her tanned cheeks hes a psycho im serious penn hes completely amoral right and wrong dont register in his mind but he covers it well hes smooth a lot of people think hes fun but not you i think hes a selfabsorbed prick i used to think he was fun he had me snowed like the rest not now though i saw through him do you want to tell me about it not really okay mia gets to her feet and looks at me with her wide dark eyes if youre going after marko be careful her severe gaze unsettles me what do you know mia it sounds like i need to hear it markos not like the rest of us okay were soft american marko grew up in a war zone his root directory is fucked up thats all i know to say and he hangs with some bad people if youre going to mess with him at all you want somebody like dr elliott around somebody who can get radical if things get out of hand understood tell me have you ever heard of cyrus white she mulls over the name no who is he a drug dealer dont ask around about him im serious okay hes not a nancy drew project mia looks offended i know when to talk and when to shut up im sorry she takes her cd out of the boom box and walks past me to the door i havent paid you yet i remind her you can catch up tomorrow she reaches for the doorknob then looks back at me i heard ellen elliott freaked out is she really dumping her husbands shit all over the lawn i shrug noncommittally i also heard you were over there the cell phones of mia and her friends are like native drums on a pacific island every significant event is instantly known by the tribe i guess ellen thinks he did it huh she asks did what got kate pregnant for one thing i close my eyes in dismay if this is public knowledge already drew is so screwed its beyond belief mia says do you think ellen believes her husband killed kate of course not some people are going to think that probably so except for the pathologist finding two guys stuff inside her right that makes it more complicated jesus mia is there anything you dont know not much she gives me a sad smile sometimes i wish i knew a lot less than i do i wonder what that would be like they say ignorance is bliss not ignorance innocence thats what i was talking about innocence mia sighs then passes through the door to the street chapter im standing outside my daughters bathroom door feeling strangely adrift between two extremes splashing behind this door is annie at nine years old still truly innocent while driving away from my house is mia burke an eighteenyearold who knows far more about the adult world than i would ever have guessed yesterday how long will it be before that world begins chipping away at annies innocence and how will she react when it does how willi react an image of kate townsend suddenly fills my mind mia said there was no way kate was going to be with a boy her own age did drew elliott seduce and corrupt that girl or was it the other way around no jury would ever see it that way of course but right now im only interested in the truth and my best shot at discovering it may be opening the shoe box hidden atop the armoire in my guest room after walking softly down the hall i climb onto a chair pull down the shoe box and carry it to the bed the scent of perfume wafts upward when i pull off the lid exposing a jumble of letters cards ticket stubs usb flash drives videotapes and various other knickknacks theres cloth in the bottom which turns out to be a pair of mens bikini underwear beneath the briefs lies a photograph printed on computer paper it shows drew and kate standing in front of a mirrora hotel bathroom mirror is my guess theyre naked and laughing and drew has his right arm around kates waist kate is holding her right arm high in the air and in the upper corner of the mirror i can just see the blue star of the flash from the camera shes holding drews stomach muscles stand out in rigid relief and kates breasts are firm and erect her torso is marked with small red ovals probably caused by the recent pressure of drews fingers its disquieting to see kate this way after seeing her mostly from a distance on the tennis court in conservative whites or wearing a cheerleader uniform on the gym floor daddy calls annie are you up here yes i call toward the hall are you ready to get out almost just call me when youre ready as i stare at kates body something else catches my eye at the bottom of her shoe box lies a multicolored schematic of the london underground picking it up i realize that the map is actually the jacket of a thin hardcover book a journal and written on the first page in a flowing female hand are two paragraphs this is the journal of katharine mays townsend my father gave me this book of blank pages when he left for england this timefor my seventeenth birthday he told me that this time of my life is precious that i will never be so filled with possibility and that i should record everything i think and do right now im more of a mind to record everything he does and more importantly does not do so that he might finally recognize himself for what he is and is not but i doubt even that would do it denial is a powerful thing ive always been told that im a special girl though not by the person i most needed to hear it from but i do believe im unlike most of the peers i know at this point in my life for that reason i shall record my thoughts and deeds and if someone digs up this book a thousand years from now they will find an accurate record of what was in the head of a materially spoiled but emotionally starved american girl of the st century hello whoever you are i flip quickly through the pages conscious that annie could walk in at any moment some are covered with tight blocks of script others with hastily scrawled paragraphs doodles and caricatures adorn many pages illuminating the journal as the work of a talented artist i can hardly suppress my excitement the last year of kate townsends life is right here page after page of it and id like nothing more than to read the journal from cover to cover right now but that will have to wait until annie is in bed still i cant resist a quick look suspending the diary by its front cover i let it fall open to its natural breaking point it opens to a twopage spread lined with four columns the columns on the lefthand page are headed hookups and real hookups the columns on the righthand page are headed rejected and rejected by these two pages i realize are where kate townsend believed she saw herself most clearly not through the lens of the effusive praise she must have heard every day but measured by her physical acceptance or rejection by the people around her like most of us sadly this beautiful and brilliant girl defined herself more by who desired her rather than by any internal sense of self but that weakness may be drews good fortune i eagerly scan the columns searching for information that might somehow help to free him hookups david adams k peter smith k emerald mound johnny wingate k jack b k henry f k st james park jed andersen k b patrick schaefer k b f chris vogel k b f geoffrey k david quinn k b chris anthony k b f o the pavilion carson k b o win langston the sand bar f jody first bj michael went down on me gavin green junior trip walter wenders i actually came spencer d turner queens ball andy winograd steve kane j real hookups andy v steve v oa sarah evans ov vv weird drew everything shit shit shit shit rejected timmy livingston walter taunton billy neil hot but too young jack d ricky dr davenport yuck chris farrell cyrus shit close one tyler bradley mr dawsonperv mark wilson gross bass player blue steel goth jeanne hulbert butch andy coach anders i think martin sarah evans stalker gavin rejected by point guard jackson academy jay gresham mr marbury laurel goodrich dr lewis morgan davis lead singer wings of desire several names jump out at me as i scan the list most of them high school boys who attend st stephens with some entries i recognize surnames only they probably belong to boys from the other local high schools but some of the names truly shock me as they seem to belong to adults under the rejected column is coach anders the athletic director of st stephens wade anders is thirty years old and divorced with two kids of his own at st stephens kates parenthetical notation seems to indicate some uncertainty about whether anders made a pass at her or not and i can only hope it was her imagination mr dawsonthe pervis also a teacher at st stephens hes taught religion for one year and now its likely to be his last i have no idea who dr davenport is ditto for mr marbury but they apparently had close contact with kate perhaps during her time in england and sarah evans a recent graduate of st stephens is listed under both the real hookups and rejected columns theres also a female listed under the rejected by heading apparently kate liked to experiment but the entry that stops my breath is under the rejected columncyrus theres no surname listed but the parenthetical shit close one seems to indicate some anxiety on kates part that set this encounter apart from the others she clearly felt less in control with cyrus than with the other males she rejected i cant be sure that this cyrus is cyrus white the drug dealer sonny cross warned me about but i know of no cyrus who attends st stephens or any other local school at least cyrus isnt listed on the hookups page which tends to discredit sonnys theory that there was an ongoing sexual relationship between kate and the drug dealer studying the list in more detail i can only hope that its comprehensive the letters following the names seem to be a simple code signifying a graduated scale of sexual activity i saw many similar codes during my time as a prosecutor in houston usually in the private documents or computer records of men k probably stands for kissed bbreasts f probably stands for fingers or some variant thereof the and bj are selfexplanatory the letters following the entries under the real hookups heading are a bit surprising in their explicitness but mia did tell me that kate was highly sexual my guess is that v stands for vaginal intercourse oa must signify oralanal contact and the everything following drews name i can only guess at more than anything i wish kate had dated these entries im sure mia could give me at least a vague time frame but i cant afford to show her this journalnot yet anyway i need to read it from cover to cover then load the computer disks and peruse everything on them i hope kate didnt passwordprotect them but i suspect she did even standing naked before a bathroom mirror she radiates the selfpossession of someone well practiced at protecting herself staring at the photo in a kind of trance i experience a rush of intuitive knowledge so powerful that while i realize that facts could prove me wrong i feel viscerally sure they will not i race downstairs to my study annies voice pursuing me down the stairs i call out reassurance but i keep running in the study i go to my bookshelves and pull out a folding map of natchez its a simple thing a free handout produced for tourists by the chamber of commerce but its proved invaluable to me during the writing of my last two novels spreading it open on my desk i orient myself to highway then search for the brightside manor apartments the reputed lair of cyrus white i find them in short order on the north side of town near where the old black high school used to be to the west of the apartments lies lynda lee mead drive a street named for a natchezborn miss mississippi who became miss america but to the east of themmy heart thumps against my sternumto the east lies open land transected by a curving blue line st catherines creek i close my eyes and breathe something very like a prayer of thanks though brightside manor is several miles from where drew found kates bodyand even farther from where kates corpse was discovered by the fishermenthe apartments stand a mere forty yards from the creek into which her body was dumped this is something that will sway a jury if not the district attorney one glance at this map shows that cyrus white could easily have raped and murdered kate townsend in his apartment then dumped her body into the flooded torrent behind it with the near certainty that she would be swept far downstream from the crime scene if not all the way to the mississippi river daddyannie calls faintly remembering the nude photo lying on my bed i leave the map and sprint back up the stairs from the reverberation of annies voice i can tell shes still in the bathroom ill be here in a minute baby i promise looking in through the steam im doing something annie smiles up from the tub im fine i just wanted to know where you were i heard you running everythings okay i hurry back to the bedroom and pick up the photo of drew and katewhat were you doing at cyrus whites apartment i ask silently it takes a few moments for my ringing cell phone to register when i pick it up the caller id saysmia im almost afraid to answer and find out what new tragedy shes discovered hello nancy drew here she says in a deadpan voice remember i told you i wanted to do what i could to help dr elliott yes well i got to thinking about what you told me about shad johnson hijacking the grand jury yeah so i decided to take a ride down to his office you knew where it was i figured it would either be in the courthouse or in lawyers alley i didnt have to look very hard except for the bars and pearl street pasta the waterworks building was the only one downtown with lights blazing inside thats the das office all right i say not interested enough by mias amateur detective work to remove my gaze from kates body or my mind from the juxtaposition of brightside manor and st catherines creek well thats not all i saw she says no you sound distracted what are you doing watching soft porn on cinemax sorry what else did you see two people walking into the first floor of the waterworks building they used the das door and they looked pretty friendly did you recognize them sure did one was the sheriff billy byrd my chest tightens and the other judge minor holy shitkates nude body is forgotten got your attention now you do indeed arthel minor is one of natchezs two circuit court judges he was among the first africanamericans in mississippi to be elected to the position after reconstruction as a circuit court judge he has a percent chance of handling the kate townsend murder case when it comes to trial and like both shad johnson and billy byrd arthel minor is known to have higher political aspirations how did you recognize judge minor mia she laughs i served on the mayors youth council this year i spent a couple of hours talking to him he had me rolling on the floor with his jokes this girl is good can you see what theyre doing now not from where im sitting which is at the malt shop drinking a parrot ice but i can get back there in about a minute hang on a second i need to think dont strain yourself the image of shadrach johnson sheriff billy byrd and judge arthel minor meeting together after business hours sends a cold shot of fear through my veins it might seem natural that these people should meet and discuss an investigation in progress but in fact this kind of meeting never happens contrary to what we see on television the investigation of a crime is handled almost solely by police officers after adequate evidence has been obtained the case is then handed over to the district attorney who takes it to a grand jury if the grand jury binds the accused over for trial theres a preliminary hearing before a municipal court judge only then does a circuit judge enter the picture what mia has described is a meeting that while legal by the strict letter of the law is very dangerous to the integrity of the legal system and more particularly i fear to my friend drew elliott together those three men could investigate drews life try him for murder and sentence him to death mia can you come back here and watch annie for an hour i know im taking advantage but can you do that i guess id better the ivy league isnt cheap you know youre two minutes away if you punch it she laughs more like one annies still in the bathtub ill meet you at the front door chapter theres an empty parking space in front of the das private entrance i park and ring the bell but no one answers banging on the door produces no response either i call shads office from my cell phone but all i get is a recording saying that the office is closed even angrier than when i left the house i walk around to the alley behind the waterworks in the shadows between the buildings i can hardly see my hand in front of my face but on the third floor bright fluorescent light spills from a row of casement windows shads office a ladder dangles from a landing on the building across the alleyfire escape one minute of careful climbing puts me on a thirdfloor landing where i smell the aroma of seafood cooking in the restaurant on the next block i can also see directly into the office of the district attorney what i see brings acid into my throat shad johnson is pacing around his office in a brilliant blue suit while seated at his desk is arthel minor to ensure impartiality circuit judges are supposed to be assigned cases by a simple system of rotation but in practice cases are often steered to certain judges by crafty lawyers its pretty clear to me which judge will be assigned kate townsends murder case beyond judge minor leaning against a filing cabinet on the far wall stands billy byrd the redneck sheriff of adams county this is the most unlikely lynch mob i ever heard of but theres no doubt in my mind about their intended function two bricks lie on the landing at my feet im tempted to hurl one through shads window but that would probably put me in jail for the night instead i pick one up and start banging the metal railing of the fire escape the clanging echoes through the alley like hammer blows in a blacksmiths shop shad soon comes to his window i keep banging and sheriff byrd appears at the next window in the row then judge minor materializes behind him the sheriff motions angrily for me to stop i dont sheriff byrd clearly does not recognize me but now that i have the groups attention i hold up my cell phone shake it theatrically then dial shads office again they all turn away from the windows finally shad answers his phone hello whos making that goddamn racket i yell what shad asks in a flabbergasted voice who is this penn cage you unethical prick go downstairs and let me in is that you banging on that fire escape across the alley you bet it is and now that ive caught you three in the act theres no point trying to hide open up shad slams down the phone i scramble down the ladder and race around to the das door sheriff byrd stands waiting for me one hand on the gun in his belt and a seething anger tightening his jaw muscles what the sam d hell do you think youre doing he growls id like you to answer the same question i push past him and take the stairs two at a time preferring to confront the judge before the others but when i reach shads office judge minor is nowhere in sight now shad sits behind his antique desk watching me like someone looking at a dangerous mental patient wheres judge minor i demand the district attorney doesnt answer he didnt make it downstairs that fast unless he sprinted and thats a little undignified for a judgeeven one of questionable integrity is he hiding in another office what are you doing here at this hour shad asks slowly getting himself under control what are you talking about im talking about the third coconspirator in this little lynch mob shads mouth drops open youd better choose your words with more care counselor i said exactly what i meant to say did you now sheriff byrd asks from behind me huffing from the exertion of climbing stairs what else did i see through those windows i ask the circuit judge the sheriff and the district attorney all huddled in a room after dark the irony is exquisite what ironys that asks the sheriff who wouldnt know irony if it hit him over the head if shad and judge minor werent blackand if this were forty years agowhat else could i conclude but that i was seeing a lynching in the making you dont know what youre talking about shad says finally do you deny that you three were discussing drew elliott before i showed up sheriff byrd starts to deny it but shad holds up a hand to silence him why should i deny that because it isnt exactly standard procedure for a murder investigation dr elliott isnt a standard murder suspect neither was kate townsend a standard victim she was practically a celebrity around here and thats what we were discussing the whole towns turned upside down from the rumors going around and we wanted to make sure we were all on the same page thats called collusion shad its none of your damn business what were doing up here says the sheriff i focus on shad you know a meeting like that borders on being unethical drew hasnt even been charged with murder the circuit judge has no place whatever in this matter not at this time borderson shad echoes tilting his head to indicate the equivocal nature of this point this is a special case penn and we all agree that it needs to be expedited as quickly as possible thats exactly the wrong thing to do you need to proceed methodically follow precedent and leave no stone unturned in your investigation sheriff byrd leans against the filing cabinet again and regards me with disdain my mama always told me the worst vice is ad vice i know your mama i tell him i think most people would agree she could have used a little advice herself along the way byrd comes off the file cabinet with stunning speed one fist clenched and the other hand on his gun billy shad yells hes just trying to bait you you smug son of a bitch byrd says in a murderous tone just keep on with your shit see what happens shad lays his palms flat on his desk penn youll get your chance to weigh in on these issues during the trial but for now the trial youve found nothing so far that indicates drew should even be indicted youve hijacked the grand jury to question minors without their parents present youve started rumors that have already gone a long way toward ruining dr elliotts career half the town already thinks hes guilty of murder and he hasnt even been charged and what do you have really a rumor that he was having sex with kate townsend thats lightyears away from capital murder shad seems unfazed by my impassioned outburst are you finished for the moment then why dont you try listening for a change im all ears dr elliott is in deep trouble and it has nothing to do with the meeting you just witnessed let me review the evidence for you first the anonymous call that started this thing i start to argue but shad silences me with a shake of his head that call was too strange to ignore if you were the da you would have handled it just as i did youd have called dr elliott into your office in any case that anonymous call certainly led somewhere didnt it damned straight agrees sheriff byrd shad looks embarrassed to have byrds support second shad goes on the preliminary serology on the semen samples based on the lab findings one of those two samples is very likely to be confirmed as belonging to dr elliot when the dna analysis comes backwhich wont be as long as you think third that particular semen sample wasnt taken from the townsend girls vagina but from her rectum the hair along my forearms stands up when shad told me yesterday that kate had semen in both holes i naturally assumed that the unknown samplethe one unknown to me that iswas the one swabbed from her rectum that rather prurient fact shad says with authority bolsters my theory that dr elliots intercourse with the victim was an act of vengeance if not outright rape a grudgefuck i believe its called i cant even begin to deal with the implications of this new information in this room but at our first meeting you told me the trauma was vaginal didnt you i believe i said genital shad looks down at some papers on his desk there was labial swelling some vaginal abrasions but also anorectal swelling with small tears inside the anus i take a moment to process this which semen was deposited first that found in the vagina or the anal sample even if you assume drew had anal sex with kate he could have deposited that semen up to seventytwo hours before she was swabbed while the sperm found in her vagina could have been deposited just prior to death shad shakes his head and i detect something like smugness in his eyes well never know that he says since the girl was doa she wasnt swabbed until the next morning during the autopsy in jackson the sperm in both samples were dead one of the disadvantages of investigating crime in a small town what else do you have i ask quietly fourth shad enumerates fingerprints sheriff byrds detectives found dr elliots fingerprints all over kate townsends bedroom and private bathroom drew you stupid bastardi curse silently how do you know those prints are dr elliots i ask the sheriff given your relationship with the pd i cant believe you went to the city jail to print him or even that you asked the police to fax theirs over to you sheriff byrd gives me a superior smile one of my deputies took some prints from the docs private bathroom when they went to his office to collect his blood now i remember the short unpleasant deputy excused himself to use the restroom while susan salter pulled drews blood the little son of a bitch what else i ask working hard to hide my dismay phone records shad says weve got kate townsends cell phone records for the past year the past few months are clean but if you go back to this past summer it gives dr elliott some problems of course she called drew i say she was the family babysitter shad grins goodnaturedly youre going to dig the hole deeper if you dont keep your mouth shut why dont you listen to what i have to say hes right if drew were a normal client id stand here with my mouth shut but i feel compelled to defend my friend even when i dont know exactly what he has or hasnt done shad dons a pair of reading glasses and examines a piece of paper with tiny type on it i wouldnt have found it odd if the girl called dr elliotts home a few times or even more than a few but she didnt do that she called his medical office and his cell phone almost exclusively she did it often and at very odd times like three oclock in the morning and the calls lasted a very long time shad looks at me over the lenses of his glasses hours i struggle to hold my poker face but the real kicker shad says with obvious relish is that she didnt just call him direct she bought thirdparty phone cards at walmart and dialed into an number switchboard before calling his cell phone thats a standard method of trying to disguise phone callsparticularly in extramarital affairs he glances at sheriff byrd computers are a wonderful thing arent they byrd chuckles the only positive i can see is that they seem to have no record of kate using computers to textmessage drew certainly theyve checked his records by now perhaps those digital connections are not so easily traced what else shad removes his reading glasses and meets my gaze a classmate of kate townsends saw her changing cars with dr elliott in a public parking lot what do you mean changing cars you know exactly what i mean both of them parked their cars in a public lot and when they thought no one was looking kate climbed into dr elliots car and they drove away a female st stephens student told that to the grand jury this afternoon my stomach rolls over this girl also said that it looked like dr elliott and the girl were fighting how long ago did this supposedly happen and where shad shakes his head his eyes twinkling sorry counselor cant tell you everything that wouldnt be right shads litany of evidence like this would titillate and possibly sway a juryuntil they realized that he was proving the wrong point fine i say drew looks like a dog for carrying on with kate townsend but youre no closer to murder than you were ten minutes ago all youve given me is evidence of an extramarital affair most of it circumstantial this isnt a divorce case shad he nods as if in agreement youre right about that but youre wrong about what ive shown and you know it ive presented you with direct evidence of sexual battery a serious felony shads heading right where i didnt want him to go dr elliott was kate townsends personal physician he says a position of trust defined by statute having consensual sex just once with a juvenile female patient will buy him thirty years in the pen and i figure dr elliott probably repeated that offense a hundred times or more openandshut case says sheriff byrd i give shad my coldest stare you dont give a damn about drew having sex with that girl if you charge him on that offense its pure politics and everyone in town will know it how do you figure that youre singing your song about positions of trust and underage sex you want to go out to the public school with me tomorrow and start questioning seventeenyearold black girls you want to ask them if any of their coaches have rubbed their shoulders after practice or maybe rubbed some more intimate parts as defined in the statute on sexual battery shad has gone still as a bust in a museum you want to go over to the junior high and start asking fifteenyearold black girls how many of them are sleeping with adult men thats statutory rape open and shut hell you could fill up both jails in an hour but you wont do that will you youd lose votes faster than if you put on a kkk sheet and hood dont pretend that public morals or public safety have anything to do with this case okay you want to convict a rich white man to further your political ambitions end of story i turn to sheriff byrd i dont know why youre part of this but im going to find out and dont think ill hesitate to go to the media with the whole stinking mess youve already ruined my clients reputation ive got nothing to lose both men are staring at me with more anxiety than anger sheriff byrd walks over to a chair and takes a seat beside shad the district attorney rises from his chair comes around the desk settles his butt on it and smiles as though this whole confrontation is just a misunderstanding between friends penn you were a prosecutor for fifteen years the evidence ive laid out tonight is just what weve uncovered in the first fortyeight hours can you imagine what else there is to find you know dr elliots dna is going to match what we took from that girls rectum and at that pointforget any future evidence that comes inat that point just about any jury in this state will be ready to fry his ass and not lose a minutes sleep over it i let his last sentence hang in the air this is the kind of logic that condemned many an innocent black man not so many years ago theres just one problem with your scenario shad a tiny little hole that a secondyear law student could drive a cement truck through whats that the second semen sample youre completely ignoring it who else had sex with kate townsend who raped her thats what you should be trying to find out on the contrary he says thats the cornerstone of my case dr elliott murdered kate townsend in a jealous rage over what he perceived as infidelity on the girls part then whos the mystery man if the semen in her vagina wasnt deposited during a rape why hasnt the guy come forward shad glances at sheriff byrd as if deciding how much to reveal i think its a kid he says finally just like the deceased a kid whos scared shitless and with good reason he doesnt want to jump into the middle of a capital murder case also hes probably scared of dr elliott maybe he saw elliott kill the girl if so hes got to figure if he killed her hell damn sure kill me to keep me quiet or the kid may have told his parents what he sawthey may be keeping him from coming forward these days a lot of parents would do that everything you just told me is pure speculation shad shrugs maybe so but its the kind of speculation juries like hes right and although he might have some difficulty getting this speculation into the record in a normal courtroom hell have no trouble with judge minor good old arthel will give shad all the rope he needs to hang drew with innuendo come on cage says sheriff byrd you know as well as i do that most murder victims are killed by people they know and know well same with rape youre absolutely right are you satisfied that youre aware of everybody kate townsend knew well were getting there so you know all about cyrus white byrds eyes narrow but shad looks blank what are you talking about asks the sheriff im talking about regular contactregular and documented contactbetween kate townsend and cyrus white and im not talking about casual encounters in the mall im talking about her visiting his crib in the brightside manor apartments stop right there shad says irritably who the hell is cyrus white only the biggest drug dealer in the city of natchez shad glances at byrd is that right the sheriff nods reluctantly why havent i heard of him before i cant resist answering the voters of this city would probably like to ask you the same question shad the sheriff gives me a dark look then cuts his eyes at shad you dont know who cyrus is because hes never been arrested where did you get your information cage since i cant betray sonny cross i barb my evasion with a point from the same person who told me cyrus was sexually obsessed with kate townsend bullshit cyrus has a serious jones for white girls billy that seems like the kind of thing you ought to know about given the circumstances of this case cyrus is black shad asks i mean if he lives in brightside manor i guess he must be hes black the sheriff confirms but he doesnt always stay at brightside he has safe houses and apartments all around town the crib at brightside is just one of them cyrus moves around a lot where was this guy when the murder happened shad asks sheriff byrd looks at me again but says nothing he doesnt know i tell shad billy figured he could nail dr elliott on circumstantial evidence alone and since thats what you want him to do why look any further right sheriff screw you cage dont tell me how to run my business somebody needs to has it seeped into your brain yet that st catherines creek runs right behind brightside manor sheriff byrds mouth falls open he looks like a largemouth bass thats been hooked deep in the gut thats what i figured i turn to shad aint it a bitch you were all ready to rush a pillar of this community to execution to make yourself look good for an election and now cyrus white drops out of the woodwork nailing a black drug dealer for killing a white girl wont buy you much capital with black voters will it in fact it might hurt you some shads eyes are no longer focused on me theyve moved off to the middle distance as he makes lightning calculations about the political ramifications of all this ask yourself this shad i say softly on one hand youve got a distinguished physician whos never been in trouble in his life he was having sex with an underage girl but he was in love with her and ready to marry her thats the guy youve got sitting in jail on the other hand youve got a notorious drug dealer who violently wiped out all his competition who is known to have been sexually obsessed with the murder victim and who lives on the creek into which the body was dumped nowwhich suspect would a reasonable man conclude is the most likely killer shad swallows audibly the sound gives me great satisfaction sheriff byrd stands up straight and tries to stare a hole through me except for the paunch he looks a lot like the blackhatted gunfighters in the old westerns my dad and i watched when i was a kid tell me where you got your information about cyrus and the townsend girl he says taking two steps toward me sorry sheriff if i told you everything that wouldnt be right would it shad speaks in a cold voice tell him or ill charge you with obstruction of justice you call what i saw when i walked into this office justice i laugh outright then turn and walk to the door ill see you boys tomorrow after youve taken a dna sample from cyrus white and be sure to inform the newspaper the grand jury and judge minor that you have a second suspect or ill have to do it for you hold it cage sheriff byrd warns were a long way from done here i keep walking you cant get out shad calls after me the downstairs door is locked hes right then get your ass down there and open it or ill smash it open do that and ill arrest you threatens the sheriff his voice edged with hatred its times like this that i think the judicial system should be entrusted solely to women arrest me and ill make you look like the biggest asshole in the county on the front page of tomorrows paper and thats saying something billy byrd looks like hes about to stroke out open it for him shad says softly here are the keys i walk downstairs without waiting for billy hell be ready to kill me by the time he reaches the ground floor but right now i dont give a damn i stand at the glass door listening to his boot heels hammer the steps and the keys jangling in his hand he stops behind me but makes no move to open the door youre writing mighty big checks with that mouth of yours he says in a low voice i turn and face him my jaw set what did shad buy you with billy whatever it was it must have been big i know you dont sell cheap especially to a black man theyve never been your kind of folks byrds trigeminal nerve twitches his cheek be careful boy of what exactly the smile that cracks his face is like another mans grimace dont you wish it was forty years ago i say softly so you could just put two in the back of my head and say i assaulted you or maybe that i tried to escape the smile leaves byrds lips sometimes i think they had it right back then yeah open the door the sheriff tosses shads keys onto the floor and walks back up the stairs i unlock the door toss shads keys into a trash can in the corner and walk out into the night as i stand in the street looking at the hulking white courthouse everything i didnt know about drew rushes through my mind with dizzying speed his fingerprints in kates bedroom kates cell phone records a witness seeing drew and kate changing cars in a parking lot each of these facts is another stone in the pile that could eventually bury drew at trial not evidence of murder of course but evidence of depravity to a conservative jury and shad was right about one thing if the semen found in kates rectum turns out to match drews dna shads theory of rape and murder as revenge is going to sound a lot more plausible no member of a mississippi jury will want to believe that a high school senior was practicing anal sex for recreation im not sure i believe it myself if it werent for cyrus whites relationship with kateand the location of the brightside manor apartmentsid be damned frightened right now my cell phone rings the caller id saysmia but when i answer all i hear is sobs mia is that you shes crying im sure of it my heart bounds into high gear is annie all right yes but something terrible has happened tell me chris vogel is dead chris vogel is a junior at st stephens and the star of the basketball team i saw him two days ago shooting threepoint shots in a neighbors driveway downtown are you sure positive everybodys talking about it how did he die he drowned at lake st john lake st john the same lake where the xrave was held last nighti climb into my saab crank the engine and pull into the empty street when did this happen mia tonight do you have any details more than i want apparently chris never came back to town after the party last night he and jimmy wingate ditched school today everybody figured they had hangovers because they wouldnt answer their cell phones but apparently they stayed up at the wingates lake house they just didnt want word to get back to the teachers where they were they stayed drunk and probably worse given the shit that was up there the other night you mean drugs mmhm how do you know all this christy blake called and told me about chris but as soon as i hung up with her i called jimmy wingate we were good friends when we were little hes in bad shape seeing chris drown really messed him up i want to know more but id rather hear it facetoface ill be home in three minutes tell me when i get there okay mia sobs into the phone please hurry i hang up and press down on the accelerator ive never seen or heard mia lose her composure before but tonight its no wonder death is difficult enough for adults to deal with but for adolescents it can be a paralyzing shock flushed with hormones and in the best physical shape of their lives they view death as a shadowy event that waits incomprehensibly far in the future the sudden loss of one of their ownparticularly a school hero like chris vogelpunctures their illusions of immortality you are not immune says fate speaking with utter permanence two high school kids dead in two daysmuses a voice in my head in a school with only five hundred students how could they not be connected chapter im parked outside my house on washington street trying to reach sonny cross the narcotics agent who told me about cyrus white mia stands in the open door her worried face illuminated by the porch light someone answers in a voice so soft as to be almost inaudible sonny i ask are you asleep on surveillance he whispers hang on i hear the sound of heels on pavementprobably sonnys snakeskin cowboy bootsand then he speaks in a normal voice you must have heard about the vogel boy yeah things go to shit in a hurry dont they do you think his death was drugrelated definitely the kid with him admitted theyd done three tabs of acid in the past twelve hours i was there when they questioned him did he say where they got it claims they found it in a bag by the lake road this is jimmy wingate yeah were his parents there sonny chuckles dryly oh yeah jimmys old man threatened to beat the crap out of him if he didnt tell us the truth and the kidstill wouldnt talk you think they got the acid from marko bakic who else but nobodys admitting that these kids either love marko or theyre scared shitless of him maybe both i suggest marko knows nothing about american football but he won the south state football playoff for st stephens by kicking the winning field goal i wouldnt think that would be enough to keep kids quiet when a childhood friend dies though yeah well times on our side bubba let chriss death really sink in and somebodyll get mad enough or upset enough to talk i hope so st stephens cant take much more of this natchez cant take much more sonny mutters could the lsd have come from cyrus white rather than marko you can bet it went through cyruss hands before it got to marko just like it went through the asians hands before it got to cyrus i suppose some other white kid could be buying from cyrus but it wasnt until marko got to st stephens that this shit started showing up there look sonny i had to mention the cyruskate connection in front of sheriff byrd i kept your name out of it but i did tell him the contact was documented he may be able to figure out where it came from based on that ah shit dont worry about it byrd cant afford to fire me i make him look too good i gotta go penn later i hang up and get out of the car as i walk up the steps mia runs forward and hugs me then sobs against my chest whats happening everythings gone crazy calm down i tell her trying to separate us then giving up and stroking her hair the way i do annies when shes upset its going to be all right she pulls away and stares at me her eyes sparkling with tears no its not you know its not dont tell me things are okay when theyre not my dad does that the dad who left when she was twoim not saying things are okay mia im telling you im going to make them right how you cant bring chris back to life no all i can do is try to keep what happened to chris from happening to anybody else she lays her head on my chest again i let her alone for a bit trying not to feel too awkward with her body pressing against mine then i separate us wheres annie in bed good do you feel like telling me what you know now she wipes her eyes and nose my eyes are swollen that always happens when i cry i know i look like shit its okay just tell me what happened she disengages from me sits on the top step and hugs her knees about seven tonight chris bet jimmy wingate he could beat him across the lake swimming right as cold as it is at night and thats the wide part of the lake too jimmy didnt want to do it but chris was wasted and kept calling jimmy a pussy i can just see it chris is such a redneck sometimes so they tried it no life jackets pitch black they were about halfway across when chris got into trouble he just stopped swimming and tried to float he told jimmy he was watching the moon that the moon was changing colors every second theyd done three tabs of acid in the past twelve hourssonny said jimmy tried to get him to keep swimming mia continues but it was like chris couldnt hear him jimmy was treading water and he knew he couldnt last long when he finally got chris to start swimming again chris started puking after that chris couldnt keep himself afloat jimmy wasnt sure which bank they were closer to so he tried to pull chris back to the pier where theyd started he barely made it forty yards before he was exhausted mia is rocking steadily now he had to let chris go and he barely made it back himself he was crying like a baby when he told me this things have gone crazy i murmur did i help any mia asks what about shad johnson did i help dr elliott by seeing shad with the judge and the sheriff i reach down and squeeze her shoulder you helped a lot i really appreciate it can you tell me about it i wish i could but you dont trust me its not that its just she looks up her eyes hurt if you really trusted me youd tell me i sit beside her on the steps drews situation is about more than a crime okay its political the da wants to convict drew to prove that a rich white man wont be treated any better than a poor black one in this town that sounds like a good thing if that were the real reason he was doing it it would be but its not shad wants to be elected mayor and if what he really wanted was to bring this city back to life id support him but thats not what he wants he wants a steppingstone to bigger things he wants personal power and hes willing to railroad drew to get it mia turns to me and smiles through her tears that wasnt so hard was it no she raises a forefinger and pretends to zip her lips its in the vault seinfeld she laughs then she begins to cry again did you know chris well i ask since nursery school this doesnt surprise me i started at st stephens when i was four years old fourteen years later most of the people i graduated with were children id played with in nursery school i knew them as well as i knew my own family and many of them i still do thats one of the things that makes this shrinking town worth saving some of the best parts of american life that have vanished elsewhere still thrive here i still want to help mia says i mean it even if you think its dangerous schools boring me to death im just counting the days until graduation i want to do something that matters especially now i stand and pull her to her feet then look hard into her eyes who brought the lsd to the party she goes still her eyes locked on mine was it marko i dont know not for sure would you tell me if you knew i dont know what would keep you from it loyalty to your friends to marko or is it fear of marko she closes her eyes then opens them again ill think about that okay im not sure myself fair enough id better go now i try to give her a smile of encouragement but it fails will you hug me once more she asks in a small voice i start to but something stops me never mind she says her mercurial eyes quick to recognize my hesitation she walks down the steps and to her car not once looking back be careful mia dont worry i can take care of myself she slams her door and pulls away leaving me feeling like a complete asshole chapter closeted in my downstairs bedroom with kates shoe box i remove her journal again and prop myself up in bed i already tried without success to view the contents of the three lexar flash drives from the box each flash drive is protected by a security program that requires a password even to view file names and types ill have to ask drew tomorrow if he knows any of kates passwords if kate stored intimate photos on the drives maybe he was privy to that information so that he could borrow the drives sometimes and view them if not ill have to hire a professional hacker to open the files after adjusting my reading light i reread the opening passage of kates journal then wade into the body of the work her voice seems mature for her age which i would expect from a senior bound for harvard but theres something else here an unguarded honesty i didnt expect ive been sent many manuscripts by published and unpublished writers over the years and one thing ive learned is that people who write unflinchingly from the heart have the capacity to move us where more polished craftsmen often fall short kates journal begins in the early summer of last year as i read the early entries my hunger to know more about her more recent months causes me to skip ahead what quickly emerges from the pages is a picture of a girl maturing very fast changing from a bored overachiever concerned with the social politics of high school to a fully engaged young woman ready to ditch the standard plan in order to be with the man she loved by the time ive skimmed to the halfway point i find myself mourning kate townsend more deeply than i would have thought possible realizing that i might have missed important information in my haste i go back and start again this time folding down the corners of pages that seem representative of the arc of her final year and also of those that hold information that might be helpful in defending drew theres the early stuff where kate was still a part of the high school as most adults imagine it drew was recuperating from a knee injury and thus home all day with kate and timmy mia got voted head cheerleader today makes me wish i never even tried out well she deserves it she actually seems to give a damn about the stupid games or at least about cheering im not sure why i tried out except that its what youre supposed to do im such a retard its too late to quit now though damn damn damn steve and i went to the lake today he was really moody he keeps asking me what ill do if i get into harvard or princeton as if i would turn one of them down its so obvious that were going to split up when that time comes i dont know how i can keep playing this role until then i already cant remember what made me date him in the first place i mean the physical element is still there but aside from that its hell he cant carry on a conversation thats not about baseball or deer hunting or what soandso looks like and hes so vain i dont think hes ever passed a mirror without looking into it hes always fixing his hair and asking me how it looks hes such a nobody would believe it but he is god i want a guy i can talk to i hope like hell the guys at college are different the ones at colleges around here sure arent though theyre the steves that left high school two or three years agolet me get in early decision played tennis with ellen elliott after work today she waspissed i wonder if they still make love i really doubt it mom told me she heard that ellen cheated on him a couple of years ago why would she do that shes got a guy most women would give their left ovary for and shes cheating with some stupid tennis pro is there something i dont know about drew is he terrible in bed brilliant and interesting but incompetent between the sheets no way that cant be it they sleep in different rooms now he says its because of his knee but ill bet that dates back to the tennis pro i bet i know why she did it too ive seen the insecurity in her that need for constant reassurance like the breast implantstoo big dont ever let me be that pathetic drew talks to me like an equal none of the condescending crap i get from most adults around here that drives me most of them havent read a book in twenty years other than john grisham or nora fucking roberts the other day i made an allusion to john updike and mrs andersen thought i was talking about anhello sometimes when his knee is really hurting drew asks me to read to him i love it he lies there on the sofa just looking at the ceiling he lets me pick what i want to read too i read him a play by paddy chayefsky one of keseys books part ofan essay by ayn rand he asks me where i come up with this stuff nabokov would be too obvious but once i tried to embarrass him by reading an incestuous sex scene from anaïs nin he kept a straight face for about five minutes then closed his eyes when i got to the really explicit part he started to snore i really thought hed fallen asleep bastard ellen wont look me in the eye when were in their house on the tennis court were fine but if she comes home while im keeping tim she wont meet my gaze its weird its like she sees me as a threat i go out of my way to speak to her but she cuts every conversation short has she caught drew looking at me when im not looking or something has heabout me to her maybe she feels im usurping her position with timmy if it werent for drew id want out of there drews knee has gotten a lot better hes talking about going on the mission trip to honduras after all ellen told me i should go along that its the kind of realworld experience that a lot of the kids going into the ivy league may already have had i meanwhen i asked whydoesnt go she told me once was enough she apparently got a case of dysentery in the dominican republic and that killed her desire to help the unfortunate in any way except by writing a check if hes serious about letting me come im going to do it why not id love to see honduras and id really love to be with him somewhere without ellen and timmy just to see how we are on august drew and kate flew to honduras along with a team sponsored by a local church this is a journey into the unbelievable never have i seen people so poor so sick so helpless yet never have i seen smiles so broad eyes so bright or heard laughter so pure ive shot a hundred pics already my admiration for drew grows every day that i watch him work there are five other doctors with ussome of them specialistsbut somehow drew is the de facto leader of the team ive watched the other doctors gape in awe as he works yesterday he removed four cancerous masses from a miners neck two of the other doctors warned him not to do it they said the patient needed a hospital and general anesthesia drew said the guy would never get either and that the cancer would probably cut off his air supply within a month the operation took place under a tarp stretched over a picnic table drew injected the man with lidocaine told him to be still then cut on him for about an hour he had to inject more lidocaine throughout the procedure but the miner just smiled and murmured encouragement all through the operation he somehow knew drew was his last best hope i know one thing now thats the kind of man i want not a doctor necessarily but a man wholl take risks to do what he knows is right who wont be paralyzed by anxiety or rules or anything else i want someone whowhen drew walked out of that tent i waited until no one was around and then hugged him as tight as i could and told him i thought he was wonderful corny maybe but i dont care anybody with eyes to see would have said the same today i asked drew if he believed in god i mean this is a mission trip right but it doesnt seem to me that hes into all the praying and bible stuff the others talk about every night he told me he doesnt believe in the conventional concept of god he said the idea of a god that watches the sparrow fall that intervenes in human affairs that rewards the faithful and punishes the wicked is a wishful fantasy i asked him about life after death and he just shook his head come on i said what happens after you die he looked at me like he was a thousand years old and said kate when you die youre dead i think hes watched a lot of people die in pain so this is all there is i asked he nodded and said all well ever know as individuals anyway then i guess wed better do all we can to be happy i said which i believe he looked so sad then but he said i think youre right and then i made this colossal blunder and said are you happy with your wife i never meant to say that i meant to say are you happy with your life but it just came out and i let it stand he looked at me for a really long time without saying anything and then he turned away and then i knew i guess id always known he wasnt happy and he hadnt been for a long time and i wanted to make him happy wanted it in a way i never wanted anything before i wondered what would make him happy and whether maybe i could i knew then that id do whatever it took to take away the pain and loneliness in that face the mission team soon returned to natchez but too much had happened to go back to the way things were before it finally happened we were talking in his workshop fourth time i sneaked out and it was really hot his air conditioner was broken i said we ought to go over to the johnsons pool since theyre out of town drew was worried at first but then he said yes we slipped through the trees and then across the open grass to the edge of their pool he looked at me like he was unsure what to do so i went first i took off my top and my shorts and then i walked into the water i turned back and watched him strip to his underwearboxer briefs i couldnt stop shivering id seen him in just tennis shorts before but this was different because we were alone we swam for a while keeping our distance talking from a few yards apart but then finally we came together and he held me while we talked he moved out to where the water was about five feet deep and i wrapped my legs around him and laid my head on his shoulder we talked for a long time and then we stopped talking i asked if he wanted to kiss me he didnt say yes he just raised my head looked into my eyes and did it my whole body was quivering id waited so long for that moment his kiss was so tender and knowing not like steves at all not like anyones except maybe sarah evansswhich is weird because drew is so masculine and then he said i want to see you i knew what he meant so i slipped my bra straps down and then my whole bra he looked at my breasts as though appraising them and then he covered my nipple with his mouth and i started to lose track of everything i literally melted into the water i felt him against me down there after a while he made this shocked sound and then he told me to put my hand down between us that kind of scared me but i let him pull my hand down the pool water was cold but between us the water was very warm like someone was peeing in it i thought for a minute that maybe hepeeing and that he was weird about that or something but then he said its you kate thats and i blushed so deeply because i realized it was drew held me tight and pulled me against himstill with his shorts onand started moving against me then he whispered in my ear is it all right if i climax i literally could not speak i just nodded into his shoulder and then he did there was this explosion of air from his lungs not grunting or anything like steve and then he just shivered the length of his body i was crying but not from sadness i was overwhelmed i wanted to look in the water but i didnt he walked to the shallows then still holding me up then he walked up out of the pool like i was a little girl he carried me over to this big padded chair the johnsons have on their patio and laid me down in it and then we did it for real god when i think about it now sitting here in the cold airconditioning all i can really remember is clinging to him and feeling things id never felt before i kept thinking hes married stupid but i didnt stop or tell him to after he finally stopped moving i tried to sound calm when he talked to me but i wasnt i was freaking out my heart was just pounding but i didnt want him to know imshaking its am andhow can i look at ellen now if i go late i wont have to see her shell be playing tennis or getting her hair done or something and timmy god this is going to behard and soi feel guilty but thats only part of me the other part cant think of anything but him last nightwanting it again that ineffable closeness i cant believe that was our first time where do we go from here i hope hes okay with it not freaking out because im so young he looked so happy i think he was crying at one point but i didnt want to say anything he needed me so badly have to sleep some now two lives thats what im leading its the strangest experience ever i have a day self and a night self and the two never flow together during the day drew is a vague feeling always there yet indistinct a heaviness in my stomach a tingle in my forearms life goes on around me and with me yet the real me is hibernating i cant eata new experience ive always eaten ravenously but now i cant eat anything the excitement and anticipation fill me in some way ive never been filled before turning my heart into a huge balloon that presses down my stomach and rises into my throat is this what love is when i first see him that balloon rises so high into my throat that i cant speak but the sleep deprivation is starting to get to me i feel like im hallucinating sometimes if i dont get some rest mias going to take valedictorian and i cant afford to lose that until i hear something from harvard maybe i should quit the cheerleading squad that wouldnt affect my transcript and i could take naps in the afternoon maybe as i read on kates amazing selfawareness shows me how drew could become so captivated by her i know some people will say im looking for a father figure and my first instinct would be to say bullshit i already have a father he just happens to be a prick but really what if i am what if one of the needs drew fills for me is a protective presence who takes care of certain things whats wrong with that everyone needs some of that and i was certainly shortchanged in that department growing up if drew is happy being that for me and if he makeshappy by being that wheres the fault in it a lot of people would be happy to tell me of course but screw them what do they know half of conventional married couples end up divorcing sois this relationship going to stunt my emotional growth or something no most people wholl criticize us probably stopped growing themselves years agoemotionally and intellectuallyespecially in this tiny town after two months of nightly rendezvous kate has developed into an accomplished lover and her hunger seems to have no bounds yet just as in the past she continues to measure herself against others tonight i had eight orgasms in two hours two clitoral six vaginal drew is amazing or maybeam do other women respond like this i hope so for their sakes but i know ellen never did and i know my girlfriends dont except maybe karen carr drew wants to test my testosterone level he thinks a libido like mine has to be driven by something other than the normal hormonal flow i think he must be right with the crazy things i want theres still so much i havent shown him sometimes we get to a place where it hurts me but instead of wanting it to stop i want it to intensify once when i was on top his hand was on my breastbone and it slipped up around my neck i pressed it there with both hands to show him what i wanted he squeezed for a little bit but he didnt really cut off my air i wanted to tell him that steve used to do that for me at my request of course but i felt too weird to say it drew would probably understand but im not sure if i tell him how that gets me off he might think im messed up somehow of all the things weve done hes never suggested anything that involved pain i could tell him i read somewhere that some people like oxygen deprivation when they climax he probably knows that already and try to get to it that way i could say karen told me about it i dont know maybe isick or something but if i want it it must be natural so whats wrong with it all i can think about after reading that entry is the autopsy report cause of death strangulation could it be that kate wasnt murdered at all that she died during what was for her normal sexual activity im still wondering this when the name ive been searching for leaps off the page as though written in letters of fire tonight i met cyrus facetoface cant talk about why even here he wasnt at all what i expected he looks young and old at the same time his face is young but his eyes are old he reminds me of drew that way cruelty and kindness living in the same soul i found myself wondering who would win if he and drew had to fight to the death like that stupid mel gibson movie two go in one comes out and what would they fight over me of course a scary image but it turns me on too in a weird wayturns me on fuck fuck fuckclearly i didnt make the cut for early decision after school mrs parrinder pulled me aside and told me mia got into brown thats probably true i remember brown had the same ed notification date as harvard thats weird too because mias so straight compared to me youd thinkbe going to brown and she to harvard of course she claims she didnt even apply to harvard but i know thats bullshit she had the sats and who wouldnt apply who had a chance of getting in tonight drew and i talked about maybe bringing someone else into our lovemaking he says hes never done that before and i like the idea of making him experience something he never hassure never done it the only girls i know who have are sluts who pulled a train when they were drunk or something or susie drane who let chris and chip both do her on the football field one night ugh the obvious question should the third be a guy or a girl when drew asked what i thought i said girl to make it seem less threatening but the truth is id rather it be a guy idto see drew do things to a guy and vice versa but i also want to know what it feels like to be completely full when i finally admitted that drew didnt seem threatened by it but clearly there are problems with this kind of thing do you pick a friend you both know really well or a total stranger you know youll never see again a stranger reduces the emotional risks but increases the medical ones the easiest way to start would be sarah evans of course since ive already been with her but when drew asked if we could trust her to keep quiet i realized i wasnt sure sarahs been kind of stalking me lately and this would make that worse drew said maybe the best thing would be to try a couple a guy and girl at the same time that way wed all have the same things at risk and nobody would feel left out of the sexual stuff i asked drew if there was a woman he fantasized about having or if he had a friend he could trust to try something like this i was afraid he was going to say mia burke but he really surprised me he said maybe penn cage the writer drew trusts him and penns girlfriend fiancée is like and hot caitlin masters is her name i played tennis with her once at duncan park shes from boston and she dresses sort of risque sometimes so maybe shed be into something like this it seems weird even to be writing about this but if its something you desire what are you supposed to do pretend it never popped into your head drew said we shouldnt rush it though and i think hes right theres time for all this while the shock of reading this passage settles over me i see cyruss name lower down the page cyrus wants me and hes so fucking open about itmore open than drew ever was maybe its a racial thing just to be out with it like that or maybe hes just used to getting whatever girl he wants he kept pulling on his package while he talked to me just like the black guys on mlk street like i wasnt seeing it or like he didnt give a shit if i did itsa double standard what if those guys wives and girlfriends walked around rubbing their clitorises clitorisae all the time theydall that practiced cool would evaporate in about two seconds and somewhere behind that double standard is the belief that its different for men that men need it more think about it all the time etc if only they knew a month passes without major changes in kates pattern then cyrus reappears like a supply ship that arrives once a month cyrus is definitely getting to be a problem tonight he walked me into a corner and murmured stuff right in my ear he asked if i had something against niggers his word not mine i told him i didnt but that i was in love with someone else he asked who some he said god i wanted to tell him about drew that would have made him step back he just stared at me like a wild man like he blames me for driving him crazy then he touched my right breastnot too hard just a tweak to my nipple i was wearing a bra thank god because my headlights definitely came on from fear im sure he could probably see them but too bad hes makingcrazy i just hope i dont have to do this much longer but its all in a good cause right at least i see it that way the cops definitely wouldnt this passage makes me think kate was seeing cyrus to buy drugs im ecstatic to find evidence of cyruss obsession with kate i only wish i could show selected portions of this journal to shad johnson a dangerous game tonight i told drew that the best kisser i ever knew was a girl have to be honest right nothing ever aroused me faster than sarah evanss tongue in my mouth it anticipated every want before i even wanted it drew asked if she kissed me down low better than he does again yes but i think she had an unfair advantage she knows the territory better than any man could at least drew doesnt freak out like other guys about other sex ive had how can he though hes been with like women before he got married of course ive never cheated on him that would probably be different in fact i know it would i never want to find out i never want to see him truly angry as i read the last line again i know i can never show this journal to shad here is the smoking gun that the da would give anything to be able to read aloud to a jury by midfebruary kate is growing less obsessed with sex and more concerned with the future of her relationship with drew ive always heard people say youth is wasted on the young but i didnt understand that until id been with drew awhile now i look around and see people my age living from moment to moment jumping from thing to thing without thought on one hand its beautiful to be completely in the moment but its also like being less alive almost living like an animal without past or future except people arent truly like animals because theyre haunted by insecurity kids dont realize how much freedom they have to screw up over and over if they need to because thats the true gift of youthtime the need to be accepted drives everyone to crazy extremes even adults but in my peers its almost a manic need and girls are the worst it isnt even acceptance that most of them want but attention my god the things theyll do to get it alter their voices act out give blowjobs to guys they barely know look at me look at me notice me i talked to a couple of friends about it but of course they think i dont understand their problems they all say im so beautiful and smart and assume ive never had to deal with selfdoubt a couple of years ago i was a pathetic wreck i just hid it better than most guess i learned that from mom thanx mom if you ever read this mom knows oh my god i dont know how im going to tell drew im only writing because drew didnt get on the computer hurry up hes going to freak but i have to let him know somehow that its all right i cant believe it all that anxiety ive had about mom finding out and shes known for two weeks shes played itshe wouldnt even tell me how she knows but she acted like shes seen us together or something maybe she followed me over there maybe she walked in on us here and didnt tell me its so weird she said she knows i think im in love with him but thats only natural since im so young and hes such a good guy in so many ways shes really concerned with drews feelings i think and she wants to talk to him actually now that i think about it drew will be glad its come to this i mean i think he will i guess i should look at this as a test if he panics and doesnt want to talk to her then hes not serious about wanting to be with me im just agod that would kill me but if thats how he reacts ive got to face it every time i go to cyruss i tell myself its the last time but then i have to go again its just taking so long longer than drews worst estimate sometimes i feel stupid for waiting but thats par for the course i guess i should talk to some other mistresses about this im sure were a silent sisterhood suffering alone yet all dealing with the same issues mom and drew talked tonight he actually came over to our house at and the two of them talked in the kitchen for like two hours i went over to lessleys before he got there because mom wanted to see him alone she called me home at one am she had tears in her eyes when i walked in but i think she was happy i asked her what was wrong and she said i dont know why im crying and i said what happened tell me she just hugged me and said he really loves you honey he loves you in a way no one ever loved me youre very lucky in that youre just unlucky in the circumstances she said a lot more but i cant sit still to write it im going over to drews in twenty minutes oh my god ifor him to talk to dad hes one person the great david townsend sure wont intimidate i think mom wants to see that encounter too it makes me realize how daddy has used his education and his gender to intimidate us i want to see what hes like when that advantage is neutralized by superior strength and intelligence hell yeah moms been worrying lately she trusts drew she even worries for him her main worry is timmy i think she doesnt know whether drews love for me is strong enough to make him leave tim i understand drews conflict though the irony is devastating because one of the things i love about him is that hes not like my dad yes he could divorce ellen but he could never abandon tim hell always be the father he needs to be and thats just something im going to have to deal with i mean i love timmy too even though he isnt mine and drew and i can have our own after a while anyway its going to be all right i know it is got my acceptance letter yeah now i get to drop the hbomb like all the other ivy league brats and now im secondguessing myself of course before i got in i thought i wasnt good enough for harvard now its likemaybe its too cliché for me its like woody allen said id never want to join a club that would take me as a member plus i saw the same juvenile shit in cambridge that i did when i visited ole missyou got what you wanted live with it then kates final entry five days nowbeen this late before drew told me to get a test at the pharmacy but ive been too nervous i dont want to know yet theres so much stress already i dont want to add my being pregnant to it drew doesnt need that neither does mom neither do but i keep thinking about that senior party at the lake when i got so drunk i know i missed my pill that day and maybe even the day after shit what if ii always thought id get an abortion but now that its real thats not such an easy call i mean what if i had the baby drew already told me that its my decision he wont pressure me either way and i know he means it in some way it would be such a relief my future would be decided at least in that way drews been talking to a med school friend about practicing medicine in boston he said he already took the boards or whatever he was saving that as a surprise but i think he wanted to ease my worry about the future he definitely loves me hes shown me so many times in so many ways if a baby comesthat child would be the two of us alive in the world as one and with that the journal ends less than twentyfour hours later kate townsend was dead i close the book and drop it onto the floor beside my bed im too tired to try to analyze what ive just read i switch off the ringer on my phone turn off my reading lamp and roll onto my stomach as sleep slowly takes me one aspect of the journal remains at the forefront of my thoughts kates voracious sexuality seventeen years old and already she was considering the risks and rewards of a ménage à trois with a stranger more disturbing still in light of the way she died was kates desire to be choked during sex this opens up so many possibilities that i must wait until ive rested to consider them but one thought refuses to leave me alone it now seems less impossible than it did yesterday that kate townsend could have died at drews hands chapter annie leans over the front seat of my car kisses me then climbs out and runs into the st stephens middle school from habit i wait until she disappears from my sight before driving on its a primitive instinct like the one that made annie keep a hand in contact with me for over a year after her mother died even while she slept as the line of cars moves slowly past the high school holden smith steps from beneath the overhang and motions for me to pull over when i do he comes to the window with a big smile and tells me hes scheduled an emergency board meeting to deal with the aftermath of our two student deaths yesterday he practically demanded my resignation along with drews todaywith the examiner offering up cyrus white as a possible suspecthes saying the board was hasty in suggesting i resign holden sounds positive that chris vogel drowned because of ecstasy or lsd and while no one has fingered marko bakic as the source of those drugs holden seems quite prepared to expel our troublesome exchange student without any proof i reiterate my intention to resign but i also agree to appear at the meeting primarily in order to gather the most information possible about the events surrounding chris vogels death i feel holdens relief as he pumps my hand in farewell chickenshit i mutter as he walks away i pull out onto highway and head into town the first order of the day is getting the assault charge against drew dismissed as i pass the hospital my cell phone rings its don logan chief of the natchez police department are you getting your buddy out of jail this morning he asks im on my down there now well his situation has worsened a bit since last night my pulse quickens something serious has happened how so this morning we searched the woods upstream from where we found the townsend girl we started at dawn and we moved pretty fast along both banks we had a little dispute with the sheriffs department but i wont go into that now the point for you is that when we reached the woods between pinehaven and the creek we found kates cell phone theres a hitch in my breathing and its one of those camera phones she had some pictures stored inside it one of those pictures shows dr elliott asleep on a bed in the nude even though im driving i waver like a man losing his balance does the district attorney know about that picture yes sir he does while i work through the implications of this development chief logan speaks again penn between you and me ive got a source over at the sheriffs department she tells me that dr elliott is going to be arrested by a couple of deputies as soon as he leaves this building jesuson what charge sexual battery is what i heard but im thinking murder if the da wants drew charged with another crime why doesnt he just have you charge him theres a long silence before logan answers the da would tell you its because murder is a state crime and a defendant accused of it has to be held in state custody but if you ask me its because billy byrd is a lot deeper in shad johnsons pocket than i am or ever will be this leaves me both angry and uncertain about what to do has drew been scheduled for arraignment eleven oclock i may let him attend that proceeding after all ill let you know well before then what im going to do id appreciate it things are getting mighty interesting down here don have you turned up anything on cyrus white nothing at all its like hes vanished off the face of the earth id say that makes him look more than a little guilty i agree but maybe hes just paranoid maybe he doesnt believe shad johnsons promises of fair treatment for blacks in the judicial system was that humor don dont forget to call me chief logan hangs up even before i lay my phone on the seat one certainty settles into my bones despite what i told shad and sheriff byrd about cyrus white last night drew is going to be charged with capital murder it seems unbelievable but worse has been done in this town in the name of politics another certainty quickly follows the first drew needs a real lawyer not a former prosecutorturnednovelist whos too close to the case he needs a topflight defense attorney with years of experience one with the credentials to neutralize the subliminal cards that shad johnson will bring to the table that means a local attorney who is black and preferably female several black attorneys practice in natchez but the only one i know well practices civil law i need a wise counselor to help me choose my candidate i slow down and make a uturn then head back south my fathers office is less than a mile away for forty years he has treated more black patients than any white doctor in town and he knows many of them like family if anyone can tell me about the black lawyers in town its my dad i call ahead and ask for esther ford his physicians assistant esther has very little formal training but after forty years of working at my fathers side she knows more about primary care medicine than many interns when she comes on the line i ask if dad can spare me fifteen minutes she laughs and simply hands the phone to him whats up penn dad asks in his resonant baritone i need to see you for a minute ive got an emergency a medical emergency no but almost as bad does it have to do with drew elliott howd you know when i made rounds this morning thats all anybody was talking about in the doctors lounge what were they saying that drews been screwing the townsend girl that she got pregnant and he snapped and killed her great i figure if any of thats true its the first part the rest i cant see drew elliott is the best young doc ive seen in my career and im not talking about technical skills he cares about people any man can be led astray by his willie but drew elliott committing murder no way i wish more people felt that way people turn on you fast its human nature my father once learned this lesson in a very painful and public way it took me almost twenty years to pay back the man who tried to ruin him dad i need some advice and i need it fast shoot i need the best black lawyer you know to defend drew you got it youre the hotshot lawyer why ask me you know why i want him local and id actually rather have a her does anybody in town fit the bill hang on im thinking take your time i hear esther talking in the background i only know of three black female lawyers in town ive heard good things about two of them but thats not who id hire if shad johnson was trying to nail me to the barn door why not im not sure you asked my opinion im giving it to you fair enough what about men we ought to ask esther id go to her if i was sick but not for this more silence dad calls out a medication and dosage to someone penn im at a loss here when i think of local lawyersblack or whiteand then i think of the situation drew is facing i just come up blank i know what you mean sorry i cant be more help its okay ill just wait a minute dad says in an excited voice hell i should have thought of that first thing what not what who you have someone in mind the smartest lawyer for a thousand miles around if you ask me no offense who are you talking about quentin avery images of a tall black man in a black suit arguing before the supreme court fill my mind in some of those old news photographs the negro lawyeras the captions referred to him thenstands beside thurgood marshall in others beside robert carter and charles huston i even remember quentin avery standing shoulder to shoulder with an angrylooking martin luther king jr quentin avery i echo i knew he owned a house out near the county line but i didnt think he spent much time there quentin travels a lot but hes been staying out there most of this past year hes sort of a recluse now ive been treating him for diabetes and hypertension how old is he mm two or three years older than i am seventyfour what kind of shape is he in mentally hes writing a law textbook and in conversation hes so quick i can barely keep up with him what about physically he lost a foot a couple of months agodiabetesbut he still gets around better than i do hes like a spry old hound dog what made you mention him i mean avery is a legend why would he take a case like this even as i ask this question a possible answer comes to me quentin avery might be a legend of the civil rights movement but time has not increased his stature the moral leadership he demonstrated in the sixties and seventies seemed to vanish in the s when he began handling personal injury cases and class action lawsuits against drug companies this giant who argued landmark cases before the highest court in the land was suddenly trying accident cases in jefferson county mississippi the predominantly black county famed for its recordbreaking punitive damages awards most of them based on the prejudices of the africanamericans who filled the jury box each week recently federal prosecutors began reviewing many of those awards and initiating action against both jury members and the attorneys involved oh i dont think hed take the case dad replies although you never know what will interest quentin but you can bet he knows the perfect lawyer to get drew out of this jam does avery know who i am sure he does quentin wasnt in town when you solved the del payton murder but he followed it from new haven he was teaching law at yale then he said he admired you for bringing leo marston to justice after all those years i think hes read a couple of your books as well maybe he was just being nice but thats not quentins style should i just call him out of the blue you could but he probably wouldnt answer why dont you let me call first ive got a good idea of your situation if quentins willing to help hell call you good enough but time is critical i got that son someone is beeping in on my phone its chief logan again ive got to run dad go bring annie by to see us soon i will i click the phone to take the incoming call chief penn somebody just told billy byrd that he saw dr elliotts car parked in a vacant lot in pinehaven on the afternoon of the murder that lots adjacent to st catherines creek and not a quarter mile from where we found kate townsends cell phone mother fucker drews recklessness is going to damn him in the end is that the worst of it afraid not this witness says he saw drews car at about three fortyfive pm kate townsends cell phone records show that she answered a text message from a girlfriend at three twentytwo pm we found her cell phone in the woods less than two hundred yards from where drews car was parked that means they were in very close proximity to one another within twentythree minutes thats provable penn what a jury would read into that you know better than i i cant believe thisis there anything else don my source says sheriff byrds planning to arrest your man for capital murder she even heard that with the das help byrd might try to take drew right out of my custody astonishment paralyzes me penn are you drews lawyer or not he doesnt seem too sure himself i guess i am for the moment what do you want me to do if byrd shows up and tries to take him out of here ive called the attorney general in jackson for an opinion but all i got was the same old runaround goddamn lawyerspick any dozen of them and you wont find a pair of balls in the bunch no offense none taken i mutter searching desperately for a solution what do you want me to do desperate times desperate measures penn charge drew with capital murder the silence on the other end of the line is absolute on my own authority you know what the evidence is youve got the girls cell phone charge him with murder right now dont wait do it the second you hang up i take back what i said before youve got a pair of balls on you all right will you do it don ill do it but youd better get your ass down here in a hurry chapter drew is a sobering sight today gone are the ralph lauren khakis and charles tyrwhitt buttondown he wore to work yesterday morning now he wears the orangestriped prison garb i usually see on inmates picking up trash around the city his handsome face is shadowed by thirty hours growth of beard but its his eyes that unsettle me most theyre no longer the eyes of an accomplished physician in command of his surroundings theyre the haunted eyes of a man who realizes that the world he once bestrode with confidence may soon contract to an eightbytenfoot cell tell me you have some good news he says i do but its not all good youd better put your gameface on he blinks slowly give me the bad first the police found kates cell phone in the woods not far from her house i lower my voice to a whisper also not far from where you told me you found her body he watches me without speaking for a while whats so bad about that had she tried to call me or something i dont know but she had some pictures stored in her phone explicit pictures another slow blink pictures of what you unclothed drew closes his eyes but says nothing i saw them one looks like your penis another looks like your ass what i remember from the high school dressing room anyway do any show my face yes in one youre sleeping naked goddamn it i told her to erase that stuff he grits his teeth and shakes his head but its hard to be angry at a dead girl is that all the bad news no someone saw you park your car in that vacant lot near the creek after all honestly thats the most damning piece of evidence they have because unlike the rest which only prove an affair that puts you close to what they may eventually prove was the crime scene drew lays his elbows on the narrow ledge on his side of the visiting window what about the good news were not done with the bad yet shit the semen that the serology tests say is yours wasnt swabbed from kates vagina it came from her rectum drew looks at me like a man offended by a personal question what are you asking me penn is your dna going to match that semen when the big test comes back he looks away then back at me kate liked to finish that way sometimes okay i dont know why but she got a lot of pleasure from that i did too obviously we probably did thatone out of every four times i dont speak for a while im trying to judge his honesty about a subject on which drew is the only living authority why he asks did somebody make a big deal of that kate was in high school drew everybodys going to make a big deal out of that its going to make you look a lot more guilty of rape to a lot of people thats crazy it was her idea ellen and i never had anal sex because you never asked or because ellen refused he stares at me with wide eyes then hangs his head i see what you mean the autopsy report says kate had both vaginal and anal trauma indicative of rape would you have traumatized her back there no way she relaxed totally during that act if she was traumatized back there whoever raped her did it i think about this for a while did kate ever ask you to choke her during sex his head pops up no why i lower my voice to a whisper did you know kate kept a journal drew glances at the door behind him then turns back to me and nods kates mother brought that to me with some of her other personal things she didnt want the police to find them thats good i told you jenny understood kate wrote in her journal about wanting you to choke her apparently steve sayers used to do that to her and at her request bewilderment she never told me that and she never asked me to do it im almost afraid to ask the next question did you two ever bring anyone else into your bed did she write that we did im tempted to lie and try to trap him but i dont she wrote about wanting to do it drew looks like he might be about to ask me what she wrote about that subject but then he says she did want to we might have done it in the future butno we never did kate had three miniature flash drives in the box with her journal the usb type lexar did you open them i couldnt theyre passwordprotected he looks intrigued but offers nothing do you know the passwords to those disks no theyre highcapacity drivesfive hundred twelve meg im thinking they have digital photos on them if it turned out that she had some pictures of other meneven one other manthat might really help you drew is no longer looking at me i dont know her password he says not even for her email account she was private about stuff like that okay lets try a little good newsalthough on a personal level you may see it as bad have you seen the morning paper no have you ever heard the name cyrus white drew looks blank no who is he a black drug dealer no reaction kate had some contact with this guy i go on regular contact she visited cyrus every month or so at the brightside manor apartments brightside manor shock now what the hell was she doing there nobody knows i got this from sonny cross the narcotics agent keep that to yourself by the way sonny says its unlikely that kate went there to buy drugs because girls like kate dont need to buy drugs guys will give them whatever they want did you ever see kate get high hell no drew says distractedly hes obviously preoccupied with this new information about his mistress kate hated drugs i think she tried grass when she was fifteen but she didnt like what it did to her head he scratches his shoulder as though to kill a bug under his clothes but why else would she go to a place like that i try to choose my words carefully but theres no way to sugarcoat this sonny suggested that she might have gone there solely to see cyrus drew pales youre out of your mind or cross is what does that redneck know about kate anyway hes never spoken to her in his life he apparently knows more than you do about at least one part of her life as hard as that may be for you to swallow we dont have time for hurt feelings drew we need to figure out what the hell kate was doing at brightside drew shakes his head again but whether from anger or puzzlement i cant tell this isnt some twentyyearold punk were talking about i explain cyrus is a thirtyfouryearold veteran of desert storm he runs the serious drug trade for the whole city he has ties to asian gangs on the gulf coast and he ruthlessly wiped out his competition here when he went into business drew turns up his palms i dont know what to say okay this is totally out of the blue for me is there anything else you can tell me according to sonny cyrus has a taste for white girls i see fury building in drews face and a new tension gathering in his heavily muscled shoulders stay calm buddy i say quietly in the journal kate kept a list of guys shed hooked up with guys and girls drew looks more interested than surprised tell me she listed people shed made out with people shed rejected and people who had rejected her under the heading of guys shed rejected was the name cyrus beside this namein parenthesesshe wrote shit close one in another part of the journal she wrote that cyrus had come on to her pretty strong during one visit he backed her into a corner and fondled her breast a steely calm emanates from drews eyes get me out of here penn i cant do it youre going to be charged with murder this morning and at my request his mouth drops open it was that or let sheriff byrd arrest you for some reason i dont yet understand billys acting as a monkeys paw for shad johnson so it was basically a choice of jails the other ones nicer but this ones saferfor our purposes anyway this is bullshit drew says you get me out of here now ill find out what this cyrus was doing with kate thats not going to happen with shad pushing this thing bail will be denied wheres cyrus now have the police talked to him have they taken a blood sample from him thats got to be who raped kate at the creek possibly i concede i hope it was son of a bitch drew explodes slapping the ledge do you realize where brightside manor is about forty yards from st catherines creek exactly and the creek was in flood he could have killed her there and dumped her body in the creek i thought of that last night only it seems unlikely that kates body would wash up within a couple of hundred yards from her house not really says drew shaking his head thats a dogleg bend with a lot of obstacles that trap floating objects kate wasnt far from a fallen tree now that i think about it his eyes bore into mine you didnt answer my question wheres cyrus now nobody knows drew stares at me like a madman youre shitting me no and until the police find him question him and take blood from him youre going to sit right where you are now so settle down and get ready to tough it out tell me youre not serious i am and dont even think about doing anything crazy drew i know inmates escape from the outdoor area of this jail with embarrassing regularity i also know that if you got out of here and tracked down cyrus white before the police hed be dead but that would be the worst thing you could do we need a confession from cyrus failing that we need a dna match to the other semen sample taken from kates body the coldness in drews eyes could freeze desert sand they can match dna to a corpse as easily as they can to a live body promise me you wont try it or ill tell chief logan to put you in lockdown around the clock hell do it if i ask him drews hands are shaking promise me i repeat or this is the last time youll see me in here after some time he nods i stand and reach for the door behind me one more thing he looks up with burning eyes you need a real lawyer now a topnotch criminal defense attorney preferably black and female drew says nothing thats nonnegotiable i tell him understood he waves his hand in a gesture of dismissal he could care less about lawyers at this point his mind and will are totally focused on one thing cyrus white im sitting in chief logans office when sonny cross calls my cell phone and delivers the next bombshell penn do you know jim pinella the oil man thats him hes got a son at the catholic school a junior michael mike they call him ive met mike i reply vaguely recalling a tall thin boy who acted in a play at the little theater well the kid was just beaten within an inch of his life a surreal feeling envelops me in a bubble blurring chief logan and everything else in the office who did it some black guys it happened outside the brightside manor apartments brightside manor what the hell was a white kid doing over there buying dope or was this another mystery visit like kate townsends mike wasnt buying dope sonny says curtly where are you now the police station im on liberty road can you meet me in the parking lot of first baptist church does this concern drew im not sure but it damn sure concerns st stephens ill be there in five minutes chapter the first baptist church is a massive monument to the southern baptist sensibility built on fortyeight acres of pristine meadow sold by the devout owner of the antebellum mansion next door the towering church complex manages to look both smug and sober at the same time today its quiet but usually the grounds echo with the screams of basketball from the churchs gymnasium or the crack of softballs from the emerald diamonds in back im parked by a bronze bell in the front parking lot waiting for sonny cross to arrive like so many parts of natchez the contrasts here are stark on this side of the highway stands devereaux a nationally famous gem of greek revival architecture surrounded by oaks shrouded in spanish moss on the other side sit an aging pizza hut restaurant a cocacola bottling plant and somewhere in the clapboard houses behind them the fossilized shell of the armstrong tire plant once one of the most powerful economic engines in the city sonny crosss ford explorer turns into the entrance of the churchs broad drive as i watch him approach i recall visiting the coke plant as a child its interior was a cavernous open space filled with rattling clanking machinery the most aweinspiring contraption in the place pulled empty green bottles along a conveyor belt jetted ten ounces of fizzing caramelcolored elixir into each bottle then sealed each one with a silver cap i could have watched that machine for hours the icy coke i was handed as i left that building was the besttasting drink i ever had in my life but that place exists only in my memory now today that cocacola building bottles nothing it merely serves as a hub from which trucks distribute cases of aluminum cans throughout what remains of the city i remember we dont make anything anymore hey sonny calls from the window of his explorer i only got a couple of minutes you hear theres an emergency school board meeting tonight the drug agent has light blue eyes a blond mustache and a mullet hairstyle that belongs onstage with lynyrd skynyrd cross seems to fancy himself a sort of miami vice cowboy favoring snakeskin boots and turquoise jewelry i heard about it i confirm you gonna be there unless you tell me i shouldnt no you should the deadheads whove been asleep at the switch all this time are finally calling me about marko bakic let me guess bill sims hes one of them what does mike pinella getting beat up at brightside manor have to do with st stephens maybe nothing says sonny his face hardening in anger or maybe a lot this past october mike started getting into pot hed never tried it before but since all his friends suddenly decided weed was the thing to do mike went along he got steadily deeper into it but the deeper he got the more unhappy he got hes a catholic kid and he had a lot of guilt still he went to that xrave two nights ago where marko shot off all the fireworks at the lake i murmur orienting myself right anyway mike grew up downtown on the same block with another kid you know a lot better whos that chris vogel the boy who drowned in lake st john last night when vogel drowned something snapped in mike i know this kid pretty well okay his younger brother is friends with my oldest son and i worked for his dad a couple of summers out of high school so after mike heard vogel drowned he called me up he told me he was really upset and he didnt want to see anybody else get hurt he said he knew where chris had got the acid that killed him he told me he was willing to testify against the guy who sold it or set him up for a bust whichever i wanted he just needed to get some things straight before he told me what he knew i pressed him but he wouldnt budge on that that was this morning penn sonny takes a deep breath now hes lying in the icu at the hospital his jaws broken his hands too he cant tell me what he knows and he couldnt write it down either as hard as he tried i sat there watching tears roll down that boys face while he struggled to do it the reality of this is difficult for me to accept what could the skinny kid i remember from that play have to do with drug dealers but of course thats all too easy to answer its my heart that wont accept it its something id rather not believe could happen in natchez who beat him up sonny cyruss people had to be cross is clenching his sideview mirror so hard that his knuckles are bone white he doesnt even seem aware that hes doing it didnt you tell me you thought it was marko who supplied the drugs for the lake party sonny nods do you still feel that way or do you think it was cyrus when you get right down to it is there any difference from the schools point of view theres a big difference from mike pinellas none i try to go by the letter of the law sonny says quietly but sometimesin this businessi just want to fuck somebody up you know i know when i was an assistant da in houston i saw things nobody should ever see and i dealt with cops who saw a lot worse than i did on a daily basis sometimes i wanted to pick up a gun and go out there myself but you cant do that sonny fixes me with a nobullshit stare the way i heard it you have done that and more than once only in defense of my family i say softly thats where i draw the line he looks away for a while seemingly at the church steeple then turns back to me how do you define family because im not mikes biological father i dont have a responsibility to protect him you cant protect mike now hes already been hurt and the others like him theyre part of this community penn part of this town we call ours those kids arent family they are but you cant do whatever it is youre thinking about doing thats a tribal reaction sonny ive felt it myself drews walking the same razors edge you are hed like to break out of jail and take cyrus white apart piece by piece but you cant give into that urge not yet anyway give the law a chance to work sonnys mouth wrinkles with contempt you talking about shad johnson yes and sheriff byrd and chief logan the drug agent hawks and spits on the asphalt thats what i think of sheriff byrd these past couple years and i work for the man i dont know what to tell you sonny youre part of the system make it work but please anything you find out about marko pass it on to me before tonights meeting six pm sonny pulls a tin of skoal from his shirt pocket dips his thumb and forefinger into the snuff then packs it between his lower lip and gum i got some things working he says putting the explorer in gear ill let you know something one way or another what do you have working i ask anxiously he winks and grins dont ask dont tell right later bud the explorers tires squeal as sonny skids around the silent bell and roars back toward the highway img stylewidth height hspace vspace src the early afternoon passed without surprises shad johnson cussed out the chief of police for arresting drew but he did nothing else about it the whereabouts of cyrus white remained unknown my father spoke to quentin avery but the famed civil rights lawyer did not promise anything beyond giving some thought to your sons situation i picked up annie from school at three and drove her to softball practice at liberty park i often stay and watch her practices when im not drafted into coaching myself shes hitting well today but her fielding is less than spectacular the coach ends practice early for some reason and annie walks over with a dejected expression on her face im about to console her when my cell phone rings the id says its my father hey dad whats up quentin avery just called me a fillip of excitement runs through me yeah he says hes bringing a lawyer by my office one whod be perfect for defending drew he wants you to meet him can you get away hell yes what time daddy youre cursing again annie reminds me i smile and tug on her ponytail what time now quentin already had an appointment to get his foot checked so i guess he figured hed kill two birds with one stone whos the lawyer he didnt say okay fine im on my way i just have to drop annie off was that papa annie asks when i hang up how did you know by the way you talk to him its different than when you talk to me annie has more intuition than i ever did youre just like your mother girl all the humor goes out of her face am i really you are just like her after we get in the car and start toward the highway annie says you and caitlin havent been talking much lately have you no shes pretty busy up in boston annie mulls this over it sure seems like it but i thought shed come down and visit us more often i did too punkin so did caitlin work is something adults dont have a lot of choice about sometimes although in this case thats not true can i ask you something personal daddy sure boo is mia too young for you the question leaves me speechless i mean i know she is annie goes on but she seems really mature for her age and i really like her a lot she doesnt seem at all like the other high school kids you know she reads the same kind of books you do and shes really pretty and annie my daughters eyes go wide as though shes hoping for good news but expecting bad i reach over and squeeze her hand mias got a lot to do before its time for her to settle down baby she has to go to college and figure out what shes going to do with her life just like you will in about ten years nine years annie corrects ill be eighteen in nine years i just thought shed be a cool mom thats all for somebody you know i think youre right i lean over and hug her to my chest so she cant see the tears welling in my eyes my daughter so desperately needs a maternal figure and i have failed to provide one right nowfor the first time reallyi feel true anger at caitlin for spending so much time away i dont think she was honest with me or with herself when she took her latest temporary assignment i need to run down to papas office for a while boo ill see if i can get mia to sit okay okay she says in a bored voice as though seeing mia holds no excitement whatever i take out my cell phone and speeddial mias number chapter my fathers private office is a library devoted to medicine and military history scale models of world war two tanks and planes stand beside ships from the napoleonic era and handpainted lead soldiers guard every bookshelf in the room hows drew holding up dad asks from behind his desk my father is six feet tall with white hair a silver beard and piercing eyes that have witnessed most of the ways the human body and soul can fail its hard to tell did that drug dealer named in the paper kill kate townsend i honestly dont know you dont look very confident whats your worst fear penn i havent really thought about it that way to anyone but you id have answered its that drew will be wrongfully convicted of murder but to me i close my eyes and when i speak the truth emerges as though by its own decision its that drew might have killed kate without meaning to the girl was highly sexual despite her youth and she liked to be choked during sex she died of strangulation it doesnt take sherlock holmes to see the possible link but drew denies anything like that yes a buzz sounds from dads phone and esther tells him shes on her way back with quentin avery wheres annie right now dad asks i had mia meet me outside and take her home i didnt know how long wed be he looks past me and rises from behind his desk his eyes twinkling theres quentin come in here man i turn and face the door often when i meet someone ive seen only in pictures or on film i find the actual human being to be much smaller in reality thats not the case with quentin avery the famed lawyer may be over seventy but he still carries the charismatic aura of a man who once strode boldly across the national stage despite the loss of his foot he still stands sixfeetfour and he wears his white hair in a tight afro hairstyle his eyes have a greenish tint and his skin is lighter than that of most natchez blacks but its darker than shad johnsons which is so light that some people have called him more white than black but averys appearance means nothing in the end this man standing in my fathers office has argued multiple cases before the united states supreme courtargued and won he has counseled presidents on civil rights issues most notably jfk and lyndon johnson he has struck fear into the hearts of white supremacists and corporations across the country he has taught death penalty law at the yale law school he has profoundly changed legal precedent and by so doing has done what few of us ever will he has changed the world my friends gonna be a little late quentin avery says by way of greeting my apologies gentlemen i imagined that he would speak precisely the way so many black leaders of his generation strived to do but quentin avery seems to have retained his southern accent his rich baritone rumbling in the lazy drawl of a manservant has probably caused many an opposing lawyernot to mention judgesto underestimate him over the years i offer him my hand penn cage professor avery smiles an easy smile then takes my hand in a grip of steel just plain quentin works for me mind if i sit down my foot may be gone but it still throbs something terrible on occasion take the couch quentin says my father coming around his desk penn you sit back here id love to hear this but ive got patients to see ill kick you out if i need to thank you tom avery says settling into the leather sofa opposite dads desk i sit behind the desk and wait for the legend to speak your father told me a little about your problem he says and based on what he said i have a good lawyer in mind local too though not female black lady lawyers are still in short supply in mississippi but my protégé is tied up downtown why dont you tell me a little more about your case i ought to be able to tell you whether he can help you or not as i summarize the events of the past few days quentin avery watches me with eyes that miss nothing i tell him about drew finding kates body the anal sex angle the blackmailer cyrus white even the nude photos in the cell phone now and then averys eyes narrow or his lower lip pushes out but he doesnt break my flow with a single question i suspect hes learning as much about the situation by the way i describe it as he is from the facts i conclude my briefing by telling about the witness coming forward and placing drews car in the vacant lot near the creek the only detail i omit is jenny townsend leaving kates private effects with me until i know that quentin averys protégé intends to handle drews defense i cant afford for anyone to know that shoe box exists so what do you think i ask avery sighs thoughtfully i can tell youre worried for your friend i nod assent youre right to look for another lawyer for him you have no business handling this case he seems to be waiting to see if this offends me it doesnt youre way too close to your client the man saved your life you played on the same athletic teams for years from what youve told me about him dr elliott is a largerthanlife kind of man a hero in some ways thats why its so hard for you to accept that he killed her i open my mouth to argue but avery holds up a hand that could easily palm a basketball im not saying he did it penn but somewhere down deep in your soul youre afraid that he did i remain silent but my opinion of quentin averys instincts just went up i dont care whether he killed that poor child or not avery goes on and its critical that his lawyer be just as detached thats the only way he can defend elliott to the best of his ability you know that of course its just tough to remember when youre that close to a defendant youre right what do you think about the facts facts avery snorts what facts the police havent even found the crime scene yet everything the da has is circumstantial and most of that doesnt point to murder now im not saying that the evidence he does have wouldnt predispose a jury against dr elliott a mississippi jury hears everything youve told me theyre surely going to believe he could have done it and if they find out dr elliott was down in that creek with his hands on her dead body theyre gonna vote guilty unless you can prove that big bad cyrus white raped and killed her thats a pretty tall order it seems to me quentin nods even if that other semen sample matches cyruss dna all youve done is prove that cyrus had sex with her he sniffs and gives me a little smile of course the jurys gonna make all the difference in this trial white folks are gonna come on preconditioned to believe that a depraved nigger dope dealer wouldnt hesitate to rape and kill a tasty young thing like kate townsend black jurors will feel exactly the opposite odds are youll get a racially mixed jury thats good for dr elliott because this is capital murder all it takes to acquit is one juror with reasonable doubt avery grins his teeth astonishingly white itd be a mighty poor lawyer who didnt think he could persuade one juror that a fine upstanding healer like dr elliott just might not have done it for the first time in days i feel a surge of real hope i feel stupid for sounding so pessimistic i think its because i know that the da the sheriff and the judge are so dead set on convicting drew avery nods sagely cause for concern and to tell you the truth thats why i was willing to get involved in this case i dont understand shad johnson he says with obvious distaste do you know him weve met a few times i know his people his peoplethis means family stretching back for an unknown number of generations how do you feel about him i think hes dangerous not only to dr elliott but to every black man woman and child in this town im dumbstruck what do you mean theres a crisis in black leadership in this country penn the leaders of my era are relics of another age a lost age im sorry to say martin malcolm xfannie lou hamer medgartheyre dead as the dinosaurs youve basically got three types of black leaders today theres the managerial type who pretends race isnt even an issue he wants a large white constituency but he also wants to keep the loyal blacks behind him hes pragmaticand not a bad leaderbut he tends to suppress the best type by claiming that going mainstream is the only solution for blacks then you have your black protest leader hes black loud and proud he casts himself in the image of malcolm and martin but deep down hes nothing like them he uses the ideals of those great leaders only to get what he really wants personal status and power marion barry al sharpton louis farrakhanthe list is endless theyre flashy flowery and dangerous they deceive the mass of black americans by tapping into their emotions but they use that support only in service of egotistical ends you wont see these men wearing the simple black suits and plain white shirts that martin and malcolm wore they want to be players and they love dressing the part true protest leaders are humble men penn they value wisdom not media consultants that sounds a bit like shad johnson but not completely shad is schizophrenic says quentin avery he began as the first type but failure has pushed him into becoming the second im about to ask what the third type of black leader is when quentin says shad actually despises his own people did you know that not all of them but the ones who most need help he blames them for their own misfortunes just like white racists do i nod ive heard shad speak disparagingly of local blacks he actually used the term bonedumb bluegums in front of me once quentin bends over to rub his phantom foot that doesnt surprise me at all theres a lot of selfhatred at the root of that language hes antisemitic too he maintains close ties with louis farrakhan its sad to see in a man of shads intellectual gifts are you all right i ask as avery seems to be in some distress im fine damn diabetes he straightens up the thing is penn to be a genuine black leader youve got to love that lazy weakminded brother fishing on the highway bridge with a cane pole in the middle of the workday if you dont you aint gonna help nobody i remain silent trying to decide if i agree with him its like jesus avery muses jesus loved the harlot and the sinner you want to save a whole people you got to start at the bottom not in the kings antechamber or in the mayors office as it were does avery know that shad has his eye on the mayors office again whats the third type of black leader a look of regret settles into the lawyers face the prophetic leader thats martin malcolmella baker or james baldwin in the intellectual sphere jesse jacksons the only recent political leader who had an opportunity to fill that role but he faltered after the current generation has produced no leaders of this type much less of that caliber im watching barak obama but im not sure yet the reasons have more to do with the pervasiveness of mass market culture and the failure of the black middle class than with any personal failure avery waves his hand but thats not why were here i only mention this because it underpins my feelings toward the district attorney he reaches into his shirt pocket and removes an expensivelooking cigar which he puts between his teeth but does not light the minute i heard mayor jones was terminally ill i knew shad would declare for mayor again five years ago he left goldstein henry in chicagothats a top firm with many influential black lawyersand he left there bragging how he was gonna come down south and win the mayors office then use that as a steppingstone to the governors office in jackson from the governors office shad figured he could reach the senate after that who knows but he failed his very first test wiley warren beat him even with all the black celebrities shad flew down here well young shadrach wasnt about to go back to chicago with his tail between his legs so he ran for da and won but thats not what he wants no sir he wants what he told his partners he was coming down here to get now this town desperately needs a good mayor but shadrach johnson isnt it last time out he promised a colorblind meritocracy and a rejuvenated city that didnt get him the mayors chair so this time hes putting out the word that hes stepping to an allblack band every city position will be filled by a black candidate qualified or not friends are good familys better hes gonna give whitey a taste of what its like to be on the bottom a lot of local blacks will vote for shad just because of skin color but that would be a mistake i understand your feelings about shad quentin but i dont think a courtroom defeat in this case will be enough to keep him out of the mayors office youre right about that no im relying on shad to do the critical damage himself what do you mean avery gives me a rogues smile lets say god forbid that dr elliott did kill that poor girl and lets assume that a mountain of evidence piles up that seems to prove that he did penn i believe that even in that circumstance shad wont be able to let well enough alone he wont trust in the evidence hell do something unethicalmaybe even illegalto stack things in his favor to make the verdict a lock and youll be right there to expose him then my personal end will have been accomplished a surge of optimism courses through me but just as quickly it dissipates quentin im very encouraged by this meeting but im also worried you understand the overall situation much better than i do but the guy you brought me here to meet knows nothing yet and time is a factor in this case shads in a big hurry the guy i brought you to meet knows more than you think hows that avery takes the cigar out of his mouth and smiles hes sitting right in front of you it takes me several moments to absorb the full implications of this are you telling me you plan to defend drew at trial personally i do because of shad johnson thats right but my motive shouldnt bother dr elliott too much hes gonna get a better defense than he ever dreamed i sit silently trying to take this in i know youre right about that but what drew doesnt seem to grasp the jeopardy hes in or doesnt care much if he does i think kates death put him into some kind of shock and he hasnt come out of it yet avery chuckles softly dont worry when he sees those twelve supposed peers sitting in the jury box staring at him like hes charles manson itll sink in in a big damned hurry too the realization that a legend like quentin avery has taken up the cross i thought i was going to have to bear alone brings relief unlike any ive experienced in years i tell you quentin i feel like a new man dont celebrate yet ive got a feeling we got more bad news coming what kind evidence evidence that wont help the doctor any i nod slowly i hope youre wrong sometimes i am but it happens less and less the older i get from anyone elses lips this would sound arrogant but from quentin avery it doesnt its one of the paradoxes of old age he adds your prick gets weaker but your reasoning gets stronger he laughs richly the two must be related maybe intelligence is more a matter of focus than anything else you could be right i drop my palms flat on the desk with a slap what do you want me to do he ticks off a list on his long fingers reserve some rooms at the eola hotel a suite for me plus four or five regular rooms for offices and overflow ill need a retainer of sixty thousand dollars and another fifty thousand deposited in an account for expenses thats just to start consider it done i say praying that ellen elliott doesnt have control of drews liquid assets thats what i like quentin says a man who knows what talent is worth its easy when its somebody elses money youve got a point there what about me personally how do you see my role the old lawyer purses his lips like a man trying to figure out the function of an unfamiliar machine lets call you my chief investigator youve shown a flair for it which is only what id expect from a former prosecutor come to think of it youre the enemy by constitution but id rather have you inside the tent pissing out without preamble quentin avery lifts his cane and struggles to his feetor to his foot i guess let me walk you to your car i offer no thanks ive got somebody to do that nevertheless i accompany him to the waiting room avery walks with great purpose despite his limp when we open the door a beautiful black woman of about forty stands and starts forward is this your daughter i ask as she holds the front door open for us they both laugh doris is my wife says quentin limping outside penn cage doris avery he winks at me now you see why i spend so much time at home yes i do i say awkwardly wondering if quentin has more sympathy for drew than i thought at probably thirtyfive years older than his wife he must view a separation of twentythree years as relatively minor as though reading my mind quentin says kate townsend was seventeen we cant let ourselves forget that no i agree sexual battery is a statutory offense he says gravely and dr elliott could well get thirty years for it no matter what happens with the murder case i understand butquentin winks at meif any lawyer can talk a jury into a little human understanding on the issue of younger women im your man i cant help but laugh ill bet you are we proceed slowly to the parking lot doris supporting quentins right side by bracing his right arm she looks strong with taut calves showing beneath her skirt now that weve got things settled quentin says i have one question for you penn shoot whats the real reason youre not handling this case your friends life is at stake and youve got the chops to defend him isuppose you might have the good sense and detachment to realize you shouldnt handle it but i dont think thats it he looks hard into my eyes about the only reason i can see you giving it up is that you know hes guilty i shake my head thats not it the truth is im thinking of running for mayor myself in the special election and if i go to war with shad to defend drewand loseill lose the election too somaybe the future of the town is more important to me than drews fate as terrible as that sounds quentin avery appraises me for several moments then theres a wrinkling around his eyes a glint in his pupils and finally his lips break open to reveal his shining white teeth boy youre gonna put a big old kink in shads world arent you hes gonna want to kill you before the month is out doris stops us at a shining new mercedes and opens the passenger door what do you think about me running for mayor i ask quentin shrugs dont know you that well yet fair enough what do you think about another white mayor instead of a black one the renowned lawyer chuckles and looks down into the valley of kudzu behind my fathers office what id like to see is a good mayor this towns in a world of hurt and its got no time for racial ideology its got no time for anything but getting down to the business of business maybe youre the man for the job and maybe you aint all i know is youre the man who put del paytons killer behind bars and thats more than i could do back in he grins so im willing to give you a look anyway quentin climbs into the passenger seat settles himself then peers up at me i sense youve got a question for me too maybe more than one hes right i want to ask him why he seemed to abandon the civil rights movement in the s and s to pursue personal injury and class action cases which greatly enriched him but did little for the people he professes to love but i dont dare offend him drew cant afford to lose a lawyer of this caliber not with the system already aligned against him im just trying to get my mind around all this i reply not untruthfully no youve got questions insists avery but well be seeing a lot of each other in the coming days after you get your confidence up you can grill me to your hearts content he faces forward and laughs tell your daddy ill see him later in the week doris avery closes the door then takes me by the upper arm pulls me to the rear of the mercedes and speaks in a low but intense voice i want to make you aware of something mr cage please call me penn all right penn quentins in a lot worse shape than he pretends to be diabetes is a terrible disease and its taken more away from him than a foot a lot more than hell admit doris averys eyes are wet with private pain but she doesnt cry im not going to tell him not to take this case but im tellingyou dont push him too hard ive already got a lot fewer years to spend with him than id like and he gave far too much of himself over the years to people who didnt appreciate it to kill himself doing the same thing now i hear you mrs avery she nods once then turns and walks to the drivers door then she smiles just a little you can call me doris from now on good day to you chapter driving up the curving entrance to st stephens prep i realize ive given sonny cross all the time i can afford i voicedial his cell phone as i park in front of the high school he answers after five rings yeah its penn sonny its six pm im about to go into the board meeting you have anything for me a squawk like a muffled yell comes through my phone a cutoff grunt follows soon hisses cross sonny what the fuck was that dont know must be your cell phone ill call you back as soon as i can somethings going down but i dont have time to press him on it youve got nothing on marko bakic right as of now dont forget to call me the st stephens boardroom looks just as it did on the night i learned kate townsend was dead the ten faces gathered around the rosewood table are more than somber its as though some catastrophic threat faces the entire town and we are meeting to consider extreme responses holden smith opened the meeting before i arrived making it clear that my status in this group is now equivocal only the headmistress jan chancellor looks happy to see me arrive sit down penn says holden afraid we had to start without you i sit but dont respond jan chancellor says the board has just scheduled a memorial service for kate and chris tomorrow where the school gymnasium says holden chris was methodist but kate was presbyterian and we wanted to do it during school hours better not to try to transport all the kids out to a church we can do it right here did you talk to jenny townsend about this im going to inform her as soon as the meetings over typical as if the boards decision should rule everyone elses life okay so why am i here holdens voice takes on an almost feminine tone of irritation the next order of business is the expulsion of marko bakic expulsion and deportation grunts bill sims its time for that little bastard to go back where he came from on what grounds are you expelling him i ask they dont really have anything specific jan informs me just a catalog of smaller infractions detentiontype infractions which i seem to remember he served detention for i think aloud noting jans use of they exactly she says turning to holden and bill if you want to expel bakic youre going to have to do it arbitrarily fine says sims hes a damn croatian what can he do about it he can sue you and this school i say in an even voice our insurance would cover it but the publicity would eat us alive youd wake up every day and read the words illegal drugs and st stephens prep in the same article hes not even an american blurts smith that makes no difference the foreign prisoners being held at guantánamo are suing the federal government for unlawful imprisonment among other things american lawyers are lining up down there to represent them bullcrap sims bellows thats just bull crap thats whats wrong with this country no thats one of the things thats right with it sims glares at me then looks at holden smith as if to say what the hells he doing here anyway ill tell you something else i go on you pulled the trigger too fast on drew the more i find out about kates death the more certain i am she was raped and murdered by someone else who asks someone down the table that drug dealer mentioned in the paper i cant discuss that here were in executive session says holden no ones keeping minutes nothing will leave this room thats the funniest thing ive heard all year i dont remember one sensitive topic discussed in this room that i didnt hear about two days later from someone who shouldnt have known a damned thing about it everyone in here talks out of school to belabor the expression and im not blowing drews defense to hell to satisfy the curiosity of this group i just want those of you who condemned drew for murder the minute you heard about him and kate to know you were wrong but he is guilty of the affair insists holden correct if he is you know what that makes him what as human as the rest of us holden looks genuinely hurt penn youre taking this personally we all like drew we all respect him apart from this of course but the damage thats already been done to this school because of his involvement with kate is incalculable and what about the damage to kate herself honestly im not sure how all that shakes out yet what if kate was already in deep trouble what if drew was a stabilizing influence in her life youre saying that having sex with a fortyyearold man stabilized kates life no but being loved by him might have holden the total tonnage of what we dont know about these kids lives would sink an ocean liner the board president blows out a stream of air like someone resigning himself to ambiguity penn you obviously know a lot more about this situation than we do what do you recommend regarding marko watch him closely thats it if someone steps forward and says they saw him bring drugs to that lake party thats a different matter a police matter the lake party happened off school grounds of course but since its a criminal offense i think we could justify immediate expulsion under our zerotolerance policy but so far nobodys come forward and now that the pinella kid has been beaten up i doubt anyone will was marko responsible for that asks a woman at the far end of the table i dont know jean look even if marko is selling drugs to our kids hes not the one bringing them into the city illegal drugs are an industry and in this case they start down on the gulf coast and flow northward certain people here wholesale it to other peoplepossibly markowho then retail it to users like a small number of our students markos only part of a very long chain we dont yet know who might have thought they had reason to beat up the pinella boy but marko is the link that most affects this school holden says until he showed up we didnt have a problem not a visible problem every high school in america has a drug problem holden should we test some of our students for ecstasy and lsd asks sims reviving an idea we killed months ago now im losing my patience bill if youre worried about the schools image that idea is about as stupid as it was when you brought it up a couple of months ago sims reddens but doesnt respond what we need to do is calm down and let the police and the judicial system work if you want marko on a plane back to croatia you may get your wish sooner than you think what do you know holden asks eagerly i know that the best thing we can do is let things take their course now do you need me for anything else jan glances at holden penn wed like you to remain on the board this body was premature in asking you to step down i agree jan but i cant do that are you officially drews lawyer asks holden i havent decided yet but it makes no difference this body has given up any moral right to leadership that it had before this crisis started most of you are here because you have your own private agendas which may or may not be in the best interest of the school as a whole one of our most distinguished and generous alumni is in troublehe may soon be fighting for his life in factand you abandoned him without even hearing his side of things so i bid you good night i stand and walk to the door penn wait holden calls let him go snaps sims goddamn bleeding heart lecturing us like that as soon as i clear the door i find myself jogging toward my car my frustration is about to boil over i climb in and start the car but leave the engine in park im not even sure where i should go now when my cell phone rings i assume its jan chancellor trying to get me to return to the board meeting but my caller id sayssonny cross sonny yeah sorry i couldnt talk before ive got what you need now man youre not gonna believe it what marko cyrus katei understand everything now and boy have i got something to help drew tell me not on your life not on a cell phone where are you my house beau pré road you know where that is yeah whats the house number two seventyone ill be there in ten minutes i pull into the southbound lane of highway and press the accelerator to the floor chapter a few miles south of natchez kingston road forks away from highway and curves through rolling land that a century and a half ago made up thriving cotton plantations populated with hundreds of slaves beau pré road is a serpentine offshoot of kingston road lined with onestory houses and aluminum trailers some with bass boats sitting in their front yards the houses are set far apart with small ponds outbuildings and dog runs in the overgrown border land between lots its full dark as i round a long curve that should carry me to sonny crosss house from what the drug agent said in our brief cell phone conversation it sounded like hes discovered the holy grail of this case my greatest hope is that he can prove that cyrus white murdered kate scanning the homes flashing past on my left i see two gold numbers tacked to the wall of a house trailer two sixtynine i ease my foot off the gas and coast around the tail of the curve a lone porch light appears in the trees to my left then the beam of my headlights hits a rutted dirt driveway that intersects beau pré road on my left as i turn onto the dirt a yellow rectangle of light appears beneath the porch light the black silhouette of a man walks into the rectangle then passes through it and the orange eye of a cigarette bobs along the driveway at a height of about six feet when i reach the cigarette i stop my car turn off my engine and get out sonny cross takes a deep drag off his cigarette the orange glow illuminates his haggard face and glints off a silver stud in his left ear despite the fatigue in his face i see excitement in his eyes how much do you want to know he asks everything dont be so sure this is dirty harrystuff tell me everything sonny another long drag smoke drifts into the night as he speaks i was pretty upset this afternoon you saw it when we talked i couldnt just sit around waiting for something to break what did you do i ask my gut tightening in anticipation i decided to have a little talk with marko bakic i picked him up outside the wilsons house easy as pie then i took him to uhan undisclosed location where we had a frank and honest exchange of views a willing exchange of views sonny chuckles softly there might have been a little duress jesus what did you do to the kid i just asked him some questions but young master bakic indicated an unwillingness to cooperate he emphasized this with some wellchosen sarcastic remarks he seemed quite pleased with himself all in all so i stuck my gun in his mouth i shake my head in disbelief to tell you the truth sonny reflects even that didnt rattle him much i think that boy saw a lot of shit over in bosnia and guns by themselves dont scare him i dont think he believed id really use it you didnt did you cross shakes his head slowly no but i convinced him i would how did you do that exactly an unguarded smile some things we must pass over in silence my son was that what i heard when i called you before the board meeting you torturing marko no that was somebody else who one of cyruss guys id like to sit sonny down and have a talk with him about the niceties of the constitution but right now i have a different priority enough foreplay sonny give me what you got markos basically cyruss punk okay he registered in the student exchange program hoping to get new york l a or miami instead he got natchez mississippi imagine his dismay marko saw himself as the next scarface a young al pacino coming to america to take over the drug trade but when he got here he didnt find robert loggia an old dealer soft and ready to fall he found cyrus white a kind of nightmare hed never seen before cyrus recognized something in marko though maybe because they had both seen war up close he saw markos ambition and he used that to open up new markets white markets through the older brothers and sisters of our high school kids marko made contacts in the white fraternities at lsu ole miss usm millsaps louisiana techyou name it this network is far more extensive than i imagined the asians on the gulf coast wholesale to cyrus massive shipments moving north by several different routes when it gets here cyrus sends out his boys to supply baton rouge jackson oxford ruston hattiesburgall the markets marko opened up its a massive operation penn mindblowing really the drone of an engine echoes through the trees then a pair of headlights sweeps past us in a long arc why are we out here i ask my kids are inside sonny explains my exwife hears any more about this cowboy shit shell be asking the judge to modify our custody agreement mosquitoes getting you im good go on you said you had something that would help drew sonny grins i know why kate townsend was seeing cyrus she was buying lorcet from him you know what that is pain pills right like codeine thats right she tried to buy it from marko first but he doesnt keep lorcet in stock its more of an adult drug the kids dont use it much anyway marko goes to cyrus and asks for some but cyrus wont hand it over just like that hes curious by nature he wants to know why marko suddenly wants hydrocodone the word hydrocodone triggers something in my mind but im too interested in what sonny discovered to ponder it marko tells cyrus hes going to use the lorcet to buy the finest piece of ass in the city cyrus asks who hes talking about dumbass marko tells him and that was that cyrus knew damn well who kate townsend was her pictures been in the newspaper about twenty times over the past couple of years tennis swimming her scholarship to yale harvard wherever cyrus told marko that if kate wanted lorcet shed have to come to him to get it personally thats how all this started i dont get it i say softly suddenly afraid that i do drew told me kate never used drugs then she was buying them for somebody else another set of headlights appears in the distance moving slowly this way tell me about kate and cyrus sonny watches the lights come and go once a month or so kate would tell marko she needed a new bottle she was buying at the rate of a hundred a month a hundred pills i mean she bought a hundred and fifty per visit the last couple of months would the medical examiner have tested for hydrocodone in kates body they always do toxicology in a young girl like that because suicide is so common i already checked no hydrocodone or metabolites in kate no drugs at all what about the sex angle did marko say kate and cyrus hooked up sonny nods emphatically while drawing on his cigarette no but this is even better once cyrus got a look at kate he couldnt stop thinking about her marko said every time cyrus saw him he asked about her who she was talking to who she was fucking who had she fucked in the past what music did she listen to everything every last detail the guy was obsessed but marko didnt think they ever had sex no she just drove cyrus nuts the way women like to do sonny gives me a conspiratorial smile marko thinks cyrus killed her man a rush of excitement goes through me but i try to stay calm can he prove it no but heres the gold man heres something you can throw right in shad johnsons face i feel blood pounding in my ears what you know what that crazy cyrus was doing how could i know damn it sonny laughs at my impatience he was tracking her cell phone he wanted to know where she was all the time right well there are companies you can pay to digitally ping somebodys cell phone every fifteen minutes as long as the target persons cell phone is on this company can give you their gps coordinates every quarter hour and theyll never know it sonny cackles with glee it doesnt evencost that much these companies are all over the internet penn paranoid spouses keep them in business i dont even bother telling sonny that i knew about this technology if i can prove that cyrus was tracking kates cell phone especially on the day she died its looking like something just might stick to the teflon nigger this time and get this marko says whenever kate left the apartment cyrus would be crazy mad he told marko he didnt think it was him being black that bothered her it was that he sold drugs which was crazy to him since she was there to buy drugs drugs she wasnt taking i murmur my mind on drews words in his car on the night he told me he was involved with kate ellens addicted to hydrocodone you cant imagine ellen popping lorcet plus like m ampms goddamn it i whisper what is it nothing dont bullshit me penn if its something i need to know tell me its not i assure him wondering if drew could really have sunk that low give me the rest of it sonny youve got most of it except that markos scared shitless why because cyrus doesnt need him anymore now that cyrus has the contacts at the colleges markos just one more middleman he doesnt want to pay thats good i reason thinking like a prosecutor maybe marko will testify against cyrus to save his ass sonny grins hes considering that as we speak as we stand in the silent darkness i realize its not silent at all the highpitched drone of crickets is almost a scream and a spring breeze rattles the millions of oak leaves surrounding us across the road a car engine starts and a pair of headlights clicks on slut sonny mutters who kate no my neighbors got a teenage daughter over there about fifteen theres a different boy over there every week ive even seen a couple of black boys pick her up one jig from the catholic school showed up at my front door saying he was looking for a girl named karenthats this girl i said the only black girl on this road lives about three miles down that way sonny laughs he didnt know what the hell to say the screech of a screendoor spring silences the crickets and the yellow rectangle appears again on sonnys porch then a little boys voice calls into the night are you coming back in daddy sonny turns back to the house and yells just a couple of minutes kevin across the street the car pulls slowly into the road its a lexus sedan an older model but still expensive for beau pré road as i watch the window on our side slides down and the car slows as though its driver wants to ask for directions hes probably reluctant to pull into sonnys driveway without an invitation so i start toward the road as i walk i see a glint of metal in the open window in one paralyzed moment adrenaline floods my body ive been shot at before and despite the darkness i know what im looking at get down sonny i scream diving to the ground night vanishes in a starburst of white light and thunder the explosions coming too quickly to count automatic weaponas the seconds dilate i whip my head toward sonny who for some reason is still on his feet standing in full view of the gunman hes returning fire at the lexus orange flame leaps from his pistol but the reports are lost in the roar of the machine gun i look back at the lexus and for one instant a screaming asian face is revealed by a perfect circle of light two holes appear magically in the door below the face then another fusillade of bullets erupts from the rear window an explosive grunt sounds behind me sonnys hit as the spinning tires scream i roll back toward sonny cross hes lying on his back his eyes wide his mouth gasping for air his right arm jabs his gun toward me take it i do but by the time i come to my knees with the pistol raised the lexus is fishtailing up the road i empty sonnys clip at the fleeing car then drop the gun and fall to my knees beside him the blood on his white knit shirt tells me hes been hit at least three times in the torso his chest rises and falls erratically and the wheezes coming from his throat and chest tell me death isnt far away my kids he says in a guttural voice check onmy boys you first sonny i pull my cell phone from my pocket but as i dial the front door of the house bangs open again daddy daddy where are you panic in the voice daddys still out here i shout hes fine hes coming in just a minute go back inside boys dispatcher says a womans voice in my ear this is penn cage ive got an officer down at two seventyone beau pré road multiple gunshot wounds i need an ambulance stat now connect me to the sheriffs department up on sonnys porch two small silhouettes stand wavering in the yellow rectangle sheriffs department says another woman deputy sonny cross has been shot at his home multiple gunshots repeat deputy sonny cross get some paramedics out here hes critical the shooters fleeing the scene on beau pré road headed toward highway its a black lexus with at least three people inside an oldermodel lexus you need to set up roadblocks immediately the shooter is asian repeat asian ethnicity call sheriff byrd at home tell him penn cage reported it hold on mr cage says the dispatcher i cant two seventyone beau pré road one of sonnys children has left the porch and ventured about half the distance to his father daddy he calls tentatively even in his distress sonny manages to shake his head dont let them see me like this dont a gout of blood erupts from his throat i jump up and run to the boy snatching him into my arms and trotting back to the porch where his brother waits when i set him down i try to reassure them both but the faces in the glow of the porch light already know the worst i drop to my knees and grasp a thin wrist tightly in each hand are either of you hurt no sir says the oldest who looks like he might be eleven should i get my gun wheres my dad asks the other whos eight at the most tears are running down his face your daddys hurt boys but hes going to be all right the ambulance is on the way i want you to go inside and call your mom tell her she needs to come right over here do you understand yes sir says the older who i now remember is called sonny junior the younger boy doesnt want to go but junior grabs his wrists and pulls him inside i race back to the end of the driveway for the first time i notice a light lying on the ground beside sonny its not a flashlight its a spotlight mounted beneath the barrel of his pistol he must have flicked it on before he opened fire on the lexus that was the circle of light that showed me the gunmans face it may also have been what guided the shooters bullets to sonnys chest pennsonny chokes his hand grabbing at the air are you there im here buddy i use the gun light to illuminate my face you hang on his desperate eyes lock onto mine my boys theyre not hurt theyre both fine and they know youre fine somehow sonny laughs a wry sound that turns into a terrible coughing fit notfine he rasps not gonna make it this time around bullshit i take his hand and squeeze tight asian he whispers shooter was asian i saw him im cold man just like the damn movies just like the ambulance is on the way sonny hang tight too far knowresponse time tell em save the gas with a sudden surge of strength sonny cross raises his other hand rolls into me and grips my biceps like a claw his eyes are straining out of their sockets like the eyes of a dying martyr exhorting his torturers to have faith its yours now penn cyrusmarkoyou gotta finish it do what you have to dohear me i cant do what you did today he falls back on the ground his eyes half shut now but his grip still strong chris vogel he croaks mike pinellakate how many others family manall family i hear you sonny his next words ride a deep exhalation of the kind ive heard too often before tell janie im sorry man tell heri never meant this time the silence is absolute not even the crickets disturb the transit of sonny crosss troubled soul as it departs for wherever it is bound a highpitched sob sounds behind me i turn and see the two boys standing six feet away they look at me then run to their father and collapse with their heads on his chest then the crickets resume and the high note of a siren wails sonny crosss benediction chapter by the time i reach the city jail ive told the story of sonny crosss death three times first to sheriffs deputies then to sheriffs detectives and finally to sheriff byrd himself part of me wanted to hold back what sonny told me about kate visiting cyrus but i couldnt in good conscience do that all i could do was withhold my near certainty that kate was buying those bottles of lorcet for ellen elliott i also gave up the information sonny tortured out of marko and that seemed to go a long way toward convincing sheriff byrd that kates death might be more complex than a matter of a jealous older man the fact that cyrus had been tracking kates gps location through her cell phone was particularly convincing once byrd and i were alone i told him exactly how sonny had extracted this information and that this made it unusable in court nevertheless i had a feeling that marko bakic was in for a long night sheriff byrd ordered roadblocks set up on all routes leaving the city but his dragnet didnt catch the black lexus either the killers slipped out of town before the roadblocks were set up or they were still hiding somewhere in the city waiting for things to cool down an army of deputies raided cyruss known safe houses and rousted all their drug snitches but nothing has produced results like the asian killers he probably summoned here cyrus white has vanished piled on the shock of watching sonny die the ordeal of being grilled for two hours exhausted me and i was tempted to go home to bed but i had to know one thing before i could sleep was i right about kates errands to cyrus tonight the bench on the other side of the glass in the visiting cubicle is empty drew finally walks in and sits down no guard visible behind him his eyes have the empty look of a man in a fugue state sonny cross is dead i tell him drew tilts his head to the left as if to say what does that have to do with me he told me some things before he died like why kate was visiting cyrus white now hes interested kate was buying lorcet from him drew a hundred pills at a time drews eyes close lorcet is hydrocodone right the drug ellen is addicted to he nods slowly then hangs his head dont make me drag it out of you drew i need to know he opens his eyes and lays his forearms on the little window ledge i didnt know she was getting it from cyrus i had no idea im stunned by the amount of anger that erupts from within me what did you know man why was kate buying the drugs at all drews right cheek twitches as though in response to an electric shock i told you how bad ellens addiction was four times through rehab and still she couldnt kick it id prescribed the absolute limit to keep her out of withdrawal the dea was watching me all the time a lot of doctors are hooked on lorcet so they monitor those prescriptions closely anyway ellen finally stole one of my pads and forged some prescriptions she got away with it a couple of times but then she got caught if win simmons at riteaid hadnt called me instead of the police shed have been in deep trouble how did kate come into it we were deeply involved by that time she saw how upset i was the night of the prescription incident so i told her what had happened i was in pretty bad shape myself i couldnt concentrate at work i was afraid to leave the house for fear of what ellen might do she refused to go back into rehab she was drinking heavily to mask the withdrawal and that made her violent then in the middle of this nightmare kate showed up one night with a bottle of lorcet plus one hundred tenmilligram pills in a pharmacists bottle drew shakes his head as though in awe it was like salvation i asked where she got them and she just said from a friend dont worry about it of course iwas worried but kate wouldnt tell me any more she said it was no big deal to get lorcet half the town was popping them she needed five hundred dollars to cover the cost but she said she could get whatever i needed whenever i needed it no risk at all i know how terrible this sounds butit made life bearable at last i had the dea off my back and kate was happy that i could relax and pay attention to her yeah it was perfect i say bitterly except that kate was risking her freedom every time she made a pickup for you jesus drew do you realize how sleazy this is he bows his head again i can understand you falling in love with kate okay she was a beautiful girl full of promise a lot like you when you were eighteen and i understand the temptation to consummate those feelings it takes serious effort for me not to just sit and stare at mia sometimes but this is different you risked that girls future to make life a little easier on yourself thats low man that sucks i know it is that all you have to say he turns up his palms what can i say do you think words really matter at this point hes right about that you realize that cyrus may have killed kate he nods almost imperceptibly and that cyrus would never have gotten within a mile of her if ive already gone farther down that road than you ever will drew says softly the irony is that if cyrus did kill her that will free me from jail but it cant free me from my own judgmentor yoursor worst of all my sons and whether you believe it or not those judgments will be harder for me to bear than a life sentence in parchman prison if i caused kates death i will live in hell until the day i die i study him without speaking ive heard many people say this kind of thing over the years and they do sufferusually for a month or two then they thank the stars for their freedom and happily go back to their old ways i dont think drew is like those people he is quite capable of torturing himself for years but that doesnt make what he did any less reprehensible if cyrus killed her that may free you on the murder charge i tell him but you still may do thirty years for sexual battery and if a jury ever finds out about this little drug arrangement you can count on it his eyes lock onto mine did you tell anyone about it i wait before answering watching him for signs of selfconcern not yet he doesnt react he doesnt even thank me he seems resigned to whatever fate awaits him theres a soft knock at the door behind me and then someone pulls it open looking back i see chief logan gazing down at me his dark eyes sober i need to see you a minute penn drew glances up at him hey don logan doesnt even look in drews direction the days of special treatment for the police chiefs doctor are over i get up and follow logan to his office he sits behind his desk puts his face in his hands and rubs his temples with his thumbs whats happened i ask have you found cyrus no he looks up but somebody did what do you mean cyrus has been hiding in a safe house downtown north union street fifty minutes ago a car pulled up to it and a guy wearing black from head to toe got out holding two pistols one was silenced he shot the two guards on the porch but nobody heard him one of those guys is still alive but they already shipped him to university hospital in jackson with a severe head wound hes unlikely to make it my stomach has gone hollow as chief logan speaks i flash back to my years as an assistant district attorney in houston this kind of thing happened all the time there but here in my hometown a placid little city that wouldnt even be called a city anywhere but mississippi this kind of crime is as alien as a terrorist attack after the gunman took out cyruss guards logan goes on he walked calmly through the house shooting people as he went cyrus was in a back bedroom with a girl with that silencer i doubt he heard anything but grunts and muffled cries maybe a scream when cyrus walked out the shooter nailed him five times with the second pistol then the shooter dropped both guns and walked out like he didnt have a care in the world he even left the car out front was it a lexus my first thought says logan but no it was a camry with adams county plates it was stolen a few minutes before the crime this was obviously a professional hit logan nods just like sonny cross anybody say the shooter was asian he wore his mask the whole time and he never said a word the guy who shot sonny wasnt wearing a mask i know logan takes a pen from a mug that reads talladega and starts tapping it on his desktop the total body count from this little encounter is five wounded and three dead probably four by morning i shake my head not quite able to accept that my strongest alternative suspect in kate townsends murder is dead did you learn anything about kates murder from the survivors my detectives are still over at the hospital questioning them but so far all weve got is computer matches on the shooters handguns that fast logan nods his face unreadable the silenced one was stolen from a residence in biloxi a few months ago biloxigambling capital of the gulf coast also the base of the asian drug gangswell that sure tells us something the chief is watching me closely the other handgun was bought and registered right here in natchez two years ago a chill of anxiety runs along my skin who bought it drew elliott and its never been reported lost or stolen i feel as though my body mass has doubled breathing is difficult and the idea of moving seems impossible drews been in jail all night right logan sighs as best i can determine yes but i wasnt here myself and theres no closedcircuit camera in his cell again i remember the escapes ive read about in the examiner for some reason inmates at the city jail are allowed to exercise in a fenced area behind the station and more than a few have disappeared from this flimsy enclosure he couldnt have gotten out for like forty minutes and then come back could he i dont think so penn but i cant be certain christ chief logan looks up at me his eyes filled with regret thats not really my main concern to be honest im more worried that drew used his cell phone to hire this done i struggle not to let logan see how much this possibility worries me who could drew call that could have found cyrus both you and sheriff byrd have guys working around the clock and they couldnt find him how could drew granted says logan but he still looks unconvinced the theory that drew slipped out and did the shooting himself has the same flaw i point out how would he know where to find cyrus you told me kate townsend visited cyrus regularly but only at brightside manor logan raises his eyebrows are you sure im not suredon lets be realistic this had to be the asian crew that popped sonny cross i hope so because i gave drew access to his cell phone when i shouldnt have and i sure regret that now this was some kind of drug hit it had to be like i said i hope so but youve got one more problem what we recovered another pistol at the scene youll be interested in that one too why its a springfield xd and its registered to you it takes all my composure to keep my mouth from falling open i can explain that don logan nods but he looks far less confident in me than he has for the past couple of days i hope so penn because this looks bad really bad i lost it the other night chasing a guy who tried to blackmail drew two guys actually logan shakes his head clearly furious that ive been holding back information why didnt you report it lost because i lost the gun on hunting camp land dr felders camp right behind st stephens i knew if anybody found it it would be a hunter from that club i called dr felder the next day and told him to warn his members to be on the lookout for it i also told coach anders at st stephens to watch for it just in case i lost it on the field i searched the field and the track myself but found nothing one of the blackmailers must have picked it up thats the only explanation okay ill call dr felder tomorrow and try to verify that two days ago chief logan wouldnt have had to make such a call my word would have been enough i cant believe this i murmur what that cyrus is dead i needed him alive to save drew i needed a confession from that son of a bitch i mean dna might prove that cyrus had sex with kate but it cant prove he killed her it cant even prove he raped her and now well never know what cyrus knew about her last hours if anything barring the discovery of an eyewitness who saw cyrus kill kate drew is going on trial for murder the chiefs gaze is not without sympathy dont give up hope yet why not have you found a witness logans eyes shine with knowledge i cant read cyrus was hit five times he says thats what two witnesses told my detectives but when my patrolmen responded to the call they didnt find his body what there was nothing but some blood where the witnesses said he fell i stare at logan in disbelief do you think the wits lied to you i meanchrist was cyrus really shot at all could the whole thing have been staged to make us believe hes dead this is real life penn forget that tv shit the girl cyrus was in bed with made the call and shes not part of his crew shes a white girl from morgantown on the tape you can hear a black guy screaming at the girl to hang up then the phone goes dead i doubt cyruss guys would even have called anyway the girl told us cyrus was wearing a bulletproof vest his homeys confirmed that he owns one kevlar with ceramic inserts im trying to visualize the scene even if thats true why would cyrus be wearing it in his bedroom expecting a hit maybe cyrus heard about sonny and got scared the prospect of cyrus alive and breathing has me wired with excitement have you covered all the hospitals of course you have i dont know penn the chief cuts in what im going to interrogate drew right now im assuming you want to be present suddenly and for the first time i view don logan as a potential enemy don drew was in your custody while these shootings occurred i think wed better wait until im going in there logan says in a voice edged with steel you can take it up with the supreme court later but right now im going to do what i have to do ive been more than fair with drew but he hasnt reciprocated and ive had enough of people getting hurt and killed in my town kids are dying and drew knows more than hes saying more than hes saying to me anyway i hold up my hands in supplication let me call his attorney first thats all i ask logan looks at me like im crazy yourehis attorney i just told you id let you be present im not drews attorney don who the hell is quentin avery logan freezes in his chair youre kidding right i shake my head you know who avery is yessir i do the chief stands and removes his gun belt every move communicates an attitude of defensiveness and im not waiting around for that sob to make a federal case out of this as far as im concerned youre all the lawyer dr elliott needs the interrogation starts in one minute he walks past me without meeting my eyes don wait i plead fuck you chapter when i called quentin avery to tell him about drews impending interrogation i got his wife instead doris avery was reluctant to bring quentin to the phone but i heard him protesting in the background and then his rich voice came down the wire from the far northern edge of the county what are you pulling me out of bed for penn cage i quickly related everything that had happened since we last talked quentin sounded intrigued by the attack on cyrus and still more by his disappearance but he wasnt worried about drew being interrogated by chief logan if i felt nervous he said i should observe and make sure that drew answered only questions pertaining to cyruss death quentins nonchalance worried me i felt that he was misreading drewwhom he still had not metand that drews belief in his own innocence might cause him to make statements against his interest in the legal sense but quentin turned out to be right chief logan got nothing out of drew other than a denial that hed been involved in the attack on cyrus and his guards drew appeared even more shocked than i to hear of the attack but he was very interested in cyruss escape like me drew raised the possibility that cyrus might be attempting to fake his own death as chief logan tried to shoot down this theory i decided that if cyrus was trying to fake his own death hed done it without premeditation by simply taking advantage of a tragic but fortuitous event but drew seemed committed to the theory that the entire attack had been orchestrated by cyrus to rid himself of his own menpotential witnesses against himand then die to escape being punished for kates murder what better way to avoid prosecution drew challenged logan cyrus is probably on his way to chicago or los angeles by now logan ended his interrogation no wiser than hed begun it i warned drew not to answer any more questions without myself or quentin present promised to visit him in the morning then let chief logan walk me to my car somethings not right penn he said i dont know whether its drew or something i dont know about yet but somethings deeply wrong in this town maybe somethings been wrong for a while don maybe its just coming to the surface at last you talking about drugs and the other things tied up with it race problems teenagers in trouble big enough money to draw outoftown predators what about this marko kid logan asked whats his story you didnt have him on your radar before this no hes a croatian exchange student who wants to be al pacino what nothing just something sonny cross said chief logan looked like he wanted more information but i was too tired to tell what i knew about marko bakic whats your problem with quentin avery don the chief took out a cigarette and lit it after a couple of drags he said avery sued my uncle in a personal injury case danny richards uncle danny owned a trucking company they hauled pulpwood mostly well one of his drivers was drunk one friday black of course some of those guys buy two cases of beer in the morning and drink all day up in the cab its crazy of course but how you gonna stop them uncle danny checked his drivers lots of times but you cant be up in the trucks with them all the time anyway this particular driver overcorrected on a turn and spilled a load of logs on a housewife coming back from the grocery store paralyzed her avery took the case and pushed it to the limit the driver didnt have anything but a mountain of debt so he spent a few years in jail then got out hes driving log trucks again and your uncle avery shut him down all the assets of his company were seized to pay the punitive damages the case was litigated in jefferson county of course uncle danny killed himself two years later drove into a bridge piling stone sober in broad daylight onecar accident im sorry chief logan blew out a long stream of smoke that motherfucker comes into my station hed better hope theres people around the whole time otherwise he just might slip on a banana peel i waited for more but the chief added nothing to his story its an ancient rule lawyers make enemies ill see you don he dropped his butt and ground it out on the pavement yeah as i drive away from the police station my mind constructs a montage of images i never saw in life but which i now know happened cyrus white being attacked by a blackmasked killer the ethereal kate townsend walking alone into the brightside manor apartments to score drugs for her married lovers wife and playing beneath these images like the blackandwhite filmstrips of carnage i saw in drivers education class the death of sonny cross my own personal nightmare of muzzle flashes and panic and black blood my feelings about sonny remain mixed he was a flawed man but he did his best to protect his hometown from a scourge he knew more intimately than most of us it was an obligation he felt deeply and as he died he passed part of that obligation on to me like a falling soldier passing a regimental banner to a comrade reflecting on the hurricane of violence that began spinning through my town two days ago i ask myself what lies in the eye of that storm and the answer that comes to me is simple marko bakic given what i told sheriff byrd tonight about sonnys interrogation of marko this afternoon marko is probably sitting under a hot light down at the sheriffs department right now but maybe not billy byrd has a lot to deal with tonight dialing directory assistance on my cell phone i request the home phone number of paul wilson the retired professor who sponsored marko in the student exchange program its after eleven but paul keeps late hours ive seen him jogging with his dog after midnight in his subdivision i know this because i often keep late hours myself especially when im writing after pauls phone rings five times i start to hang up but then the professor answers in a wideawake voice penn cage whats up fella paul is a yankee and he obviously saw my name on his caller id hey paul i know its late but i was wondering if i could talk to you for a minute its not late over here janet and i were just having a glass of pinot noir and watching puccini on pbs a hysterical laugh almost escapes my mouth paul has instantly fulfilled my stereotypical image of him ive heard that he and janet drink a lot of wine and i know from talking to him that he listens to too much npr have you heard from the police tonight i ask theres a brief silence on pauls end as a matter of fact the sheriff called he was quite rude actually are they questioning marko now no markos out on a date i didnt think kids went on dates anymore paul laughs they dont really but marko and this girl spend a lot of time together shes his girlfriend well shes quite taken with him obsessed i would venture to say but i dont think marko confines himself to one girl when he was a child he learned not to get attached to anyone because he might lose them at any moment is marko usually late getting in sometimes he doesnt get in at all to be honest sometimes he stays at alicias house alicia reynolds i ask thinking of a troubled girl in the senior class thats right i turn onto the bypass and drive in the direction of pauls subdivision paul do you mind if i ask you a few questions about marko not at all i know youve spoken up for him at least once on the school board and i appreciate it but before you ask me anything let me say this i know a lot of people think i just bury my head in the sand when it comes to that boy but thats not the case at all nobody around here has any idea what marko went through in bosnia he was in sarajevo during the worst of it penn he was ten years old and he saw unspeakable things there nobody who experiences those kinds of things comes out whole on the other sideespecially a child marko doesnt talk about it but i know some would you feel comfortable sharing any of it with me it might be relevant to the current situation wellmarko reminds me of that kid in empire of the sun the spielberg film about world war two christian bale plays the kid hes in a prison camp and conditions are abominable john malkovich teaches bale to survive and bale becomes the consummate hustler thats marko and if thats what you are you dont change overnight just because youve been dropped into the land of milk and honey have you ever seen marko get violent never the kids at school think he carries a gun silence ive certainly never seen him with a gun im not saying its impossible considering his level of paranoia but ive never seen one id be very disappointed if i did you might be disappointed someone else might be deaddo you keep guns in the house paul not one im a firm advocate of gun control hm penn i heard a rumor that the board is thinking of expelling marko maybe even trying to get him deported wonderfulas i told holden smith nothing in those meetings stays secret just between you and me paul thats true i told them they couldnt do it without proof that hes broken the rules i see penni know its late but i think perhaps you and i should have a facetoface conversation about marko if hes in serious trouble i need to know the extent of it and i know some things about his experiences in sarajevo that you should probably be aware of i look at my watch pm mia is probably getting antsy by now but on the other hand marko is the biggest question mark in this whole bloody mess and after having sonny crosss gun stuck into his mouth this afternoon theres no telling what he might decide to do tonight i think thats a good idea paul ill be there in ten minutes ill pour you a glass of wine i dial home and mia answers her voice alert how you doing girl im good annies sound asleep why arent you i finished bowless book and i started the secret history i meant to read just one chapter but it hooked me i cant believe this was written by a girl from mississippi in longhand no less dont you ever just have fun this is my idea of fun believe it or not as i ask mia if she can stay another hour a crackle of static fills my ear then the felt wall of silence that heralds a failing connection greets me i accelerate up the hill in front of me until my phone shows three bars then pull over to the curb and dial mia again can you hear me now she asks yeah i had to pull over can you stay another hour sure what will your mom say i already called her and told her i might have to stay over this takes me aback meredith was okay with that yeah she knows youre working on drews case how does she feel about drew after all shes heard shes reserving judgment mom doesnt put much stock in gossip shes always respected drew and she told me she has a really hard time believing he could have killed kate but she believes he slept with her oh yeah i meanhes a guy right i laugh softly well i dont think youll have to stay over im going by paul wilsons house but it shouldnt take long a sudden tension enters her voice are you going to talk to marko id like to but hes not there hes out with his girlfriend mia makes a derogatory noise what is it marko doesnt have a girlfriend then what was paul talking about what about alicia reynolds godalicia worships marko shes kind ofi dont know goth i guess for about a year she had black fingernails now all she talks about is third world debt i think shes kind of a sex slave for him actually but not his girlfriend markos not into boundaries he takes whatever he can get does that make him different from most of the guys you know welli guess when it comes down to it no okay thanks id better get going hey wait mia says i heard a cop got killed tonight is that true the cellular jungle drums are beating overtime tonight yes do you know who did it sort of was the killer local why do you ask that i didnt figure youd tell me who it actually was so i asked for what you could tell me you seem to realize the drug business extends outside of natchez well sure they dont grow the stuff here except for some shitty pot out in jefferson county mia i think you should consider a career in law enforcement i might but i dont think they teach that at brown i laugh again ill see you in less than an hour if i fall asleep wake me up i will i tell her realizing as i do that we sound like nothing so much as a married couple the wilsons live on espero drive part of a large subdivision built in the s one that i once thought of as the new part of natchez now espero and its parallel street mansfield drive are shaded by mature oaks and house many retired couples who keep perfectly manicured lawns the wilson house is a onestory ranch set well back from the road behind it and to the right stands a twostory garage the upper story containing the apartment where marko lives i park on the street and walk up a flowerlined sidewalk trying to recall what i can about paul wilson his wife is a natchez native but paul hails from ohio he taught political science for years at the university of southern mississippi at hattiesburg about three hours by car from natchez i once attended a lecture he gave on race relations at the natchez literary festival and i was impressed paul seemed to have a better grasp of his subject than most yankees ever get and i credited his wife for that he probably knows more about the former yugoslav republics than i could learn in a year and i suspect that his choice of marko bakic as an exchange student was rooted in that knowledge on the other hand he might simply have been assigned marko at random the doorbell rings loudly enough for me to hear it through the door but no one answers i wait about thirty seconds then ring it again nothing maybe marko got home and they went out to his room to talk to him i step over some shrubs and walk around the right side of the house where the driveway runs back to the garage rather than interrupt a family conference i decide to check the rear of the house proper if i remember right the wilsons added a large sunroom to the main house a couple of years back they did the glass enclosure juts out unnaturally from the original brick but i imagine the wilsons were more than willing to trade symmetry for a nice place to drink wine and admire their garden without mosquitoes eating them alive as i move closer i see janet wilson sitting in a wicker chair in the sunroom i dont see paul im walking up to the glass door to knock when something stops me cold from this distance what i thought was a floral print on janet wilsons blouse looks more like spattered blood with my own blood roaring in my ears i scan the yard behind me for intruders nothing i lean against the door and search the rest of the room with my eyes two chairs lie on their sides possible signs of a struggle then i see paul hes lying facedown on a pale blue sofa and this too is splashed with blood i pull out my cell phone and dial not quite believing that im reporting murder for the second time in one night emergency says the dispatcher this is penn cage again i whisper im at espero drive and i have two probable homicide victims paul and janet wilson i need paramedics and cops the killer could still be on the property could you speak up sir nodouble homicide espero get two squad cars and an ambulance here and tell them to come with sirens screaming i hang up and try the door handle its open id give ten grand for my lost springfield right now but theres no use wishing the smart thing would be to wait in the bushes for the cops this isnt rural adams county like sonny crosss property there should be a squad car here inside two minutes but theres also a chance that paul or janet could still be alive and for them every second could be critical i open the door and go to janet first pressing my finger underneath her jawbone while i survey her wounds shes been stabbed more than a dozen times with most of the wounds concentrated in her chest and abdomen both hands show the multiple slashes of defensive wounds theres no pulse in her throat moving to the sofa i see that paul too has suffered multiple stab wounds a half dozen on his back alone i kneel squeeze his shoulder and speak close to his ear paul paul its penn cage a low rasp comes from his throat as gently as i can i roll him over pauls eyes are open but his throat has been slashed from his trachea to his left ear it was a clumsy effort a butchers job a small amount of bubbly red fluid pulses from the wound but i sense that the bulk of pauls lifeblood is soaking into the sofa and the rug beneath it his eyes are glassy and his face is so gray that i cant believe hes alive paul can you hear me the rasp comes again not from his mouth though its coming from the laceration in his windpipe the contents of my stomach come up in a rush and its all i can do to keep from vomiting on paul when i recover myself i realize that the dying professor is trying to turn his head to look at his dead wife all i can think of is sonny crosss dying concern for the safety of his sons janets fine i assure paul hoping he didnt see her stabbed but certain that hell be dead soon in any case air continues to bubble through the slash in his throat and he struggles harder to turn i take him by the shoulders and stop him the paramedics said janets fine paul its you theyre worried about hang on okay you have to hang on for janet another ambulance is on the way his eyes close a crazy thought comes to me and before i can stop myself i voice it did marko do this paul did marko stab you his eyes open again wide this time and with a remarkable feat of will he shakes his head did marko do this i repeat wanting to be sure paul shakes his head once again then closes his eyes and sags backward can you hear me paul nothing i take his hand and squeeze it im here paul youre not alone can you hear me nothing i reach across him with my left hand and grasp two of his fingers thats janet holding your hand she wants you to hold on can you hear me the fingers move and for an instant i feel hope but then a seemingly endless rasp issues from the throat wound slowly diminishing to a fluid rattle paul wilson is still in the way that only dead men are still i drop his hands and get to my feet suddenly aware of how foolish ive been to focus on these two while their killer could still be near i dart back outside and move into the shadows at the side of the house in the distance i hear a siren as it grows louder and higher in pitch i find myself looking up at the apartment over the garage suddenly i realize the obvious that the wilsons werent the target of whoever killed them marko was sprinting across the driveway i bound up the steps to markos apartment the door stands ajar while i try to decide whether or not to enter i hear the scream of burning rubber out on the street someone is fleeing the scene right now jesus the killer was probably still in markos apartment while i was checking on paul and janet praying i wont find markos corpse inside i enter the apartment its a single room with a bed a kitchenette and a toilet behind a partition the floor is a sea of bedclothes books and drawers jerked from the dresser against the wall an armoire lies facedown on a table its front shattered by the force with which it fell only a computer screen glowing against the far wall seems to have escaped the damage the siren is closer now i pick my way through the debris and go to the computer its a windows platform system i go to the my documents folder and check its contents the files look innocuous school reports and letters from junior colleges regarding a possible football scholarship i scan the rest of the hard drive but nothing jumps out at me marko seems to be a serious gamer with numerous combatoriented games residing on his drive the wail of an ambulance joins the police siren and the cacophony sounds as though its coming from the wilsons front yard knowing im pressing my luck i go to the windows control area and click show hidden files when i recheck the hard drive several new folders have appeared each with a semitransparent icon indicating that it was designated by the computers primary user to be concealed from a casual user i try to open one folder but im immediately prompted for a password another folder gives the same result desperate for some clue to markos inner psyche i look down at the floor into some drawers that were ripped from the computer desk between the drawers lying amid cracked cds and dvds is a usb flash drive similar to the ones in kate townsends shoe box this one is a sony about a half inch wide and three inches long as the sirens fade into silence out front i plug the flash drive into the usb port and copy the formerly hidden folders onto it then i dismount the drive shove it into the instep of my shoe and run downstairs to the driveway stopyells a male voice police put up your hands i cant see the face of the officer in the driveway because a floodlight on the side of the wilsons house is backlighting him but i see the gun in his outstretched hands im penn cage i made the call reach slowly into your pocket and take out some id as i obey the command i speak in the calmest voice i can muster the bodies are in the sunroom out back paul and janet wilson they have an exchange student living with them but hes not here hes involved in the drug trade and the killer tore his room apart he lives over the garage the officer moves toward me and checks my id then follows me back to the sunroom hes natchez pd not a sheriffs deputy and im glad for that while he surveys the crime scene two paramedics with a gurney arrive followed by more uniformed cops and a plainclothes detective named john ruff ive talked to ruff five or six times but never in a professional capacity usually i see him at the softball field like me he has a daughter who plays this is something huh he says in a soft voice i cant believe it john after whats already happened ruff nods and steers me away from the patrolmen to question me i answer his questions as fully as im able but the shock of seeing three murder victims in one day is taking its toll on my concentration the vagaries of fate and chance are hitting home as well paul and janet wilson must have been attacked only seconds after i hung up with paul if i hadnt pulled over to maintain good cellular reception with mia the couple might still be alive or i might be dead while ruff questions me about the immediate past a memory from my more distant history intrudes it was here on espero drive that the first homicide that ever touched me personally occurred a divorced young schoolteacher was raped and brutally murdered one night while her four and sevenyearold daughters slept in the house her killer wasnt a depraved stranger passing through natchez but a fifteenyearold boy with whom i had played often i was seventeen at the time and while i understood both rape and murder id never heard of the two being united in the way i would come to know so well later when serial murder became an american obsession but what shocked me most deeplyand likewise the townwas that such a crime could intrude upon our placid little universe at all even now twentysix years and infinite blows of disillusionment later the spectacle of paul and janet wilson cut to pieces in their own home seems more like a stunt mounted for punkd rather than reality as i recite my narrative to detective ruff i keep expecting paul and janet to get to their feet wipe the fake blood from their clothes and burst out laughing but they just lie there bad sports about the whole thing at last ruff runs out of questions and tells me im free to go as i rise to leave i hear a commotion in the front of the house angry voices all male the volume steadily increasing i hear what sounds like a scuffle and then a redfaced deputy charges into the sunroom my fists tighten involuntarily its the blackhaired deputy who stole the fingerprints from drews private bathroom while drew gave his blood for the dna test deputy burns i remember or so chief logan guessed after i described the guy you better straighten out those boys at the door burns yells at detective ruff or theyll wind up in the county jail ruff squares his shoulders at the shorter man what the hell are you talking about burnsie sheriff byrd is commandeering this crime scene thats what im talking about ruff glances at me at his men then back at the deputy you been smoking something from your evidence room burnsie didnt you notice this house is in the middle of natchez that makes it our jurisdiction before deputy burns can reply two more deputies appear behind him this makes it a fair fight three county officers versus three from the city the paramedics are staring in amazement and anticipation theyve already declared the wilsons dead and are only waiting for the police photographer to complete her work emboldened by the appearance of his comrades deputy burns continues sheriff byrds the chief law enforcement officer of adams county the citys part of the county that makes everything his jurisdiction he can take over any crime scene he deems necessary for public safety and he already told me that these murders will be investigated by the sheriffs department end of story john ruff draws himself to his full height and puts his hands on his hips burnsie if you or your buddies touch anything in this room youre gonna find yourself in a world of shit youve already contaminated the crime scene by tromping three men through it without any need now get your ass outside and wait for the sheriff and the chief to work this mess out unbelievably deputy burns lays his right hand on the butt of the automatic in his gun belt if you want me to arrest you i will he says in a bellicose tone nodding as though to convince himself the paramedics blanch john ruff is clearly outraged but hes also reluctant to escalate this argument into an armed confrontation after fifteen years working with seasoned professional cops in houston i have no patience for this kind of crap i step in front of ruff and address the deputy in a strong voice look over there i say pointing at the wilsons bloody corpses do you see those people you stay out of this cage he snarls look at themi shout they were murdered less than ten minutes ago are you investigating the crime no youre standing here obstructing the investigation bowing up for a fight like some junior high redneck theres an enemy in this town deputy burns but its not the police department you and ruff are after the same thingor you should beand your bosss smalltown political bullshit shouldnt have a thing to do with this crime the deputys chin is quivering but whether from shock or anger i cant tell youre not looking at them i yell unable to control my frustration how many murders have you seen like that in your career burns one none you think a single person in this town gives a damn about billy byrds feud with chief logan you leave that crap back at the station and do your work the deputys gun is out of its holster now hes not pointing it at me but its plain that hed like to im puttin your ass under arrest he yells spittle flying from his mouth goddamn bigcity lawyer i hold out both hands go ahead deputy arrest me arrest me and in thirty days i will have your ass penn ruff says gripping my shoulder from behind take it easy now seeing these bodies got you upset but dont be stupid i know ruff is right but under the gaze of the wilsons dead eyes i cannot rein in my anger you think these bodies upset me i take a step toward deputy burns i was an assistant district attorney in houston for fifteen years ive seen more murder victims than you will in your whole career ive sent twelve men and women to death row you want to arrest me clap em on you just be ready to take the heat for it the deputys face has gone from scarlet to gray but he still gets out his handcuffs hes trying to fit one around my wrist when sheriff billy byrd swaggers into the room whoa there tommy boy he says in the voice of a poor mans john wayne sheriff byrd sputters burns this crazy sumbitch i heard him says the sheriff you just leave him be for now byrd glances at detective ruff did you get a statement from mr cage john the detective nods warily okay byrd shifts his gaze to me youre free to go i start to ask him about the jurisdictional dispute but then i remember the flash drive concealed in my shoe with a last look at paul and janet wilson i exit the house through the door no one answered when i arrived and walk down the sidewalk to my saab closing myself into the little space i start the engine but i dont pull into the street my hands are cold and shaking and my chest feels full of something besides air whats happening i ask aloud i mean what the fuck one thing i know for sure the murders of paul and janet wilson will stun this town in a way that the attack on cyrus whites safe house never could and possibly even more deeply than the murder of kate townsend the reason is simple when drug dealers get killedblack or whitethe public perception is that the victims simply got what was coming to them when a young girl is raped and murderedblack or whiteour knowledge of the primitive laws of attraction and male sexual dominance informs our response but when middleaged white people minding their own business are murdered in their home in the safest part of town the fundamental order of southern life is thrown out of balance and the repercussions of such a severe anomaly are inevitably dire by noon tomorrow the full resources of law enforcement will be mobilized to a degree only surpassed by the response to a kidnapping or to the murder of a cop a multiagency task force will almost certainly be formed the dea and fbi will be part of it but as i sit in my idling car on espero drive images of paul and janets butchered bodies running through my mind one question comes to me what are all those agencies going to dobecause despite having been embroiled in this mess from the start i have absolutely no idea what is going on chapter dad its penn you awake you know me my father says in his deep voice im dictating and smoking a cigar dad was doing exactly the same thing thirty years ago while i tried to stay awake to watch the late movie back in the dark ages before hbo eternally behind with his hospital charts he would dictate late into the night and then reward himself with three hours of reading on the civil war or the history of the crusades i heard the ers been pretty busy tonight he says with understated curiosity yeah what do you need son a gun what kind not a moments hesitation my father has collected guns for most of his life the bulk of his collection consists of civil war muskets with a few pieces dating back to the revolutionary war but he also has a nice collection of modern pistols i need an automatic with a big magazine ive got a nice browning you can use you on your way over yep you in a hurry i need to get some sleep ill meet you outside five years ago my parents housemy childhood homewas burned to the ground by a man trying to stop me from working on a thirtyyearold race murder five years yet i still find myself turning into our old neighborhood as though the house i grew up in is still standing its not my father had the wreckage cleared but built a new house elsewhere now our old lot holds only flowers and a small granite monument to ruby flowers the black maid who raised me and my older sister ruby died as a result of the fire that took the house and part of me died with her the new house is south of town where most new construction in natchez goes up true to his word dad is standing in his carport when i arrive in the glow of my headlights i see the browning automatic hanging from his right hand i leave my engine running and walk up to him seventytwo years old half crippled by diabetes arthritis and coronary artery disease he still manages to practice medicine more hours per week than most internists fresh out of medical school thanks i say taking the gun is annie in danger he asks this is no idle question the man who burned our house five years ago also targeted my daughter for kidnapping and death not yet but i try to learn from past mistakes dad nods by the time most people realize theyre in danger its too late to do anything about it i may give daniel kelly a call sounds like a good idea i thought he was working in afghanistan daniel kelly is a former delta force operator who worked with me during the del payton case now an operative for a prestigious corporate security firm based in houston kelly has truly frightening skills but more important he knows and loves my family dad probes my eyes with a gaze that has searched out illness and deception for more than forty years what happened tonight you look shellshocked somebody tried to kill a drug dealer three black guys got killedteenagers probably dad shakes his head thats not all of it is it paul and janet wilson were just murdered in their home now its my father who looks shellshocked professor wilson and his wife cut to pieces who the hell would do that im not sure yet i think the killer was after an exchange student who lives with them why is this a drug thing too i think so are you involved in that case in a way im afraid it might be connected to drews case how this is you and me right dad gives me a look that makes me embarrassed to have asked the question ellen elliott was addicted to lorcet i tell him drew had the dea on his back for keeping her supplied so his girlfriend started getting it for ellen to make life easier on drew she got it from this black dealer dad closes his eyes damn it i suspected something like that what drew called me once and asked if id write ellen a scrip for fifty lorcet did you sure but i knew if he was asking me to do it he was already at the limit himself do a lot of local people abuse that drug patients ask for it by name every day i take it myself for arthritis couldnt get by without it but its addictive as hell you dont hear about it much oxycontin gets all the headlines but lorcet is an opium derivative too and it makes you feel pretty good i look down at the browning and familiarize myself with the safety mechanisms dad grips my wrist in his hand youre shaking penn that crime scene was pretty bad what can i do to help this is no idle offer at nineteen my father was part of the infamous retreat from the chosin reservoir in korea he also had occasion to use violence a couple of times in civilian life after that but i would never put him in harms way now despite his willingness to put himself there nothing right now but i appreciate the offer you know my number as i start to go an idea hits me do you have a pistol with one of those lights on it sonny cross had one and it looked pretty useful a laser sight no it was more like a powerful flashlight a tactical light dad says sure ive got one i can mount on that browning be right back he disappears into the house then returns with a small black object look here you flip this catch then slide the light onto these grooves cut into the gun stock when you let go of the catches its locked on he demonstrates the move for me twice to flick on the light just push up this lever with your trigger finger i test the light by shining it toward dads backyard fence an armadillo rooting in the yard freezes then scuttles away take him out dad says those bastards tear this yard to pieces ill leave him to you id better get moving ive got a babysitter keeping annie dad frowns caitlins still out of town yeah he shakes his head but says nothing he doesnt have to ill see you dad remember he calls theres more where that came from the gun or caitlini wonder but of course he meant both by the time i reach washington street my hands have steadied a bit i park in front of my house and look over at the town house to the right of minecaitlins house when shes in town which is less and less of late some nights when shes gone i look that way with an infantile wish that ill see lights on inside signifying a surprise return but thats never happened and tonight i dont even feel the wish its just an empty house i walk up the three steps to my familiar blue door unlock it and walk inside for a brief moment im suffused with terror an irrational fear that ill find annie and mia slashed and bleeding on the floor but of course theyre not mia is asleep on the couch in my study balled up beneath the comforter from my bed her cell phone sits on the back of the couch beside a paperback copy of donna tartts the secret history annie is undoubtedly asleep in her room upstairs i dont know whether to wake mia or to let her sleep through the night i dont even know what to do about myself im exhausted but i dont think i could sleep without a strong sedative i should have asked dad for something maybe a lorcet sensory overloadsays a voice in my head i told deputy burns the truth about my past in houston but that was a long time ago another life ago the grotesque scenes i saw tonight hit me with the same impact they would a layman or perhaps even harder i think human beings can endure only so much carnage and waste beyond a certain limit one either breaks down or becomes utterly desensitized that break point differs from person to person but i sense that im close to mine ive seen dozens of murder victims in person and hundreds in crime scene photographs ive watched nine of the twelve men and women i sent to death row be executed i watched my wife die a horrific death from cancer and i watched the maid who practically raised me die from thirddegree burns despite my best efforts to save her spread among those dead are the people ive watched suffer but live to tell about it if this tally continues to grow im not sure which side of the equation ill tip over onbreakdown or numbness hey says mia blinking and smiling up from the sofa what time is it around midnight i reply setting my fathers browning on top of a glassfronted bookcase behind me mia squints at me are you okay you dont look good im not sure she rises from the couch and walks past me to the hall stay there ill make some tea i obey grateful to be told what to do when mia returns with the tea im still standing in the spot where she left me staring at the rows of hardcover books on my shelves come sit she says setting two china cups on the coffee table before the sofa sarah chose those cups i say softly mia watches me closely your wife yes ive seen pictures of her in the photo albums annie showed them to me i nod distantly i think annie still misses her a lot mia sucks her lips between her teeth as if reluctant to continue do you sometimes i thought youd have a family picture out with the three of you you know i used to i think it started to bother caitlin after a while she never said anything but i took it down when i repainted and then pretended to forget to put it back up mia nestles herself into the corner of the sofa and tucks her legs beneath her i think the teas ready to drink i walk to the coffee table and drain half my cup in one swallow the tea is almost scalding but i welcome the pain can you tell me what happened tonight mia asks you dont already know nobody called me with anything new is it bad yes can you tell me i guess itll be all over town by tomorrow i justim really wiped out thirty words or less somebody tried to kill a black drug dealer he got three of the dealers friends instead and the wilsons are dead mias eyes go wide the wilsons marko lives with thats right did marko do it this brings me partly from my trance you obviously think hes capable of it i dont know why i said that maybe i do or maybe im retarded like i told you markos different from the rest of us he liked the wilsons though no i dont think he would do that i sit on the end of the sofa opposite mia shes still staring at me with wide eyes penn what the hell is going on i dont know i really dont i mean its been whatthree days three days and how many people dead she counts off the casualties on her fingers kate chris the narcthree black guys and now the wilsons and that catholic kid is still in intensive care right mike pinella i mean does anybody have any idea whats going on i shrug what do you think seriously i think its a drug war thats the only explanation i can come up with she nods slowly can natchez cops handle a drug war that questions moot tomorrow well see federal involvement at least the dea and maybe a task force thats what needs to happen some of the violence is coming from the asian gangs on the gulf coast the rest of iti dont know mia processes this in silence i lay my elbows on my knees then turn and look hard into her eyes youve seen marko selling drugs to st stephens kids havent you she doesnt move she doesnt even blink but then very softly she says i feel so bad about that now like maybe i could have stopped some of this you couldnt have but you need to tell me the truth now have you seen marko sell drugs on school property she nods have you seen him hurt anybody physically i mean a deep breath held in no i havent seen that why the hesitation i was thinking about something else what private stuff i decide to leave this alone was marko in school today no what about steve sayers steve was there he was trashtalking dr elliott when i saw him an image of kates exboyfriend rises in my mind a matthew mcconaughey lookalike with a more redneck bent have you ever seen steve do drugs mia rolls her eyes ive seen him smoke weed but most of the guys do that on occasion even the jocks nothing harder than pot no do you think steve could have killed kate she picks at a thread in the fabric of a pillow beside her only in a fit of rage hed be screaming and crying as soon as he realized what hed done maybe thats exactly what happened if kate insulted his masculinity or something i can see him hitting her what about choking her she tilts a hand from side to side yeah i can see that steve still has a weak alibi and he assaulted drew before word about the affair with kate was really out in the community will you see if you can find out how he first learned about kate and drew ill ask him be careful dont worry steves pretty much a brick mia hugs the pillow to her chest you know ive been sitting here trying to figure out whats behind all this violence have you i think peoples motivations are pretty basic you know primitive go on its like sex how do you mean she shrugs as though her point is selfevident sex is always there you know people act civilized they go through the motions of public life but these secret attractions and affairs are always going on look at st stephensthe parents i mean how many of them are having affairs with other peoples husbands and wives quite a few that i know about how do those affairs start with a glance that lingered too long bumping into each other in the grocery store my point is that sexual energy is always there that desire to be loved and wanted is always looking for a connection and thats the secret motivation of a lot of what we see youre right so thats whats missing from history i think history what do you mean mia is hugging the pillow hard but she seems unaware that shes doing it in school we learn about all these events historical trends stuff like that but what we dont learnand probably cant ever knowis the true nature of personalities i mean we can read biographiesand if were lucky personal lettersbut the real interplay between individuals the chemistry of aggression and submissiveness pride and shame sexual attractionwe cant ever know that thats why it was so shocking to the country when they proved that thomas jefferson had children by his black slave suddenly he was no longer a granite figure on mount rushmore he was just like us you know feet of clay we tell ourselves that we know everyone is human but then we act as if we expect something else we expect our heroes to be immortalthats the real problem drew has now mias words are almost tumbling over themselves but her command of the language amazes me did i speak this way as a high school senior i dont think so i have a feeling mia goes through life holding herself in praying for someone who might be receptive to her thoughts it strikes me as even stranger that this vocabulary is pouring from the mouth of a beautiful girl thats only my prejudice of course but i wouldnt be half so surprised if mia were a plain girl who sat at home all the time but shes the head cheerleader with a body to make the shallowest high school jock drop his jaw in lust kate townsend shared this quality with her though kate was not so conventionally beautiful its not hard to see why drew was drawn to this unusual combination of qualities most people in natchez thought drew was the greatest guy theyd ever met mia says now it turns out he was having sex with his babysitter and theyre so pissed off theyre about to pop but their angers not really about kate you know its about them they feel betrayed they put him up on a pedestal and then he committed the crime of being human so fuck him right never mind that kate was two weeks shy of eighteen and on the make for exactly the kind of affair she had with drew so you think kate was the aggressor id bet all the money i have on it she grins exposing perfect teeth which isnt much if only drew could get jurors with your mindset but go on you said youve been trying to figure out whats behind this violence mia looks startled oh sorry i went off on a tangent as usual okay i know this sounds obvious but i think you should start with the people and move forward rather than the way cops work which is they start with the murder and work backward right some of them go on were not just looking for a killer were trying to understand the secret reality of this town like kate and drew that was the reality not drew and ellen you see if you figure out the true connections the killer will be obvious mia is right of course the best homicide detectives use the exact methodology shes describing theyre experts on human psychology even if theyve never taken a single psychology course but i doubt they developed their methods by the age of eighteen mia i think you should think long and hard before you choose a career because you need to find something thats going to make use of all of your gifts she stares at me without speaking then she blinks as though suddenly coming awake its time for me to go isnt it i give her an apologetic smile i think so she forces herself to release the pillow then speaks without looking at me are you in for the night absolutely i dont think i can move from this spot now her eyes find mine you dont need me to stay and take annie to school no my eyes will pop open at seven a skeptical smile i left my backpack in the kitchen ill get that and then im gone okay i cant thank you enough for staying late you just did something i didnt think anyone could do whats that she asks standing took my mind off of the wilsons bodies well im glad for that see you tomorrow she picks up her paperback and her cell phone then leaves me alone in the study i take a deep breath and settle back against the soft cushion mias theories of history and detective work acted like a tranquilizer on my frayed nerves driving home i feared i would have trouble sleeping tonight but my only trouble is going to be making it upstairs to my bedroom the couch is plenty soft enough to sleep on i must have dozed off because the next thing i feel is strong hands massaging my shoulders i wouldnt have allowed mia to do this if id been awake no matter how good it feels whichfranklyis pretty damned good her fingertips dig expertly into the muscle fibers of my neck then climb to the base of my skull slowly easing the pressure on the disks between my cervical vertebrae i groan involuntarily and the sound of my pleasure brings me to full alertness mia that feels great but i cant let you do that why not i jerk my head around to find caitlin staring down at me looking half amused and half angry she raises her eyebrows and says you were a little slow to tell the babysitter she shouldnt be rubbing your neck i was asleep i protest getting to my feet caitlin gives me a look of mock suspicion were you how the hell did you get here hug first then talk i walk around the sofa and crush her body against mine only after i sense her having difficulty breathing do i pull back and look at her no matter how much time i spend with caitlin i cant get accustomed to the luminous green of her eyes they seem almost incongruous in her face which is porcelain pale while her hair is jet black and very fine wheres mia i ask shes gone home where she belongs i slipped through the back door and saw her in the kitchen she left that way thats some timing a little color comes into caitlins cheeks i watched the two of you from the porch for a little bit spying a girl has to protect her investment i maintain my smile but the thought that came into my head wasyou havent invested much in me lately or in annie either are you all right caitlin asks i know you were at the wilson scene how do you know that ive been in touch with my reporters all the way down i pull her over to the couch and sit beside her down from where explain yourself she laughs at my puzzlement i was flying down to wilmington to see my father he wanted to talk to me about an acquisition for the chain face time not phone time wilmington north carolina is the home base of caitlins father the owner of one of the fastestgrowing and most successful newspaper chains in the south theyre at eighteen papers and counting daddys company owns the cessna jet that allows caitlin to change her flight destination on a whim ann denny called me after sonny cross was shot caitlin goes on denny is the editor of the natchez examiner which means she reports directly to caitlin who is still technically the publisher despite her long absences i figured you were probably in the middle of whatever was going on here so i decided screw it lets turn this plane southwest and go to mississippi wellim glad you did her lovely eyes narrow are you of course she gives me a long and searching look then why arent you raping me her eyes flash invitingly but i feel no reaction other than anxiety if i make love with caitlin now and then tomorrow vent the feelings that have been building up while shes gone she will feel betrayed besides the truth is i dont feel like having sex right now what i most want now is sedation general anesthesia youre upset arent you yes i concede i heard the wilson scene was bad was it even this simple question causes resentment in me is she asking me out of curiosity or out of professional interest it was a murder scene you dont want to talk about it not tonight what do you want to do i know this sounds bad but i think i need sleep more than anything else caitlin shakes her head and smiles no i understand completely do you want me to stay here can you stay all night she seems to steel herself then says i promised ann i would go over to the paper at twothirty for a strategy meeting shes working through the night i shake my head dont worry about it penn that still gives us almost two hours i can tuck you in and watch you sleep a year ago i would have loved hearing this not now i dont think im very good company tonight ill have my resources back in the morning we can start over then caitlin stands okay i need to air my house out anyway im going to open all the doors and windows and drink a gimlet maybe two i wish i was up to joining you sorry she looks down at me silently imploring me for some explanation but she must already know the truth of the situation caitlinyou wouldnt even be in natchez if it werent for these murders would you she bites her lip and thinks this over thats probably true but i was coming back in two weeks no matter what and staying for a whole week were you yes penn whats wrong please talk to me we should talk before we slip back into our old routine lets talk now no im too exhausted ive seen too much tonight im happy to see you and annie will be ecstatic lets leave it at that for now caitlin starts to reply then thinks better of it she steps forward and gives me a soft kiss on the lips then turns and walks out of the study shes never been slow on the uptake one way or another change is coming chapter the st stephens high school gymnasium sounds like a broadway theater before the lights go down four hundred students ranging from fifthgraders to the senior classmates of kate townsend and chris vogel have been crowded into the bleachers on both sides of the gleaming basketball court most teachers are sitting with their classes trying in vain to keep the anticipatory energy under control about fifty adults from the communitymany of them st stephens parents but some teachers and coaches from other schoolsstand against the wall by the large double entrance doors coach wade anders our athletic director stands by the smaller door to his office glaring at the loudest of the students to quiet them down a podium has been placed at the center of the tipoff circle with chairs on both sides of it in the chairs sit jan chancellor holden smith dean herrick minister of the presbyterian church kate attended roger mills minister of the methodist church chris vogel attended and charles martin the school chaplain theres no chair for jenny townsend kates mother but she must be here somewhere likewise the vogel family jan chancellor stands and walks to the microphone a folded piece of paper in her hand on any other occasion it would require some effort to obtain quiet but not today today the room goes still as though everyone has suddenly held his breath death retains its power to awe we have gathered here jan says in a strong voice to remember two of the most distinguished students ever to attend this school kate townsend and chris vogel because st stephens is such a small institution we are truly a family and today we all grieve the loss of two family members as jan goes on i realize she is an even better speaker than i thought she doesnt distance herself from the kids by being too formal neither does she condescend to them she paints a brief picture of each dead student that brings home their special qualities and avoids all mention of the manner in which they died i suppose that subject will be handled by the ministers winging the podium as jan introduces reverend mills i find my thoughts drifting away from the proceeding this gymnasium served as a backdrop for some of the most seminal moments of my life several of the royal blue banners hanging from the far wall have my name inscribed in gold upon them along with the names of boys i knew from the age of four until today from this tiny town we sallied forth in a creaking old school bus and claimed state titles in basketball baseball football and track if i close my eyes i can still hear the sound of rain thundering on the tin roof as we run line drills during pe and basketball practice we even practiced football on this floor when it rained barefoot to protect the wood wearing shorts shoulder pads and helmets on this floor i stole kisses under the eyes of watchful chaperones during school dances devoured barbecue chicken at athletic banquets received ribbons on academic awards days watched school plays and ran endless sprints as punishments for various infractions but this is the first time i have come here for a funeral its not a funeral really but a memorial service the real funerals will begin in less than an hour in churches downtown students from the tenth grade and above will be excused from school to attend them if they so choose the rest will sit in class and pretend to work while they wonder what is happening at the funerals reverend mills is speaking now trying his best to deal with one of the thorniest issues any believer must face why an innocent young person should be cut down for no apparent reason just as his life is about to begin by my measure mills isnt doing a very good job he seems to be following the god has a plan inscrutable to us mortals line i stopped buying this rationalization at age fourteen and i doubt its resonating with the students sitting in the bleachers today scanning the faces in the crowd i realize im searching for marko bakic i dont see him anywhere i suppose the incipient drug war has changed his opinion of the relative value of an american high school education reverend mills segues into the evangelical section of his eulogy he has no more intent than jan chancellor of delving into the issues of sexual homicide or drug abuse as his deep bass voice drones on i wonder who will finally articulate the feelings of these students and of the town proper after the unprecedented losses of kate chris and sonny news of last nights deaths hit natchez with the force of a tornado ive never seen the city in such a state not even during the race riot of then at least the threat was understood but now all sense of control has been shattered driving through downtown this morning it felt as though the air had been sucked from the streets people hurried along the sidewalks with their heads down like medieval villagers awaiting the onslaught of some unknown calamity so many deaths in so few days almost begs the question of divine retribution and im sure that theory has been raised in some local households millss somnolent drone makes me want to get up and phone quentin avery who is setting up his offices at the eola hotel right now but reverend mills suddenly yields the floor to his presbyterian colleague reverend dean herrick herrick is about my age and ive met him a couple of times hes from tennessee and he seems to have more liberal ideas than any of his predecessors or peers hes about twenty pounds overweight and hes starting to use the dreaded combover to combat his receding hairline he stands at the podium in silence surveying the assembled students with dark eyes boys and girls he says finally im not going to take much of your time today and im not going to lie to you im not going to spout a bunch of platitudes that sound good in a preachers guide but give no comfort to a grieving soul or a troubled mind reverend herrick did not look at reverend mills as he said this but he might as well have i sense that he has the full attention of the assembly the premature death of someone like kate townsend or chris vogel is the toughest test a christian ever faces as a minister i have no special powers of understanding like you im rendered speechless by these tragedies my heart is broken and in the face of deaths like this the bible is strangely silent we search its pages for comfort but we find little death like birth is a mystery we feel that we understand birth because we know what comes after it but do we know what comes before birth no we believe that souls originate from god but more than this we do not know so what of death for christians death is the time when we shuffle off this mortal coil and return to god but as for details we know none reverend herrick pauses the air in the gym is still not one student shifts in his seat as i lay in bed last night he goes on one question filled my mind why why was this beautiful girl taken so young does god have a plan that requires her death the bible doesnt tell us so whatdoes the bible say jesus said no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him in other words only through death can we return to god well all right but does that answer my question why after eighteen years of rigorous and joyous preparation for life were kate and chris taken from us if they were not to be granted a full life why were they born at all some of the parents stir at these words as if reverend herrick has trespassed on territory best left unexplored in the presence of children but hes got the kids i can feel it but here we may find some comfort herrick says because you and i would not be the people we are the souls that we are had we not known kate and chris both those young people brought joy into my heart and yours simply watching chris perform on the fields and courts of this state was a revelation seeing kate work with children on mission trips made me think of audrey hepburn working with the starving children of africa but kate didnt think of herself that way like the rest of us she spent much of her time worrying whether she was living up to the ideals her mother and this community had bred into her herrick spreads his arms as if to take in the whole school people this institution would not be what it is today had kate and chris not walked its halls their lives had purpose and their deaths have purpose too because in the dark hours of the last three days all of us have been forced to face one inescapable truth in the midst of life we are in death you hear that a lot but what does it really mean ill tell you live each day as though its your last for one day youre sure to be right for a christian that means living out the meaning of our creed it means following the example of jesus life just when i think herrick is going to repeat millss error by proselytizing he veers into still more surprising territory what is the purpose of this memorial service he asks whats the purpose of the funerals you will attend in a few minutes the answer will probably surprise you for though the words of these rituals are gentle our intent is fierce in a christian funeral we raise our fists at death and shake them we remember jesus christ who suffered death battled death and ultimately triumphed over it reverend herrick takes out a handkerchief and wipes his forehead he seems overwhelmed by his own passion the bible tells us it was through sin that death entered into the world and some people draw unwarranted conclusions from that language theres been a lot of talk about kates private life a secret life that none of us was privy to theres been a lot of talk about chris vogel too the parents against the wall are shifting uncomfortably again yes kate had secrets herrick says chris had secrets too kate needed love and affirmation and she found it in her own way chris needed help to face the stress of this world and he found it where he could but i dont condemn these children for that how can i because i need love and affirmation too i need help facing the stress of this world just like every one of you out there and what tortures me today is not anything kate or chris did in life but what they didnot do they did not come to me with their fear and confusion and the fault for that lies with me with us somehow we did not make kate feel safe enough or loved enough to come to us with her pain and loneliness and i know this kate and chris werent the only ones among us with secrets we all carry private burdens we all carry guilt weall sin thats why death comes to all men and women but premature death is not a punishment sent from god to those of you who may be suffering in silence i say please do not suffer alone and to those people who speak ill of kate i repeat the words of jesus of nazareth let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone reverend herricks words echo through the gym with unexpected power the children appear dumbstruck by his honesty i sense that some in the room want to stand and applaud as herrick walks to his seat the only sound is his heels clicking on the floor jan chancellor rises again probably to introduce the school chaplain but reverend herricks words are the last i need to hear on the subject of kates death im seated at the far end of the bleachers close enough to the door to make a discreet exit and i do walking down the familiar halls i decide to drive straight to the eola hotel for a conversation with quentin avery as wise as the famous lawyer is his primary motive is to torpedo shad johnson not to get drew acquitted but i have to finish with quentin in time to ride out to the cemetery for kates interment my interest in the burial isnt personal but professional murderers often attend the funerals of their victims particularly in cases of sexual homicide i brought my digital camera in my car to shoot pictures of those who will gather at the grave just in case the local cops neglect to do it in a town that averages only one or two murders a year such an error wouldnt surprise me as i reach the main atrium of the high school i pass the back door of coach anderss office on impulse i walk in meaning to have a word with the athletic director when the service is done but like me anders has left the gym early hes sitting at his desk staring blankly at a poster of peyton manning on his wall wade anders is thirty with closecropped black hair and the body of an aging athlete past his prime theres a growing spare tire around his middle but his legs and forearms still ripple with muscle anders is fast with a grin and smooth when dealing with the school board but during basketball games out of town ive seen him lose control of his temper and be ejected from the gymnasium the students seem to like him but then he is all they have ever known anders makes me long for the coach i had at st stephens a gentleman athlete with a paternal manner and a steely eye a natural leader who took kiplings advice and treated both victory and defeat as impostors yet still managed to bring home state titles one raised eyebrow from him was the equivalent of a violent outburst from wade anders but though my coachs name is painted over the gym door its anders sitting in his chair nowone more sign of the way the world has changed wade i say softly anders starts from his trance then comes quickly to his feet hey penn what can i do for you i wanted to ask you about marko anders shakes his head that boywhat can i tell you have you seen him at all in the past two days not hide nor hair hes gone and id just about sewed up a scholarship for him at delta state they need a new kicker and one thing that boy can do is kick tell the truth its about the only thing he can do on a football field i give wade the laugh he expects i heard marko was with you on the afternoon kate died is that right yessir it is he rode home from school with me i worked on his kicking with him then worked the phones for a while talking to college coaches on his behalf i was trying to do what i could for the damn fool i knew he was into drugs and i thought a college football program might get that out of his system even a junior college program and now hell penn if marko doesnt come back to school soon hes not even going to graduate i already talked to his teachers hes practically a washout now sit down wade this isnt a formal meeting this is just two guys shooting the shit okay sure yeah anders sits but he doesnt look comfortable the fact that im a member of the school board as well as a lawyer is probably enough to make him nervous but still something seems wrong beyond simple anxiety did you give marko a ride to the wilsons house after you were done with your phone calls no some other kids picked him up did you know them wade shakes his head they were black kids homeboys looked like druggies to me what time was that a little after six marko said they were going to baton rouge to watch a movie did he tell you what movie adam sandler i think dont remember the title i watch wade in silence for a while trying to figure out what i might be able to learn from him he has the athletes discomfort with stillness has marko ever talked to you about what he experienced back in europe i ask he told me he saw his family killed happened in a place called srebecesomething like that anyway the place where hes from hes got a hell of a scar on his belly and when i asked about that he told me about his folks the scar came from a bayonet he didnt tell me any details though did you ask once yeah late one night on the team bus on the way back from an away game he didnt want to talk about it though some people think markos dangerous wade capable of serious violence anders shrugs as though this is unlikely i dont think so he hates the serbs now thats who killed his folks if you asked me would marko kill a serb id say dont get between them how did marko feel about the wilsons wade laughs he liked them hell they let him do whatever he wanted most of the time why wouldnt he like them professor wilsons in another world half the time anyway was i mean absentminded you mean head in the clouds that too i guess but i meant drunk a new thought hits me paul wilson didnt do drugs did he wade shrugs again never thought about it but i wouldnt reject the idea out of hand he spent his whole life teaching college hes bound to have smoked some reefer at least hm what did you think of kate townsend wade swallows hard shakes his head and looks at the floor jesus penn you see a kid like that maybe once every ten years gifted on the field and a genius in the classroom ive really never had one like her myself tell the truth i cant really believe shes dead do you have any idea who killed her shock blanks anderss face hell no do you no i mean people are saying dr elliott did it but i dont really hold with that why not drews not the type i mean im sure he was in love with her hell you cant help but love a girl like that but he wouldnt have killed her i mean not unless hes got a different side you know a jealous side some guys are like that seem like great guys on the outside but at home theyre real control freaks paranoid you know yeah youre his friend right is drew like that no i didnt think so you can tell from how a guy deals with his kids drew never pressures his son in football practices he comes out to watch you know but he never gets onto timmy not even when he makes a mistake which surprised me since drew played college ball and all look man what do i know im just a coach youve made some good points wade what do you think about drew having sex with kate anders blinks as though confused what do you mean do you condemn him for it wade looks at his office door which i realize is open about a half inch he closes it with his foot you want the party line or the real answer you know what i want his eyes shine as he shakes his head penn these girlstheyre not the girls we went to school with okay theres a group of girls here who have a club called the bald eagles know why do i want to know they all shave their pussies is that a big deal wade raises his eyebrows theyre in the eighth grade jesus even in our frankest discussions mia and i have not gotten to this level of detail and the juniors and seniors man they put it right in your face day in and day out sex is no big deal to them ill be honest with you penn the hardest thing ive ever done is said no to the girls whove come on to me in this office ive had em start changing clothes right in front of me like they forgot i was here then ask if i want to see more wades honesty surprises me but is he playing me as well do you always say no wade his jaw tightens yessir i do know why why my mama taught me one lesson dont shit where you eat he glances at the door again i need this job penn and screwing a seventeen or eighteenyearold would eventually lose it for me because these girls cant handle what theyre playing with they have sex but they dont understand what it really is you know hell adults dont either half the time maybe thats what happened to drew the truth is well probably never know what happened to kate yes we will i promise because im going to find out wade anders stands and offers me his hand more power to you brother anything i can do to help you let me know i shake his hand and turn to leave the office oh hey he says i had my baseball team go over the football field and track with a finetoothed comb but they never found that pistol you told me you lost i stop and look back at him searching for hidden meaning in his face did the crew i sent over get your light control box fixed yep good as new wade leans back in his chair and puts his feet up on his desk man those bullets tore up the inside of that box good thing you didnt hit anybody with them i freeze i never told you it was me who shot the box he looks blank i guess you didnt i just assumed what that you were down here spotlighting deer or something that you crossed over from the hunting camp i didnt mean nothing by it i keep studying his face looking for cracks in his composure thats pretty much what happened thanks for the effort wade no problem you be careful lots of crazy shit happening in this town i will chapter at seven stories the eola hotel is the tallest building in natchez built in the year of the great flood the eola has weathered boom and bust to find itself in the national register of historic places when i was a boy in the s the lobby of the eola was a seedy place where old men played chess and smoked cigars while families fresh from church walked through the stale air to eat their sunday dinners in the hotel restaurant in that era uniformed black men operated the elevator and attended the restroom while yankees like dan rather his cbs news crew and new york print journalists stood in the café watching robed klansmen on horseback march down main street outside quentin avery remembers that era a lot better than i do and now he will run drew elliotts legal defense from the penthouse suite of a hotel that wouldnt have given him a reservation when he was a thirtyyearold lawyer today i operate the elevator myself as i ride up to the seventh floor when the door opens i see two young white men carrying computer equipment between rooms they have the harried look of young lawyers i nod at them and make my way up the hall to quentins suite the door is propped open with a heavy law book i knock and walk inside the suite is huge three separate rooms and two baths all decorated with obsessive attention to detail quentin is standing on the long balcony which gives a panoramic view of natchez the mississippi river and the louisiana delta stretching away for miles to the west hes wearing jeans and a white buttondown shirt from the rear his grayishwhite afro gives him the look of a much younger man quentin i call its penn cage avery turns and smiles and though i see every one of his seventyplus years in his face the light in his eyes tells me hes excited to be back in the game again what do you know he asks anything new i talked to chief logan this morning marko bakic has vanished ditto cyrus white quentins smile broadens good good thats just how we like it whys that you need to ask me that come out here into the sun maybe itll prod your brain i walk out onto the balcony theres a cool breeze blowing off the rustcolored river which is high for this early in the spring tell me this is a murder case penn our goal is acquittal to get that we need one thing reasonable doubt and cyrus white is our reasonable doubt just as he is if i could stop time right now and go to trial i would because no sane jury can convict drew elliott of murder with unidentified sperm in that dead girl and cyrus white on the loose not with proof that kate and cyrus knew each other im not sure we can prove that quentins smile vanishes you told me the police had video of the dead girl going into cyruss apartment sonny cross told me that hes dead now and wellhe worked for the sheriffs department so the sheriffs department will have the video well get that during discovery i hope so what do you mean when i talked to sonny i got the feeling he kept a lot from the sheriff i dont think they got along too well quentins face hardens i need that video penn youve got to get it for me ill do my best is there any other proof that kate townsend and cyrus knew each other an image of kates secret journal fills my mind but im not ready to tell quentin about that yet theres no way we could use that diary in the trial without causing drew further damage besides jenny townsend gave me kates private things specifically so that they wouldnt be seen by prying eyes even if i wanted to make the diary public im not sure i could bring myself to violate jennys trust if it meant saving drews life i would of course but right now that journal is as likely to hurt him as help him there might be digital proof somewhere that cyrus was tracking kates cell phone but ill find that out on my own i dont know i murmur ill try to find out youll have to talk to cyruss crew quentin says see if they remember her coming around you think theyll talk to me quentin shrugs youre my investigator well subpoena them if we have to but thats never the best way to get information its time for me to come clean with quentin about kates relationship with cyrus as succinctly as possible i explain ellen elliots lorcet addiction and kates reason for visiting cyrus once a month he listens like a man who has heard it all in his time he cant be shocked only disappointed this aint good quentin says when i finish i can make the jury feel sorry for a good doctor who happened to fall in love with a beautiful young girl even an underage girl but i cant make them feel sorry for a manipulator who used a high school girl in a sleazy scheme to get drugs ill be very surprised if shad makes that connection quentin raises one eyebrow ive learned something in my long years of practicing law penn what holds true of adultery holds true for most other sins sooner or later people find out for us the important question is how long does this particular sin stay secret in other words how soon will drew be indicted and go to trial quentin nods i look for sooner rather than later as soon as shad gets a dna match on the semen taken from the girls rectum hes likely to ask for an indictment thats usually three weeks minimum although shad hinted to me that it might not take that long if he really wants drew badand we know he doeshe could use a private lab to do the analysis that could knock ten days off the wait maybe more the irony is that shad will be helping us if he rushes to trial only as it relates to that single issue quentin points out connecting the lorcet to ellen elliott maybe you shouldnt talk to cyruss crew after all we dont want to jog anybodys memory too hard were at the beginning of a court term now i think aloud even if shad gets an indictment the trial will be scheduled for the next term which gives us two months to prepare i wouldnt count on that quentin says why not shads thinking about the special mayoral election not the trial thats the whole point of the trial if he gets the indictment hell try to have the trial scheduled for the current term judge minor and shad are thick as thieves all shad will have to do is steer the case to minors court and minor will schedule the trial for this term were likely to be trying the case in less than a month quentin says thats unethical quentin laughs heartily try convincing the supreme court of that the founding fathers specifically guaranteed the right of the accused to a speedy trial if we protest against shad rushing this trial he can argue that hes only trying to provide what the constitution demands the right of an innocent man to prove his innocence as soon as possible hell that was the way it worked all the time in the old days in some rural counties they still indict the accused and try him within a week the system has gotten so ass backwards over the past three decades that we routinely expect capital cases to take years but thats not how its supposed to be if judge minor is on shads side theres no way well slow this trial down great quentin nods thoughtfully it is great because we want the trial over before anyone can figure out just what a sleazy character our defendant really is and we want cyrus white to stay lost quentins description of drew offends me but i hold my tongue out with it says the lawyer am i pissing you off a little bit a tight smile i understand human frailty penn believe me im only talking the way the jury will behind closed doors i dont care if your buddy was albert schweitzer right up until he met kate townsend his behavior since then is going to make him scum in the eyes of most potential jury members now a lot of jurors will understand the psychological dynamics of extramarital affairs and some of them will even forgive that but this drug angletheyll fry his ass for that the sheriffs men will be questioning cyruss crew about kates visits to cyrus i hope to hell kate never said anything about ellen to cyrus or his men yeah it would be a lot better if you hadnt told byrd about that video i didnt tell him there was video you told him there was documented evidence thats video or still photos i squeeze my hands into fists wishing i could change the past stop beating yourself up says quentin cyruss homeys wont say shit to those cracker cops the cops may find out kate was going there to buy drugs but theyll assume she was getting them for herself at first anyway but the toxicology on her body will be clean are you sure have you seen the report yourself no but sonny cross said it was clean quentin chides me with a smile well request that in discovery if were lucky our prom queen popped a few lorcet herself to ease the pain of waiting for her lover to get divorced im glad i never came up against you in court quentin youre a pragmatic son of a bitch his eyes twinkle that i am my boy you are too you just have this romantic haze over your eyes you want the world to be better than it is but i know your record youre as hard as i am when it comes down to it you just get there by a different route im not sure about that quentin snorts as many people as you got executed i hope youre sure images of desperate men fill my mind some of them glaring at me from death row cages others staring through bulletproof glass as a technician injects paralyzing drugs into their veins in some of those eyes i see a plea for forgiveness in others unalloyed hatred but one thing is common to them all the animal fear of death stop it quentin says let the dead bury the dead sometimes i cant stop it the old lawyer looks out over the rooftops toward the river and speaks in a low voice fifteen years ago i was asked to review the case of a young man sitting on death row in huntsville texas he was black and his family told me hed been railroaded by the state the facts sounded promising as presented so i flew down to texas and reviewed the file quentin glances at me you were the lawyer who convicted him a chill goes through me what was his name doesnt matter quentin looks back at the river the point is i spent three days and nights going over that case i had two associates helping me and we couldnt find one chink in the wall of evidence that had convicted that boy there wasnt a glimmer of hope i gave the family back their files and flew home he spits over the brick wall of the balcony then turns to me i dont believe in the death penalty penn not in this mortal world its applied unfairly and innocent men are executed but i will say this according to the law of the land that boy in huntsville got exactly what he deserved and you have nothing to be ashamed of ive reviewed a lot of death penalty cases and that was the best work ive ever seen why are you telling me this because thats the reason the two of us are standing here now working together were about to go through some shit you and i and i want you to know i know youve got what it takes to do it now if you want to do your friend any good youre going to have to start looking at the facts as coldly as you would if you were dealing with some deadeyed killer in texas its hard for me to look at drew like that thats because hes white i feel my back stiffen thats not true i sent five white men to death row i killed a white supremacist myself quentin shakes his head like a patient tutor i said hes white not white trash when you look at drew elliott you see yourself when you look at kate townsend you see your sister or your daughter or your mother how do you think i got so many black men off of death row when i looked at them i saw myself or what could have been me with just a tiny push at the wrong time i see what you mean so youre telling me not to try to find cyrus damned straight as long as cyrus white stays a mystery hes our acquittal on the hoof the last thing we want is that depraved hoodlum on the witness stand telling a jury how kate was scoring dope for drews wife you get me yes only what i tried a lot of murder cases quentin if you dont really know what happened at a crime scene you can get your ass handed to you in court stop thinking like a prosecutor were the defense boy we dontcare what really happened at the crime scene we dont even want to know all we care about is reasonable doubt thats your mantra from now on i want you saying it in your sleep reasonable doubt say it man its like show me the money quentin grins come onreasonable doubt id like to humor him but at bottom i just dont believe in his strategy he puts his hand on my shoulder and squeezes its human nature to want to know the truth penn but what if the truth is that your best friend flew into a jealous rage raped that girl in the ass and strangled her to death quentins frank tone tells me that he fully believes in this possibility i know what hes trying to do but i simply cant abandon my faith in my friend if i do that i abandon my faith in myself i dont think thats what happened but you dont know and at least until this trial is over thats the way i want it because if you find out that is what happened you wont be any earthly good to me or drew elliott and i need your help just remember youre the foot soldier here not the general i got it make sure you do chapter cemetery road runs through the old black section of town past the little theater and up along the twohundredfoot bluff that stretches along the mississippi river north of town the road is narrow bordered on the right by a low stone wall and on the left by a tangle of kudzu that festoons the bluff from top to bottom as i pass the second wroughtiron gate in the cemetery wall i realize that my plan to photograph the mourners at kates interment is impractical the turnout for burials is usually much smaller than that for funeral services but the faded green tent over kates open grave is surrounded by more than a hundred people i drive past the third gate in the wall pass a row of shacks on my left then turn right into the fourth gate which lets me drive up the back side of jewish hill the highest point in the cemetery jewish hill holds the remains of natchezs secondgeneration jewish settlers and it has the best view of the mississippi river anywhere in the nation i take my camera and walk past the stones of the rothstein and schwarz families then stop behind a wall in the cohen plot from here i can see the whole sweep of the ninetyacre cemetery this ground was consecrated in but some of the coffins were moved here from an even older graveyard where natchez settlers were buried in the early s kate townsends grave has been dug in an area near the bluff called the zurhellen addition it lies between the steep rise of jewish hill and the long row of majestic oak trees that borders the next section of graves to the south about forty yards in front of kates grave near the stone wall at the edge of the cemetery stands the most famous monument in this city of the dead the turning angel erected in to commemorate five girls who died in a fire this marble statue has become an object of both legend and ritual in natchez the lifesize angel stands on its pedestal in an attitude of purposeful repose writing names into the book of life the angel possesses a face of madonnalike serenity but its musculature and powerful wings make it appear almost masculine when you drive down cemetery road the angel appears to be looking directly at you yet once you pass the monument and look back over your shoulder the angel is still looking at you thus the appellation the turning angel for me the effect is much more dramatic at night and its probably caused by a trick of light as the beams of headlights create everchanging shadows on the monument in daylightfrom up closeyou can clearly see the angel standing with its back to the bluff and the river yet so famous is this legend that every natchez teenager at some point in his life drives or is driven down the dark stretch of road to watch the angel turn thus has legend spawned a rite of passage for all the children in the town the faded green tent at the center of the funeral crowd reads mcdonoughs funeral home and its been the centerpiece of almost every white funeral in town for as long as i can remember the crowd is pressing so close to the tent that i have no hope of photographing anyone my only hope is to walk down and join the throng a concrete staircase leads down jewish hill to the flat rectangle of the zurhellen addition as i walk down it i hear the chime of an acoustic guitar then a young male voice floats over the tops of the mourners heads cracking with grief but also communicating defiance its singing about unpredictability and fate and the brevity of youth i guess kate townsend was a green day fan very slowly i weave my way through the crowd nodding to those mourners who meet my eye i know most of the people here but some i dont as i near the tent the crowd becomes too thick for me to negotiate further thanks to my height though i can survey the gathering from here jenny townsend is sitting beneath the burial tent with her exhusband the englishman reverend herrick is performing the graveside service a much more traditional one than he gave in the school gymnasium there are other people beneath the tent but they dont interest me the people gathered around the tent do i see most of the st stephens school board with holden smith at their head jan chancellor is wearing a silk pants suit steve sayers stands in the front row to my right one eye swollen and purple not far down the line from him stands mia burke with her mother a paralegal for the citys largest law firm to my surprise mia is wearing a black dress and makeup with her dark hair pulled up in a bun she looks twentyfive she catches my eye and vouchsafes a demure smile coach wade anders is standing with his back to me but i recognize his head and shoulders even in a suit i have to do a doubletake to confirm that one of the women on the far side of the tent is ellen elliot but im right i guess ellen felt she needed to show the town that she mourns kate as much as anyone despite whatever her soontobeexhusband might have done to her as reverend herrick prays i turn my head and scan the gravestones on jewish hill then the mausoleums on the high ground above the superintendents office i have a feeling that someone else is here today but who cyrus white maybe marko bakic or could drew be here some part of me cant quite accept that drew will not see his paramour lowered into the ground how difficult would it be for him to slip out of the fence behind the city jail and make his way here prisoners with half his intelligence and strength have done it but i see no one hiding among the stones of course that doesnt mean theres no one there reverend herrick is reminiscing about kate as i look around the cemetery i recall many memories of this place sneaking into it as a twelveyearold with friends to ride madly through the dark lanes on our banana bikes walking through the stones in the heat of summer with a lovely girl then lying on the soft grass beneath a wall to explore each other meeting the love of my life on jewish hill in the dead of night twenty years after i lost her hoping to learn the secret truth of our lost lives excuse me a woman i dont know brushes past me the crowd is dispersing car engines start in the lanes and idle softly while figures in black recede from my vision i recede with them i see mia looking for me but i turn away and walk toward the concrete steps in the wake of some people who parked where they could avoid the long funeral cortege breaking away i climb to the top of jewish hill and turn back toward the river watching the last of the living depart kates gleaming casket lies suspended above her open grave soon all evidence that she lived will be buried forever jenny townsend still stands beside the tent alone with reverend herrick the minister reaches out and lays a comforting arm on her shoulder as they speak a lone figure appears from beneath the tent ellen elliott reverend herrick hesitates then moves away from the two women what can ellen be saying and how is jenny responding jenny knew about the affair between her daughter and drew for some time yet she didnt try to stop it nor did she inform ellen about it thank god ellen doesnt know any of that watching ellen offer her condolences i realize that shes adhering to a code of southern womanhood that demands precisely what she is doing now maintaining composure and grace through all trials however difficult the women do not embrace but they do shake hands then ellen walks toward the last two cars in the lane with quiet dignity you fucked up drew i say softly you couldnt see what you had of course ive never known ellen as a wife the gracious figure that gave her sympathy to jenny townsend is a far cry from the drugcrazed addict drew has probably faced more nights than i would have been able to endure conjuring that image its not hard to see how appealing kate townsend must have looked to him christ what do i really think about drew quentin avery is willing to believe that he committed brutal rape and murder but the mother of the victim is not of course jenny doesnt have all the facts of the case i do most of them anyway is there a dark corner of my heart where i admit that drew might have blown a gasket and murdered the teenager hed fallen in love with that he got her pregnant panicked and thenterrified of losing the family hed worked so hard to build and sustainerased her from the world no the boy i grew up with had he committed such a heinous act would have owned up to it and taken his punishment like a man as the archaic phrase goes that may be a quaint and sexist notion these days but some of what is best about the south is archaic the tragedy is that it should be so if drew didnt kill hersays a voice in my head then why didnt he call for help when he found kates body hes a doctor i say aloud he knew she was already dead all he would have accomplished by reporting the body was the destruction of his family but what if he didnt mean to kill her what if they were playing a sex game and it simply got out of hand he would have told me that i mutter he would have when you start talking to yourself in a graveyard its time to go home as i turn toward my car my cell phone vibrates in my pocket its caitlin calling from the newspaper i havent spoken to her since last night my phone showed a missed call from her when i woke up this morning but shed called from the paper and hadnt left a message so i didnt call her back she must be desperate to question me about all the murders but shes trying hard to preserve the illusion that she wont exploit our relationship in order to write a better story hey i answer looking down the hill toward jenny townsend and reverend herrick where are you caitlin asks the cemetery oh can you talk yeah go ahead ive got bad news and bad news no mention of last night just straight into our old banter give me the bad first the cops just located the spot where kate townsend died the actual crime scene where i ask almost afraid to hear the answer theyve been searching st catherines creek ever since they found kates cell phone about two hours ago they found human blood and hair on the edge of a wheel rim that was half buried in the sand they say its where the edge of the creek would have been on the day she was killed it was flooded apparently yes i think the rain slacked up about an hour before kate died the blood they found is the same type as kates theyre going to send it for a dna test of course but the hair is a perfect match my shoulders sag was this anywhere close to where they found kates cell phone about fifty yards away right between pinehaven and sherwood estates right between drews house and kates house and exactly where he told me he discovered her body if kate bled heavily there she probably died therewhich means she didnot die far upstream at brightside manor cyrus white suddenly looks a lot less guilty than he did thirty seconds ago and the chances that the police will tie drew to the actual murder scene with physical evidence just went up astronomically i know thats bad for drew caitlin says in a careful tone hell be okay who found the blood the sheriffs department or the police the police thank god for small favorshm the fbi is in town now though dea too theyre setting up a multijurisdictional task force in the old sears store at tracetown shopping center good so maybe all the evidence will be shared from now on i wouldnt assume that caitlin is silent she wants more information about drew but shes not going to push for it whats the other bad news i ask ten minutes ago mayor jones officially resigned hes no longer the mayor of natchez i close my eyes and reach behind me for somewhere to sit down jones issued his statement to me personally the wilson murders were the last straw this poor guy was trying to do chemotherapy and run the city at the same time it might have been possible during normal times but nowits sad really i cant quite get my mind around this a decision id thought i had at least a month to ponder will now have to be made within days and maybe within hours are you there penn here are you picking up annie today mias bringing her home oh a little coldness in the voice penn now that jones has stepped down theres going to be a special election in less than fortyfive days thats the law i know well youve made some oblique comments about pursuing that job yourself in the past month i know wellif youre going to run youll have to announce in a matter of days i know that too caitlin i hear her breathing slow and steady are you going to do that this isnt the time or place to reveal anything but i cant deceive her im not sure but right now im leaning in that direction more silence then she speaks in a falsely chipper voice if mias keeping annie after school lets try to get some early dinner we can spend some time with annie later at your house that sounds good good planet thailand ahno privacy how about the castle okay call me i will i put the phone back in my pocket then turn and sit on the brick wall behind me ive come to the proverbial fork in the road i began my adult life as a private practice lawyer then i became a prosecutor when i could tolerate that life no longer i started writing about it instead of living it that career has been good to me but has the time come to leave it behind and take up yet another profession or would i necessarily have to leave writing behind would running this city require every waking hour of my days and nights of course it would says my inner censor youre not talking about taking on a new job youre talking about a cause a mission a crusadetrying to save the town that bore you to lift it out of a paralysis caused by economic stagnation and persistent racism and no ones going to thank you for the effort youre going to pay a price and losing caitlin may be part of it and the biggest joke of all you could spend every ounce of time and energy you have and not make a bit of difference a slamming car door snaps me back to reality down in the zurhellen addition jenny townsend and reverend herrick are finally leaving its time for me to go too but something holds me here for the first time kate townsend and i are completely alone i wish she could speak to me if she could describe her last minutes a lot of peoples lives would be simplified and justice might actually be served but she cant speak and in her muteness she will become the center of a political storm that will be a trial only in name after a silent prayer for kate i jog down the hill to my car then pull onto cemetery road an overloaded log truck is rumbling toward me last week i might have tried to squeeze around it but after chief logans tale of drivers who drink beer in the cab all day i pull onto the grass beside the cemetery wall to let it pass the ground shudders as the big truck roars by me but after it does i pull back onto the road and head toward town on my right the mississippi river cuts inexorably through the continent rolling down toward baton rouge and new orleans like time incarnate as i clear the steep slope of jewish hill on my left the turning angel comes into sight the serene face watches my approach as though waiting only for me of course the angel only seems to be watching me i know its actually facing away from the road and the river nevertheless i drive slowly as i pass the monument trying absurdly to catch the angel in the act of turning i cant do it only when i pass and look back over my shoulder do i see the ageless visage staring after me again stepping on the brake i make a threepoint turn and pull alongside the cemetery wall the turning angel is trying to tell me something not with words perhaps but theres a message here what what is the message of the marble angel what you see isnt always the reality we look at one thing but see another why with a marble statue because of a change in perspective or a trick of light but with human beings the reasons are more complex people project only what they want others to see or at least they try to and even when unintended clues to the being behind the mask are exposed we often refuse to see them our perception of others is always distorted by our own prejudices hopes and fears and sometimes as quentin avery suggested we look at others and see ourselves appearance versus reality i say softly that sounds like the title of an essay i was forced to write in high school english class as i stare over the gravestones at the angels androgynous features several faces seem to project themselves onto the white stone slowly morphing from one into another like the faces in the classic sinéad oconnor video mia first the angel most resembles her with its oval face and madonnalike serenity yet as i stare mia somehow becomes drewnot drew as i know him now but as the beautiful boy he was when he scorched across the firmament at st stephens more than twenty years ago i blink my eyes and drew becomes ellen and then ellen kate until i lose my sense of balance though im sitting in my own car on terra firma throwing the saab into gear i spin onto cemetery road and race toward town but one glance in the rearview mirror tells me what i already know the turning angel is watching me go chapter caitlin and i are sitting in a small private dining room in the castle the finest restaurant in natchez the building is a restored carriage house behind dunleith the citys premier antebellum mansion one of more than eighty such mansions dunleith is a colossal greek revival palace that dwarfs even the mythic mansions from gone with the wind sited on forty pristine acres in the middle of the city dunleith functions as a highend bedandbreakfast while the castle named for two gothic outbuildings on the grounds exists to feed the guests and incidentally the people of the town caitlin and i didnt drive over together we met here she came from the newspaper office while i left annie with mia at my house we still havent spoken facetoface since she left my house last night i was surprised to find the main room of the restaurant crowded when we arrived so i asked the maîtred to seat us in the private dining room the owner of dunleith is a fan of my novels so my request was granted do you get that kind of treatment in new york caitlin asks with a smile not a chance theyd seat me by the bathroom we order crab cakes as an appetizer then set aside our menus and simply look at each other for a while just as they did last night her luminous green eyes exert a hypnotic effect on me set in her pale face framed by night black hair they seem almost independently alive small talk or big issues she asks i think we owe it to ourselves and annie to go ahead and deal with some things caitlin nods in agreement annie called me when she got out of school today she asked if id watch a movie with her tonight she told me you said yes ive missed her then why havent you called herwhy dont we lay some ground rules for this conversation caitlin looks puzzled absolute honesty i tell her no sugarcoating anything weve always been good at that have we i think so the waiter appears and pours two glasses of chilled white wine i wait for him to depart weve been together for five years now i reflect it seems unbelievable but we have it seems more like two i know its easy to let time slip past too easy i guess the question i want to ask you first is do you still want to spend the rest of your life with me she looks incredulous of course i do i cant imagine being with anyone else if thats true its hard for me to understand why youve been spending so much time away is it well youve basically been like a mother to annie for the past five yearswhen youre here at least but shes getting older now caitlin shes nine she needs more than youve been giving her and i honestly dont know if youre ready to give her more i see traces of moisture in caitlins eyes but she doesnt speak im not saying its your duty to give more i know you want to but theres a difference between wanting to do something and actually committing the time and effort to do it god i sound like my parents caitlin is watching me intently but still she doesnt speak i mean youre actually getting to the age where if you want to have kids of your own its time to get started she closes her eyes and a tear slides down her left cheek am i crazy i ask her tell me how do you feel about all this she opens her eyes then reaches across the table and takes my hand i love you penn and i love annie she looks as though shes about to continue but then she stops ive never known caitlin to be at a loss for words i know you love us i say softly but youre gone for very long periods i mean youre the publisher of the examiner but youre working as a reporter fifteen hundred miles away and not even for your fathers chain i dont understand it im not sure i do either i never really thought about it but maybe its because im not working for my father that i enjoy these assignments so much the waiter sets an exquisitely browned crab cake before her and another before me caitlin looks up at him thank you are you ready to order he asks we havent even glanced at the menus ill have the blackened catfish caitlin says withdrawing her hand from mine the duck i tell him very good anything special on the side surprise us caitlin says with a smile yes maam when the waiter leaves she says penn im taking these assignments because its what i love to do its the rush its where its happening its a big story and they want me and i like it that they want me i understand that need when i worked as a prosecutor even though i was in a big city only a few people really knew what i did what i was accomplishing but after i became an author i started getting feedback from hundreds of people then thousands that kind of affirmation is a powerful thing she nods as though im getting it but you won your pulitzer for a series of stories you wrote right here in natchez about events that happened right here i know during weeks like this one natchez is a great place to do what i do as cold as that may sound but fifty weeks out of the year its little league games and aldermen meetings that are mired in racial crap that got solved elsewhere twenty years ago the resentment in her voice is palpable i dont think thats true i reply race is a problem everywhere its just more in the open here lets dont even go there caitlin says with surprising irritation lets talk about annie you said no sugarcoating right right the schools here are atrocious penn the public schools i mean they have the lowest act scores in the nation and thirtyfive percent of their seniors dont even take the act actually the acts in washington dc are lower i correct her the only ones you want to guess why that is i know why caitlin taps the table to emphasize her points this is the most illiterate state in the union its number one in singlemother homes and natchez is number two in the state in those rankings forget the political implications of that what does it mean for annie i start to point out that annie doesnt attend a public schooland that she has a single father but caitlin pushes ahead before i can say anything st stephens does a decent job i know smart kids like mia and kate still go on to the ivy league but for most kids st stephens doesnt compare to whats available elsewhere like boston she shrugs sure boston or new york or even wilmington any major city you know that and im not talking about elite private schools here you pay through the nose to get an average education im talking about cities where the public school systems actually function where theres not racial segregation accomplished by high tuition and that would be where exactly she closes her eyes and sighs its not just the schools its extracurricular opportunities and what about diversity i mean kids here are either white or black theres no other major demographic group a couple of indian kids a few mexicans one or two asians you want to be honest i ask all right is annies education really your main concern here two pink moons appear high on caitlins cheeks im concerned about it yes but i have my own issues too ill admit i love this town penn but i also see what were missing by being here there are no real art galleries or museums no is that what you spend your time in boston doing going to museums and art galleries or are we really talking about restaurants and clubs thats not fair she says looking genuinely hurt but now that you bring it up there isnt even an olive garden or an applebys here for gods sake forget truly exotic cuisine theres one cineplex with four screens and i dont think theyve ever booked an art film shes right but that doesnt make me glad to hear it caitlin you talk about boston like its the best of everything beyond the reach of people here well drew elliott our murder defendant and smalltown doctor just passed the massachusetts state medical boards and he scored in the top five percent so dont act like youre coming down to hicksville usa to preach the gospel of urban enlightenment caitlin looks stunned shes realized that drew taking those boards means he was planning to move north with kate when she went to harvard but she doesnt comment on that drew is an exception she says and so are you am i you know you are youre not like the other people here not anymore anyway the irony is you can do your work here and still stay connected to the larger world but i cant to work at the highest level in my business i have to be in a city not boston necessarily but some major city penn the simple truth is that you dont have to give up what i would to live here fulltime at last we come to the truth youre right i admit i know that do you want me to give up my work theres a note of challenge in her voice no not when i think about it intellectually but if you ask me what i want in my heart i want you to be with us more all the time actually caitlin smiles but i see pain in her eyes i do too and thats the crux of our problem how so she lays her hands flat on the table and looks deep into my eyes i know youre seriously considering running for mayor penn if you do thatand you winyoull be tying us to this town for a minimum of four years tell me how you feel about that possibility she takes a slow sip of wine her eyes on the candle at the center of the table im afraid youre about to make this town your personal crusade you may disagreeyou may believe youre simply running for mayor but what that job really means is playing referee in a race conflict ive covered natchez for nearly five years every single vote by the board of aldermen is decided along racial lines every one and if shad johnson gets in theyll be decided on the black side regardless of whats right ethical or even legal but if i get in theyll be decided fairly dont kid yourself no good deed goes unpunished what makes you think you can get elected anyway youll have to get black votes to do it a lot of them ive given this a lot of thought i think my record in houston speaks for itself i convicted black murderers but i also convicted whites i put away a notorious white supremacist and i killed his brother myself when i got here i solved the murder of del payton i think theres gratitude in the black community for that i take a quick sip of wine and then theres my father caitlin smiles in spite of herself dads treated the black community in this town for forty yearsas equals with kindness and respect hes built up a lot of goodwill im my fathers son in most ways and i think the voters would see that finally the alternative to me is shad johnson i think enough black people in this town have recognized shads true nature to take a gamble on me what scares me caitlin murmurs is that i think youre right i think if you run youll probably be elected would that be such a disaster a soft sigh escapes her lips for the town or for us caitlin this city is at the watershed point of its history thats saying a lot when your history stretches back to the cotton economy is gone the oil is all but gone industry wont be coming back here until we fix the public school system that leaves tourism to make tourism work takes someone with vision someone who can unify whites and blacks to sell a history in which blacks wereslaves to whites thats a tall order but if someone doesnt do it this town will wither from twenty thousand souls to ten itll be another black shell surrounded by a white ring of suburban homes and it will cease to be a real community i dont want that to happen more than that i feel an obligation to try to stop it she reaches across the table and squeezes my hand i know you do you grew up here and you know what this town once was and what it can be again i say quietly natchez has become a place where we have to raise our children to live elsewhere our kids cant come back here and make a living and thats a tragedy a lot of people i went to school with would love to come back here to raise their kids they just cant afford to do it i want to change that caitlin picks at her crab cake with her fork what does your father think about this idea hes not convinced that saving the town is possible hes also said that the del payton case proved im a crusader at heart she smiles at some private thought youre a romantic penn its one thing ive always loved about you but sometimes she shakes her head again do you want to know what i see yes its going to shock you fire away i see a town that doesnt want to be saved black and white both but mostly black really absolutely when i came here five years ago i lectured you on white racism i laugh softly you sure did but now that ive seen the reality up close i understand white frustration black people here are just different not all of them but so many i dont know why maybe its because this was one of the biggest slaveholding cotton counties along the river i dont know i used to think it was ignorance but im starting to see it as willful ignorance and maybe worse their belligerence in public places their rudenesstheres almost a pride in ignorance here black employees refuse to wait on white customers in stores they treat incompetence as though its some kind of act of civil disobedience im sick of it penn and the black politiciansmy god ive watched black aldermen do patently illegal things and then brag about it they dont care whether something is legal or not white politicians abused the system for years caitlin they just did it in a more subtle way i know that but is that an excuse for blacks to repeat the abuses of the old system the system martin luther king and malcolm x died to dismantle no but we talked about the schools before you want to know the hard truth the public high school here is ninetyeight percent black its budget is five times higher than st stephens per studentyet it turns out the secondlowest act scores in the nation most st stephens graduates score well above the national average and nearly all of them go on to fouryear colleges the same is true of immaculate heart there are black students in both those schools very few and theyre the exceptions that prove the rule we talked about the singlemother statistics you want to guess what color the huge percentage of those mothers are caitlin listen i know i know youre going to give me your great analogy between africanamericans and the american indian well i dont want to hear it too much waters gone under the bridge im tired of hearing about slavery and reconstruction brown v board of education was almost fifty years ago penn whats wrong with this picture how obvious does it have to get before people admit the truth which is the system is broken and one of the reasons its broken down here is that its largely run by and for black people they simply do not place a high cultural value on education and im not going to pretend otherwise any longer i cant believe it like so many yankee transplants caitlin has had a dramatic change of heart on the issue of race but though ive seen it before i would never have expected it from her thats a pretty racist view caitlin im not a racist she asserts im a realist if i said those things id be labeled a racist does being from boston make it all right for you to espouse those views her fork jangles on her plate im not some spoiled dilettante okay thats what i was five years ago when i got here now i have a personal stake in this issue she takes my hand again and squeezes with urgency let them have this town penn they want their turn on top give it to them let shad johnson turn this beautiful little city into another fayette you cant stop it anyway not even if youre mayor maybe after they run it down to nothing theyll learn something about running things whats that that you have to give a damn you have to sacrifice you have to work this from the child of a multimillionaire her eyes flash with anger you think my father didnt work to build what he has you think i havent worked calm down of course he did but he did it in a different context he did it with certain advantages of law capital andfrankly the oldboy network caitlin shakes her head in exasperation as the waiter delivers our entrées her blackened catfish smokes on the plate and my duck looks perfectly seared the only problem is that im no longer hungry after the waiter leaves i say well at least i know where you stand now she puts her hands together as though praying dont do this penn let us have a life somewhere else someplace where this conflict doesnt have to be at the center of our daily lives i point at her plate are you going to eat she looks down at her catfish and grimaces i know you hate everything ive said if i were the person i was five years ago id be screaming invective at the person i am now to someone with no experience of this place i sound like a native redneck but theres no teacher like experience why dont we change the subject while we eat caitlin nods then lifts her fork and breaks off a piece of fish we can talk about anything but race politics or drews murder case i say her eyes flick up at my last words dont i warn her penn whats going on we worked together all through the del payton case i helped you with your investigation and you fed me parts of the story that was a different situation was it or was it just that in that case you could exploit me in return i hate to admit it but she might be right just tell me this she says is the possibility that you might run for mayor what kept you from representing drew i sigh heavily probably so a deep sadness fills her eyes youre becoming a politician already no a realist i was afraid you didnt represent him because you thought hed killed kate no good im glad she forks a small piece of catfish into her mouth the seasoning is perfect on this wow you cant get it like that in boston caitlin rolls her eyes what do you think about drew and kate i ask not the casetheir relationship she takes a long drink of wine i understand it they both got something they wantedmaybe even neededfrom the relationship what did drew get the adoration of a beautiful and brilliant young girl he got to break thomas wolfes rule and go home again and he got the possibility of a whole new life with a person a lot like himself thats probably a more powerful rush than heroin to a guy like drew caitlin smiles strangely can you imagine the ecstasy he must have felt making love to kate i mean thats like evolutionary nirvanayou know no i donti think as an image of mia flashes behind my eyes what did kate get out of it apart from the obvious the freudian thing you mean drew as father figure sure caitlin says laughing kates dad left the family when she was sixsomething she shares with mia burke by the way i dont think mia ever even knew her father no he left when mia was two all love is transactional by nature caitlin says chewing thoughtfully the boost to kates selfimage must have been enormous being wanted by drew didnt just make her feel lovedit made her feelworth being loved you cant overestimate the value of that to an adolescent girl and of course she got other benefits her intimacy with drew probably gave her a fiveyear jump on her classmates in realworld relationships it sounds like you dont really have a problem with what happened caitlin shrugs i know people get all bent out of shape about this kind of affair but what do they expect half the models we see in magazines are sixteen or seventeen years old ad agencies dress them up like twenty and thirtyyearolds but thats just costume the truth is no woman over twentythree can look like those models that kind of perfection is the province of late adolescence so we hold up these perfect little girls to the world as the zenith of desirability and what happens duh men desire them and women get depressed because they cant attain their perfection its pathetic it says so much about who we are as a society i finally take my first bite of duck the thing is caitlin goes on men like drewmen who are rich or famous or still handsome and charismaticthey can actually possess girls like that i give kate credit tooshe wasnt some bimbo who couldnt balance a checkbook she was accepted to harvard for gods sake but still she would have paid a price in the end even if she wasnt murdered and so would drew isnt there a price to be paid in every relationship she gives me a wry look point taken i didnt mean us but its true caitlin wags her finger at me no sugarcoating shes silent for a bit but i can tell shes thinking you know she says one thing you might bring up in drews defense is the fact that he had very little choice of partners what do you mean im talking about his affair with kate not the murder after the economic downturn here the middle class vanished there simply arent any single women between thirty and forty here not the kind drew would be interested in the bright women in this town of that age are married or divorced and if youre looking for brilliant ones forget it to start fresh he almost had to go with someone as young as kate because girls like that leave here at eighteen and never come back caitlin is right although her argument would probably offend every woman on the jury i mean she goes on who the hell would you be dating if i hadnt shown up here i dont even want to think about that i put down my fork and look into her eyes earlier you said that you couldnt imagine being with anyone else but me thats right areyou with anyone else when youre away i mean she looks at me with disbelief absolutely not id never do that to you she starts to take a sip of wine then stops with her glass poised in midair are you no not even close she watches me a little longer then drinks her wine after she swallows she takes a bite of stuffed potato and says mias in love with you by the way a lump of duck sticks in my throat what you havent realized that yet i saw it through your window in five minutes im not saying she knows what love is just that shethinks shes in love so for all practical purposes she is and i should do what about this caitlin looks up at me her eyes inscrutable be careful we were just discussing the lack of available partners drew is a handy object lesson jesus no evolutionary nirvana for you buster i take her hand and smile youreevolutionary nirvana for me she smiles with genuine pleasure i am ten years younger than you old man i laugh so loudly that the waiter sticks his head into the room i motion for him to leave us alone so are we sleeping together or not caitlin asks in a casual voice i miss it do you her voice drops in pitch but becomes richer somehow this is the longest ive gone without sex in years so anytime youre ready you let me know okay okay she gives me one of her feline smiles couldnt we declare détente and return to hostilities in the morning i reach out and take her hand finish your duck she says annies waiting for us and i dont want the movie to take all night two hours later im sitting in the glow of the flatpanel television in my home theater a converted guest room on the first floor annie has nestled between caitlin and me her eyes glued to the television as nemo swims brightly across the screen above annies head my fingers are threaded into the soft hair at the base of caitlins neck the last few minutes of our dinner at the castle seemed so natural they could have happened before any of our tensions came into being but despite the promise of sex in the air something seems wrong its been too long since caitlin and i made love i miss it at least as much as she and yetsomething is shortcircuiting the desire i should feel for her the pessimism in her dinner speech really hit me wrong and some of what she said actually offended me caitlin truly was a liberal when she arrived in natchez and she routinely chastised me for being too conservative but now it seems that her liberal convictions werent convictions at all but rather easy opinions based on the lectures of ivy league professors after a few years in the south shes ready to give up on racial harmony and flee to more enlightenedread homogenousenvirons as for my sexual desire thats been running in overdrive for weeks now like drew i have consciously turned away from many women willing to ease that tension opportunity is always present in a town like this where wives easily become bored with their limited routines every day those women present to the world a perfectly coiffed and manicured lady but inside theyre like captive panthers pacing their cages i havent yet sought solace there during caitlins absences but tonight with caitlin actually lying beside me in anticipation of sex i dont want solace here either its a predicament but my solution is simple and time testedthough never by me ill simply fall asleep i dont even think caitlin will mind that much shes checked her cell phone for text messages a half dozen times during the movie and no matter how understanding i want to be that irritates me but these are small issues my real dilemma is simple my choice a stark one love or duty a woman or a town chapter sonny crosss funeral is very different from those of kate townsend and chris vogel its held not in a church but downtown at mcdonoughs funeral home the benches reserved for the family are filled but there are several empty rows at the back of the funeral parlor many mourners in the pews are cops most of them in uniform sonnys flagdraped casket stands at the head of the center aisle and a picture of him as a much younger man stands on an easel to the right of it the service is conducted by the elderly baptist pastor of the second creek baptist church one of the most rural white churches in the county a strong klan area in the bad old days he preaches a sermon of anger not love venting righteous outrage at the loss of a man who gave his life so that the rest of us might live in peace i dont care for the pastors tone but i cant argue with his sentiments when he begins the eulogy i discover something i didnt know sonny cross served as an infantryman in vietnam and was decorated for battlefield gallantry i knew the man for four years but he never once mentioned this i never would have guessed it either he must have been drafted right out of high school as i ponder sonnys life and death it strikes me that whatever his prejudices he was one of the quiet heroes of this country he never made much money he rarely if ever got his picture in the paper he never asked for special recognition he simply worked hard to protect the ideals he was raised to believe in and in the end when called upon by fate he gave the last full measure of devotion when a plain woman with waistlength hair rises from the front pew and begins to sing amazing grace without accompaniment i realize there are tears in my eyes the singer is wearing a cotton dress that looks handsewn from a simplicity pattern as she sings about toils and snares i relive the moments when the asian face was illuminated in the window of the lexus when the holes appeared in the door below that face and then me turning and seeing sonny standing in his combat stance with his pistol returning fire in the face of an automatic weapon sonny cross was no movie actor with nothing to fear but a man of flesh and blood facing his last seconds on earth with remarkable courage that brave last stand was what sent the lexus fleeing down the road in retrospect it almost certainly saved my life and what did sonny cross say as he lay dying on the ground did he scream call an ambulance did he beg me not to let him die no he told me to check on his sons to make sure they hadnt been hit then he told me to make sure that the wife hed divorced knew that he was sorry that he was thinking of her at the end today those boys and that exwife sit in the wooden family box at the side of the funeral parlor their faces rigid with the stoic resignation of appalachian hill people only the youngest boy has the glitter of tears in his eyes theres a man in the box too elderly but big with the rawboned hands and red skin of a day laborer his face is a more weathered likeness of sonnys the father ill bet when the hymn is done the pastor motions for the pallbearers to come forward eight deputies rise as one and lift the casket from its bier sheriff billy byrd stands at their head his rigid jaw making plain that hes more than ready to deliver the righteous retribution that the pastor demanded during his service as the casket leaves the parlor by a side door i rise with the rest of the mourners and walk out into the sunlight unlike the city cemetery greenlawn memorial park has existed for only fifty years its a more conventional graveyard sited on rolling hills in the bluecollar area of morgantown road people of all denominations may be buried here so long as theyre white there are probably more baptist residents here than anything else originating from the staggering aggregation of baptist churches in the state it always struck me as telling that mississippi has the highest per capita number of churches in the nation but the lowest literacy rate yet somehow out of this strange marriage of extremes we produce some of the greatest artists in the world about thirty people have gathered around sonnys open grave family members cops an honor guard from camp shelby theres no pretense here the pastor quotes some scripture the honor guard fires its saluteseven rifles three shattering volleys then as the echoes fade a strange new sound floats across the hills bagpipes i turn toward the sound and squint standing on a hill about sixty yards away is a lone piper wearing a tartan kilt and a black beret again the tune is amazing grace but this time it carries a stark and lonely beauty that accomplishes what words and gunfire cannot it pierces our veil of denial and makes us one with the departed even as we find comfort in the sound when the piper finishes the honor guard folds the flag and delivers it to the mother of sonny crosss children she may be his exwife but no one is arguing legalities today true widowhood has little to do with the law the crowd breaks up swiftly and soon only the family is left by the grave the big redfaced man stands talking to sonnys widow hes wearing an illfitting suit almost certainly the only one he owns crosss sons stand a few yards away looking awkward and uncomfortable as they watch the cars in the lane drive away as i study them the oldest of the two seems to recognize me he lifts his hand in a little wave then walks toward me i meet him halfway and offer my hand you were there when my dad died he says thats right sonny i say they call me junior probably not after today i think youre going to be sonny from now on a look of utter seriousness takes possession of his face then slowly pride replaces it i know this is tough i tell him my wife died of cancer and she was a lot younger than your dad this gets the boys attention really yeah it takes a long time to get over something like this in some ways you never really do but it gets better the boy bites his lip and kicks at a stick on the ground if you guys need any help i want you to call me my name is penn cage ill be glad to help you out thats what your dad would have wanted okay has the sheriff asked after you boys is the department doing anything for your mother anger tightens little sonnys face the sheriffs a son of a bitch hes making out like my dad did something wrong not in public you know but with us he said my dad took things from work he wasnt supposed to take i swallow hard and try to hide my interest i dont think your dad respected the sheriff much when it came to police work sonny nods firmly thats why he worked alone so much he told me that my pulse quickens this elevenyearold knows much more than i would have expected sonny did you know i was working with your dad he nods again he told me it was up to me to finish the job to catch the guys he was trying to get do you understand yes sir i know the sheriff has probably asked you what im about to ask but im not the sheriff you know what i mean i think i do i figure your dad must have had a special place where he kept his work stuff the barest hint of a smile lights the boys eyes they been searching our place for two whole days but they didnt find anything nope i start to speak again but a deep voice overwhelms my own its the redfaced man from the funeral you boys get back to your mama he orders sonny and his brother instantly scamper toward their mother this man is obviously accustomed to being obeyed he walks toward me with a slow gait his blue eyes focused on mine i hold out my hand as he reaches me and he shakes it carefully like a man who knows he could hurt someone by simply closing his hand hello mr cage he says are you sonnys father thats right your daddy was my doctor back when i worked for triton battery im thankful for this ive yet to meet a former patient who doesnt have fond memories of my father i cant tell you how sorry i am about what happened to sonny mr cross takes a slow breath then lets out a deep sigh you were with him when he died they said that right yes sir i was did it really happen the way you told the sheriff yes sonny done his duty mr cross i never saw anything like it the big man grimaces then nods twice as though settling something in his own mind hes shown no more emotion than a man making sure his son finished cutting someones grass as promised but i sense that inside he is boiling with emotions that will never be outwardly expressed i saw you talking to sonny junior he says he was saying that his father didnt like the sheriff much mr cross pokes at the dirt with his booted foot billy byrds a showboat he cares more about newspaper headlines than he does about enforcing the law thats one way to be i reckon its not my way sonnys neither i think youre right sonny told me you was working with him thats right he said you put a lot of bad outlaws away in texas i did my best and now you write books yes sir the big man sniffs but asks no more questions mr cross as sonny lay dying in his driveway he asked me to finish the job for him i mean to do that if i can go on i think sonny kept a lot hidden from sheriff byrd i think he did that because he knew the sheriff was likely to damage his investigations but if im going to do what sonny asked me to do i need whatever evidence he had now i know there were some surveillance videotapes and i imagine he had notebooks still photographs and maybe even a computer im also sure that sheriff byrd has been pressing you about this i just want you to know the sheriff is no friend of mine in fact to be frank i consider him an enemy mr cross stares at me in silence for some time then he says you know where i live no sir way out kingston road almost where you turn to cut through to liberty road i got thirty acres out there i wait for him to continue were having some family out there some food some whiskey you know the drill you ought to ride out there now its up to you but sonny spent quite a bit of time out there of an evening id take the boys fishing or riding the fourwheeler and hed work might be worth your time to ride out my heart thumps in my chest ill do that just past second creek baptist church mailbox has a wroughtiron bronco on it you cant miss it ill be there the bucking bronco mailbox marks a dirt driveway that leads back into the thick woods that border kingston road on the way in i pass two ponds and a baseball backstop then i see several pickup trucks parked before a simple frame house i hate to interrupt a family gathering after a funeral but mr cross did invite me to come thankfully as i park my saab behind a massive dodge truck the big man opens a screen door and lumbers out to meet me have any trouble finding it no it was just like you said mr cross changes direction and walks toward a green ford pickup lets take a little ride my knees are too bad to do much walking these days i walk around his pickup and climb into the passenger seat mr cross drives onto the lawn and circles behind his house the backyard looks about as i expected theres a kubota tractor under a tin shed with some fig trees growing beside it a glitterpainted bass boat on a trailer half covered by a blue tarp and plastic hummingbird feeders hanging from almost every tree mr cross steers the truck into a couple of ruts and begins climbing a grassy hill he obviously doesnt feel talkative so i say nothing as we crest the hill i spy a stand of trees beside yet another pond descending toward it i make out a small camper trailer parked under the trees sonny liked it out here mr cross says i bought this place after triton downsized me in eightysix cost me my severance pay and all my stock options but it was worth it he pulls the truck up beside the trailer but leaves the engine running this is where sonny did most of his work is there electricity down here yes indeed put it in myself theres a satellite dish on the south side of the trailer sonny had to have that damn internet out here youd know more about that than i would the trailer looks like it should be sold for scrap but maybe its nicer on the inside i need to get back to the folks says mr cross you take as long as you need is it locked never has been no need out here protected by smith and wesson of course what if i find something i need take it take anything you want this was sonnys business and now its yours i reckon i ought to give this stuff to the sheriff but i just dont believe hed do the right thing with it youre welcome to come and go as you please just honk your horn as you pass the house driving down here mr cross offers me his hand good luck to you mr cage and keep your eyes open for those bastards who shot sonny i will i shake the giant hand then climb out of the truck mr cross immediately drives away leaving me in the shadow of the trailer its an ugly thing the kind of rig you tow behind a pickup truck it was probably built to sleep two people but theres only one way to know the trailers door has almost no weight i pull it open and step up into the unit i expected a bad smell but a little mildew is the only odor that greets me the interior of the trailer is a remarkable sight the campers beds have been converted into worktables a metal filing cabinet stands against one wall and a computer glows on a formica countertop that apparently served as sonnys desk the yellow kitchen cabinets have had their doors removed and now function as bookshelves most of the books are criminal justice texts but there are a couple of looseleaf binders on the right side of the bottom shelf two cameras rest on the top shelf a digital still camera with a telephoto lens and a small sony video camera when i check the drawers in the kitchenette i catch my breath rows of minidv tapes line the drawer bottoms and they seem to be organized by date surveillance tapes i can hardly contain myself probably the best thing to do is pack the tapes the computer and the binders into my car and take them home to study if i stay here i risk mr cross changing his mind or some other family member challenging my presence ive seen enough families fight over property after a death to spend more time here than necessary two steps out of the trailer my cell phone rings its caitlin i almost dont answer i dont want to lie about being here but caitlin wouldnt be calling if it wasnt important hey i answer steel yourself penn my first thought is annie then my fathers weak coronary vessels tell me the grand jury just indicted drew for capital murder theres a roaring in my ears that sounds like breaking surf its only blood of course pumping under the enormous pressure generated by my clenching heart why the intense reaction i knew this was coming and ive heard much more devastating news in my life verdicts rendered in death penalty cases my father telling me that my wife died during the night yet somehow i sense that this indictment will set in motion unprecedented pain and suffering why i dont know maybe because shad is trying drew for the wrong reasons or maybe penn are you there yes you sound out of breath what are you doing that took me by surprise i didnt think it would happen this soon me either where are you i close my eyes caitlin cannot know about the trailer or sonnys private stash of evidence talking to the cross family im going home soon though she says nothing she senses something wrong but she hasnt enough facts to work out what it is penn dont worry babe well talk later when we have some time i need to finish with these people now okay but call me back i will i pocket my phone and start jogging up the hill toward my car i need to pack sonnys things and stash them in my floor safe as soon as possible then i need to talk to quentin avery chapter for the first time since i met quentin avery his face is taut with anxiety the lawyer is sitting across from me in the main room of his penthouse suite at the eola his artificial foot resting on the floor the bare stump of his lower leg crossed over his left knee this is fast quentin ruminates really fast you say shad handcarried the indictment over to the circuit clerk thats what caitlin told me i spoke to caitlin by phone again on my way from my house to the eola and she filled me in on the most recent developments of the case there are two circuit judges in this town the system ensures randomness by simple rotation assigning each judge every other case thats filed the problem is every lawyer in town knows that if a lawyer wants a particular judge for a case he carries three cases to the clerks office the first case he files is a stalking horse if that case is assigned to the judge he doesnt want the lawyer immediately files the case he wants to steer and it goes to the judge he does want but if the stalking horse goes to the judge that the lawyer does want he has to file all three cases to steer the one he cares about to the right judge the true bills returned by a grand jury are normally filed as a group quentin says but thats more a matter of convenience than anything if shad carried drews indictment over personally he carried two other cases with him you can bet your good foot that hes already steered drews case to judge arthel minor then you can bet your ass that arthel will schedule drews case in the docket for the current term the only question is how soon will it be four weeks or less i reckon and now that mayor jones has stepped down i look for it sooner rather than later any sooner than two weeks says quentin and even the man in the street will know drews trial has nothing to do with justice im not sure shads worried about that you said it yourself his concern is the special election that means making good on his promise to make the system equal ie to nail a rich white man thats what will get shad a unified black vote i expect judge minor to move as fast as legally possible quentin nods slowly why is the white sheriff lined up with shad and judge minor did shad promise him the black vote in the next election i dont think shad can guarantee that im not sure what billy byrd hopes to get out of this but its something you can bank on that we should try to find out it might give us an advantage i will when will we know about the trial date caitlin has reporters at the circuit clerks office and judge minors chambers if arthel sets a trial date today well know about it a trace of a smile touches quentins lips kind of handy having the publisher of the newspaper on your side isnt it its a twoedged sword he nods thoughtfully what the hell is shad thinking i know he has a hardon to indict dr elliott but its not enough for him to want it bad something happened today that persuaded the grand jury to indict the dna must be back i conclude thats the only explanation quentins eyes narrow and then he nods slowly if you pay a hefty rush fee a private lab with a good sample can do the analysis in seventytwo hours youre right would shad pay for that hell yes and the timing just works thats it then says quentin one of the samples matched dr elliott and that convinced the grand jury to indict i think theres more if shad paid a private lab for a rush job he would have had both samples analyzed the vaginal and the rectal i close my eyes and try not to focus on any particular line of reasoning that means hes got the data on our mystery man as well the vaginal sample what could shad learn from that quentin asks they couldnt id that sperm without someone to compare it to do you think it matched the sayers boy or the fishermen maybe a small epiphany sends a tingle along my forearms i open my eyes no what shad could learn from that second semen sample is that our mystery man wasnt black ergo that semen was not deposited by cyrus white son of a bitch quentin breathes son of a bitch there goes your reasonable doubt i take a sip of coffee from the room service tray on the table between us quentin closes his eyes and rubs the stump of his ankle maybebut maybe not quentin yesterday you told me dna was subtle science i know juries can get bored with technical testimony but if im right this science is pretty simple and compelling a black man didnt rape kate townsend thats a message that black jury members will love to hear and the location of the crime scene away from brightside manor already screwed your chance to paint a scenario in which kate was murdered there by cyrus goddamn it quentin mutters what do we have that links kate townsend to cyrus i can testify that sonny cross told me he saw her visit cyrus at brightside manor while he was conducting surveillance operations thats hearsay unless you have videotape we may have the actual surveillance tape in our possession but im not sure yet i havent had time to go through the tapes thats your first priority do we have anything else an image of kates journal rises in my mind but im still not prepared to reveal its existence not at this time i stand and walk over to the window given what weve deduced here does the second semen sample still look like reasonable doubt to you shads case is still circumstantial quentin says firmly even dr elliotts semen in the girls rectum doesnt place him at the crime scene but his car parked in that vacant lot damn near does shads case may be circumstantial but it just might be strong enough for a conviction i would have gone to court with it in houston quentin takes a sip of coffee and makes a face there are only two possibilities for disaster one the police find physical evidence that links dr elliott to the crime scene two they find out that dr elliott had the victim scoring dope for his wife which brings up an even thornier question do you plan to put drew on the stand quentin closes his eyes like a man experiencing deep internal pain if they tie him to that crime scene and he hasnt admitted that he was there the jury wont believe a thing he says after that thats a chance im going to have to take says quentin im not putting him on the stand to tell the jury he found that girl dead and didnt report it to anybody have you discussed this with drew we havent gotten that far ill bet you any amount of money that drew will demand to tell the jury his side of the story quentin goes absolutely still tell me hes not that stupid if hes innocent thats what hell do if the police somehow tie him to the murder scene shad will have to let us know that before the trial he has to according to the rules of discovery if that happens ill still have time to put drew on the stand and let him tell his story at least thats a margin of safety is it you said yourself that shad would break the rules if he withholds evidence its grounds for a mistrial i mull this over youre forgetting that sheriff byrd is on shads side what if byrd were to pretend that his men found such evidence during the trial and you hadnt admitted drew was at the scene youd be screwed quentin youre going to have to tell the truth drew is an innocent man whose adultery made him too afraid to report a murder youve got to admit he was at the scene from the start quentin gives me a hard look thats not the road i want to take your client may not give you any choice the lawyer laughs bitterly nowi see why you brought me into this case you know what a knucklehead your friend is im about to bring up another problem when my cell phone rings its caitlin whats up judge minor just set the trial date she says next wednesday my blood pressure plummets did he make any official statement to the media no i got this from a guy in the circuit clerks office did you have to flirt to get it a little she laughs this is bad for drew isnt it not necessarily call me if you get anything else i hang up and set my phone on the coffee table quentin watches me expectantly next wednesday his mouth falls open youre shitting me wednesday baby ill give shad credit that little son of a bitch plays hardball im afraid weve got another problem as soon as drew was indicted by the grand jury that put him into the state system that means he has to be transferred from police custody to the sheriffs department the county jail my guess is sheriff byrd will move him today he hasnt yet because chief logan promised to warn me about any problems but we need to warn drew worstcase scenario quentin says billy byrd locks drew into an interrogation room without either of us there and sweats him under the lights drew doesnt strike me as the type who would crack under that kind of pressure he wont crack but his desire to explain his innocence might cause him to make statements against his interest quentin shakes his head do you really think hed talk to the sheriff at this point without me present in a word yes goddamn it quentin reaches down and begins strapping on his artificial foot i thought doctors were supposed to save lives not put you in an early grave i appreciate you doing this quentin the old lawyer looks up at me his eyes curious tell me this now that doug jones has stepped down are you going to announce for mayor i cant help but laugh my significant other is not in favor of the idea quentin finishes with the limb and sits up who wears the pants in your family man that depends on the issue well no matter what you do shad has to wait until the end of the trial to announce thats why hes rushing this circus and why ive got less than a week to prepare for trial yep quentin grins aint politics something do you still feel the same about cyrus white what do you mean you want me not to find him quentin folds his arms and fixes his eyes on me with unsettling intensity do you really think drew is innocent i do then ill tell you what i want he picks up his car keys and jabs them at me i want you to find me that girls killer fast chapter at just after pm i reenter quentins suite this time with mia and a male friend of hers in tow quentin and doris are sleeping in a smaller room down the hall so that this one can be used for business at all hours caitlin is spending the night at my house with annie i feel guilty about asking her but it was the only way i could free mia to work with me and also be sure that caitlin wouldnt discover what we were doing mias friend is a high school sophomore who dresses like a new york investment banker the only openly gay student at st stephens lucien morse is as slender as a sword and has short glistening black hair i met him only ten minutes ago but i know one thing alreadyhis eyes dont remain still for longer than three seconds lucien is here to hack kate townsends usb flash drives id planned to overnight the drives to a computer security firm in houston but when mia heard me making the arrangements she told me i could save at least a day by having a friend of hers hack them i was skeptical at first but she assured me that this particular tenthgrader was capable of doing the job mias price for arranging this service that she be allowed to see whats on the drives after theyre hacked desperate to see the contents as quickly as possible i agreed computer hackers arent thick on the ground in natchez mississippi lucien morse isnt short on confidence when i opened my leather portfolio downstairs and showed him what i had he rolled his eyes and asked me where the nearest computer was now that were in the suite i point to the dell that one of quentins young lawyers installed here yesterday lucien walks to the machine and plugs one of the flash drives into a usb port the thing about these little wankers he says is that the security isnt fundamental its basically obfuscation i ought to have it open in less than five minutes remember i tell him the second you break in you get up from the monitor and walk away you dont look at the files even if a fullscreen picture pops up you shut your eyes and walk away touchy touchy your payment is dependent on that condition five hundred dollars lucien says rapidly tapping at the keyboard right five hundred easy money i set my portfolio on the coffee table it still contains kates private journal and marko bakics flash drive my plan is to have mia try to put a time line to the list of men and boys in kates hookups lists but only after lucien leaves can we order tea or something mia asks order whatever you want drews paying for it she picks up the hotel phone and dials room service she starts to order then stops in midsentence and pulls her cell phone from her jeans pocket it must have vibrated she asks the room service clerk to hold on then checks a text message her mouth opens in surprise what i ask she puts her finger to her lips then she pulls me into the next room no arguing in front of the children lucien calls mia holds up her phone and shows me the blue lcd screen it readsrave nite square tracetown movie theater heard marko coming with kas from ole miss and killer dj from memphis leaving now with stacey whats square thats where the first clue will be i recall sonnys description of the complicated security precautions that precede a rave kids are prompted by various riddles or poems to drive from place to place until theyre sure no one is following them then theyre told the location of the drug party what do you think mia asks her eyes sparkling you want to go i glance back toward the other room but what i see in my mind is the lcd screen heard marko coming yes i want to go mia grins yeah what about lucien he sleeps at school not at home for five hundred bucks hell come back later i heard that lucien croons well i ask walking back into the main room of the suite can you come back later lucien slaps the enter key then stands and steps away from the keyboard no need jobs done youre kidding he smiles revealing small white teeth i dont kid about work i gave you two drives that was the second one view them at your leisure no password no problems and yes i take cash i take out my wallet and remove five onehundreddollar bills id like you to look at one other drive lucien no problem itll cost extra though i pay for results i open the portfolio on the coffee table and remove the flash drive i stole from markos garage apartment this ones a sony not a lexar but lucien seems unconcerned we really need to go mia says whats the hurry asks lucien i give mia a pointed look this is important lucien takes the drive and slides it into the usb port mia stands on tiptoe and whispers in my ear the clue wont be there long if were late well miss the party and marko we really need this and luciens fast not this time he says theres a separate encryption program hiding whatevers on this drive it looks like militarygrade stuff where did you get this i should have known marko would take precautions what did paul tell me in sarajevo marko became the consummate survivor you dont need to know that can you hack it or not maybe how long maybe an hour maybe a year if i took it home you cant take it home then i guess ill see what i can do well be back in a couple of hours can i order room service lucien asks with a smile i missed supper get whatever you want the smile turns beatific i hope they have a wine list riding north on highway in the passenger seat of mias honda accord im scrunched underneath a st stephens letter blanket that mia pulled from her trunkto facilitate my being shady as she calls it for the past fortyfive minutes ive been living a scene out of a screwball comedy from the s updated with touches from s carchase movies after mia read the doggerel verse taped to the ticket window of the old theater we joined a convoy of jackedup pickup trucks handeddown family sedans and highend foreign sports coupes these vehicles charged from place to place to find and unravel successive clues dodging in and out of traffic and smashing beer bottles against road signs my heart nearly stopped when i saw one high school boy leap from the bed of one pickup truck to another at seventy miles per hour dave matthews is playing softly on mias cd player she drives with one hand while the other sends and receives text messages on her cell phone in an olympiccaliber display of manual dexterity using the led penlight on my key ring ive been reviewing kates hookups lists in her journal and asking mia to give me a time line on the names mia has laughed at some names and dropped her jaw at others one made her curse and tense in her seat the story behind this was simple enough kate stole my boyfriend in ninth grade she told me chris anthony it was just after she got back from england it wouldnt have been so bad but she did it behind my back they saw each other for like six weeks before someone told me when i confronted kate she wouldnt even discuss it she acted like i was a total loser beneath her notice i know that sounds trivial but it hurt we didnt speak for over a year is that the root of your competitiveness i asked mia kept her eyes doggedly on the road part of it i guess doesnt matter now does it mia knew almost every name on kates hookups lists and the picture that emerged from her time analysis was that kate had been promiscuous during junior high and the early part of high schoolbefore she began having intercoursebut beginning in the summer before the eleventh grade shed dated steve sayers exclusively two of the names mia didnt know had notations beside them indicating they had occurred while kate was living in england only two names seemed remotely worth checking out as people kate might have cheated on drew to see and thereby become the object of jealousy that led to murder mia got her shocks from kates rejected and rejected by lists the fact that kate had tried to seduce a girl named laurel goodrich made mia gasp the adults on kates list didnt surprise her though she agreed with kates assessment of mr dawson the religion teacher as a perv the rejected dr davenport turned out to be a psychologist who had commuted to natchez for part of one year the dr lewis who had apparently rebuffed kates advances was her longtime psychiatrist who practiced in new orleans mr marbury was a gymnastics coach who had worked with the cheerleaders for two summers mia seemed quite happy that hed refused kates attentions when i read wade anderss name from the list mia wrinkled her brow and turned to me kate says coach anders came on to her not the other way around well hes under the rejected column huh what do you think about coach anders wades okay hes never hit on me he told me a lot of girls have come on to him in his office mia nodded some girls think hes hotor they did before he gained that weight anyway she laughed softly he did say something about my butt once what no way come on godshe bowed her head as though mortified he said i had a ghetto bootie i grabbed the wheel to keep us on the road meaning you knowa butt like a black chick i laughed at mias expression of mixed embarrassment and amusement doyou have one you tell me yeah you kind of do she burst out laughing it is a good one though ill admit that it better be she said i work on it enough now that weve covered the hookups lists im reviewing the other entries in the journal looking for things mia might be able to clarify her cell phone has chirped a hundred times with text messages but this time when she checks the phone she pumps her hand in triumph got it what the last square the party where is it oakfield i cant believe it i figured the rave would happen in the middle of nowhere oakfield is an eightyacre antebellum estate north of town the site of one of the most beautiful italianate mansions in the natchez area thats a threemilliondollar house mia glances at me is it easily janie moffitts grandparents own it theyre out of town how many kids do you think will be there i figure ive already seen forty to fifty en route to the party there were a couple of hundred at the lake party and with the terrible stuff thats been happening i have a feeling everybody will come to this one x gives you that sense of total empathy you know oneness with everybody i think thats what everyones looking for right now some way to share what theyre feeling if i werent here would you take ecstasy tonight mia glances over at me i might take some anyway the convoy turns left on airport road which leads into the northwest part of the county when i was in high school we held a lot of informal parties under a tinroofed pavilion near the airport there was little danger of discovery since the natchez airport didnt have commercial service and still doesnt but oakfield is truly high cotton in california the estate would cost forty million dollars the convoy slows then turns onto the narrow lane that leads to the mansion get down mia says i see the gate the accord slows to a stop then creeps forward from my nearly fetal position i spy the head of a lion mounted on a tall stone gatepost mia jerks the blanket over my head and shoves me toward the floor with surprising strength miayells a male voice sup youre up jamie you all by yourself as always its a crime man do i get in hell yeah i want to dance with you be careful though its wild down there mia starts to drive off but jamie calls hold up she skids to a stop on gravel i almost forgot jamie says giggling dont forget this it sounds as though something is changing hands at the window thanks dad mia says and then she drives on what was that i ask she shoves something under the blanket there you go baby i click on my penlight and see a yellowandwhite pacifier in her hand from my years in houston i know the significance of the pacifier mdmaor xmakes abusers grind their teeth ravers use pacifiers to prevent sore jaws the morning after and also to prevent damage to their teeth wowmia says almost reverently what is it look outside but be careful i raise my head above the door frame the rolling hills of oakfield are flickering under multicolored spotlights tents of various sizes have been set up around the estate and pounding techno rock rolls down from the mansion atop the hill on our left sixty yards ahead a huge crowd of teenagers dances in front of a lighted stage pickup trucks and fourwheelers race over the hills in all directions ramping into the air while kids in the beds behind scream and laugh is this how these things usually go i ask raucous male laughter followed by a female screech pierces my right ear as i turn three naked girls sprint toward mias car chased by two shirtless boys in blue jeans one of the boys is spraying beer at the girls from a large bottle while the other shoots at them with a batterypowered water gun the first girl slams headlong into mias right fender then spins and darts across her headlight beams into the darkness on the other side of the road a second girl follows but the third falls laughing to the ground the two boys fall beside or on top of her no mia says softly this is not the usual thing she starts forward again bringing us closer to the dancing throng what do you want me to do i want to talk to marko will the kids freak out if i get out and walk around this party they wont freak but itll get around that theres somebody old here theyll probably ask you to leave park in the dark then but put me where i can see the main action she turns off the long driveway into a pit of blackness on the left the accord bumps up and down then stops you want me to hunt for marko she asks if youre up for it what if i find him do i just tell him you want to talk to him actually i havent thought that far aheadi dont know does he know you he knows me but if you can get him over this way without letting him know whats up that would be good mia studies me in the dashboard lights you mean pretend that i want to hook up with him if thats not too scary i guess so ill take over as soon as i see you you could ring my cell to give me a headsup one ring and ill see your id okay she says finally but i wouldnt get my hopes up nobodys seen marko for two days she reaches for her door handle i take her right wrist and squeeze it thanks mia no problem she says but shes not smiling and then she is gone someone is knocking on my door i grab for the browning in my jacket pocket trying to remember where i am are you going to shoot me mia asks sliding into the drivers seat the smell of alcohol wafts through the car you fell asleep didnt you i guess so sorry i didnt tell her i was carrying a gun tonight but she did give my coat a second look back at the hotel its close to seventy degrees outside what about marko i couldnt find him has anyone seen him a lot of people saw him earlier he was apparently up onstage with the dj dancing and talking to the crowd he dedicated a song to kate and chris but nobody knows where he is no he might be in one of the tents but im not going in there for you why not im just not whats going on inside them drugs what mia gives me a hard look the kind of sex im not into probably i wasnt asking you to go i just wanted to know she leans back in her seat and closes her eyes she sounds a little out of breath did you take any ecstasy i ask no i was kidding before i dont do drugs i had a couple of vodka shots just talking to people whats the general state of the crowd up by the stage its mellow everybodys hugging and holding hands out on the edges its out of control the rednecks in the trucks are doing crystal meth i saw a fight down by one of the ponds some of the girls are really drunk incomprehensible thats who winds up in the tents i roll down my window to let the breeze blow across my face do anybodys parents have any idea whats going on out here i dont think so but they might by next week i saw flashbulbs going off in one tent you get naked out here youll wind up on the internet for sure shit mia leans forward and pulls her hair into a ponytail then puts an elastic band around it what do you want to do now lets get back to the hotel and see whats on kates flash drives were not doing drew any good out here she nods and starts the car hang on i tell her opening my door where are you going its a long ride back oh dont wander off i walk a few yards down the hill away from the car as i unzip my pants a truck rolls slowly up the drive to escape its beams i walk farther down the hill toward a tall oak with low spreading branches after the trucks headlights sweep past i open my fly and begin urinating im nearly done when a strangely musical voice seems to fall from the sky my little bird likes what she sees i jump backward and nearly piss on my leg highpitched laughter echoes through the dark whos there i ask anxiously up here says the voice i look up lying in the bow of a horizontal oak limb is a shirtless teenager who looks a lot like marko bakic seated beside him her bare legs hanging down in the air is a girl who looks no older than fifteen alicia reynolds shes shirtless too her breasts barely covered by a pushup bra the white ring of a pacifier dangles from her puckered mouth you can finish she says giggling around the pacifier ive already seen it anyway the shirtless boy grins like the cheshire cat mr cage right the east european accent is unmistakable its marko all right i take a step forward and look up at him hello marko what brings you out here tonight man you looking to get high i came to see you actually the smile doesnt waver yeah how can he just stop peeing like that asks the girl i couldnt do that go get yourself another drink marko tells her never taking his eyes off me i dont want another drink get lost then you can take this with you he passes something small to her pills no doubt the rest of you go with her okay as though materializing out of thin air three more young men drop to the ground from other limbs and start walking up to the road alicia goes with them the back of one boys tshirt reads ka ole miss after they disappear marko swings down from his perch hes about an inch taller than i with lanky muscular arms and a scrawny chest his mouth is smiling but it seems separated from his eyes somehow which are watching me like the eyes of an animal uncertain whether to fight or flee maybe its the drugsi think what can i do for you mr cage do you know about the wilsons the smile disappears sure terrible yeah were you home when the killers got there markos eyes narrow no way id have killed them right back i found the bodies i read that in the newspaper i watch him for a while without speaking the silence doesnt seem to make him nervous its making me nervous why are you carrying a gun he asks you scared i guess in sarajevo you learn to spot weapons pretty quick things are a little crazy in town just now i like to know i have options this earns a smile optionsi like that i like options too who killed the wilsons marko who tried to hit you he shrugs who knows man americas a crazy country markos accent combined with his lanky physique makes me think of goran ivanisevic the croatian tennis star marko is actually handsomer than ivanisevic but not quite as wholesome looking listen marko i say in a friendly voice im not here to try to hurt you in fact if you let me i can almost certainly help you i know youve opened up some new drug markets with the white fraternities at ole miss and lsu some other places too but now that youve done that youre expendable cyrus seems to think so honesty a good startwas it cyrus who hit the wilsons dont know man or was it the asians all the levity leaves markos face you know a lot mr cage maybe too much yeah im not the only one who knows this stuff low down on markos belly is a mass of white scar tissue shot through with purple wade anders told me marko had been bayoneted as a child marko sniffs like a fox and looks up toward the road that cop with the mullet knew it look what happened to him i saw the asians kill him maybe the asians think im expendable too eh if they do im dead if i went back to croatia i might get away from them but i dont want to go back are you coming back to st stephens cant do it dont you want to graduate tiny points of light dance in his eyes i want to live more how can you stay in the us if you dont graduate and go to college he shrugs i can live anywhere ill just become someone else is that how you want to spend your life as someone else might be nice for a while i hold out empty hands and step closer to him were no more than five feet apart i dont care about the drugs marko im here because i want to save my friend you know who im talking about the doctor the guy who raped kate why do you say that marko shrugs again thats what everybody says the doctor raped her and then he killed her drew wouldnt do that he was in love with her this seems to amuse marko men kill women they love all the time no and vice versa what you call it here crime of passion yes but thats not what happened to kate no he looks confused what happened to her then im trying to find out i think somebody else raped and killed her someone who might not even have meant to kill her he might only have been trying to keep her quiet that happens a lot why are you telling me this before he died sonny cross told me you thought cyrus had murdered kate marko scowls i told that kopile whatever would get his gun out of my mouth he was bad news man i feel my hope deflating you lied to cross some lies some truth did you lie about cyrus being obsessed with kate ha no way that nigger wanted that girl bad marko says nigger with such an unfamiliar pronunciation that i almost misunderstand the word how do you know that every time i saw him he wanted to know every little thing about her he tracked her cell phone all he thought about was her coming to get those pills it made him forget every other chick you know hed wait the whole fucking month to see her he thought she was some kind of goddess and you didnt you want to use the lorcet to get into kates pants sure he laughs why not kate was hot no doubt about it no goddess though no woman is a goddess they shit and fart just like we do even the pretty ones and they all want the same thing whats that same thing a man wants money and power and a little sexmaybe he laughs again if sex gets them more money and power now that im facetoface with marko i wonder if he can really help me at all do you know where cyrus is now hiding out like me what does cyrus have to be afraid of marko bares his teeth the yellow men do you think hes close by he cant be too far you cant leave this business very long somebody else come along and take it from you did you ever sleep with kate i dont sleep much a smirk did you fuck her his teeth show again now youre into what i like i can see how kate might be drawn to marko bakic hes the ultimate bad boy she already had drew the ultimate good guy but maybe she felt the need to privately balance the scales maybe marko was the answer to that craving so did you screw kate marko shakes his head never got the chance will you put your money where your mouth is what you mean will you give me a hair off your head one hair instant suspicion what for a dna test you know what that is sure i watch tv if your dna doesnt match the sperm that was found inside kate then a lot of your problems with the law will vanish the cops think i killed kate the possibility has been raised i lie i was with coach anders man you tell them i got enough problems without this bullshit one hair from your head would solve this particular problem if youre innocent what do you have to lose marko shakes his head you just want to save your friend you can make a test say anything you want i didnt expect him to give me the hair theres no upside for him i just wanted to read his reaction hes watching me with what looks like curiosity then suddenly he steps forward sending my hand into my pocket markos pistol is out before i even touch mine its barrel pointed straight at my chest fear turns my bowels liquid carefulhe says stepping closer then he pulls at his dark hair with his free hand and holds something out to me there you go get the police off my back okay at least on that shit i take the hair and squeeze it tight in my fist now maybe you better go home mr cage maybe youre right he puts his gun away i think this is the last time were going to see each other thank you for talking for me at the school board meeting a while back that was a big help no problem i say wishing id joined the campaign to have him expelled three months ago are you leaving town or something marko sucks at his bottom lip apparently weighing the issue ive got some moves to make first moves unfinished business cyrus an easy laugh maybe or maybe the asians maybe i decidetheyre expendable yeah i can see that point of view but where would you get your inventory then this buys the biggest laugh of all afghanistan man where else its better than that colombian shit anyway ecstasy and lsd from afghanistan hell no heroin man black pearl you know what keeps these whitebread kids from doing heroin the needle thats the line they wont cross theyre afraid of aids and hepatitis or just plain scared of the fucking needle but now the puritys so high that you can snort and smoke heroin just like coke you dont need the needle its the future man im going to give those frat boys the ride of their lives and im going to be rich why are you telling me all this an indifferent shrug because it doesnt matter in a day or two marko bakic will exist no more im going to reinvent myself like madonna you like madonna this exchange has become surreal all i want to know now is how to get back to mias car without turning my back on marko its okay mr cage he says reading my thoughts im not going to shoot you as i back away from him one last question occurs to me do you think steve sayers could have killed kate steve sure why not hes crazy guy i thought he was pretty straight a jock marko snickers those pickup trucks driving around scaring everybody to death yeah steves driving one of them hell probably kill somebody before morning and he wont even know it just another bump in the grass steves semen didnt match what they found in kates corpse so what maybe he wore a raincoat or maybe he pulled out you know in my country ten serbs rape a woman maybe half of them come in her maybe thats what happened to kate you know ten guys could have raped her why not gang rape who knows americas crazier than bosnia when it comes to sex its all they think about what do you think about a broad grin business is that why you blew five grand on fireworks the other night sure promotional expense im an entrepreneur like bill gates i stop backing away ive dealt with a lot of criminals but marko bakic is a new experience for me hes like a russian mobster convinced that hes in the vanguard of capitalism even as he leaves a trail of carnage behind him of course american capitalism left quite a wake of destruction during its infancy as well maybe marko isnt completely wrong about himself will you give me your cell number i ask i may need to reach you he smiles lazily you know better than that mr cage you give me yours maybe ill check in with you before i go why notbetter to have some chance of talking to marko again than none i give him my number as he punches it into his cell phone im suddenly terrified that mia will walk down the hill in search of me i dont want marko to know it was she who brought me here well good luck i tell him backing farther up the hill marko knows how scared i am he sees it in my face but i dont care fear is infinitely more powerful than pride and i have so much to lose i hope i never see marko bakic again when i reach the road i cross it and sprint toward mias car goi shout as i jump into my seat get out of here now what happened she asks you were gone forever i talked to marko go i dont want him to know you brought me mia throws the car into reverse backs onto the road and guns it for the gate drive normally i tell her digging in the glove box for an envelope fuck that she says i want out of here very carefully i slip markos hair into the envelope containing the title to mias car dont worry she says everybodys too wasted to remember anything yeahi think everybody but marko chapter quentin averys suite is empty lucien has apparently gone home but from the dirty dishes littering the coffee table he ate a full meal and several desserts before giving up on the sony flash drive i took from markos apartment the flash drive itself is sitting on the keyboard in front of the flatpanel monitor on the desk though its long after midnight mia looks wide awake the rave is forgotten her excitement at seeing what kate kept hidden from the world is plain to see why are you so excited about seeing whats on kates drives i ask taking a seat before the computer and slipping the sony drive into my pocket mia pulls up a chair and sits beside me i just want to understand where she really was in her head maybe then ill know why she died when i insert the first lexar flash drive windows offers to open a folder to view the files thank you lucien i click the mouse and a group of folders and individual files pops up some arejpeg image files others are wordperfect documents and still others appear to be hypertext documents saved from the worldwide web what do we look at first mia asks the pictures i guess i have a feeling some of this stuff is going to be explicit she gives me a look that says give me a break i click ajpeg file and a picture of two men having sex fills the screen whoa i say feeling my face color i try to click the image away but mia grabs my hand thats no big deal she says this isnt okay ive seen women doing it with horses on the internet everybody in my class has its not her revelation about bestiality that shocks me but the way she refers to as if its the dark ages i was twenty years old in for me still carries the dread of an orwellian future for mia its the name of a bad van halen album released two years before she was born its just gay sex she says and the guys are hot do you think thats why kate has this she shrugs i dont know open some more files more images of gay sexual action appear i think kate was into anal mia says in a matteroffact voice thats what drew told me thats why they found his semen in herin her butt mia finishes looking at me like im being ridiculous yeah shads going to use that fact to make it look like drew raped kate hes relying on the jury being unwilling to believe a girl that young would do that voluntarily he might be right if the jurys old enough but you never know they might surprise you i wouldnt mind being surprised like that mia is still watching the screen keep clicking i open some more files moving quickly down the directory a few heterosexual images appear but the collection is still heavily weighted toward gay porn as the images flash up and vanish i realize that im simply not young enough to judge how normal or abnormal it is for a girl to possess this kind of material today mia i dont want to embarrass you but i need to know something what do you have stuff like this on your computer i dont mean gay porn butyou know at last mia blushes do you wellsome but im a guy she laughs nervously yeah ive got a few pictures i wouldnt have thought that she gives me a strange smile am i ruining your perfect image of me maybe everybodys human penn even girls like me i guess i keep hoping thats not true she points at the screen try this folder at the bottom it has a d and a k in the file name her instinct is deadon when i click the folder shes pointing to a host of file icons appears all coded dk with a number and when i click the first icon an image of kate and drew having intercourse fills the screen jesus i whisper mia whistles softly drew and kate are in the missionary position but theres no hokey mugging for the camera or anything like that it looks as though someone hiding in the bedroom caught them in the act of tenderly making love not many people look good having sex but drew seems frozen above kate like a statue by michelangelo his muscles flexed in stark relief hes looking down into kates eyes and she appears awestruck her mouth partly open her eyes filled with indescribable emotion this single image brings home the reality of their relationship in a more visceral way than all drews explanations of it or even my imagined reality they dont look like two porn actors but two people deeply in love its so sad mia says isnt it yes open another one i sigh then move to the next file when this image fills the screen mia gasps it takes me a minute to process what im seeing drew stands facing the camera holding kate against him as they make love but she is not facing him shes facing the camera her long legs bowed at the knee her feet hooked behind drews powerful legs drews hands are clutching kates inner thighs while her lithe arms disappear beneath his muscular ones presumably to grip his lower back somehow these few points of contact manage to support kates full weight the position spreads her chest to the limit pushing her modest but shapely breasts up and outward through her long blond hair and though her eyes are closed her face communicates utter bliss drews jaw is clenched with effort but he looks as though he could hold kate suspended for eternity ive never done that mia says softly have you no is he in her front or back i study the picture kates pubic area is trimmed to a barely visible shadow what must be a third of the shaft of drews penis is visible below her vaginal lips but the slight downward angle of the shot makes it difficult to see the point of entry front i think mia shakes her head again her breathing has gone shallow and theres a tension in her body that wasnt there before the photo is shockingly erotic and it makes me wonder whether drew and kate shot this photograph or whether someone else was indeed in the room its hard to believe they staged this shot with a timer mia leans closer to the screen at some level i know that viewing this material with her is inappropriate but i also know that im not about to stop what do you think about that i ask its beautiful is it hes hot i cant help but feel a pang of jealousy and kate shes so long ill never look like that why would you want to look like that mia shakes her head she doesnt want to answer but neither does she take her eyes from the picture as she stares i decide to ask something ive wondered about ever since the murderand especially after last nights conversation with caitlin would you do something like that mia what the sex no would you do what kate did get involved with an older man like drew she takes a deep breath and closes her eyes then she turns to me and opens them do you want me to be honest of course will you be honest yes have you ever thought about kissing me in one moment my face is burning i cant be honest with her about that maybe not even with myself that wasnt a discussion question she says its yes or no true or false mia she looks down its all right i already know do you i think so well she shakes her head and looks up again you asked if i would do what kate did my answer is yes with the right man why would you she looks back at the screen and covers her mouth with her hand then she closes the file and turns to face me her eyes bright with intensity because im ready to experience more than i have up to this point i want to know the essence of life and of myself i want to learn what im capable of and the boys i know cant help me do that she pauses but she seems to have more to say i realize that i could be hurt by an older man she goes on but thats what you do when youre my age isnt it you get your heart broken and you learn you try to figure out who youre supposed to be with i suppose youre right im not kate im not even like kate im my own person im eighteen and i understand what that kind of choice means its a risk but its one i would take its something id like to experience before i leave for brown and my feeling is that the consequences of that kind of relationship dont have to be negative she gives me a tight smile im not a fatal attraction kind of girl no dramatic scenes no pregnancy no suicide attempts no diseases just intimacy her dark eyes are only inches from mine and they seem almost bottomless mia im not the angel you think i am penn youre more of one than you think she raises an eyebrow in answer then lays her right hand over my left will you answer my question which one you know which one as blood suffuses my cheeks again it strikes me that only truth will resolve this situation yes ive thought about what it would be like to kiss you she acknowledges my words with a nod but she already knew the answer but that doesnt mean its all right for me to do it i add mias smile is as serene as the face of the turning angel ive thought about it too she says i thought about it during the drive out to oakfield and during the drive back i dont know what to say dont say anything just kiss me i cant do that she smiles as though we share some intimate secret did you know that humphrey bogart married lauren bacall when she was twenty no he was fortysix thats more of an age difference than we have not by much she laughs softly just giving you a little history i wasnt saying we have to be together forever you already have a life and im going to brown in the fall before i can speak again she takes my other hand in her free one and squeezes look at me penn not your idea of me but me the mortal girl the fleshandblood mia and dont say anythingplease i cant obey her because to look into mias eyes for too long would send me straight down the road drew has already traveled the reality of a stunningly beautiful and intelligent young woman explaining why its all right for you to make love to her is enough to make any male lose all capacity for rational thought in my mind i hear wade anders telling me that the hardest thing he ever did was turn down the girls whove come on to him in his office those girls i am certain were not even in mias league but what refuses to leave my mind is the image of drew and kate making love before the camera mia viewed that photograph with me and felt no embarrassment at all on the contrary she wants to experience the same intensity she saw there with me more than that shes telling me beforehand that ill have no obligation to her evolutionary nirvanacaitlin called it god was she right i close my eyes slip my hands from beneath mias and grip her upper arms listen to me mia do you have any idea of the power you possess you sitting there saying thatthe way you said itmakes me believe in witchcraft its like a spell and i know youre telling the truth you have outgrown this town and its people you are ready to taste a deeper level of life youre ready to explore yourself and you probably do need a man for some parts of that journey but youre not that man she says i nod slowly we both have to tell the truth here okay thats the only way to be fair to each other do i want you in this moment yes i do do i have any idea of what it would be like to experience with you what we saw in that picture i think i do do i have any inkling of the connection you and i could have despite our age difference of course i do because we already have it ive been forcing myself to ignore it for weeks its a cliché i know but i feel as though ive known you all my life but the thing isi havent i couldnt have because youre half my age you are literally young enough to be my daughter but im not your daughter she says laying her hands over mine again i breathe slowly trying to stay focused in some ways i feel you are mia shakes her head her eyes anxious now dont say that because its not true ive seen things in your eyes that a father doesnt feel for a daughter of course you have im a man and i respond to all that you are but i also feel things that a father feels for a daughter mainly i feel very protective of you and my first duty is to protect you from me she stares at me in silence trying to process what ive said in this strange lacuna of time i feel the shattering intensity of the moment that drew stepped over the line with kate he looked into a face this beautiful he gazed into eyes like twin pools in some mythic grove he touched skin this flawless he listened to the siren song of eternal youth falling from bloodred lips and then he leaned forwardnot back and from that moment forward he was lost mia reads my eyes with the precision of a clairvoyant sadness touches her lips for a moment then she blinks three times and looks back at the computer screen forget i said anything she says clicking the mouse to open a wordperfect document i was being retarded no you werent you were just i stop talking ive lost her the walls have gone up and nothing is going to bring them down any time soon look at this she says it looks like email from that guy you talked about who the drug dealer cyrus the name shocks me back to the present mias right the letter is three paragraphs long and incredibly enough its signed peace cyrus i read it aloud searching for a sense of cyrus white in the way his words feel in my mouth dear kate ive been thinking about you a lot i dont want to freak you out but i dont think youre the kind of girl who freaks out too easy ive been looking at that picture the one jaderious took you look so fine in that girl you look like a movie star in a magazine when they catch them coming out of a theater or something i mean it i saw a girl on the cover of us magazine that made me think of you i looked inside to find out who she was her name is katie holmes yall even have the same name so i rented two of her flicks youre kind of like her only with blond hair and blue eyes and more together not silly or flighty or anything i hope what i gave you did you right i cant see you doing that myself but i dont really know you yet everybody carries some pain around and im sure youve been through your share you told me your old man was never around and i can relate to that i didnt even know who my father was the guy i thought it was turned out he was just some guy you know my mamas boyfriend but that was a long time ago i just want you to know im thinking about you that i see youre different from everybody else i know you already know that but i want you to know i know it too i know it cause im the same way i live in a different world of course but i always knew i was different thats how i got where i am now when the plants closed down around here a lot of guys just gave up some took shit jobs but others just sit at home with their head in a bottle or smoke weed whatever i guess thats all right for them but not me i got screwed out of my living so i give it right back to the bastards who did it im not letting them take me down im getting enough money to do anything i might ever want to do i got big plans i want you to know that i know you got plans too if you ever want to talk like you said just mail me back or call me whatever im open to it you know thats all i want to say you be cool peace cyrus lets look for the picture hes talking about mia says look for cw in the file name i think aloud or ck snap says mia there it is she clicks on anotherjpeg file and a new photo fills the screen a large sullenfaced black man stands before a gray wall with his arm around kate almost crushing her against him kate has a smile of sorts on her face but its the smile of someone making the best of a bad situation she looks like a girl being molested by a customs official while trying to get out of a hostile country she has to play along to get out of the situation but shes not okay with it but then again maybe thats just prejudice coloring my view of the photograph does she look happy to you i ask mia shakes her head thats one of kates fake smiles everybody has one of course kate has about five and thats one of them she looks scared to me i agree i lean closer to the screen and try to read cyruss eyes but the flatpanel model doesnt have the fine resolution of a crt still his whole appearance and posture radiate a sense of threat sonny cross told me that cyrus was thirtyfour but the drug dealer looks about twentyeight in this photo hes built like an nfl cornerback his bullet head is shaved clean his neck is corded with muscle and his biceps are thicker than kates thighs his skin is the color of café au laitim guessing a quarter of his blood could be caucasian hes wearing a black wifebeater tank top and tight white painters pants a solitary gold chain hangs around his neck but the links are thick enough to pull a truck out of a mudhole i wonder if the chain is meant to symbolize the chains of slavery look for more letters i murmur definitely says mia she begins opening wordperfect files most of them seem like diary pages that didnt make kates handwritten journal ironically these entries are of the more casual sort ate crawfish pasta at pearl street pasta got an acceptance letter from colgatetoo late people grandma sent me a check for what does she think i can buy with that steve almost cracked his skull today on his wheeler he made a huge deal out of it but i couldnt pretend to be too worried its not like there was much risk of brain damage for some reason kate chronicled the most sensitive events of her life by hand where they could easily be discovered while her quotidian record was saved to a passwordprotected disk why the password was to protect the pictures i realize the person most likely to discover kates journal was her mother and kate wasnt worried about that she simply wanted to spare her mother from the explicit visual evidence of her sexual life that looks like the only letter from cyrus mia says im going to have to find a way to get a look at kates actual computer would mrs townsend let you do that she gave you the journal i think she would but the police probably have it by now ill get quentin to request access to it wait heres another letter as i read the next email from cyrus my face grows hot the chatty tone of the first letter is gone replaced by seething anger this time mia reads aloud what the fuck huh you said you were going to write me back talk to me but you just leave me sitting here like i dont exist and thats the truth isnt it in your world iexist i only pop into your head when the dope gets low yeah i know how it is i know more junkies than i can count and theyre all the same you just look better than the rest but the beautiful people got the monkey on their back too baby youll see that when you get to harvard you can bet your ass those rich kids are snorting and mainlining and everything else the only difference is they got better dope if you ever come down off that high horse write me back cyrus thought kate was getting the pills for herself mia says she was protecting drew mia shakes her head i dont like drew too much right now he was really taking advantage of her im disgusted myself but im also excited if cyrus white didnt know kate was buying the lorcet for ellen elliott then shad johnson cant possibly learn the truth behind kates visits from any members of cyruss crew quentin will be ecstatic over this look says mia reading another note from cyrus you see what kate was doing she was playing cyrus to keep the pills coming he wanted her so he held the dope over her head and she played the game i wonder how far she went too far im afraid i reply reading farther down you played me didnt you bitch you made me feel like you saw past my skin and my trade but you dont you made me believe you see me the way you see yourself but you dont to you im just another nigger after you get to harvard im going to be that big bad black dope dealer you tell colorful stories about while your spoiledass friends laugh well fuck you bitch you knew i wanted you and you held out that pussy like bait to get what you wanted just like every other bitch tries to do but women dont play that shit with cyrus hear i got some bitches you ought to talk to about that they learned quick you will too you can hide all you want you can ignore my email not answer my calls but when that dope gets low youll be back and dont be trying to get it from marko ithat motherfucker your best bet is to fake a toothache and go to a horny dentist you can probably play him for some of what you need but you wont make it through the summer baby youll be back to me and this time youre going to pay like all the other bitches with pussy holy shit mia says softly this is scary this is dynamite is what it is are there any more like this lets see she opens another folder containing wordperfect documents most are todo lists relating to admission to colleges there are five drafts of essays written for applications look at this hypertext document mia says the saved web page is a visual encyclopedia of medications containing hydrocodone theres a picture of each brand of pill and beside each the pharmacological information about ithow much hydrocodone it contains how much acetaminophen etc kate was a comparison shopper i comment she wanted to make sure cyrus didnt screw her in the drugdealing sense in both senses says mia i feel so sorry for her whats that i ask pointing to a microsoft notepad document mia opens the file it looks like she copied the text from an email and posted it into notepad holy shit look at that i saw you todayit begins you were talking to that doctor i see running all the time yall were being shady as shit too you found a new source didnt you you didnt go to a dentist you went to a doctor i saw how you were with him youre giving your shit to him all right he wouldnt give you the dope without some kind of payment and what else do you got that hed want of coursewont see it that way you probably think youre in love well i got something for you cinderella you dont shit on cyrus and walk away cleanand dont think your doctor man can help you he may look big but ill take that motherfuckerhow did you get this way anyway does your mama know you do this shit or did she teach you this shit i bet thats it have a nice day okay enjoy your ride in that boxyass volvo it aint gonna last long whats the date of that email i ask theres no date its just copied text whats the date of the notepad file mia checks it the twentyeighth three days before kate was murdered i pull the flash drive from the computer and get to my feet my neck and back are stiff from staring so intently at the computer what are you going to do mia asks get to work that letter is going to save drews life will it really this letter alone will create reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury mia nods but she doesnt look convinced what is it a lot of people get upset when theyre rejected she says you know a lot of people say they want to kill the person who hurt them or at least they think it have you ever thought that she looks straight into my eyes yes who was the person she shakes her head i told you im not the angel you think i am i want to know more but right now i cant make myself concentrate on the love life of my babysitter its lateprobably too late to wake quentinbut i need to get mia home and start working on drews defense its hard to get my mind around the fact but his trial begins next wednesday at least now well have a big surprise for shad johnson you want me to go dont you mia says well im going to be working all night on subpoenas and things like that drew doesnt have much time i understand ill go she picks up her backpack and starts toward the door mia its really late let me run you home she stops you dont have to ive got my car ill follow you then and tomorrow ill let you know everything that happens related to this i know you want to know about it i do thanks and to tell you the truth i dont feel like driving i can pick up my car tomorrow good i open the leather portfolio i brought kates journal in and zip kates flash drives into one of its inside pockets then i slip the envelope containing markos hair into another im not letting this stuff out of my sight as i reach for markos flash drive which is still in my pants pocket it hits me that mia is seriously upset i walk to her and put my hands on her shoulders mia i cant tell you how much help youve been tonight helping me find marko getting these disks hacked youve been critical throughout this investigation when drew is acquitted its going to be due to your efforts more than anyone elses a smile touches the corners of her mouth you really think so absolutely drews going to have to make a large contribution to your college fund she laughs her eyes sparkling how large five figures for sure hell i think it ought to equal quentins fee youre kidding right im not if drew doesnt take care of you i will thats a promise but he will i know him now lets get you home mia shoulders her backpack and leads the way through the door as we enter the elevator though i realize that her smile is gone againwake up stupid says a voice in my head its not paying for college that shes worried about its what happened in front of the computer ten minutes ago were standing about two feet apart facing the elevator door our reflections are staring at us from the brass plating mia looks tiny and vulnerable with her backpack slung over her shoulder im so glad i didnt cross the line with her upstairs mia she gives the slightest shake of her head she cant bear to discuss what happened between us as i stare at her reflection i realize there are tears on her face after a moments hesitation i reach out and take her hand in mine its very small and soft not so different from my daughters hand after a moment she squeezes my hand in return then steps close to me and lays her head on my chest putting my arm around her i feel ineffable sadness at the plight of this girl her father abandoned her when she was two yet she and her mother somehow struggled through not just to the point that theyre okaywhich would have been triumph enoughbut to the point that mia has become a selfpossessed young lady accepted into one of the finest universities in the country if drew really is acquitted im going to make him set up a college account for mia and the first deposit is going to be a hundred thousand dollars the elevator dings and the doors open onto the empty lobby to our left a clerk behind the desk stands and gives us a sleepy wave do you need anything sir no thanks my cars in the back lot i tell mia stopping by a large sofa stay here until i bring it around she slips her heavy pack off her shoulder and drops into the soft cushion of the sofa dont fall asleep i might i point to a side door that leads to the hotels checkin lanes thats where ill be youll be able to see me pull up can you bring a pizza with you im hungry we can grab something on the way home i walk past the desk and out the back door the eola parking lot occupies the hollow center of a large city block its mostly empty so i jog straight to my saab laying the portfolio on the passenger seat i crank the engine back out of my space and pull around to the checkin lanes with six stories of hotel sitting on top of them theyre effectively in a tunnel and for some reason the arrows painted on the ground go against the normal american traffic flow the right lanewhich would put me in front of the hotel dooris painted with an arrow coming straight toward me as it would in the uk screw it i mutter pulling into the right lane as i come abreast of the glass doors i see mia waiting just inside them then i see a man standing behind her not a man really but a boy a boy with an asian face hes pressing a gun against mias right temple and hes smiling chapter the asian boy kicks open the glass door and shoves mia through it the gun still hard against her head mias face is drained of blood her eyes blank with terror i want to reach for the gun in my jacket pocket but that would probably get mia a bullet in the head as i stare i realize im looking at the guy who shot sonny cross from the black lexus on beau pré road hell have no qualms about blowing mias brains out what does this guy want i start violently at the crack of metal against my window i look to my left a second asian boy is aiming a stubby submachine gun at me it looks like a heckler and koch mp a favorite of law enforcement he motions for me to roll down my window i do keep your hands where i can see em he says in a southern accent for some reason i expected him to speak vietnamese but why should he hes from the mississippi gulf coast keys he snaps give em here if mia werent part of this equation id hit the gas and peel out of this tunnel but she is part of it i shut off the saab and hand the boy my keys that too he says jabbing the gun at the portfolio on the seat i brought the portfolio with me because i knew other people had access to quentins suite and i didnt want to take a chance on losing it i glance at mia as i reach into the passenger seat and pass the portfolio across my chest her mouth is hanging slack get his gun yells the boy holding mia well take his car as the boy at my window reaches inside a shadow appears behind the one holding mia i assume its another member of his gang but then the right side of his forehead explodes and he drops like a sandbag mia screams and looks down the hand at my chest jerks out of the window run miai shout ramming my door into the gunmans midsection then i yank out my fathers pistol fire three times through the window and scramble over the passenger seat for the opposite door whoever shot the guy holding mia is firing to give me cover i shove open the passenger door and dive onto the cement wondering who the hell it could be get in here pennshouts a male voice move as my unknown savior fires i crabwalk across the cement and dive through the glass door its swinging shut behind me when a burst of machinegun fire blasts plate glass all over my back over hereshouts mia hurry mia is hiding behind a gigantic oriental vase i crawl to her and take cover searching for whoever saved us gunfire from the tunnel sends glass spraying through the lobby thank god its two in the morning get her clear screams a voice from my right who are you logan don logan the chief of police get her out of here penn theres probably more of them hes right weve got to run for it mia i look out into the seemingly empty lobby call for backup don on the way get moving as i pull mia to her feet chief logan rises from behind a club chair and begins firing his handgun through the shattered windows where do we runthe door to the parking lot is beside the checkin desk but the lot offers no guarantee of safety theres another exit on main street but thats a long run from here and something tells me the asians will be covering the main doors i sprint across the lobby toward the hall that leads to main street pulling mia alongside me dont go outside logan yells im not headed outside theres a staircase in the hall that leads to the mezzanine which has sheltered access to the elevators when we reach the stairs i start to send mia up first then change my mind as i lead the way i try to do what my father often preaches realize the danger before youre in it dont hesitate i say as i run if something happens shoot first sort it out lat mia screams so sharply that it hurts my ears i whirl figuring someone is chasing us but mia is pointing past me up the stairs i half pull my trigger as i spin then depress it the final distance as a blurry figure comes flying down toward me i dont know if hes armed or not but i keep pulling the trigger until a hundred and fifty pounds of muscle slams into me knocking me back onto mia is he dead she grunts trying to scramble out from under me theres an asian boy lying half on top of me i dont know if hes dead or not but hes still clutching a pistol in his hand i slam my fathers browning against his elbow nothing happens not even a reflex jerk with great effort i roll the kid off us and pull mia to her feet what do we do she asks her chin quivering where do we go up back to the suite we race up to the mezzanine elevators the wait is almost intolerable when the door opens im so nervous that i nearly fire a slug into the empty car but we board and before long im opening the door to quentins master suite i thought the gunfire would have awakened half the hotel but no one on the seventh floor seems to have noticed anything inside the suite i go straight to the window flashing red and blue lights bounce off the buildings on pearl street the cavalry has arrived blue lights mean police red lights the sheriffs department it seems everyone has responded to chief logans distress call mia walks up beside me panting who was that why did they do that those kids killed sonny cross i guess they never left town after all the phone beside the sofa rings i pick it up hello mr avery says the desk clerk no this is mr cage hold please i have someone who wants to speak with you a ragged voice says penn are you okay don yeah were okay is it secure down there yes weve got the pd and the sheriffs department here now what the hell were you doing here ill explain in a minute is my car still down there i ask desperately wondering about my leather portfolio no the guy who had the drop on you stole it and made a run for it did you catch him not yet doni shot a guy on the mezzanine staircase we found him hes dead why dont you two come back down its completely safe and were going to need you to answer some questions well be down in a minute i hang up and look at mia are you up to talking to the police she nods slowly i guess god my mothers going to freak my laughter starts as a chuckle then blossoms into fullthroated hysteria mia soon joins me after we calm down and walk into the hallway i consider waking quentin theres really nothing he can do tonight and since chief logan the hero of the hour cant stand to be in the room with quentin its probably best to let drews lawyer sleep especially since it looks like i lost cyruss threatening emails quentin can cuss me out in the morning the lobby of the eola looks like the site of a terrorist attack more than a dozen uniformed cops and deputies move through the capacious room with their guns at the ready eyeing each other suspiciously chief logan is standing by the doors he was shooting through only minutes ago at his feet lies the body of the boy who murdered sonny cross i seat mia in one of the club chairs and walk over to him hey penn don says his voice muted the girl okay yeah i need to get her home though who is she mia burke she was a friend of kate townsend i see says logan but his eyes tell me he doesnt see at all its a long story ive got time why do you think they attacked you i point at the corpse probably because i saw this punk kill sonny cross they were wiping out the only witness against them don looks down at the boys shattered skull he doesnt even look human anymore are you sure thats the same kid positive i knew it the second i saw his face logan looks relieved good what were you doing here i mean if you hadnt beenwed be dead an offduty cop called in a report that hed seen a black lexus near the hotel this afternoon i knew this was averys command center for drews defense and i knew youd seen the asians hit sonny i havent been sleeping too well the past couple of nights so i took a ride downtown i saw you go into the hotel with the girl i decided to hang around and see what was gonna happen after that i clap him on the shoulder and squeeze hard i owe you buddy he shakes his head just doing my job sonny cross may have worked for the sheriffs department but i knew him for most of my life he was a good cop he shouldnt have died the way he did no i look around at the deputies prowling the lobby who called the sheriffs department i did they were closer logan laughs quietly when the chief of police calls the sheriffs department for help in this town you know hes desperate as i chuckle chief logan turns to make sure no one is within earshot did they take anything from you penn i think about the evidence lost in the car no just the car he watches me carefully i imagine well find that soon enough you sure theres nothing in there i need to look for if we find it the chief must have seen the portfolio in my hand when i walked across the lobby with mia spell it out don he looks over at two deputies talking a few yards away im talking about something you wouldnt want to accidentally get lost before it could be returned to you christif things have come to the point where the police chief can ask me this this town is truly in bad shape i look deep into logans eyes i dont know him wellweve talked a few times at our daughters softball gamesbut what i see in his face now convinces me that the time has come to take a chance i hate to rely on anyone but myselfespecially with a friends life at stakebut sometimes you have to have a little faith i lean toward don and speak in a whisper there was a leather portfolio in the car there were two computer flash drives in it and one envelope i need that stuff bad don drews life depends on it logan nods whats in the envelope a hair from the head of marko bakic the chiefs head snaps up his eyes questioning find that car don we will you just make sure i know everything i need to know i will can i take mia home now i have a feeling shes barely keeping it together logan blows out a stream of air and looks back at the men moving through the lobby i guess we can take a statement from her tomorrow the crunch of glass heralds the approach of someone from the tunnel my relief at being released evaporates at the sight of sheriff billy byrd the sheriff stops before the body on the ground and leans forward to look down past his gut then he surveys the lobby through the shattered doors christ on a crutch he says in his heavy drawl they told me it looked like a war zone i never thought id see something like this in my town chief logan offers byrd his hand the sheriff takes his time about shaking it who killed this one here byrd asks gesturing at the body on the ground i did says the chief contact wound looks like it was a hostage situation byrd nods then turns to me his eyes boring into mine you got one too thats right lucky huh i dont feel too lucky sheriff and im about to go home do you need me for anything got a couple questions for you i can pretty much fill you in logan says tacitly claiming the crime scene for his department byrd ignores him its pretty late mr cage what were you doing here with mia burke at this hour shes still in high school isnt she thats right does her mother know shes here with you my mother knows im with mr cage mia says stepping up to us byrd smirks so what were you two doing here is this like dr elliott and the townsend girl hot blood rushes to my face youve got no right to say that to us the sheriff snorts and looks over at his men who are gathering to watch our exchange its my job to get to the bottom of this mess aint it actually i believe thats chief logans job and since he just saved our lives while you were sleeping at home im not too well disposed toward you and your bullshit just now sheriff byrd pales you dont talk to me that way smartass i didnt hear anything chief logan says quietly why dont we let these two be on their way and concentrate on the work at hand sheriff byrd hikes up his trousers and leans in close to me this is where averys staying aint it thats right is the girl helping you with the case shes working for us yes as a runner basically a gopher is that right miss burke mia nods uncertainly are they paying you anything mia looks worriedly at me no im doing it because i believe dr elliott is innocent the sheriff snickers youre one of the few all right thats it i say you want to ask more questions you arrest us byrd looks as though hes considering it chief logan takes a single step but its a big one he places himself directly between me and the sheriff get going penn he says call me tomorrow morning thanks again chief i take mia by the arm and lead her toward the corridor that runs out to main street then i stop and turn back to logan i dont have a car logan motions to one of his patrolmen lee will drop you off thanks a young black patrolman detaches himself from a group of cops and walks toward us sheriff byrd stares at me with open fury but i ignore him too much has happened tonight to give a damn about a redneck sheriff and his agenda follow me mr cage says the patrolman thank you the ride to mias house is mostly silent the young patrolman driving us asks a couple of questions but his only intent is to learn more about the kind of gun battle he is unlikely to see in this town again howd you get the guy on the stairs before he shot you he asks he was carrying a glock and there was a round in the chamber im not sure i killed a man like that once before when i lived in houston a burglar mia is staring at me from her corner of the backseat no i reply watching her he was the brother of a white supremacist id sent to death row he broke into my house to kidnap my daughter she was an infant then and he was actually holding her when i shot him i was so scared to shoot i almost let him get out of the house but you didnt no i was lucky then too sho was says lee looking at me in his rearview mirror man alive the squad car slows then stops before mias house a thirtyyearold home in a middleincome subdivision off liberty road this it asks lee yeah thanks he releases the locking mechanism on the rear doors and we get out ill walk you up i tell mia she nods gratefully after thanking lee at his window she starts up the sidewalk ill come by tomorrow morning i promise walking beside her ill talk to meredith and explain what happened or try to mia says laughing nervously yeah i think your nancy drew days are over she makes a sound i cant interpret you lost kates flash drives didnt you i nod and her journal im sorry how badly will that hurt drew i was never going to use the journal but we needed those drives what about markos flash drive i tap my pants pocket i still have that lets just hope it has something useful on it and that lucien can crack it if he cant someone can mia unlocks her front door and steps through it she looks into the depths of the house then back at me moms asleep thank god i hope no one hears about everything tonight and decides to wake her up i think youll be okay on that mia reaches out and pulls my hand until im standing inside with her all i can see clearly are her wide eyes shining in the dark what is it i ask i almost died didnt i you could have i admit and it would have been my fault if chief logan hadnt been there look at me penn i am ive never felt more alive than i do at this moment my palms are still tingling from the aftereffects of the fight at the hotel but theres something else happening within me too i think thats pretty common in these kinds of situations i want to kiss you mia says we talked about this before i know i know we cant have a relationship i even respect that i just want this moment okay before i can think of a response she stands on tiptoe takes my face in her hands and kisses me full on the mouth i dont kiss her back but neither do i pull away the truth is i feel exactly as she does about our brush with deathphenomenally alive to every molecule of existence and i cant imagine anything more alive than the swelling mouth pressing against mine mias lips part slightly and i feel her tongue brush against my lips for one moment i open my mouth and taste her and in that moment i feel a rush of overwhelming desire the first few feet of a plunge into bliss that caitlin dubbed evolutionary nirvana mia gives my lower lip a soft bite then pulls away there she says her eyes shining see no harm no foul tomorrow ill act like it never happened i promise try to sleep mia not a chance but dont worry about me and dont feel guilty promise me ill try her teeth flash in the darkness then she gently pushes me out the door as i walk down the sidewalk the chatter of a police radio brings me back to the present ive got a lot of work to do tonight i might have lost kates flash drives but i still have sonny crosss computer and case notes if im lucky something in them will lead me to the dark soul who has brought so much death to this town my town cyrus white chapter news of the shooting at the eola hotel sent the town into shock caitlin published a detailed account of the attack based on the account i gave her after waking her from a deep sleep in my bedroom early that morning there was no point in trying to keep it from her besides i figured the more people who knew about my stolen saab the better the odds it would be found caitlin seemed particularly interested in what id been doing at the hotel with mia at am i explained that mia was helping quentin and me investigate kate townsends life and that beyond that i couldnt say more this didnt satisfy caitlin but she was so glad to get the inside story of the attack that she let it go at least for a while after she exhausted my memory of the nights eventsthe ones i could tell her about anywayi pretended to get ready for bed caitlin got dressed called her editor and drove down to the examiner offices to begin working the story as soon as she left i brewed a pot of coffee and retrieved sonny crosss private case materials from my safe then i scanned twelve of sonnys minidv surveillance tapes using fast forward it was a tedious process but by the end of it id found two that showed kate townsend walking into and out of cyrus whites building at the brightside manor apartments these tapes were what quentin had asked me to get for him but they didnt satisfy me i wanted cyrus in the flesh i began sifting through sonnys case notebooks line by line they contained copious notes on the drug activity at brightside manorand elsewhere in natchezbut nothing that would help me locate cyrus unless hes staying at one of his known safe houses and chief logan assured me that all those are being checked on a regular basis sonnys notes made it plain that he got most of his information from drug users or couriers hed busted and then forced to work for him in exchange for their continuing freedom my problem was that sonny only referred to these snitches by code names the code names seemed oddly chosen until i realized that they were all characters played by john wayne on the big screen rooster chance ethan cahill big jake chisum mcq almost all the information sonny had on cyrus white had been provided by ethan but nowhere in the notebooks could i find a key to the identity of these snitches setting aside the notebooks i began scouring the files on sonnys laptop computer after nearly an hour i hit pay dirt an encrypted file i couldnt open it but what excited me was that this file seemed to be the only encrypted one on the computer as soon as i was sure of this i called lucien morses cell phone lucien happily agreed to meet me at the eola the next morning to hack sonnys file all he required was another five hundred dollars then i called quentin at the eola and briefed him on the battle hed slept through last night he told me that doris had awakened at one point thinking shed heard a shot but no sound followed so they went back to sleep quentin cared little about the deaths of the asians but the loss of cyruss threatening emails left him sputtering with rage hed enjoyed about thirty seconds of euphoria after i told him about the existence of the emailsthen disaster when i tried to mollify him by telling him id draw up a subpoena for cyruss email records quentin just laughed he uses that email address for dope trafficking man youre never gonna find that hes got that shit under somebody elses name then we somehow have to convince cyruss crew that giving us that address is for cyruss own good i argued quentin laughed harder theyll never buy that the emails for that account could probably put cyrus in parchman for five hundred years on drug charges the chances that hell be convicted of kate townsends murder are practically zero cyrus can read the newspaper and see that for himself drew looks like a slam dunk right now you leave the defense strategy to me ive been here before after this conversation quentin left the eola to visit drew at the county jail i called my father and asked him to take annie out of town for a few days he agreed without hesitation he and my mother plan to leave for jackson tonight those arrangements made i drove to the eola hotel and found lucien morse waiting for me in the lobby the st stephens sophomore was dressed to the nines just as he was last night plastic sheets had been tacked up over the shattered hotel doors and a construction crew was already working to repair the bullet damage in the elevator lucien asked some morbid questions about the attack the only answer i gave him was sonny crosss notebook computer while lucien tried to break sonnys encryption program i sat at the coffee table and drafted a letter for the top of the morning column of the natchez examiner a feature that usually contains editorials on the local political scene or articles on community events the purpose of the letter was to announce my intent to enter the special mayoral election as a candidate im not sure how the community will respond to it but i know two people who will be profoundly affected shad johnson will be enraged and quentin avery will be ecstatic to have shad distracted from drews upcoming trial a third person will be more deeply affected of course when i deliver that letter to the examiner offices caitlin will know i mean to run for mayor what will happen after that i dont know but i have more important business to take care of before delivering the letterbusiness that lucien made possible twenty minutes ago i am holding in my hand a printout of the contents of sonny crosss encrypted computer file a key to the true identities of sonnys snitches along with their names sonny recorded in this file the addresses and telephone numbers of each informant and also details of the offenses they had committedin effect the swords that he dangled over their heads trying not to hope for too much i lift the hotel phone and dial one of the two numbers given for code name ethana drug courier whose real name is jaderious huntley jaderious i recall was the name of the person who shot the photo of cyrus and kate that was stored on kates flash drive the prefix tells me the number im calling is a natchez cell phone after five rings i get the familiar automated voicemail greeting of cingular wireless i hang up without leaving a message then try the next number beside huntleys name this one looks like a residential phone after seven rings a young male voice says jaderious hello ethan jaderious gasps and then the phone goes dead i dial the number again no answer i dial again and let it ring twenty times no answer i hang up and dial again i can almost see a young black man staring at his telephone in horror wondering if hes hallucinating i have no doubt that the only man in the world who knew the real identity of ethan was sonny cross and everyone knows that sonny is dead on my eighth try someone picks up the phone but says nothing this is sonny cross i say in a calm voice the silence stretches to infinity you might as well talk ethan im not going away a tense voice says sonny be dead thats right but im not who are you a friend of sonnys oh man dont be telling me that that shit be over with now its not over jaderious but it can be i need one thing from you just one thing after that ill burn your file itll be like you never knew sonny at all dont play that shit man you guys dont never stop you think im a slave or something you put yourself in this spot ethan not me dont say that name man just tell me what you want i want to see you facetoface no way shit gone crazy in the street that task force be on everybodys ass everybodys uptight i cant be seen with you you dont even know who i am i know you white thats enough just tell me what you want i need to know where cyrus is jaderious sucks in his breath like a monk hearing the voice of satan you crazy he hisses you stone crazy man youre going to have to talk to me jaderious one way or another no i aint if you know my number you know where i stay at and you aint coming up in here i know that especially right now tell me where he is ethan nobody will ever know it was you jaderious laughs openly not even if i knew dog which idont if i have to come talk to you at home people will see you come talk to me in person you wont make it out of here so it dont matter you bluffing anyway dog i gots to go dont call back he hangs up before i can respond i sit quietly on the sofa for a while then i call quentin averys cell phone what is it quentin asks in a taut voice are you still at the jail yes and im not happy i need to get into the brightside manor apartments so i need to get in there safely and shit quentin dont play stupid can you get me in and out silence i suppose so but im not sure i want to do that why not drews acquittal could depend on it im not sure thats a good enough reason considering the price ill pay for doing it besides this deluded ass you call your friend is ready to move to death row right now he wont listen to me what do you mean are you at the eola yes stay there im on my way twenty minutes later quentin storms into the suite with as much violence as a man with one foot can muster his eyes are almost wild what did drew do i ask just what you said hes demanding to take the stand i nod but keep silent theres no point in saying i told you so this fucking guy quentin mutters hes the worst kind of chump you know that i still dont respond the best thing to do with this kind of anger is let it be vented as quickly as possible quentin opens the minibar takes out a small bottle of bourbon unscrews the top and swallows half the contents hellyeah he says wiping his mouth on his sleeve doris would fry my ass if she saw that why is drew the worst kind of chump quentin the lawyer walks to the plush sofa ponders it for a moment then turns and lets himself fall into it because that fool has decided he wants to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and that surprised you hes a fucking boy scout an eagle scout actually quentin drains the rest of the bourbon drew elliott is a chump because he thinks the rules are different for him because hes done the right thing for ninetynine percent of his life he thinks all he has to do now is get up on the stand to explain to everybody how it really was and what i can not make that boy understand is that if he does that hes going to destroy himself i mean this guy has been lying to his wife every day for almost a year hes been fucking his babysitter and now the girl is dead dead and pregnant so why the hell should a jury believe anything he has to say now youre preaching to the choir quentin theres no way in hell im letting this guy get up and tell the jury he found kates body and didnt report it how can you stop him i cant but maybe you can i dont want to have this discussion right now what about getting me into brightside manor whats in there thats so allfired important a snitch who knows where cyrus white is something tugs at the corner of quentins mouth something disagreeable how about another bottle of bourbon i go to the minibar and retrieve another bottle quentin sips slowly from it his eyes still smoldering i can get you in and out all right but if i do every black man and woman in that complex is going to know i did it and thats going to cost me down the road you understand that may not be the noble thing to say but its the truth whats it going to cost you cases business reputation the question i left unasked on the day i met quentin at my fathers office returns to haunt me now why did he stop taking civil rights cases to pursue personal injury and class action suits but at this point i feel the answer is selfevident what the hell am i supposed to do im not saying i wont do it im just saying it would be better if you could find another way such as lure the guy you need out of there with what hes scared shitless then find somebody else to get you in such as as quentin ruminates over his whiskey anger rises into my throat drews life is on the line and his lawyer is worried about some personal injury case five years down the road i get up without a word and walk to the door of the suite where are you going quentin asks to do my job you need to start thinking about whether youve got what it takes to do yours hey dont i slam the door and hurry down the hall the brightside manor apartments stand like a visual reprimand to every liberal fantasy of governmentsubsidized housing the dilapidated buildings look like sets built for a blaxploitation flick from the seventies like you could walk up and push them down with your foot thirteen big saltboxes grouped on the edge of st catherines creek all centered around a massive square of asphalt crowded with one of the strangest collections of motor transportation in the nation at least fifty people are sitting or standing within sight of me the oldest ones sit on their stoops beneath dented metal awnings the middleaged stand in little knots the men sharing bottles wrapped in paper sacks the women holding babies i dont see any teenagersits as though theyve been drafted for some special warbut several toddlers walk unsupervised through the parking lot three of them are naked how long has he been gone asks my father dad is referring to james ervin a retired black police officer he has treated since the s when he was the doctor for the natchez police department after dad agreed to help me get into brightside manor he recruited ervin to make the initial foray into jaderious huntleys building ervin graciously agreed and also volunteered his beatup pickup truck for the mission eleven minutes i answer dad clicks his tongue against his teeth i dont like it lets give it a little longer ervin sounded calm before he went in dad nods thoughtfully when i called him from the lobby of the eola he and my mother were only minutes from leaving for jackson with annie he told me hed visited brightside manor many times in the old days which to him means the era when he made frequent house calls back then he carried a spotlight and a pistol in his black medical bag he rarely makes house calls these days but he still has patients who live at brightside manor he understood my anxiety about visiting the place uninvited but he felt confident that with him along for the ride we could do it i was inclined to believe him no white doctor in this town has treated more black patients than tom cage more important hes treated them exactly as he treats his white patients and the black community knows that today could be the acid test of that goodwill our plan was to send james ervin up to jaderiouss apartment to verify that the informant was inside then we would go up ourselves pretending to make an emergency medical call at number this subterfuge was primarily designed to protect us not jaderious that it might also give the snitch some cover is incidental the ring of my cell phone makes us both jump in the seat hello i say putting my cell on speakerphone your boys up here says james ervin he tried to rabbit im holding a gun on him now damn says dad i didnt know james took a gun up there bring your black bag ervin says hes more likely to talk if we give him an out with cyruss people were on our way i promise any hopes that we might make a covert approach to jaderiouss building were dashed when we arrived our white faces began to draw attention as soon as james ervin left the truck a lot of people have pointed at our truck but no one has yet confronted us if we werent sitting in such a junky vehicle theyd probably think we were cops they may think that anyway dad and i are both armed but something tells me we should leave our guns behind dad doesnt agree so we compromise i leave the browning behind but he brings his small smith amp wessonthe lady smithin his bag we cross the parking lot with purposeful strides but not too fast people sense fear the same way animals do were just two guys with a job to do two white guys im glad one of us is over seventy the people milling around the buildings dont know what to make of that like most apartments in the south the staircases at brightside manor are outside the buildings we climb to the door that james ervin entered fifteen minutes ago give a perfunctory knock and walk inside the stink of burnt grease and garbage hits me like a sucker punch jaderious huntley is sitting on his hands in a wooden chair at the center of the front room james ervin stands eight feet away a nickelplated pistol in his hand sonnys notes said huntley is twentyeight years old but he looks forty hes wearing nothing but a pair of gym shorts and his torso is so gaunt that i wonder if hes eaten in weeks his face is hollow his eyes set deep in their sockets if hes a drug courier hes been using the product he carries for a long time i walk to the chair and kneel in front of him lets make this quick and painless jaderious refusing to meet my eye he shakes his head as though hes being addressed by a moron you dont get it dog you done killed me already i tried to do this long distance you wouldnt play huntley leans back and folds his arms he seems to equate this gesture with donning a suit of armor i aint saying shit about what you asked me on the phone you aint cops he points at james ervin cept this useless motherfucker and he too old to do shit now too old to fuck his old lady no more ervins face remains as unmoved as the face of a cliff youre right i say patiently were not cops thats why youre looking at this the wrong way youre thinking that if you dont tell me what i need to know im going to have you busted for that old drug charge jaderious sniffs with the arrogance of an exiled dictator then he begins picking his fingernails but im not going to do that i go on because it doesnt help me any no if you dont tell me what i need to know im going to put it out on the street that youve been sonny crosss snitch on cyrus for the past year and a half the informants whole body jerks then im going to give your name to the task force theyll haul you over to tracetown and question you for about six hours and all your homeys will know about it you cant do that man he cries shaking his head violently i dont want to because if i do you wont see the end of the week maybe not even the end of the day and i really dont have anything against you personally jaderiouss eyes watch me as they might an angry rattlesnake you dont know cyrus he says softly you dont know the things he do i have an idea no you dont im talkin bout mutilating people man cutting off parts and shit drilling holes in their bones while they still alive dog spittle flies from jaderiouss mouth and the whites of his eyes betray true panic his tale of torture has taken me by surprise i would have expected such tactics from an asian drug gang but not from a natchez drug dealer if jaderious were to suffer such a fate because of my visit here today what would i do if i were still a prosecutor i could offer him police protection but as a private citizen i can offer nothing yet when i think of sonny cross dying in his front yard afraid for his sons lives and kate townsend jammed halfnaked into the waterlogged limbs of a tree my concern for jaderious huntley quickly bleeds away youve got one way out of this i tell him this man over herei jerk my hand at my fatherthats dr tom cage he can give you something to make you puke like youre going cold turkey and when people ask what we were doing up here you can say he made a house call as a favor to your mama you got a mama jaderious he nods suspiciously the story may be thin but its all youve got and youre not getting that unless you give me what i need if you dont give me what i need you get a neon billboard screaming jaderious huntley is a punk for the cops and then you get some personal quality time with cyrus white huntley blinks with jittery speed as though his eyelids are a meter for brain activity i look over at james ervin the retired cop has the eyes of a beagle perpetually sad what does he think about me interrogating a fellow black man does he see jaderious as a brother or does he see a lost soul who long ago gave himself over to evil if hes that scared ervin says quietly cyrus must be close by jaderious turns to ervin close enough to cut your motherfucking head off old man you tomass mother fucker ervin stares at the drug courier for a bit then takes three deliberate steps toward him and looks down into his face boy you nothing he says you know that you worse than nothing you dragging your whole people backwards and you dont even know it and you aint got nobody but yourself to blame jaderious turns his head and looks at the wall as though pulling a curtain around himself james ervin walks to the door i say feed him to his boss i join ervin at the door come on dad hes too stupid to save himself my hand is on the doorknob when huntley says hold up now i open the door the snitch jumps up from his chair i said hold up dog your mouth is moving but i dont hear anything fresh panic twists his face even this desperate to live he cant wring the information out of himself i dont know where cyrus be man but i know somebody who might i step outside the apartment i aint playing man thats all i got please dog its cyruss cousin this stops me whats his name stoney washington i look at james ervin he nods and says hes a truck driver couple of possession busts thats him says jaderious cyrus fucked up his sister quenisha was a ho over in ferriday and she got crossed up with cyrus over some coke and jaderiouss eyes close then open slowly cyrus fucked her up man how the snitch shakes his head again tell us he cut her up man he messed up her insides and shit i dont want to think about it cyrus be bad man hes like the devil when hes mad why you think i been talking to sonny because he could send you to parchman jaderious stops twitching and stands before us like a starving soldier in the act of surrender no man cyrus makes parchman look like christmas i knew that girl i loved her she was a ho but i dont care bout that now she just be fucked up stays home all the time takes medicine to keep her from killing herself i force myself to focus on the problem at hand what about her cousin stoney still be tight with cyrus moves shit for him in his truck after the thing with quenisha cyrus made him choose see stoney swore he wouldnt try to do nothing bout what cyrus had done said nisha deserved that shit what else could he say go on if stoney believes you can really take cyrus down he might talk to you you give me your number and ill call you you think im stupid jaderious what choice you got dog you wouldnt be here if you had something else and ill probably be dead tomorrow anyway from behind me my father says give him your number penn i pick a pizza box off the floor and write my cellular number on it then i walk back to the door wait jaderious cries what you forgot to give me the stuff the shit to make me puke id already forgotten dad opens his bag and digs in it for a few seconds then he takes out the bottle of syrup of ipecac we purchased at walgreens an hour ago open your mouth he tells jaderious huntley obeys will this get me high doc no low in a few minutes youre going to make a beeline for the john dad pours a stream of the syrup down jaderiouss throat the snitch gags then swallows three times when he straightens up he grimaces without a word he walks swiftly out of the room throw an opened syringe in his trash i tell dad he does and then we depart theres a reception committee waiting at the foot of the stairs two large black men in their thirties block our passage with a woman who looks about sixty standing to the side of them what yall doing up there asks one of the men you cops or what before i can answer dad says i was making a house call that boy was near death he was trying to go cold turkey and it almost killed him what you mean house call asks the woman doctors dont make house calls no more i do dad says walking to the bottom of the stairs without the slightest hint of anxiety you ought to know that iola johnson the womans eyes go wide dr cage dad smiles in the flesh what you doing up in here lord i aint seen you in twenty years i should have known you though that boys sick iola dope sick his mama called me and then james ervin called me and i thought id better get on out here the woman shakes her head in wonder that boy aint no good dr cage hes all up in that dope just like most of these young nogoods she nods at the men with her we didnt know who you was thats all me and my boys try to stay up with who comes and goes round here now and then we get some bad white men who have you been seeing for medical care dad asks dr jeffers iola cackles aint been seeing nobody aint had to thank god aint got no money to see one i tell you though old arthur starting to get me now that im getting up in years dad gives the woman advice about her arthritis and then we walk out to james ervins truck as the engine rumbles to life jaderiouss terror comes back to me and with it his description of cyruss acts of retribution im talkin bout mutilating people man cutting off parts and shit drilling holes in their bones while they still alive dog its time to get annie out of town i say softly past time dad agrees he turns to ervin thank you james the retired cop shakes his head his beagle eyes filled with pain this world be goin down dr cage i never seen it this bad its like the end times or something dad squeezes ervins knee but says nothing then he turns to me and says i read that mayor jones finally stepped down perfect timing as ever i heard that too you heard what james just said do you still think you want that job im considering it caitlin seems to think this town doesnt want to be saved i recall you expressing that sentiment not long ago not precisely that sentiment dad reaches into his pocket takes out a cigar and begins unwrapping it theres a quote i rememberi dont recall where its from it may be the torah what is it i ask ready to hear a proverb about the wisdom of knowing when to walk away from something just because you will not see the work completed does not mean you are free not to take it up dad smiles and takes out his lighter or something to that effect like moses intones james ervin he never saw the promised land but he sho led his people there sho did dads eyes twinkle with mischief an hour after we left brightside manor annie and my parents were on highway south bound for the relative safety of jackson when i got home i found caitlin sitting on my front steps it was odd to see her at rest without even a cell phone in her hand i started to ask if she wanted to cook dinner together but before i got five words out she stood and put her finger to my lips then she took my hand and led me through the blue door she didnt stop in the kitchen but walked me down the hall to the door of my bedroom there she stood on tiptoe and gave me a long gentle kiss the resentment that kept me from making love with her two nights ago still simmered somewhere within me but id been through too much in the intervening time to worry about who was right or wrong about anything desire rose in me with primal intensity and caitlin responded with passion bordering on violence as our clothes fell around us she turned and splayed both hands against the wall then thrust her hips back against me i stood back for a moment enthralled by the black mane of hair falling over her shoulder blades hurry she said roughly chapter im sitting in the center city grill a microcosm of new orleans located at the geographical center of downtown natchez center city has a brick courtyard wroughtiron tables lush ferns a fountain a good bar and welltraveled owners of some cultivation as the local euphemism goes seated across the table from me is jaderious huntley the snitch is wearing black sweatpants and a dirty tshirt and he looks about as twitchy as a junkie waiting for his next fix this morning jaderious called me to say that stoney washington was willing to talk to me about cyrus but only facetoface that smelled like a trap to me so i said the meeting would have to happen at a public place of my choosing jaderious put this to stoney who reluctantly agreed i chose center city grill because its always busy at lunch and also because jaderious and stoney are unlikely to run into anyone who would recognize them here why didnt stoney come with you i ask jaderious looks anxiously at the nearby tables theyre filled but nobodys paying attention to us stoney dont want to be seen with me bad for his health dont worry hell be here my cell phone vibrates its caitlin calling from the newspaper office ill call her back after the meeting i cant relax my vigilance with jaderious for even a moment he looks like hed bolt if a waitress dropped a tray what you gonna do if you find cyrus he asks talk to him jaderious shakes his head you crazy you want to stay far away from that cat you ought to just walk away now both of us theres still time to call stoney and forget it after this you might be free of me but youre staying for this meeting you have to make sure im talking to the right guy jaderious freezes his eyes fixed on something behind me i turn and glance at the main entrance of the restaurant to get in or out of center city patrons walk through a long courtyard lined with wroughtiron tables then pass through a door with windows set in it right now a black man of about twenty with a red rag tied on his head is standing outside that door surveying the tables inside is that stoney i ask jaderiouss chair screeches on the floor i whirl and grab his arm before he can run jaderious is half out of his seat with terror i grab his arm and hold him tight who is that one of cyruss guys i gotta get out of here okay just stay calm he wont do anything while were sitting with all these people i can have cops here in two minutes jaderious looks at me like im insane man hell shoot all these motherfuckers to get me we gots to go now i look toward the kitchen theres probably an exit there but ive never seen it there is however a small door in the back wall of the main dining room that leads to an alley on busy days ive sometimes parked in that alley and entered the restaurant that way whats he doing now i ask looking straight at me jaderious whispers im dead man awshit theres a back way out a door in the wall almost directly behind you about thirty feet away hes coming in man i rise and pull jaderious to his feet as i lead him between the tables toward the door i reach into my jacket pocket for my cell phone you got a gun jaderious asks yes tell me if he pulls his i pull out my cell phone and dial a female voice says emergency this is penn cage i say quietly theres about to be a shooting at the center city grill get some squad cars here as fast as possible call chief logan and tell him what i said were almost at the door i pocket the phone and grip the butt of dads browning you open it i tell jaderious he does penn cagewarbles a woman from the table nearest the door its one of my mothers friends i smile at her then slip through the door and pull it shut after me jaderious is already sprinting toward main street wait i yell fuck that shit i charge after him hes younger than i am but im betting a junkies wind wont last long jaderious slows down to slip around a work van blocking the alley i speed up hoping to finesse the gap between the van and the wall at high speed as i twist my body someone leans out of the vans side door and slams a fist into my chest the breath explodes from my lungs as i tumble forward the man who hit me catches me under the arms and drags me inside the van he throws me onto the metal floor steps on my chest and jerks my gun from my jacket while he slides the side door shut the engine roars to life and the van races up the alleyaway from jaderious when the foot leaves my chest i see that im lying in an open space with power tools all around me my assailant an enormous black man wearing a purple alcorn braves football jersey is sitting on a homemade bench that runs the length of the vans cargo area the van lurches to the right onto franklin street then left again hello mr cage says a deep voice from behind my head i tilt my head back a heavily muscled black man is sitting against the bulkhead of the van he has a bald head and dark penetrating eyes a solitary gold chain adorns his neck cyrus i ask the bald man grins oh yeah he looks back at his compatriot hold him down blue the mountain of a man who hit me rises into a crouch and plants what must be a size nike running shoe in the center of my chest again i stomp on your heart he says youll be dead so dont do nothing i wont a strange and powerful hissing sound comes from behind my head filled with unreasoning panic i jerk my head back again cyrus is holding a small blowtorch in his hand waiti scream recalling jaderiouss tales of torturewhat do you want to know cyrus bellylaughs at my terror the man called blue just shakes his head im trying to think of a way to bribe cyrus when he picks up a stainlesssteel spoon from the bench and holds the flame of the blowtorch to its bottom he smiles as he watches the spoon then kills the flame and sets the spoon on the bench a white blister pack like those in my fathers medical bag appears in his hand cyrus rips it open and removes a syringe then he draws whatever is in the spoon into the syringe what are you doing i ask are you going to give me an overdose cyrus holds up the syringe and taps it a couple of times naw man gonna give you just the right amount give you a nice little ride i try to twist away from the needle but blue puts more weight behind his nike it feels like a tree trunk pinning me to the floor get his vein up says cyrus blue cocks dads browning presses the barrel against my forehead then closes his free hand around my left biceps with an iron grip he got good veins man cyrus squats beside me his black eyes gleaming then he slips the needle into my antecubital vein with the casual expertise of a phlebotomist i dont feel the prick but when he depresses the plunger of the syringe i feel absolute terror what was iti scream blue releases my biceps cyrus pats my inner elbow then gets back up on the bench youll find out he says his eyes shining here it comes the first thing i feel is a rush of warmth to my stomach just below my heart then it spreads outward suffusing my limbs with a wholly unfamiliar numbness panic balloons in my chest but just as suddenly the pressure evaporates and my muscles go limp dont fight it urges cyrus let it find the place what jesus dust says cyrus look at his eyes says blue shit dog he gone now cyrus laughs deep in his chest where we going asks an unfamiliar voice the driveri cant make my head turn to look my muscles refuse to obey my nerves you know where says cyrus you still with us mr cage i try to answer but what emerges from my mouth is one long meaningless syllable yeahsays cyrus infinitely amused by my behavior blue leans over me and laughs like a father watching his baby trying to speak his first words i come awake on a sleeping bag on a hard floor a metal floor i roll over and squint against bright fluorescent lights here he is says a deep voice here he comes cyrus is sitting in an office chair about eight feet away from me his elbows on his knees his dark eyes on me the huge man called blue leans against the wall behind him how you feel asks cyrus i dont know weird thats the dust you never done heroin a ripple of shock courses through me but the reaction is strangely muted no cyrus nods happily sweet aint it my watch is gone so is my cell phone what time is it party time laughs cyrus oh yeah says blue his voice cant be much higher than barry whites where are we look around suggests cyrus you dont know the room appears to be a laboratory of some sort thirty feet wide by forty feet long it contains several pieces of what appears to be industrial electrical equipment in the far corner a naugahyde recliner sits before a small television on a counter a sleeper sofa stands against another wall against the wall to my right is some sort of mechanical cart emblazoned on its steel side is a blue trident with the letters tbc beneath it triton battery i ask cyrus nods my old employer they helping me out now in ways they never dreamed i used to work here too the summer after my freshman year in college yeah most everybody worked here at one time or other here or ip the triton battery company came to natchez in to build batteries for pullman railcars in they retooled the line to manufacture batteries for diesel submarines after the war it was truck batteries marine batteries whatever fit the changing market when the plant shut down three years ago triton was using its ancient equipment to produce motorcycle batteries for european and asian manufacturers what part of the plant are we in testing area its the only part where the airconditioning still works this and the guardhouse this is my temporary crib if im not dead its because cyrus needs me alive for something probably information again jaderiouss stories of torture zing through my head how should i play it tell everything i know right away or hold something back so that ill have something to give up later a predator like cyrus wont believe ive revealed everything until he sweats something out of me but what does he want to know what am i doing here you on ice man thats what they call it in the gangster movies why am i on ice cause i cant have you running around town stirring up shit and causing aggravation old shads got the right idea and we need to let him get his business done are you talking about the trial or the election cyrus looks puzzled the mayors election i nod what you got to do with that nothing im talking about the trial man of course you dont want me investigating kates murder at the mention of her name the humor vanishes from cyruss eyes like i said i cant have you stirring up any shit and you been stirring up a lot of it this past week with druginduced stupidity i say did you kill her cyrus his bullet head draws back on his neck you think i did that i dont know i know you wanted to sleep with her a slow almost reptilian blink yeah i wanted her but she didnt want you he looks over at blue then studies me in silence i read your emails i say softly you threatened her the drug dealers black eyes flash with anger he gets up from his chair closes the distance between us and squats beside me that wasnt any of your business you know youre right i justits the dope talking cyrus flexes his right forearm as though doing imaginary curls everybody know who killed that bitch anyway right who dr elliott an image of cyrus tracking kates cell phone by computer comes into my head but arguing with him about kates murder under these circumstances could be suicidal how long am i going to be here that depends how long you think the trial will take a week maybe thats how long you gonna be here then when blue first dragged me into the van and i saw cyruss face i was certain i would die when that fear lessened the horror of torture rose in me but now the reality is settling in im going to be held prisoner until drews trial is over i wont be able to investigate further for quentin hell be facing the trial in two days with little or no good information a private detective hired at this point wont be able to learn anything meaningful and thats why im hereto ensure drews conviction the side effects of my kidnapping will be more personal unless cyrus demands some sort of ransom my family will believe ive been murdered my father and mother annie you gonna be on the nod most of the time cyrus says that weeks gonna go by like a day for you maybe two you aint gonna get hungry you aint gonna get hornyyou just gonna get happy numb baby the weight of the world gonna be lifted off your shoulders you gonna be thanking me and when the trials over he shrugs thats up to you youre going to let me go if i wanted you dead youd be lying in that alley behind the restaurant i dont get it from what i hear youre not a half measures kind of guy cyrus begins cracking his knuckles starting with his left forefinger he maintains his squat as effortlessly as a major league catcher during this operation i tell you how it is he says im thorough all right i checked you out you aint no civilian you sent a lot of people to huntsville prison bangers killers klan everything and about five years ago you damn near got the head of the fbi sent to jail its true of course the crime committed by the fbi director was not committed as director but as a field agent assigned to mississippi in i kill you cyrus says thered be consequences this is a nice idea but probably untrue my father would likely commit the rest of his life to finding out who had murdered me but no nationwide quest for vengeance by a cabal of powerful cops would result theres an exdelta force operator who might get upset about my demise but he has a living to make although now that i think about it daniel kelly might just take it into his head to get some payback if i were murdered and anybody with kelly on his ass truly has a problem did jaderious set me up i ask cyrus stands and walks over to the counter where the tv and microwave stand we got lean cuisine and dr pepper got some dannon in that fridge over there you take what you need but dont be getting up in my pringles got it leave your pringles alone cyrus looks at blue and says hes smart aint he blues big belly rolls with laughter you just bide your time says cyrus enjoy the ride when the trials over if youve been a good boy you can leave here the way you come good as new a little rehab maybe or you can become a customer i wouldnt blame you not many people can chase the dragon and walk away its too good like classy white pussy gone bad why do you want to keep me high i ask genuinely puzzled why not just lock me in here cause this is where im staying part of the time and i dont need you bugging me trying head games and shit you on the nod its less stress on you and me both for me itll be like you aint even here youll be like a pet dog or something you okay with that fine if im still alive im okay with just about anything i thought so but you listen right cyrus points at me i dont want to kill you but i will understand you cause me any kind of shit you become even a minor inconvenience and ill send you right back to the void clear clear and dont even think about not taking the dust cause i know how to hurt a motherfucker so does my crew i dont reply cyrus takes a cup of yogurt from the fridge and rips off the foil top after two or three days you gonna be begging for the shit anyway wait and see you wont want to live without it how do you come and go from here i ask dont they have security cyrus spoons yogurt into his mouth tritons got an old nigger manning the guardhouse at night he works for me though not those motherfuckers how much more perfect could it get cyrus can live in relative luxury two miles from town and keep tabs on his drug business without any fear of discovery by the police me and blue gotta make a couple runs tonight he says setting down his yogurt so its time to hit you up again dont make us hold you down you do that you gonna pay a price i tell myself not to resist the injection but when cyrus starts cooking the heroin my adrenaline begins to pump when he picks up a loose syringe off the counter i cant help but back away fuck cyrus mutters blue blue pulls a small revolver from his pocket and points it at me he forces me into the nearest corner then cracks the gun against my left shoulder with deceptive speed my arm goes numb from shoulder to wrist lay down now he says in a surprisingly mild voice aint no use fighting just gon make it worse on you self has anybody else used that needle cyrus shakes his head its the same one i used on you in the van come on were running late dont make me hurt you fighting all my natural instincts i lie on the sleeping bag and let blue squeeze my biceps to pump up my antecubital vein cyrus slips in the needle again no pain whatever as a test i begin counting softly when i hit seven the rush begins again it starts in my belly then spreads outward through my limbs a heat like the warmth of plunging into a woman envelops my entire body is it good asks blue how you feel like a jellyfish i murmur but im part of the water most people say its like their mamas womb i nod in vague agreement could bedont remember blue giggles like a little boy i get back to the womb another way cyrus says right blue oh yeah best way there is maybe i can remember i think aloud go back in time you know no cyrus intones dont work that way he kneels beside the sleeping bag and lifts my sagging chin until im looking into his deep black eyes let me tell you bout time brother i done some reading on that shit people say time be like a river thats bullshit you can swim upstream and downstream in a river can you do that with time hell no time aint no river time is a big fucking razor blade scraping across the universe and the edge of that razor is now see thats all there is man no upstream or down no past or futurejust now and all the stuff we feel like hoping and feeling sorry for shit thats nothing useless nothing matters in this world but now iunderstand your metaphor i manage to slur but things we do in this now can change our reality in the later now see thats whywhy what we do matters cyrus stares at me working out my logic then he shakes his head you missing the point dog its cause youre on the dust thats the only thing that can take away the now dust blurs it like stretches it out into this big warm blanket thats why people kill to get it no i whisper but my grip on reason is fading fast this stuffis the now it takes away the past and future its the only thing that can cyrus laughs oh yeah you way up in the good now am i i ask wondering if im speaking at all cyrus stands sleep tight brother enjoy the ride he walks toward the door but before he opens it my eyelids fall and i snuggle under the warm blanket that heroin has thrown over my soul cyrus was right about the passage of time soon i had no idea whether it was day or night whether five minutes had passed or five hours the heroin came and went like a warm tide and my consciousness waxed and waned with it people came and went too but i paid scant attention an elderly black man in a uniform a white girl jaderious huntley a teenager and always blue who administered my heroin as lovingly as a gifted nurse if cyrus looked like an nfl cornerback blue was a nose tackle blue was refrigerator perry with a kind face blue was my nurturing angel heroin was something else heroin was an epiphany suddenly all the disjointed images id never understood made sense the generations of englishmen who gave up everything to lie in opium dens in india the ragged junkies in the houston court system the scottish fuckups in trainspotting tuesday weld indog soldiers even frank sinatra shooting up in the man with the golden arm back in my fathers day this was why those people did what they did this was what they were after you go your whole life without understanding something you know people who do itwho are even obsessed with itbut you feel no pull yourself and then you experience it and the earth shifts on its axis i think the fact that id tried other drugs in college created my misconception of heroin marijuana took away anxiety made my head thick and mellow powdered cocainethe three times i tried itsent me into a euphorically controlled high during which i felt capable of anything but heroin shortcircuits pain right at its source it bathed me in a primitive bliss that must indeed be the closest thing to the womb hour after hour i lay half comatose on the floor of the lab trying to get my conscious mind around what was happening in the base of my brain i couldnt do it eventually i realized that time was indeed passing drews trial had begun cyrus showed me copies of the examiner the changing front pages showed photos of shad drew quentin even me but it was all so far away like something happening on the other side of the world i knew i should fight what was happening to me but how could i blue outweighed me by a hundred pounds and cyrus wore his pistol all the time he even wore it while watching dvds in his recliner he watched them on the little thirteeninch sony on the counter against the wall even when he wasnt watching movies he played them his taste surprised me he watched a lot of science fiction the original versions of the thing and the planet of the apes kubricks a space odyssey he watched conspiracy films from the seventies the conversation the parallax view war films the bridge on the river kwai and the great escape perhaps most surprising of all cyrus watched westerns he seemed to choose his westerns by their stars steve mcqueen robert mitchum henry fonda and he watched the godfather over and over again i figured his cinematic tastes might have developed during his service in the gulf war most of the time cyrus ignored me but he would talk to me about movies he was stunned and pleased to learn that the bridge on the river kwai and the planet of the apeshad been written by the same man i remarked that he seemed young to be a fan of such old movies and he laughed mama had a boyfriend he said all that guy did was watch hbo and tnt classics he never worked man he had a job as a bag man for a guy who ran numbers but that was it hed just watch movies and drink id sit there with him all day long eating fish sticks and watching movies i got to liking them like meditation you know thats why i run them all the time the way most people listen to music movies are my drug man he showed me a newspaper article with a picture of my father above it he said dad had hired private experts to mount a search for me i asked if i could read the article but cyrus refused you just keep cool he said pretty soon the jurys gonna convict the doc and you can go home to your little girl i peered into his eyes searching for deception why wouldnt i be a fool to believe that cyrus grinned good question but you got people on your side you dont even know about what do you mean lets just say the words out in the community that i might have you and im hearing things about making sure you dont get hurt del paytons widows making some noise for one althea payton is the widow of the factory worker whose murder i solved five years ago in the matrix of natchez society shes the equivalent of coretta scott king then theres the preacher of mandamus baptist cyrus goes on where your maid went to church quentin averys put in his two cents worth and then theres your daddys patients which seems to be about half the black people in this town this gave me some real hope what about shad johnson cyrus laughed hard at that i think hed be fine if you didnt make it i laughed with him trying to foster some sense of comradeship cyrus might be a monster when it came to his business but he seemed sincere about letting me go if he wasnt why hadnt he killed me the first day my best strategy was to wait out drews trial and do nothing to upset my captor drew and quentin would have to make it on their own as always when the effects of the heroin began to fade manic anxiety began building in my mind but blue returned and injected me again and again i felt content to wait out my term in the wilderness soon cyrus and blue left to make a run somewhere as they often did when i was on the nod so i decided to make a trip to the restroom i threw off the top half of my sleeping bag and forced myself to get up i told my feet to walk but they refused they were asleep i stood there for a while waiting for my circulation to normalize then i tried to walk again no progress i looked down at my feet they looked strange they were the wrong color almost blue reallyespecially the toes i reached out for the wall to stabilize myself then slowly rose up and down on my toes after about a minute of this the feeling slowly returned to my feet as my toes woke up the blue faded away i figured it was no big deal chapter im going to die here im going to die because cyrus white has no real knowledge about the human body and because in the endas he told me in the beginninghe doesnt really care if i survive or not three days ago as best i can remember my feet began to burn around the same time my hands and face began to tingle i wrote this off to the heroin but the symptoms didnt abate between fixes they got steadily worse two days ago when i sat on the commode the underside of my thighs began to burn i tried to ignore the stinging pain but after thirty seconds i had to stand up a half hour later i tried again same result my skin couldnt tolerate the pressure of the toilet seat without intense pain thats when the paradox hit me i was mainlining a powerful painkiller yet i was feeling pain that night my chin went numb and stayed that way then the hair on my head began standing up in different places like a fear reactiononly i wasnt afraid this erection of small groups of hairs coincided with the onset of shooting sensations in my face much like electrical shocks they werent acutely painful but they were icy cold and they left numbness in their wake by morning i had to sit on the commode to urinate because i got dizzy trying to stand i couldnt stay seated long enough to finish so i squatted over the bowl like a girl in a nasty bathroom what the hell was happening to me if i stood erect for any length of time my hands would grow painfully heavy as though overfilling with blood when i held them up to my face i was shocked to see that my palms were dark red with a bluish cast only by holding my hands above my head could i get the blood to drain out of them cyrus and blue thought i was crazy to be afraid that i was freaking out over normal drug effects i prayed they were right but the next time i sat on the john the tip of my penis began to sting so badly that i had to roll onto the floor it took several minutes for the pain to ease when i examined myself i saw that the tip of my penis was blue though the skin eventually pinked again two tiny black pinpoints remained dead tissue my extremities werent getting enough blood as the symptoms worsened i began to experiment every time i stood erect blood gathered in my feet and hands until they ached and pounded the veins around my ankles bulged with pressure sitting on the john caused the blood in my torso to collect in my abdomen and also in the only extremity attached to my abdomen after a few hours of experimenting i realized what was happening my extremities were getting adequate arterial flow the problem was my veins they werent carrying away the deoxygenated blood fast enough something was interfering with my venous circulation cyrus quickly tired of hearing me catalog my symptoms when i showed him my red hands and bulging veins he shrugged and returned his attention to das boot he muttered that hed never seen heroin cause problems like that or at least not so quickly plus he assured me the batch he was using on me was exceptionally pure i told him i was probably having an allergic reaction of some kind an immune reaction possibly something in the heroin was causing inflammation in my blood vesselsprobably an adulterant used to cut the drug cyrus told me to shut up and let him watch his movie it was usually best to let him alone but panic had begun gnawing at my brain when your skin starts to die before your eyes your common sense gets a little out of whack my plea to be spared further doses of heroin produced exactly the opposite result when the sound of cyruss little blowtorch filled the room i scrambled into the corner and put up my fists cyrus called in blue and another guy and ordered them to hold me down then began prepping the dose i marshaled my fear and tried to channel it into strength something in the heroin was killing me and one more dose might finish the job but i was no match for blue and his companion cyrus was still laughing when he popped the needle into my vein i screamed in rage and terror but within ten seconds the jesus dust performed its magic a rush of warmth bathed my soul and my health concerns suddenly seemed rather academic in nature the shooting pains in my face became interesting events like lightning bolts across a summer sky the black pinpoints of flesh on my penis became decorative tattoos aboriginal art that some unknown artist had added to my manhood during my sleep but hours later as i began to come down i knew id been right about having a reaction to something in the powder whenever i changed position i felt tidal shifts of blood in my body when i laid down my stomach would pound for two or three minutesnot my heart but my abdominal aorta when i tried to stand consciousness flickered my face went numb and the inside of my left thigh would throb my femoral artery was trying desperately to shunt adequate blood through a system crippled by clogged veins cyrus laughed as i wavered on my feet assuming i was still stoned i knew then that if i didnt get out of the factory i would die in it i had to find a way out that or a way to kill cyrus and blue i curled into my sleeping bag and waited for them to leave hours later after cyrus and blue disappeared on a run i struggled to my feet and began to inventory the lab despite my pain and fear i quickly discovered a reason for hope i didnt know much about battery production but i knew a lot more than cyrus and his crew the lab contained quite a few leftover parts and other materialsmaterials that knowledgeable men would not have left lying around there were boxes of lead plates stacked against one wall and also rolls of electrical wire the cart id seen when i first awakened in the lab had a trickletype battery charger sitting on it i forced myself to stay calm and proceed methodically ten minutes later i found two glass bottles among some plastic ones containing floor cleaner when i removed their cork stoppers i smelled nothing but i had a feeling that the cloudy liquid in the bottom of one of the bottles wasnt water to test it i dropped a bit of wire i found on the floor into the bottle the wire began to steam five minutes later it was gone sulfuric acid the presence of acid in the lab was no big surprise its one of the two main components of leadacid batteriesthe main product of the triton battery company but how could the acid help me if i flung it into cyruss eyes it would cause intense pain but it wouldnt stop him from shooting me strong acid could burn through the metal lock on the door but a cursory examination revealed dead bolts in addition to the lock in the doorknob to eat through those bolts id have to slosh acid through the narrow crack again and again i didnt have enough acid to do that and even if i did someone outside might notice what i was doing in the end i used the acid to further my exploration of the lab the bank of cabinets that cyrus used for a tv stand had padlocks on its doors if the cabinets were locked i reasoned there must be something worth protecting inside them the question was did they contain something triton battery wanted to protect or something cyrus had stashed here i held the glass bottle over the padlock and carefully dripped sulfuric acid on the curved metal shackle of the lock the metal hissed and bubbled it took eight minutes to eat through the shackle when it was done i pried the lock from the doors and pulled the cabinet open inside were several leadacid batteries stacked in a metal frame the batteries appeared to be wired together in series their presence in this room was a violation of federal environmental law on the storage of hazardous materials but as quentin avery would know such laws are honored more in the breach than the observance even the thought of law made me laugh so comically irrelevant was it to my quest for survival but what about the batteries could they be of use at first i thought not after all they would be dead after two years in storage but then i remembered the battery charger on the cart if the batteries still contained their lead plates and acid they could be charged i popped the cell caps off two batteries on top of the array and found fluid inside trying not to get ahead of myself i sat on the edge of cyruss recliner and stared at the batteries i felt like id gone to sleep and awakened in an episode of macgyver only i didnt have macgyvers knowledge of all things mechanical i had however spent a summer working in this plant on the loading dock its true but id talked to a lot of people in other jobs something tickled the back of my brain what batteries could be dangerous of course everyone who worked at triton battery knew that but it wasnt the acid that was dangerous as most people thought acid could burn you but it couldnt explode it wasnt even flammable no the explosive danger came from hydrogen every rechargeable battery in the world produces hydrogen gas usually its produced in small amounts that remain sealed in the battery case but because of its light molecular weight hydrogen is more prone to leak than any other gas hydrogen is what kills people who get careless when jumping off the dead battery in their car if they connect the negative jumper cable to the dead battery rather than elsewhere on their car they create a spark above the battery and if hydrogen is present boomits lead plates through the skull and a corrosive acid bath there were warning signs all over the triton plant when i worked herebeware hydrogen gas is invisible i remember a safety guy walking slowly through the loading dock with a straw broom trying to detect a hydrogen fire in open air hydrogen burns almost invisibly giving off only a faint blue light the old black guys on the dock called that straw broom the witches broom as i stared at the batteries the excitement in my chest grew swiftly but with it came fear id wanted a weapon and id found one but that weapon was not controllable it was the kind of weapon that could only be used by someone with nothing to lose someone who was going to die anyway as i searched for some other way out of the lab a realization hit me with nauseating certainty you have no alternative you can wait to die here or you can kill yourself trying to get out that was twelve hours ago for the past eleven hours ive lain on my sleeping bag in a worsening state of heroin withdrawal cyrus and blue left the works for me this timesubstituting a book of matches for the blowtorcha merciful gesture in their minds a salve for the burgeoning junkie but i cant use that white powder to ease the aching hunger in my jaw muscles and back the blood pounding like a second heart in my abdomen tells me that if my veins continue to become inflamed i could stroke out or go into cardiac arrest a more immediate risk might be kidney failure thats a common cause of death in people with malignant high blood pressure which is what my condition resembles my plan is simplesimple and insanely dangerous it was cyruss tv sitting on the cabinets that inspired it i perched on cyruss recliner and worked it out in my head the heavy battery array could remain inside the cabinet i would take the trickle charger from the cart and put it inside the cabinet with the batteries then connect it to the first battery in the series then i would remove the cell caps from the batteries as the batteries charged hydrogen gas released by the lead plates would bubble steadily upward through the acid in the cells the closed cabinet would serve to confine the gas and confined hydrogen gas is basically a bomb all i needed was a fuse i found my fuse in less than a minute near the back of the soapstone countertop was a hole for electrical cords to pass through farther down the counter above the next cabinet was another hole both were sealed with rubber gaskets but the gaskets popped out easily the hole nearest the tv would be my fuse lighting it at the proper time would be the hard part but i resolved to deal with one problem at a time in my weakened physical state it took me half an hour to manhandle the charger off its cart and into the cabinet i shivered as i connected the leads to the first battery fearing that the cabinet might already contain free hydrogen when the leads were connected successfully i popped the caps off the battery cells and shut the cabinet doors the last step was to prep the tv for cyrus this trick i learned in seventh grade by watching a friend of mine blow the schools fuses from our study hall his technique was simple hed take a paper clip straighten it out then wrap the wire around both prongs of the electrical plug on the box fan at the back of the classroom then hed shut his eyes and jam the plug into the socket blue sparks would shoot from the wall and the lights would go out all over st stephens if im lucky cyrus will do the same thing for me ive spent eleven hours pondering everything that could possibly go wrong hydrogen is invisible as the triton signs warned me long ago if cyrus stays gone too long the gas will build to a lethal concentration and ill suffocate in here for that reason i cant let myself fall asleep then theres the paper clip i found a whole box of them in one of the lab drawers they looked like they were made of metal but what if theyre made of some nonconducting material a research lab might use something like that and then of course theres cyrus himself an unpredictable factor if ever there was one the moment i hear him unlocking the dead bolts ill have to jump up and pull the rubber gasket out of the hole in the countertop that will allow the trapped hydrogen to vent through the hole but to ignite that gas cyrus will have to insert the jerryrigged tv plug into the outlet above the countertop what if he finds the unplugged tv cord suspicious what if he simply gives me a onceover and leaves again as hes done a couple of times before what if what if what if the wait is killing me literally time is a big fucking razor blade scraping across the universecyrus told me no past or futurejust now maybe hes righti think i actually read something like that somewhere but right now i feel like hes wrong time is a river and i can swim backward in it as effortlessly as i please sometimes even when i dont want to think about the past it floods over me anyway a liquid wall of memory and emotion that sweeps away everything in its path lying on this sleeping bag my skin itching my muscles aching my mouth dry as sand i try not to let sadness overwhelm me as pictures of my wife float through my head my wife before the cancer got her i see her giving birth to annie screaming in agony and then smiling in exhaustion sarah is gone now of course but annie remains for a while i wonder if sarah has appeared to me because i will soon join her thats just fear i conclude think about annie annies still alive annie still needs you as i repeat this mantra over and over a new emotion is born within mestrangely enough for the first time its hatred not a generalized hatred but a highly specific animus directed at one man cyrus white because of cyrus i lie helpless in a locked room drifting slowly but steadily toward death because of cyrus my daughter might have to grow up without her father and she has already done without her mother for too long up until now i have excused cyrus in my head he hasnt tortured me as he has supposedly done to others he has promised me life did cyrus create himself no said my guilt cyrus is a product of the town we created but lying here now i reject that idea utterly cyrus had choicesmore than a lot of people less fortunate than he he made it out of this town he served in the military yet despite this chance to rise above his disadvantages he chose evil over good and not once but again and again images of the dead and injured fill my mind kate townsend sonny cross chris vogel the catholic kid in the hospital mike pinella paul and janet wilsoncyrus may not be directly responsible for all of them but he happily feeds the beast that took their lives and the next time he walks through that door i will devote every atom of my being to killing him im nearly asleep when i hear the click i tell my body to move but it doesnt respond im lying on the surface of jupiter with twice the gravity of earth sucking at my bones as the first dead bolt clicks open i roll over and struggle to my feet my belly pounds with terrifying pressure as i stagger over to the counter and pull the rubber gasket out of the countertop im only halfway back to my bag when cyrus opens the door what the fuck he says look at this junkie motherfucker trying to turn toward him i collapse on my sleeping bag what the hell are you doing he asks me you mainline that whole bag or something i groan in mock agony but i dont have to fake it much the pains shooting across my face feel like someones pinching me with pliers anger twists cyruss face when he looks at the countertop what the fuck this place is a mess im sick i grunt twisting my sleeping bag around me im sorry you sorry all right he walks into the room and stops motherfucker you been up in my pringles i was hungry junkie motherfucker i shoulda killed yo ass in the beginning i writhe on the sleeping bag then straighten out on my stomach ill be all right soon i justi dont know i close my eyes and lie still right now hydrogen gas is rising through the hole in the counter in an invisible column i got to get out of this place cyrus mutters got that old nigger in the guardhouse talking my ear off and back here i got your nasty ass im gonna lock you in a broom closet in the plant or something shit witches broomi whisper what i dont reply hey blue cyrus yells shoot this motherfucker up shut him up for a while heavy footsteps sound in the lab then soft creaks as cyrus sits in the naugahyde recliner shithe curses my tv dont work probably the remote says blue moving toward me with the blowtorch cyrus gets up and walks somewhere i want to look but i dont no he says slapping plastic its broken man plugged in asks blue the big man kneels beside me and picks up the baggie and the spoon thats it this stoned motherfucker done got into my pringlesand unplugged my tv if it was me on that syringe id waste his ass blue starts cooking the heroin you aint gonna fight me this time no the tiny roar of the blowtorch floods my system with adrenaline if the hydrogen escaping from the cabinet fills this room fast enough well all die before cyrus even picks up the tv plug i groan and roll onto my side so i can watch cyrus he has the plug in his hand hes holding it near the electrical socket but hes stopped to say something to blue you know why he aint fighting you cause the rush is worth the pain cyrus grins then pushes the plug into the socket theres no flame not even a flash but that side of the testing lab moves to this side without visibly traveling the space between my plan was to shelter under my sleeping bag but everything happened too fast now blues elephantine body lies across my head and torso and its not moving someone is screaming but its not blue i touch my mouth to see if its me its not with colossal effort i roll blue off me and look to my right cyrus is writhing on the floor screaming gibberish and clawing at his eyes his entire body is peppered with bloody wounds shrapnel wounds i realize fragments of the lead plates in the batteries they exploded out of the cabinet at supersonic speed and sliced through everything in their path thats what killed blue the top of his head is gone as though someone put it partway into a guillotine when i glance at his lower body i see that my own legs are bleeding from several wounds i retch but theres nothing in my stomach the shrill ring of a fire alarm sounds over cyruss shrieks theres no fire that i can see but the explosion obviously triggered something the custodian in the guardhouse is bound to investigate unsure of my legs i flatten my palms on the floor and struggle to my feet my legs are shaking badly but they seem able to support my weight the lab door is standing open but it may not be the only one between me and freedom i try not to look at cyruss face as i bend and take his keys from the ring on his belt loop his jerking torso is almost too much to take the acid blown out of the batteries has vaporized the cotton of his tshirt and is now eating into his skin cyrus claws at my wrist as i lift the keys but i yank my hand away and hurry to the door his screams follow me down the tiled corridor outside im not familiar with this part of the plant i have no idea where to go pausing by the door at the far end of the corridor i try to recall anything i can hey someone yells cyrus blue what happened in there wavering on my feet i move to the side of the door and flatten my back against the wall the door bursts open and a black man in a blue uniform runs through it making for the lab as he enters it i leave by the door he just came through now im in a much larger room the ceiling is thirty feet over my head the production line the fire alarm is louder here i see light a streetlight shining through a high window low down on that wall is another door and its standing open i walk toward it stumbling the last few yards my pants are soaked with blood im leaving a trail of it behind me when i clear the door new sirens cut through the shrill scream of the fire alarm i fall to my knees but i keep moving i have to get clear of the factory the custodian could shoot me just to cover his ass then blame my death on cyrus i smell the river nowits only five hundred yards to the westand kudzu too the greenest smell in the world as i crawl forward red light flashes crazily on the walls of the buildings around me i force myself to my feet and hold my hands high in the air a fire truck careens around a huge building on my left and bears down on me i wave my arms frantically but i dont have the energy to maintain my balance and i fall i hear a door slam then nothing chapter four hours after the fire department rescued memaybe twenty hours after blue last injected mei was lying in a bed in an intensive care unit cold sweat bursting from my pores by the twentyfourhour mark my skeletal muscles were cramping twisting me into a fetal position after thirty hours every cell in my body was screaming for heroin my father had to send a nurse to jackson for methadone there was none available in natchez an addiction expert he consulted by phone attributed my severe withdrawal after such a short experience with heroin to the likelihood that id received a steady flow of extremely pure product for six and a half days but it wasnt completely pure when i arrived in the er dad immediately diagnosed me with a dangerous vascular condition called hypersensitivity vasculitis my guess had been right whatever had been used to cut the heroin had triggered my immune system to attack my own body particularly my veins my bone marrow had begun churning out proteins called immune complexes which immediately began clogging my smallest veinsthe venules this silting process started in my extremities and steadily moved toward my core organs a bloodpressure reading taken on my arm in the er was but a reading taken from a cuff on my finger was i had an irregular heartbeat and tiny patches of skin on my toes and penis had died i assumed that stopping the injections of contaminated heroin would shortcircuit this immune reaction but dad soberly informed me that as long as the adulterant remained in my systemand he feared that some of it was embedded in the walls of my veinsthe potentially deadly immune reaction would continue he was considering a treatment called chelation but after he described it to me i felt more inclined to wait it out and hope for the best my legs had been peppered with shrapnel from the exploding batteries the wounds themselves werent severemy bones had escaped damagebut since the shrapnel was mostly lead fragments from the battery plates poisoning was a serious concern a surgeon spent two hours under a fluoroscope digging every fragment out of my body before dad admitted any visitors into my glasswalled cubicle in the icu he drew the curtains and stood close beside my bed the white hair and beard gave him the look of a doctor who had seen everything but i could tell that hed never dreamed of seeing his son like this annies had a tough time these past few days he said we all have but she had it the worst she thought you were dead and nothing we said to her would change her mind i guess losing her mother so young proved to her that the worst nightmares do come true you need to spend a lot of time with her penn you can count on it hows mom dad shook his head shes a tough old girl but this just about did her in she sat by the telephone day and night waiting for word i dont believe she slept more than three consecutive hours the whole time you were gone she was afraid they were going to find you in a ditch somewhere im sorry im sorry i got myself into this mess a small smile touched my fathers lips thats your nature son i understand it but youve got a family to think about i nodded dad looked through a crack in the curtains at the nurses station when they brought you into the er they put you on the same treatment table they put kate townsend on two weeks ago i saw jenny townsend that night and i felt just like her when i saw you dads jaw muscles flexed with the effort of holding in his emotion im not burying my son he said in a shaky voice i wont do it i reached up and gripped his wrist squeezing as hard as i could i couldnt just sit and wait he said i knew if there was a way to stay alive youd manage it after meeting with sheriff byrd and chief logan i called your old assistant and got the names of every fbi agent youd ever worked with i called them all and they lit a fire under the task force here i still wasnt convinced that was enough so i called dan kellys security company in houston daniel kelly is the former delta operator i considered bringing in to protect annie my father got to know him well during the del payton case kelly was still in afghanistan but twelve hours later he returned my call when he heard you were missing he promised to get back to the us by hook or by crook it took three days for a replacement to arrive in kabul but fortyeight hours ago kelly arrived in natchez and started searching for you he even brought a buddy with him to protect annie you may not believe it but kelly was planning to search the triton battery plant the day after you escaped i saw it in his daybook he has good instincts but i probably would have been dead when he found me dad shook his head slowly no doubt about it is he still in town yes he said to tell you hes waiting for instructions for some reason kellys continued presence brings me a blessed feeling of relief now dad said there are some people waiting to see you he turned to go but i said wait what is it what about cyrus white did they bring him into the er dad nodded but said nothing did he make it no he died bad dad left me in silence with my memories of cyrus and blue i felt no satisfaction at having killed them new predators would soon take their places in the local drug hierarchy and probably already had cyrus and blue had never meant to kill me but they had been content to watch me die by a process they didnt understand now they are dead and i am alive and that is all that matters two minutes after dad left the icu caitlin led annie into my room when annie stared at me as if unsure i was real i told her to climb up into my bed i hugged her tight and caitlin hugged us both from behind annie we watched an episode of leave it to beaver on tv land hardly speaking as we did but words didnt matter at that point my mother came into the room during the show she sat on the edge of my bed for a while with her hand on my knee she had aged visibly since i last saw her but i sensed that she was still far from broken when leave it to beaver ended she kissed me on the forehead then lifted a sleeping annie into her arms and left for home finally alone caitlin and i simply held each other both shivering from an emotion we could not name after a while she asked to see the damage done to my body by the vasculitis she cried then but she knew the outcome could have been much worse though i was still suffering from the reaction at least no more skin had died as for drews trial the news was almost all bad a few hours before caitlins visit shad had stunned the court by providing proof that kate had been visiting cyrus to procure drugs for drew who had then given them to his addicted wife to prove this shad produced four different witnesses each of whom knew only part of the story the most powerful of those witnesses caitlin said was ellen elliott herself because ellen was testifying about her drug habit and not giving direct testimony against her husband her testimony was allowed i figured ellen would be glad to give testimony that might convict drew but caitlin said ellen had been very hostile to shad during direct examination and as she left the witness box she appeared to have been shattered by the ordeal this testimony had fulfilled quentin averys worst fear and it left me deeply troubled cyrus himself had not known whom kate was buying the lorcet for so how had shad johnson divined that the hydrocodone was for ellen i resolved to discover this as soon as possible according to caitlin quentin had been playing catchup throughout the trial he had little inside information to work with and he was saddled with a client who seemed bent on selfdestruction drew remained firm in his belief that he should tell the whole truth about everything and he was still demanding to take the stand in his own defense that might happen as soon as tomorrow after caitlin returned to the newspaper office i settled back in my bed and tried to rest but my withdrawal symptoms made it impossible i was shaking like an epileptic when daniel kelly walked into my room i hadnt seen him for five years but he looked the same curly blond hair sea blue eyes an irish smile and a reserved manner kelly also sported a desert tan which somehow added to the aura of centeredness he always projected kelly knows how to go unnoticed in a crowd but when he reveals himself you know youre in the presence of a man of supreme competence i asked him what hed been doing in afghanistan and he gave me a typical oneword answer babysitting i thanked him for dumping his contract and playing seventh cavalry on my behalf but then i told him i was fine and that he could go back to asia kelly gave a small shake of his head and said ive been checking things out for a couple of days been to the trial been out in the street this thing isnt over penn it is for me kelly raised his eyebrows that may not be your choice i went out to triton battery and looked at the lab where they held youwhat was left of it and i found two pounds of ninetyeight percent pure heroin youfound it not the cops they took drug dogs out there but cyrus had figured a way to beat the dogs probably learned it in the air force ive seen most of those tricks in my time so i knew where to look ive learned to expect kelly to amaze me two pounds of pure heroin whats the street value of that you could buy a small island and the people who lost that dope are going to be mighty angry he gave me his cell number and told me he would stay within reach for the next couple of days at least then he squeezed my right hand in both of his and walked to the glass door by the way he said turning back to me that was a neat trick you pulled couldnt have done better myself i blew out a stream of air fighting a memory of blues massive body crushing mine necessitys the mother of invention right kelly smiled then his eyes twinkled and he was gone not long afterward quentin avery called me he apologized for not coming to the hospital but i understood a lawyer defending a client on a capital murder charge is one of the busiest people on earth quentin let me know he was glad that id survived but then he quickly asked if i had any rabbits i could pull out of my hat for him had i learned anything during my captivity that might help drew in the courtroom i had to tell him no when i asked for a summary of shad johnsons strategy quentin told a depressing tale though shads case remained circumstantial he had painted a compelling picture of marko bakic as the mystery man whod had consensual sex with kate within seventytwo hours of her death and then of drew as the older man whod discovered this infidelity and killed his underage paramour in a jealous rage dna analysis of the fetus in kates womb had proved it to be drews child but drew shad told the jury had no way of knowing that he might have believed the child belonged to marko or any other man shads hypothesis was helped greatly by the fact that no one had seen marko since the night of the xrave at oakfield shad had even suggested that drew had paid to have marko killed which would explain the croatians disappearance while don logans police department had been searching frantically for marko sheriff byrd had taken a more leisurely approach i wanted to laugh at the irony when quentin griped about this he himself had ordered me not to hunt down cyrus for the same reason it suited both lawyers purposes to work with a myth in court rather than a fleshandblood person who could contradict their theories i offered to put daniel kelly at quentins disposal but quentin demurred he didnt seem to grasp the value of kellys helpprobably because kelly has no inside knowledge of natchez late on my second night in the hospital mia called she told me she had wanted to visit earlier but that caitlin had told her it was best that i have as few visitors as possible this surprised and even angered me but on reflection i understood it took me a while to realize that mia was crying softly to raise her spirits i asked her to update me on the progress of her investigation i knew better than to believe my absence would end her nancy drew efforts mia had deduced that id been kidnapped or killed by either cyrus white or the asians since i had provoked both parties because she had no way to work the asian angle she had focused on cyrus the only possible line mia had into cyruss organization was marko so for the past week she had talked to every high school student in town trying to find some clue to markos whereabouts shed badgered alicia reynolds markos girlfriend but alicia had blown her off when mia tried to follow alicia in her car she quickly discovered that the police were doing the same thing after being warned off she went home and fell into a mild depression i thanked her profusely for everything shed done but this didnt bring her out of her mood shed cut school twice to attend drews trial she said and she had a bad feeling about the way it was going i wanted to see for myself but my withdrawal symptoms grew worse not better the methadone helped but it didnt stop the pain that bored like rusty nails into my bones i still had an irregular heartbeat as well but dad told me that was caused by the vasculitis not the withdrawal this morning i learned that shad and quentin were scheduled to give their closing statements but as badly as i wanted to hear them i simply couldnt function well enough to go to the courthouse it was all i could do to stand beside my bed for five minutes or sit in the visitors chair watching television i got so agitated at my failure that dad finally sedated me i lay in the bed half conscious waiting for an update from caitlin who was in the courtroom i waited in vain caitlin wasnt about to give up her seat in the packed courtroom to call someone who couldnt do anything about what was happening anyway i switched on the tv and tried to think about something else but it was no use id never felt so impotent in my life i lay shaking under the blanket troubled by thoughts of blue almost wishing the big man would appear at my bedside with his blessed syringe but he couldnt do that of course he was dead id cut the top of his head off with a battery plate when the sedative finally overwhelmed me i almost wept with relief penn penn wake up i blink my eyes in confusion my mother is standing beside my bed whats the matter caitlins on the phone the jurys back a bolus of adrenaline shoots through my body give it to me mom passes me the phone caitlin the jurys coming back in she whispers they deliberated ninetyfour minutes my face goes cold what do you think guilty if they see me on this phone theyll kick me out caitlin says im going to leave the connection open if you cant hear the verdict ill tell you as soon as i can my phone begins hissing like a link to outer space ive never listened to a jury verdict this way before a friend of mine once called me and held up his cell phone at a paul mccartney concert eleanor rigby i think who is the foreperson asks judge arthel minor his voice replacing the hiss with amazing clarity for some reason i dont hear the reply probably because the judge has a microphone while the jury box doesnt have you reached a verdict judge minor asks again nothing please pass the verdict to the clerk silence now but i know whats happening the clerk is giving the verdict to judge minor who will check to see if the jury has worded it correctly minor will then pass it to the clerk who will read the verdict aloud at least three deputies will surround drew to keep him from bolting in panic in the event of a guilty verdict or to protect him from angry relatives of the victim in the opposite event ladies and gentlemen says judge minor im warning you there will be no outbursts when the verdict is read or afterward there will be quiet and order do not test me or you will find yourself in the custody of the sheriff after a brief silence minor says read the verdict a female voice says in the matter of the state of mississippi versus drew elliott we find the accused guilty on two counts of the charge of firstdegree murder during commission of a felony i sag against my pillow did you hear that caitlin whispers i heard i cant believe it believe it are you okay yes go i know you need to work wait judge minors going to poll the jury they always do that in capital cases its over caitlin ill call you as soon as i can she promises i let the phone drop and reach for my water glass i wish there were some way i could talk to drew right now hes standing at his table in shock quentin avery beside him watching judge minor excuse the family of the victimjenny townsend and perhaps her exhusband next drews family will be excused i wonder who was there for him his parents are dead ellen probably not timmy is certainly not there but after whoever is there for him has left the courtroom drew will be escorted straight back to the county jail what can he be thinking an innocent man convicted of capital murder the realization that twelve citizens believed him capable of brutally raping and murdering a young girl will stun drew into shock if it wasnt for tim id be afraid he might try to kill himself penn are you all right asks my mother yes what happened guilty they found drew guilty oh my god oh no peggy cage takes several steps around the room then stops shaking her head i just dont believe it i watched that boy grow up he ate tuna fish sandwiches in my house every day every summer for years that boy was raised right theres no way on earth he hurt that poor girl like that no way this world has turned upside down i agree with you but twelve other people dont fools she says conclusively poor protoplasm it was a solid case mom but it doesnt matter now now drew has to look toward the appeal did he get the death penalty thats a separate phase of the trial they may do that today or they might wait until tomorrow mom walks back to my bed her eyes worried you look bad penn worse than you did two minutes ago i dont feel too good i admit im going to get your father to give you something something to help you sleep i dont need anything mom you let me worry about that ten minutes later my father appears a syringe in his hand if only he had what blue used to bring me but soon enough im gone again penn i groan and force myself to open my eyes who is it i croak squinting against the light me who ellen ellen elliott my godare you all right its not as bad as it looks its probably worse i can see her now her skin greenish under the fluorescent lights ellen doesnt look too good herself shes lost weight over the past two weeks a lot of weight her color job is fading the nordic blond hair now rooted with brown and gray what time is it ellen did you hear the verdict she nods that was two hours ago penn oh were you in court no i couldnt watch i wanted to be with timmy ellen tries to force a smile but the effort goes in vain its very difficult to go out in public now people just stare and point like im some circus animal they dont spare timmy either the kids at schooltheyre awful thats what happens in these trials i dont blame you ellen i know drew missed you being in there for him though she gives me a mistrustful glance do you really think so i know it no matter whats happened between you today could mean the end of drews life and hes spent most of that life with you she blinks several times and then tears begin streaming down her cheeks how could they do that to him she raises a shaking hand to wipe her face hes given so much to this town to so many of those people how could they believe drew could do that i thought you believed it too ellen seems not to have heard me what am i supposed to do now i have a son penn what do i tell timmy try to explain things i guess tims old enough to understand some of it she shakes her head violently no hes younger than you think emotionally i mean ellen sits beside my bed then stands again immediately i cant get a handle on her emotional state maybe she cant either as i study her face her lips smeared with too much lipstick it hits me that she might be deep into drug withdrawal just like me with drew in jail and kate dead her sources for lorcet have dried up did you come just to visit me i ask or is there something i can do for you she sucks in her lips and knits her brow then she shakes her head several times as though having a silent conversation with herself ellen i want you to know something penn i dontdont know who else to tell you can tell me whatever it is im sure its all right no its not her red eyes burn into mine i killed kate penn it takes a moment for the words to register its as though ellen said i just arrived from the planet tralfamadore but she didnt say that she said i killed kate and she meant it tell me what youre talking about ellen are you speaking figuratively im afraid not no i killed her she holds up her hands i killed her with thesemy own two hands for a moment i wonder if im hallucinating but dad is giving me sedatives not lsd then it hits me ellen is lying shes trying to save drews life how did you kill her ellen i choked her i thought you were with your sister when kate died she shakes her head again your sister lied to protect you yes dont blame jackie though my pulse is returning to normal overcome with guilt about her past behavior in the marriage ellen is trying to save drew by sacrificing herself why dont you tell me what happened just sit down in that chair and let it out she looks at the chair with disdain i dont need to sit its simple really the day it happened i was supposed to be shopping with jackie but before i met her i stopped by drews office i wanted to show him some paint samples id gotten from sherwinwilliams for the living room did drew know you were coming no anyway when i got to his office i happened to walk past his car the volvo i saw a piece of paper taped to his window and something made me stop probably because it didnt look like an advertisement it looked like a note like i backed into your car by accident heres my phone numberthat kind of thing confusion enters ellens face but it wasnt it was a note from kate fresh anxiety wakes in my gut what did it say i need to see you meet me at the creek thats it yes did she sign it no how did you know it was from kate ellens eyes crinkle at the corners i didnt really not for sure but kate worked for us two summers id seen her handwriting lots of times so when i saw the note i thinkon some level i recognized it keep going tell me sequentially i drove back home and walked down to the creek did you leave the note on drews car no i took it with me why ellen touches her forefinger to her chin and taps it softly i dont know go on i took the path i used to take when i walked henry henry was their black lab now dead theres only a couple down there anyway i wasnt sure i was headed to the right spot and yetit was like the handwriting i had the same instinct if kate had written the note then i was going the right way i understand i walked down to this place about halfway between our two neighborhoods ellens gaze drops and she speaks like someone under hypnosis she was sitting on a log when i saw her she looked upset when i was about thirty feet away she looked up she didnt see me because i was under the trees then i stepped into the sunlight the look on her facei cant describe it my fists are tight under the covers tell me she was afraid of course but there was something else what relief that the truth was finally out i guess she must have been holding in so much for so long ellen actually sounds sympathetic but her feelings had to be much different on the day these events transpired what happened then i called out her name like a question kate she stood up then as though my words had brought her to life god she was a beautiful girl ellen suddenly fixes me with a furious glare i hate drew for what he did not to methough its almost destroyed mebut toher he had no right to alter kates life like that he disrupted the natural order of things she had so much to offer she was so fresh and he stole that from her her whole future please go on ellen what happened next i showed her the note i close my eyes briefly and i asked her to explain it to me i think at that point i was still hoping for some sort of innocent explanation i know that sounds pathetic but its true kate got very upset but she didnt even try to lie she told me she was in love with drew and that he loved her back it was a wifes worst nightmare really i justi couldnt process it you know but when i finally got what she was trying to tell me i saw red i couldnt believe shed deceived me that way i couldnt believe that this child had made such a fool of me how stupid id been and she wasnt talking about sex oh no she was talking about love she lost her embarrassment very quickly she was almost crowing really or i felt that she was what did you do ellen i told kate she was a fool that drew was lost in a midlife crisis that she was giving up her youth for an affair that would come to nothing i told her drew would never leave tim andthats when it happened what kate got this serene smile on her face she told me they were running away together ellen is staring at the wall as though she can still see kate before her i told her she was crazy nuts but she just kept smiling then she said im pregnant ellen drew and i are going to have a baby ellens mouth hangs slack for a few moments as though shes still in shock i dont think i was functioning normally from that point on go on i screamed at her i called her a slut and a liar she just laughed that made me so furious i couldnt stand it i got right up in her face and slapped her hard she started screaming then cruel thingsterrible things she told me i could never make drew happy that he was miserable that i was killing him then she told me why andshe was right about a lot of it ellen you dont have to go there just let me finish i have to tell it all kate knew all about my drug problem that hurt me so badly that hed told her about that she said shed been getting me my lorcet to keep drew from losing his medical license she acted like i was some kind of pathetic monster and she wasright but that only made me angrier i wanted her to shut up penn i had to make her shut up i slapped her five or six times yelling shut up shut up but she wouldnt she just laughed like a maniac thats when i grabbed her i got my hands around her throat and squeezed as hard as i could she knew then how angry i was her eyes almost bugged out of her head she tried to push me off but she didnt have a chance kate could beat me at tennis but that was touch not strength ellen shakes her head slowly remembering she went out so quickly i couldnt believe it i nod it only takes seven seconds without direct blood flow to the brain to cause unconsciousness did she fall into the water ellen says distantly but her head hit something a rusty wheel rim half buried in the sand the sound was awful like hearing a kids acl pop on the basketball court the sound did something to me it snapped me out of whatever trance i was in i dragged kates head and shoulders onto the bank and started trying to revive her i couldnt believe what id done thirty seconds before id looked at her like a ruthless home wrecker now all i could see was the little girl whod sold me lemonade on the corner when she was six i was crying hyperventilatingi was losing it penn did you have a cell phone no it was in my purse back up at the house watching ellen nowtelling her story with almost the same stunned detachment that drew exhibited when describing his discovery of kates bodyi realize that shes telling the truth ellen did kill kate only she did it without meaning to with this realization comes a memory of ellen lingering behind at kates burial to offer her condolences to jenny townsend my god the torment she must have been going through what the hell am i going to do now i wonderwhat will quentin say about this and what about drew what did you do then i ask i couldnt wake her up there was no respiration i realized then that she was probably dead why didnt you report it ellen her eyes lock onto mine silently begging for understanding as terrible as it was i just cant imagine you not reporting what happened i know i feel exactly the same way its like it wasnt me penn kate and drew had turned me into a different person but more than thati just didnt have time to think what do you mean while i was kneeling there staring at her in disbelief i heard something at first i thought it was my mind playing tricks on me but then i heard it for realsomeone coming through the woods and instinct just took over i couldnt sit there and wait to be caught i cant explain it it was a primitive reactionfight or flight who was in the woods well drew i guess i mean i know that now but in my mind he was still at his office id taken the note off his car so why would he show up there anyway the louder the noise got the more i panicked i just couldnt wait around to see im not even sure why i was so afraid exceptgod ive been wondering if part of meand i hate to admit this pennif even then part of me was afraid it was drew you know i was afraid that if drew knew id killed kate he might kill me in a rage has drew ever been violent to you never oh he slapped me once but i was in withdrawal i was slugging him like some redneck bitch he should have hit me with a hammer the pitch of ellens voice is rising and her words are coming faster though she appears to be in control i sense that shes headed for some sort of breakdown wheres the note now kates note i burned it damnlisten to me ellen i want you to be very calm all right i am calm now that youve told me all this what do you want me to do she looks at me as though ive asked the worlds stupidest question i want you to tell the district attorney she says in a brittle voice i want you to get drew out of jail i mean you have to tell the da dont you now that ive confessed if only it were that simplewas there anyone in my room when you walked in your mother was reading by the bed i asked her to leave me alone with you all right shes probably still outside im going to talk to her and then i want you to wait outside with her go to the cafeteria and have some coffee thats all right jackies here with me tell jackie to go home ellen looks confused again but then she seems to get it all right ill tell her dont tell my mother anything you just told me okay what are you going to do penn try to get drew out of jail relief smooths the lines of ellens face thank you my godits finally out i couldnt go one more minute carrying that around i force a smile and pick up my bedside phone quentin avery is staring at me like he would an insane person he has just listened to ellen elliot repeat her tale of murderor manslaughter in my bookand ellen has just walked out to rejoin my mother in the hospital cafeteria you believe that story quentin asks every word he nods slowly i do too but it doesnt make a damn bit of difference what it doesnt change anything what quentin runs both hands through his gray afro then looks down at me like a patient law professor drew elliot was just convicted of capital murder that woman is his wife nobodys going to see this as anything but a lastditch effort to save her husband from the death penalty by risking prison herself hell yes quentin snorts in frustration ive seen this a half dozen times at least mothers try it all the time and you can bet judge minor has seen it too but its the truth quentin he looks at me with something like pity are you a lawyer or a philosopher the person youd have to take this story to is shad johnson who at this moment is celebrating the biggest triumph of his career shad thinks this convictions going to propel him straight into the mayors office do you think hes going to bend over backwards to overturn that conviction throw away drew and capital murder to nail the wife for manslaughter you think hes even gonnalisten well go to judge minor then quentin throws up his hands you told me yourself that hes on shads side and you were right judge minor so blatantly favored the state that i have no doubt about the outcome of the appeal quentin lays a hand on my shoulder forget this craziness penn drews best bet is the appeals process hes innocent quentin and theyre about to enter the death phase of the trial at the least ellens story could introduce enough doubt to keep the jury from voting for execution quentin looks down at a vase of wilted flowers after about a minute he looks up his eyes filled with resolve all my experience and instinct tell me that would be a mistake with this da and judge its the wrong way to play it we should save the impact of ellens story for the appeal fuck the appeal i mutter i want a new trial quentins eyes darken im chief counsel penn this isnt your call its drews the old lawyer sighs angrily if you really want to upset him like that ill go down to the jail and put this to him i shake my head im going with you you can barely make it to the bathroom i raise myself onto my hands and sit up im going with you quentin he picks up his coat and walks to the door go back to the hotel i tell him if i havent called you in a half hour go talk to drew alone fair enough he nods once i expect him to offer an olive branchor fire a parting shotbefore he goes but he does neither after hes gone i pick up the plastic device that connects me to the nurses station and punch the call button yes mr cage is my father still in the hospital his lights on would you page him and ask him to come to my room yes sir thank you ten minutes later my father walks into my room and closes the door whats the matter he asks i need to get out of here dad youve got to help me whats going on i heard they convicted drew ellen elliott just confessed to kates murder right here in this room dads mouth opens but no sound emerges then he says you believe her i do jesus christ youve got to get me out of this bed ive got to see drew facetoface and that means going to the jail i want to overturn his conviction but quentin doesnt see eye to eye with me on that ive got to make sure drew has a chance to save himself if nothing changes between now and the sentencing phase im afraid hell be sentenced to death his son shouldnt have to go through that even if the decision is reversed six months from now dad sits on the side of my bed and surveys me from head to toe youre in bad shape penn how bad he sighs deeply your hearts sounding better but the vasculitis is still a serious problem if you start moving around youre going to have hydrostatic problems with your blood pressure you could faint very easily its not my blood vessels that are keeping me in this bed its the withdrawal i get horrible muscle cramps when i move if i stand for ten minutes i fall down and twist into a ball of agony thats what i need help with the methadones not helping not enough dad makes a clucking sound with his tongue drew saved my life i say quietly you remember i remember all right dad taps his right fist into his open palm theres one thing i could try its unethical as hell buthang on ill be back in a minute where are you going hospital pharmacy hes back in less than five minutes in his left hand is a bottle of pills in his right a mortar and pestle whats that oxycontin will that help me his eyes glint beneath raised brows were about to find out he takes out two yellow tablets drops them into the china vessel and crushes them to powder abusers crush the tablets because theyre timerelease formulas he says crushing them gives you the full dose almost instantaneously its a lot more like mainlining heroin he takes a white card from the flowers by my bed and carefully brushes three quarters of the powder into the glass of water on my bedside table drink it down i swallow the bitter mixture that ought to give you some relief how long will it last i dont know but dont do that yourself when the pain comes back just take one pill by mouth dad dons his stethoscope and lays its cold bell against the skin beneath my left nipple over the apex of my heart what are you listening for i ask my heart slowing down no with a narcotic dose like this your respiration will slow down but your heart may race to try to provide more oxygen its called reflex tachycardia the rush doesnt come as quickly as the one from blues syringe but come it does after five minutes i feel the warmth spreading from beneath my heart jesus i murmur thats it the pain is gone i flex my arms then stretch gloriously in the bed talk about a miracle drug theres a reason opium has hung around since alexander the great after a while dad removes his stethoscope and says your heartbeats within normal limits i take several deep breaths then sit up and hang my feet over the edge of the bed dad takes hold of my arms and helps me stand i feel like a new man literally only while the drug lasts he says remember that youre like cinderella at the ball right your mother would boil me in oil if she knew about this dont tell her i suddenly feel lightheaded but i mask my difficulty by sitting on the bed again are you going to the jail now dad asks yes ill drive you thats all right kelly will take me even better dad looks me from head to toe again lets get some clothes on you chapter wheres ellen now drew asks in a voice i can barely hear at the hospital with my mother drew blinks rapidly then looks down even through the bulletproof glass of the visiting window i can see hes close to breaking his skin is so pale that he looks like hes suffering from severe anemia with quentin standing behind my chair ive just recounted what happened between ellen and kate at st catherines creek to his credit quentin did not interrupt once drew youve got a big decision to make i say and its yours alone he closes his eyes quentin lays a hand on my shoulder but before i can turn a single racking sob bursts from drews throat his mouth makes it appear that hes laughing but ive seen that effect in many distraught people i wish i could shatter the glass separating us and hug him but theres no way to do that as i watch helplessly he starts banging his forehead against the window like an autistic child drew drew he doesnt seem to hear me i rise and put my mouth up to the metal vent in the window drew dr elliot quentin barks from behind me weve got to make a decision about this matter drew stops banging the glass and stares at quentin decision your wife wants us to take her confession to the district attorney he blinks in shock take ellen to shad johnson thats what she wants quentin says shes ready to confess to shad that she killed your lover i glare at him but drew is already shaking his head no he says absolutely not she cant do that quentin looks at me in triumph those are exactly my feelings doctor the da wouldnt believe her anyway neither would judge minor we have to focus on your appeal now drew listen to me i implore right now tim is at risk of losing his father at the very least youre about to be sentenced to spend the rest of your life in prison at worst youll get death by lethal injection and timmy will know thatall the time youre waiting for your appeal timmy will be suffering if you had killed kate that would be one thing but you didnt i believed you before but now i know all through your trial you told quentin that you wanted the jury to know the truth well now we know the real truth and the jury should know it too dont you see drew is staring at me as though paying close attention so i press on if we can prove ellens story your conviction will be overturned youll be a free man free to be the father tim needs what would happen to ellen shed probably serve a brief sentence for manslaughter he cant guarantee that quentin says your wife could get life for murder manslaughter i insist no jurys going to convict ellen of murder for fighting with a girl who was pregnant by her husband we could pleabargain it ahead of time there wouldnt even have to be a trial id represent ellen drew stirs at this but then quentin says youre forgetting ellens drug habit penn how kate was used to feed that habit no jury is going to buy ellen as a noble wife who lost control just once it doesnt matter drew says in a monotone quentin and i fall silent waiting for him to explain if i hadnt gotten involved with kate none of this would have happened ellen did what she did because i put her in an impossible position i wont have her punished in my place not for my weakness drew stares out of the little cubicle with absolute conviction i carry my own water guys drew let it go penn ill take my chances on appeal he stands and holds his cuffed hands up to the window i appreciate you trying but i want you to forget what ellen told you every word of it i bow my head marshaling my strength for further effort then i flatten my hands against the window like starfish and lean close to the vent you want to punish yourself fine but dont cheat timmy out of a father you owe it to him to be there for him drew lifts his eyes to mine but all i see in them now is resignation tim will be okay with ellen go home and hug annie dont worry about me anymore let it go he turns away and knocks for a deputy i search for the right words to make drew reconsider but hes gone before i find them i turn to quentin in anger and confusion the old lawyer is looking at the glass where drew stood just a moment ago thats a man right there he says havent met any like him in at least twenty years i clutch quentins upper arm youd better get him off on appeal you hear me he doesnt belong in a cell if it can be done ill do it thats what you said about the last trial quentin pats his coat flat then shoots his cuffs nobody could have got him acquitted for that girls murder not in this town not this week the deck was stacked and elliots too goddamn noble to play the game the way he would have had to for us to win even with his life at stake i say nothing its time for me to get back to the hospital as much as i hate the idea my jaw muscles are already aching and the bone pain wont be far behind quentin and i take the elevator down together doris avery is sitting with daniel kelly on a bench in the lobby talking quietly as quentin and i walk toward them my cell phone rings the caller id saysmia hello mia yes ive got to talk to you shes breathing as though shes just run a hundredyard dash facetoface where are you the county jail where are you your hospital room i thought youd be here her voice is crackling with energy but i cant tell whether that energy is the result of excitement or panic hang on i shake quentins hand then motion him onward its my kids babysitter ill call you later at the hotel quentin says we may head back out to the country tonight call me there if you dont get me at the hotel i wave to doris as quentin makes his way to the bench then i turn away and walk back toward the elevators these are digital phones mia no ones going to hear you tell me whats happened i cant its too dangerous my patience has worn down to nothing mia stop the melodrama and just tell me whats going on the silence that follows tells me ive hurt her feelings im sorry for that but theres too much at stake now for high school detective games mia its okay she says whats this about coach anders wade what about him hes been sleeping with a student my stomach goes hollow who jenny jenkins shes a junior how did you find this out she told me herself not fifteen minutes ago i was up at the school in a meeting about the senior trip when i came out jenny was waiting for me are you two friends not really she told me because ive been bugging everybody all week about marko you know trying to find you i dont get it thats what im trying to tell you this isnt really about coach andersits about marko i can hardly contain my frustration what about marko his alibi is bullshit i feel a wave of disorientation but im not sure if its oxycontin or the first hint of true knowledge his alibi for which day the wilsons or kate kate wade anders was markos alibi thatswhat im telling you coach anderss story was bullshit i blink in disbelief dont say another word mia laughs told you i think quickly do you know where jewish hill is the city cemetery meet me there as soon as you can im on my way daniel kelly and i stand on the edge of jewish hill waiting for mia in a softly falling rain beyond the twin bridges over the mississippi the sun is sliding down the last of its arc soon it will slip silently into the great river i turn and look out over the cemetery kates grave is only a low mound of mud now the faded green tent that protected it is gone and theres been no time to carve a gravestone that takes weeks in this town looking down the road that runs along the bluff i spy a solitary figure in the rain the turning angel shes not turning now but merely standing with her head bowed trying to weather the coming storm as i stare a hundred thoughts sweep through my mind ellen told me she killed kate and i believed her but if ellen killed kate why did marko bakic get coach anders to lie about his whereabouts that day could he have been doing a drug deal if so and kate happened to get killed at the same time then marko must have improvised the alibi to cover his dope deal not a murder its a plausible theory but something has been bothering me ever since i heard ellens confession its the sequence of events as she described them ellen told me that after she began choking kate kate quickly went outor became unconsciousand then fell and hit her head on the buried wheel rim but the pathologist who autopsied kate determined the cause of death to be strangulation not head trauma i believe ellen choked kate long enough to make her unconscious but probably not long enough to kill her in fact my impression during ellens confession was that she believed kate died from the blow to her head ellen must have read otherwise in the newspaper but she probably figured kate was dead before her head hit the wheel but what if ellen didnt kill kate at all what if markounknown to katewas at the crime scene too what if the person ellen heard walking through the woods after kate fell was not drew but marko bakic that would have put marko with kate after ellen left her but before drew arrived and discovered her corpse the more i think about that scenario the more convinced i become that it might be true but why would marko have been there the answer comes to me so fast that it leaves me breathless marko met kate there to sell heror more likely give herlorcet plus cyrus had cut off kates supply of pills cyruss emails to her told me that cyrus had warned kate not to go to marko in search of lorcet but what alternative did she have because marko gave me his hair so willingly at the xrave i discounted the possibility that hed raped kate but maybe he gave me that hair because he knew he would be long gone before the police could arrest him nothat would have been stupid he would only have given me the hair if he was positive it could never come back and bite him on the ass oh god i say softly marko gave me that hair because he knew i would be dead in a matter of hourslong before i could deliver his dna to anyone who mattered what is it kelly asks wait a minute the events of the past two weeks are realigning themselves in my head with nauseating speed why is the chain of cause and effect so hard to see sometimes sonny cross sticks his gun into markos mouth to interrogate him five hours later sonny is dead murdered by the asians three days later i track marko down at the xrave and question him about kates murder four hours later the asians try to kill me in the lobby of the eola hotel coincidence not likely marko and the asians have been working together all alongprobably against cyrus thats why cyrus didnt kill me when he had the chance cyrus never saw me as a threat i was after kates killer and cyrus knew he was innocent of that crime but to markoi was a genuine threatjesus at drews trial shad painted the jury a picture of marko as the mystery man whod left the other semen sample in kates vagina shad chose marko not based on evidence but because marko was conveniently missing and thus offered the most possibilities for exploitation in court but shad painted marko as kates consensual partnerand drew as the jealous killer but what if those roles were reversed in reality the rightness of this logic settles into my soul with the weight of gospel thats iti whisper if marko discovered kates prone body just after ellen fled he might well have killed her and then witnessed drew finding her body if so marko could have been the blackmailer who extorted money and drugs from drew on the night of the crime was marko the man on the motorcycle that we chased through the woods behind st stephens or was he the rifleman by the press box shooting as we tried to get through the fence another rush of images fills my brain the lone killer dressed in black who shot so many of cyruss menwho was that but marko bakic what makes me sure is that it was the same nightjust hours laterthat the wilsons were brutally murdered and they werent gunned down in the style of the asian gang but stabbed dozens of times as though in uncontrolled fury what was that attack but retaliation by cyruss crew against the man they believed responsible for the attack on their safe house marko theres your girl kelly says blue honda accord mias car is racing up cemetery road she slows by the second gate turns in and speeds along the narrow lane toward the superintendents office i watch her turn and climb the road to jewish hill what do you want me to do kelly asks give us some space but watch us i have no idea where marko is but i have a feeling that kids a lot more dangerous than i thought youre covered as kelly walks down through the stones on the back side of jewish hill mias car noses onto the grass and drives along beside the wall shielding the graves when i motion for her to stop she opens her passenger door and waves me inside i shake my head and beckon her out its raining she calls thats whats keeping me awake she nods and gets out of the car shes wearing old jeans and a royal blue st stephens sweatshirt when she reaches me she looks me up and down you look really sick are you all right ive definitely been better mia tries to smile but it doesnt work she buries her head in my chest and hugs me hard i hold her for a minute then gently separate us and lead her to the far edge of the hill where the view of the river is unobstructed why did coach anders lie for marko i ask because marko knew about wade and jenny what else did jenny say coach anders has been really stressed out for the past week and a half really stressed like talking to himself and stuff jenny didnt know what that was about but today at school she was worried he might have a heart attack or something go on jenny went into wades office after fifth period and he was crying she begged him to tell her what the matter was and he finally did it was drews conviction apparently wade had suspected for some time that marko had something to do with kates death he told jenny all about marko and the fake alibi but he was afraid to tell the police because he knew marko would blab about jenny and hed lose his job maybe even his career as a coach its worse than that i tell her wades in a position of trust as defined by statute hed be facing the same kind of sexual battery charges as drew thirty years in the pen he might even be charged as an accessoryafterthefact in kates murder mia looks at me in shock well wade told jenny hed been praying all week that drew would be acquitted when he heard it had gone the other way he lost it what did jenny do freaked out she knew she couldnt keep quiet about the marko thing shed already been going crazy herself because of the affair shes been late for her period a couple of times and she was worried that wade was sleeping with somebody else its a mess god this town has gone crazy no rules anymore mia says pulling up the hood of her sweatshirt against the rain its definitely wades fault but you can bet jenny pushed hard to make that affair happen shes been with seven other guys that i know about and shes only sixteen shes got a messedup home life im not thinking about jenny jenkins but wade anders what are you going to do penn call our esteemed athletic director is that the best thing i need to know if hes willing to admit the affair mia nods but she looks unsure why should he though i mean if he thinks marko murdered kate and if he knows how crazy marko iswhich he doeshed be crazy to tell on marko forget keeping his jobhell be worried about his life he only told jenny what happened because he thought shed keep quiet will jenny repeat her story to the police i have no idea my gut says no i have to know mia call information and get me wades home number i already have it from being head cheerleader she calls the number and hands me her cell phone wade drives the bus to all the games i had to deal with him a lot this year the phone rings twice and he never came on to you mia shakes her head i guess he had jenny taking care of him mia wade anders says in my ear hes looking at his caller id no wade this is penn cage oh what can i do for you penn i know about you and jenny jenkins the silence on the phone makes the silence of the cemetery seem a roar wade are you there yeah but i dont know what youre talking about i dont have time for lies buddy i dont even care about your affair im trying to solve a murder here there are lives at stake what lies are you talking about penn i look at mia and shake my head youve been having sex with jenny jenkins thats bad enough okay but you lied about where marko bakic was on the day kate townsend died and thats unacceptable i dont know where you heard that but its bullshit wadei say in a lockerroom voice this is me man its gone too far already you cant get out of it now dont even try drews already been convicted of murder because of you and he could get the death penalty listen goddamn it anders says anger hardening his voice i know you were helping defend drew and i know you guys lost today but dont try to blame your failure on me thats bullshit what you said jenny jenkins has problems at home real problems ive tried to help her out she may have made some advances toward me but i never touched her not inappropriately anyway and i dont know what the fuck youre talking about with this marko stuff andand thats all i have to say about it you want to talk to me again call my lawyer do you have a lawyer wade i guess i better get one if youre talking this kind of shit i start to press him further but theres no point i hang up and give mia back her phone he denied it she asks all the way the chickenshit what are you going to do i dont know i reach into my pants pocket and take out the bottle of oxycontin mia watches as i open it and dryswallow one of the tablets whats that it helps with the withdrawal withdrawal i forgot that she has no idea what i went through during the kidnapping cyrus shot me up with heroin it really wiped me out once or the whole time the whole time wow she walks over and sits on the low wall bordering the jewish graves thats the turning angel down there huh yes i never really saw it turn you know it always looked the same to me no matter which way i came from i figure its like those paintings where if some people stare long enough they see another painting hidden inside the first one i never saw those things either im too much of a realist i guess thats not necessarily a bad thing she shrugs and looks up at me so do you want to hear my great idea what idea i think i can get marko to tell me what happened on the day kate died how no one even knows where he is mia smiles wickedly his girlfriend does alicia reynolds the cops have been following her for days and they havent seen anything suspicious twentyfour hours a day i assume so i dont know mias eyes gleam with certainty alicia knows where he is im telling you if she didnt shed be a basket case but shes happy as a clam you think markos close by she nods at the rave he told me he was leaving town i think he waited around to be sure dr elliot got convicted if he is leaving hes told alicia hes taking her with him would she go with him mia snorts what else is she going to do work at the piggly wiggly she hasnt even applied to college okay lets say marko is hiding in town somewhere why would alicia tell you that youve already bugged her for a week without results because this time im going to scare her and when she talks to marko hell be scared and hell ask to see me what could possibly scare marko at this point the truth meaning coach anders recanted markos alibi that should knock markos legs right out from under him even as cocky as he is you might be right but even if markos scared why should he risk seeing you in person hell already know what the threat is no he wont ill only tell alicia that it has to do with coach anders markos paranoia will do the rest mia definitely has a career ahead of her as a lawyer if not an fbi agent why would marko believe you though all of a sudden you come to his girlfriend out of the blue to try to save him mia looks away from me and gazes out over the cemetery its not out of the blue what do you mean i know marko better than you think better than i let you think i lean down in front of her but she wont meet my eye i slept with him okay she says when he first came here it lasted about two months then i figured out he was just using me i sit beside her on the wall using you for sex yes and to get kate godcan you tell me about it mia stands and turns toward the river as though she cant bear to look at me while she confesses this when marko first got to st stephens everybody thought he was so cool he had this aura about him you know the bad boy i dont give a shit about anything aura but he was smart too anybody could see that she bends and picks up a blade of new grass he started paying a lot of attention to me i was really down on myself back then it was the start of senior year and my boyfriend had just moved to minnesota with his folks because the tire plant closed down everyone else was so jazzed about the year but i was just dead thenin walks marko it had more to do with kate than anything else even for me probably she turns to me at last her eyes wet because everybody expected marko to go for her you know me included but he didnt he wantedme or pretended he did and that made me feel really good thats probably what made me be with him if im honest about it did marko hurt you mia nods slowly not physically but he tore me up inside he really convinced me that he cared about me he told me about his childhood he said i was the first person hed trusted or let inside since he was a boy andi did stuff with him id never done before id only been with one guy before marko my first boyfriend i was so stupid god she turns away from me again look i dont want to talk about that part of it okay my point is that if i can get marko facetoface i can make him tell the truth about what happened if he killed kate i think hell brag about it to me im serious and if he does that dr elliott might go free that would only happen if you wore a wire mia she nods thats what im talking about no way you almost got killed last week you want to put yourself into a worse situation but its not she argues marko has no reason to fear me ever since i broke off our relationship hes been begging me to see him again hell believe i want to warn him penn his egos just that big i take her by the shoulders and look hard into her eyes listen to me were talking about this guy because we think he may have killed one high school girl already theres too much risk she gives me a smile filled with regret im not kate okay the biggest risk isnt that ill get killed its that ill have to screw him a wave of sickness rolls through my stomach theres something you need to know mia what quickly i tell her about ellens confession in my hospital room she listens with wide eyes and when im done she bites her bottom lip and looks toward the river you believed her she asks finally yes i do too thats exactly what kate would do in that situation i can just see it shed be so cruel to ellen then you see my point it doesnt make much sense to try to trap marko if ellen is the one who killed kate mia shakes her head i dont believe she did and you dont either but you just said i believe ellen choked her yes and if kate had died from hitting her head i might believe shed killed her but she didnt did she no i concede gratified to see that mia has followed the exact logic i did strangulation mia nods with satisfaction marko was there i mean who else could it have been you know drew you never believed drew killed her neither did i but he could have mia dismisses this with a wave of her small hand you know he didnt your gut tells you that and my gut tells me marko did mine tells me the same but can i put mia at risk again to try to prove that as i ponder this question the cell phone i borrowed from my father rings my caller id showsdon logan as the caller hey don penn ive got some information you might be interested in im listening remember we kept wondering why sheriff byrd was taking orders from shad johnson yeah i finally found out my source at the sheriffs department told me theyre celebrating like its new years over there there and the das office the sheriff told my source himself what did he say shad johnson told billy byrd that when hes elected mayor hes going to abolish the civil service commission they do all the hiring and firing for the police and fire departments i dont know how shad could do that but shad says that once the commissions gone hes going to personally hire and fire every cop in town and hes offered billy byrd the job of chief it takes me a few moments to absorb this why would byrd put himself under shads thumb like that sheriffs an elected position billy might never be elected again but shad is willing to give him the one token white position in his administration i guess billy figures if you cant beat em join em i figure ive got about ninety days left in this job im sorry don welcome to the real world brother i say nothing an idea is taking shape in my mind and it includes chief logan don what if i told you we could overturn drews conviction id ask you how what if i told you marko bakic killed kate townsend id ask what proof you have proof exists and you can help me get it are you up for that are we talking about in my official capacity quasiofficial you might say it would be important after the fact that youre the police chief i need more to go on than that can you meet me at the city cemetery now right now and bring the smallest wire rig youve got with you what the hell are you up to man saving drews ass and your job just get up here chief logan breathes steadily into the phone right now hes a man without a future at length he says one word okay im sitting in the passenger seat of don logans crown victoria kelly and mia are in the backseat kelly is checking out the wire rig logan brought over from the police station i introduced kelly to logan as a corporate security expert from houston this is old technology kelly says we use transmitters a quarter this size now do you have one with you i ask the rearview mirror not on this trip i dont know about this scheme logan says i mean i see the upside but this girls life is at risk let me play devils advocate for a minute even if marko tells the reynolds girl to bring mia to him we have no idea where that might be well be trying to follow her in two cars if she loses us mias on her own tracking device says kelly i did bring one of those in my bag of tricks its a gps model we wont lose their car okay says logan but even if we manage to stick with them marko will have all the advantages hell know the layout and the terrain the homecourt advantage i guess im saying and look at penn hes at half strength if that so its basically you and me mr kelly you look like you know what youre doing and im sure you do but just the two of us well be fine kelly says with selfassurance dont sweat that part of it im just saying if we do find out where marko is why dont i just call in backup and raid the place because then wed have a hostage situation kelly says we want mia to walk in and out of this place under her own power plus i add if we raided the place marko would just lawyer up and wed never get a thing out of him about kates murder chief logan nods dejectedly the risk to me isnt that great mia insists if it was i wouldnt go you know if marko finds that wire says kelly he wont be happy dont kid yourself about that ive thought about it but he will know there are cops all around hostage situation again says logan what then kelly looks the chief in the eye then i take him out logan glances at me i nod once you feel that confident logan asks kelly kelly smiles ive been there before chief many times thats not the outcome we want i tell logan we want a confession but if mias in real danger kelly will have no choice logan looks unconvinced id feel better with a swat team penn i glance at kelly and he gives me permission with a nod daniel was a delta force operator for eight years i explain hes worth more than any swat team we have around here hes the only reason im willing to let mia go in therewherever there is logan processes this slowly i see so basically im here to make this all legal after the fact thats right don logan looks at me what are you here for for the unexpected kelly says the chief chuckles softly i dont know if were the three musketeers or the three stooges the winners write history i murmur well know which we are after this is over aw hell says logan we dont even know if marko will take the bait hell take it says mia how do you know she smiles in the gathering dusk wouldnt you kelly laughs shes got you there chapter shes been in there awhile says chief logan its full dark on lindberg street the location of alicia reynoldss parents house mia disappeared inside an hour ago after calling alicia and saying she had to talk to her about a matter of life and death logan kelly and i have sat huddled in logans crown vic all that time trying not to let second thoughts sway our plan logan and i are in the front kelly in back the reynolds house is forty yards away you dont think marko could be hiding in the reynoldss house logan suggests thats a scary thought i reply but no i change positions trying to keep my feet moving theyve been burning badly for the past twenty minutes if mia doesnt emerge soon im going to have to get out and walk around a little if marko was in there kelly says mia would have switched on the transmitter youve got a lot of confidence in her says logan kelly nods girl has her shit together earlier tonight when logan tried to tape the transmitter to mias inner thigh she shook her head and said markos hands will wind up there i promise you hes that kind of guy then where asked the chief kelly picked up mias handbag pulled a knife from his pocket and slit open the inner lining of the bag then he slipped the transmitter into the lining while logan stared kelly took the duct tape from him made a loop of it and neatly sealed the slit hed made in the bag from the inside he made mia practice switching the transmitter on and off through the lining until she could do it smoothly by touch alone mia seemed encouraged by kellys professionalism where do you think markos hiding logan asks peering at some approaching headlights lots of possibilities i answer not taking my eyes off the lighted window on the side of the reynoldss house he could be staying in an empty house up at lake st john he could be in an empty building downtown plenty of those he could be at somebodys deer camp he could be at one of the other empty factories like cyrus the bottom line is without somebody like alicia wed never find him logan nods so hed be stupid to take the bait or arrogant kelly says good point my cell phone rings i snatch it up before it can ring again hello shes on the phone with himmia hisses shes got a special phone for calling him i think were leaving straight from here any idea where youre going no have you got the tracking device on the car mia sounds panicked we didnt know which car you were taking hers i think shit i dont know shes coming dont lose us she hangs up which car asks kelly she thinks alicias but shes not sure theyre leaving soon my heart thumps against my sternum markos still here jesus put the tracker on reynoldss car says logan visibly tense not until we know for sure says kelly itll be too late then kelly shakes his head im gonna wait if the girlfriend sees you its over soft laughter nobodys gonna see me chief kelly gets out of the car and quietly closes the door when i look out my window hes vanished whered he go asks logan i dont see him hes there just be glad hes on our side logan leans over and begins fooling with something the seat between us is littered with gear walkietalkies the receiver for mias transmitter and some of kellys gear including a subnotebook computer lying on the floor in front of the backseat are a carbonfiber sniper rifle and an mp submachine gun like the one the asian boy was carrying last week both weapons are fitted with nightvision scopes what are you doing i ask logan making sure our radios are on the same channel sometimes its the simplest thing that kills you the light under the reynoldss carport goes on here they come i say alicias white rx is parked under the carport mias accord is in the driveway markos girlfriend walks into the carport and stomps around to the drivers door of her mazda shes obviously pissed off mia walks out behind her much more slowly and opens the passenger door she glances in our direction but she doesnt seem to be in distress reynolds could lose us in that mazda logan observes kellys got it just wait the rx backs quickly out of the driveway then peels up lindberg street its motor whining as it heads into a large subdivision lying between us and the highway bypass wheres kelly logan asks the door to my left jerks open and kelly leaps in stay fifty meters back he says dont get in a hurry logan wants to hurry i can tell he keeps the mazdas taillights in sight which makes sense to me if you can see her she can see you kelly says calmly reaching over the front seat for his computer trust your gear i wouldnt trust the local police departments gear but this stuff belongs to kelly have you got them logan asks barely slowing i look into the backseat sitting sideways so i can see kelly pulls up a city map on his screen and studies it got em slow down chief logan lets the taillights ahead wink out a red dot on kellys screen moves along the streets of montebello subdivision moving toward the bypass the dot turns onto the highway and accelerates where are they logan asks nervously bypass i answer now theyre turning onto montebello melrose parkway headed downtown looks like it lots of houses before theyre downtown though woods too the red dot sweeps down the long curving lanes that cut through the thick forest between the bypass and downtown natchez it passes melrose an antebellum plantation purchased by the federal government and turned into a national historical park this part of natchez is thick with mansions as many wealthy planters estates abutted in the vicinity logan accelerates along the parkway we pass a modern bank sited in the midst of the forest then climb a hill and pass melrose theyre on main street kelly says not really i tell him thats the main street extension theyre not actually downtown yet theyre slowing down says kelly stopping now where asks logan cant tell i say thinking furiously they turned into blank space on my map says kelly ardenwood maybe i suggest fucklogan curses and suddenly i know im right whats ardenwood asks kelly sixty acres owned by a complete nut says logan son of abitch were in trouble penn mias in trouble just get us there this makes all the sense in the world whats ardenwood asks kelly what the fuck are we headed into i close my eyes and try to summon what i know ardenwood was a majestic greek revival mansion built by one of the wealthiest planting dynasties in the precivil war south one of the few to remain in the hands of its original family it stood pristine through the war reconstruction decay rebirth and then the modern city of natchez growing up around it a decade ago the property fell into the hands of an heir who didnt care to live in it an eccentric lawyer from mobile he preferred to let the house stand unoccupied slowly rotting away along with its priceless contents last year on a calm sunday morning a column of smoke began rising from the center of town by the time the fire department arrived a quarter of the mansion had been consumed a crowd of hundreds gathered to watch it burn some with tears in their eyes others cursing the man who had let this jewel of history be destroyed for no reason annie and i were part of that crowd caitlin was out of town all that remains now is a dangerous shell patched with plywood against the rain that and some frightening rumors a fucking nightmare logan grumbles filling the vacuum its an old mansion sitting on sixty acres of woods and pasture it burned last year and the absentee owner blamed a prowler hes boobytrapped the whole goddamned place since then hes got shotguns wired to the doors spikes in the yard crazy stuff hes even got nightvision equipment up there he said hes going to take care of any future prowlers himself i think marko bakic is more prowler than he could handle i murmur the guy stays over in mobile most of the time logan says thats one good thing for his sake i hope hes been there all week logan slows the crown victoria and i look left as we pass the road that leads into ardenwood i see it says kelly christ the front acreage of the property is ten feet higher than the back but behind the dark mass of land a hulking black skeleton rises from between oak and magnolia trees i can just make out the greek revival facade huge corinthian columns and an immense white capital keep driving i say kill your lights and park in the median the median here is forty feet wide and shaded by oak and pecan trees were at the edge of downtown proper but to an urban dweller this would look like deep woods logan parks then sweeps our radios the wire receiver and the tape recorder into a black satchel while kelly grabs his weapons and gets out i concentrate on walking without falling down we cross the road climb the berm we saw before then hunker down under a large pecan tree logan passes out the radios now that we know where they are he says how do we play it ive got to move up to the house to cover mia kelly says you two stay here and monitor the receiver ill have an earpiece in my walkietalkie but you dont call me under any circumstance but one whats that the girl needs saving well use two codes red and blue if i hear blue ill try to extract mia without harming bakic if you say red i kill him understood i say got it says logan why hasnt she switched on her transmitter she will says kelly shes got it down he leans his sniper rifle against the pecan tree and shoulders his mp either of you know anything about the interior layout of this place there are usually four rooms on the ground floor and four upstairs i tell him you should find a big central hall downstairs with a wide staircase then another staircase somewhere else for the servants i dont know how much of the interior remained intact after the fire even if the stairs are still there you might not be able to put any weight on them thats better than nothing kelly gives us both a questioning look the codes blue for extraction i answer red is dead says logan kelly nods dead as a hammer chief he gives me a grin then turns and starts to walk away hey i call after him he turns and looks back dont let anything happen to that girl shes pure gold kelly smiles i saw that right off dont worry take care of yourself too he waves then turns and races off under the trees chapter logan peers at me his lips pale in the dark im serious about those booby traps penn the owners lawyer informed the department so wed be aware of them fire department too he was covering his ass in case of a lawsuit fuck him it wasnt any prowler that burned this place it was an electrical fire he let everything rot and fire was the result yeah says logan as i walk over to a tree trunk to lean against it a sharp squawk makes me jump then the sound of music floats through the dark coldplay then the music fades and mia whispers to us through the receiver alicia just went inside im in the car she took my cell phone and told me to stay put she said you can get killed wandering around this place thats why marko chose it she needs to stop talking logan says marko might be watching her right now thats not why he chose this place i think aloud looking through the trees at the dark ruin this is just like sarajevothats why he chose it locals dont even think about this house anymore logan muses they pass it every day but it might as well not be here here she comesmia whispers no marko hes there i murmur hes waiting for you this is dangerous as hell says logan it could go really wrong for that girl is she even eighteen yes come on miasays a childlike voicealicias voicehes waiting you know the sound of footsteps crunching in wet gravel crackles from the receiver are you recording i ask every word this is bullshitsays alicia i dont know what you think youre doing but this is bullshit mia doesnt reply i know you want him for yourselfalicia goes on her voice warbling with fear well you cant have him i already had himmia says thats not why im here im just trying to keep him from spending the rest of his life in jail youre a liar the crunching stops theyre walking around the house says logan on grass wed have heard the porch right heresays alicia boost me up through the windowasks mia you see me dont you wood scrapes against wood the girls are climbing through the window then i hear a clatter of heels on hardwood miacries a male voice so glad to see you baby the east european accent is unmistakable give us some space aliciamarko says whatanger now uncertainty with it disappear for a while but go the silence after this command is chilling but then the sound of light footsteps comes to us not that waymarko snaps ive told you a hundred times go sit in the front room and watch the driveway youre a bastard you know that i know this thats why you love me more footsteps slowly fading marko chuckles softly so were alone finally whats the big news about coach anders i hear a soft sliding sound mia padding around the room in her running shoes this place is wildshe says gas lantern huh that sheet on the window keeps people outside from seeing it just like back homemarko replies whats the deal mia what about wade hes recanted his story whats that mean recanted he admitted that he lied for you he told the police that you werent at his house on the afternoon kate died the police are looking for you now a long pause is that so yes to ensure that marko couldnt learn the real truth of the situation logan called wade anders and warned him not to take any calls from marko logan told me anders sounded scared shitless on the phone how do you know thismarko asks from the guy i babysit for penn cage ah mr cage i heard cyrus fucked him up pretty good he did i saw him but what about the police marko its no big deal i was changing my name anyway changing your name are you leaving town thats right leaving tonight are you going to come back and graduate marko laughs wildly too late for that baby no its not if you took your exams you could still graduate with the rest of us cant do it but cyrus is dead now and penn said the asians are dead or gone back to biloxi what do you have to worry about now cyrus has homeboys the asians are a gang they believe in payback is that really it marko what do you mean i meanwhere were you that afternoon for real what afternoon dont give me that the afternoon kate died busy im a busy man okay be that way ive just been wondering about kate thats all what about her why she really died i mean i know better than anyone what a bitch she could be how manipulative she could be so at the trial the da said you were having sex with her and thats what made dr elliott kill her that he found out about it and went crazy marko laughs again no way man logan looks at me his eyes shining in the dark he didnt do it he didnt kill her penn this guy is a snake dont believe anything out of his mouth let it play out you never had sex with katemia asks i know you wanted to i didnt say thatmarko laughs softly you know me im a player youre a player all right hey dont look like that its just the way i am you know that was she better than me a gentleman never tells right i curse markos penchant for head games rightsays mia and youre such a gentleman lovely mia why do you care so much about kate i told you i just wonder what really happened to her i cant see dr elliott killing her he loved her what about you you loved kate too i hated her satisfied laughter i thought so why did you hate her so much she took you away for one thing without even trying no way you left me you gave me no choice but thats not really it kate had everything you know all the fucking advantages but she never really did anything on her own she won so many things i should have won at school scholarships and stuff even when my scores were higher that southbank scholarshipit was all political maybe she gave out some blowjobs to get that i dont know marko snickers no way youre a lot better at that than she was my ears prick up thats not funnymia says forget about kate i didnt bring you here to talk about her coach anders either i brought you here to see you no you didnt i was asking about you all week and you didnt bring me here you only brought me here tonight because youre worried well youre here now okay and im glad to see you are you yeah come over here you know how long its been since we were together do you theres a brief pause then marko says six months im impressed but you havent been lonely no you want me to be lonely maybe i dont know screw it what about you why dont you date anybody mia i have a thing for somebody he doesnt know about it he cant be with me hes with someone else a shiver goes through me she sounds like shes telling the truth about that you talking about memarko asks no retard after what you did to me come here mia hesitation why just come over here i miss you more footsteps then the voices soften you look so fucking goodmarko murmurs shitfeel good too just the same theres no conversation for ten or fifteen seconds you like thatmia asks more silence a scream of frightening intensity bursts from the receiver how can you do that how can you touch her with me right in the next room i want hermarko says get used to it alicia is sobbing then she screams again fuck you im leaving smothered laughter shell be back in an hour marko says begging me to take her back im not going with you to la either no okay maybe mia will go instead she wont either shes not that stupid a door slams are you taking alicia with youmia asks maybe just to tide me over till i get to la ill dump her there thats not very nice she doesnt have to go i made no promises marko im not a nice guy mia you know that yes i do but you still like me you dont want a nice guy you dont know what i want i know you want this hes not going to admit anything logan says he just wants to get laid at least we know hes going to la now finding marko isnt our problem now its getting him to talk logan is right we need to pull that girl out of there penn maybe i say in a taut voice i dont think the guy has anything to tell i think he was just moving some dope that afternoon thats what he used coach anders to cover your legs are amazingmarko says alicias soft in all the wrong places flabby man youre so tight inside and out am i you know you are mia giggles and the sound of it stuns me ive never heard her laugh like that are you really going to la yeah i cant believe it i never thought id miss this place but now why are you leaving tonight i hear the rustle of clothing what dont push it mia i plead softly i just wondered why you picked tonight is it because of the trial were you waiting for it to be over silence follows this question and in the silence something changes i feel it like the approach of a predator in the dark lets go somewhere elsemarko says whats he doing asks logan whyasks mia i think alicias still watching us i figured youd like that maybe some night not tonight just us tonight footsteps on wood quicker than before waitmia protests let me get my purse what for girl stuff okay theres a delay then marko says thats a cool bag let me see it my throat seals shut with fear shit shit shit hisses logan give that backmia protests thats my private stuff marko laughs and then i hear a bump hey get out of there the sound of marko rummaging through the bag is like furniture being shoved around a house should we send kelly in logan asks his voice taut get ready i tell him the rummaging stops here you go marko saystampax huh you on your period that never mattered to you before knowing laughter come on lets get some privacy he didnt find it logan breathes i cant believe it where are we goingmia asks the hair on the back of my neck stands erect mias last sentence came from the receiver at half the volume of her previous one he did find it i say you think asks logan her signals fading they walked away from the purse theyre making out i crouch and lean close to the receiver theres a background of static now there was none before the voices come in and out like someone talking on a cell phone at the edge of a towers coverage give me your radio don you sure right now he hands me his walkietalkie i press the transmit key and say blue repeat blue blue repeat blue acknowledge two clicks come back to me relief courses through me with the power of cyruss heroin kellys going in i say thank god we were crazy to send her in there logan says the three stooges after all when the explosion comes im not sure whether it blasted out of the receiver or down through the trees logan gapes at me his eyes wide what the fuck was that shotgun he shakes his head sounded like a grenade to me my skin goes cold kelly wasnt carrying any grenades logan drops flat on the ground and puts his ear to the receiver nothing booby trap i suggest logan gets up and draws his gun from his holster im going up there i want to go too but theres no way i could keep up with him should i call and ask for backup ill do that you wait for the units and show em where to go i nod but logan is already charging up the hill his gun in one hand and a police radio in the other as i stare after him one thing hits me with absolute certainty by the time backup units arrive here whatever is happening up there will be over more than anything i want to call kelly on the radio but he specifically told me not to if i can help him hell call me unless hes dead theres only one contribution i can make to this effort thought i start walking toward ardenwood the mansion is seventy yards away half concealed by massive oaks and magnolias it looks like a great ship moored in a sea of trees where is marko taking mia outside if he took her outside the signal strength would still be strong and if he went outside kelly would already have nailed him he didnt go outside so where did he go did he throw mias purse into a cabinet down a hole maybe if he did the signal would simply have dropped out not faded gradually could ardenwood have a basement most antebellum mansions dont other than halfsunken milk rooms used to keep dairy products cool those were small rooms not true basements im forty yards from ardenwood now and nothing ahead has changed its as though kelly and logan walked up this hill and sank into the earth my radio crackles to life i found the girl logan says his voice choked with emotion shes down shes been hit in the neck its shrapnel or shotgun pellets i can hardly speak is it mia i cant tell shes covered with blood i need a lightgoddamn it is she alive don shes breathing i dont think she can talk god this was so stupid have you seen kelly nothing ive got backup coming though ambulance too i walk fastermy legs wont stand a run my heart is pounding like a kettledrum and my jaw is clenched tight enough to break my teethdont be mia i pray hoarsely please god dont let it be her i push my legs faster trying to reach the house but i cant keep my balance i crash onto the ground then pick myself up so winded i can hardly stand its not her crackles logans voice its the other girl shes bleeding out penn what do i do its not mia no this girl has a fucking ring in her nose mia must still be out there relief rushes through me where are the wounds neck mostly direct pressure don keep that blood inside her i get slowly to my feet and look up at the house theyre not in there says a voice in my head theyre gone have you heard any motors don no then it hits me its not a basement its a tunnel i turn to my left and walk away from the house down the hill toward the low ground on the north side of ardenwood as the civil war began to turn against the confederacy many plantation owners realized that the northern armies would eventually sweep southward over their lands some planters had only days to prepare but othersespecially those farthest southhad months and even years a tunnel could be used to store valuables and then in the last extremity as a means of escape from marauding soldiers or even neighbors a real danger to the many natchez planters who sympathized with the yankee cause ive never toured ardenwood but i know as surely as i know my name that it has an escape tunnel marko bakic knows it too moving downhill is a lot easier than moving up in less than a minute im moving into the kudzu that lines the bayou on the north side of ardenwood the smell of organic decay blends with the reek of dead fish and fetid mud its a familiar odor the whole of natchez is threaded with bayous and creeks and i came to know them well as a boy the planter who owned ardenwood would have known them toothis bayou anyway and when he decided to build his escape tunnel in which direction would he have told his slaves to dig north dig in any other direction and theyd not only have had to dig horizontally but vertically again to come up out of the earthunless they dug dozens of yards farther than necessary no slave owner would waste labor like that especially during wartime hed have ordered his darkies to dig the shortest route to safety and that was north thirty yards of tunnel would have carried the diggers to the bayou where im standing now two feet of black water simmers between the banks with tangled tree roots reaching like fingers down into it and long beards of moss hanging from the limbs above the kudzu is too thick to move quietly along either bank and walking through kudzu is the best way to get bitten by a copperheadespecially at night pushing through the vines that choke the bank i step down into the water then begin walking slowly toward the back of the mansion the closer i get to ardenwood the higher the banks rise around me if im right about the tunnel its possible that marko and mia already came out of it but all i can do is follow my instinct i try not to splash as i slide my feet along the muddy bottom with every step i take unseen creatures scuttle among the roots on the banks and shining whips uncurl in the water and glide away water moccasins snakes have always terrified me but mia is facing a lot worse than that tensing my exhausted leg muscles against the bite of fangs i push steadily forward ardenwood towers above me now more like part of the landscape than any manmade thing if theres a tunnel leading out of that ruined shell i should be getting close to its mouth i stop in the water and listen with the focus of desperation mosquitoes buzz wet leaves rustle a turtle splashes if you make a sound ill kill you unspeakable fear paralyzes me where i stand did you hear me bitch i heard you at the sound of mias small voice hope flares within me move your ass then a splash sounds behind me much bigger than that made by the turtle if i move now marko will know im here i hear another splash and then the sound of a siren floats through the trees fuckcurses marko you lying whore run mia urges him you can get away ill just slow you down if i leave you here i leave you dead marko please shut up the sirens getting louder fast this way marko says harshly i hear more splashing closer to me this time and getting closer marko must be less than ten feet away yet hes still walking toward me he cant see me its so dark at the bottom of the bayou that only the sky is visible only night predators can see here i stand utterly still as the splashes get closer marko curses as he works along the left bank pulling mia behind himat least thats what i picture from the sounds the water washes against my leg as they pass they only miss me because theyre walking half in and half out of the narrow stream while i stand dead in the center when theyre ten feet past me i turn and begin to follow them marko is moving fast now away from the direction of the road if i dont pick up the pace hell lose me if i do he may hear me twenty feet ahead two shadows walk through a column of moonlight let in by a space in the trees mias shorter frame is easily distinguishable from markos i move faster fighting a stitch in my side how long before my legs cramp how long before i fall again and marko runs back and shoots me while i try to rise from the water as i ask myself these questions a quick series of splashes sounds behind me i dont know what they mean but it sounds like a horse galloping up the stream as i stand frozen marko passes through the column of light again moving swiftly and soundlessly back toward me in seconds he will either pass me or crash into me if he passes me whatever is behind me will be a sitting duck for him if he hits me watch out mia screams hes got a gun three feet ahead of me a black form spins out of the dark and fires a gun the flame spits away from me though back toward mia consumed by fury i crouch in the water and hold out my fathers browning marko fires again this time in my direction bracketing the bayou with bullets i cant fire for fear of hitting mia motherfuckermarko screams firing like a maniacizuzetni then his gun clicks empty with all the energy left in my body i drive my legs upward and swing the browning in a roundhouse arc metal crashes into bone and marko goes down in the water i raise the browning again and drive it down hard where i heard the splash this time i hit something softer an explosion of air hits my face but then powerful arms whip around my neck and drag me down into the water marko is suddenly above me trying to shove my head under the water ive got my gun jammed into his gut but if i pull the triggerif i kill himdrew will never be freed dont make me kill youi shout marko screams in a guttural language and the hatred in his voice sends a bolt of terror through my soul he means to kill me even if it costs him his life his jerks one hand from my neck and grabs for my gun im pulling the trigger when a thin red beam arcs across my eyes a single shot splits the night and then markos hands fly away as though they never clutched me in a death grip mia screams a powerful white light sweeps across me onto mia then goes out its kellyshouts a voice both of you get down i drop into the water but i hear mia splashing toward me stop mia kelly shouts he threw his phone she yells back theres something about his phone kelly charges past me and bellows something in the same guttural language marko used marko screams back at him shine your light over here mia says kelly steps on something in the watermarko i presumethen obeys mias order she drops to her knees scrabbles through the kudzu then jumps up with a silver cell phone in her hand i press my hands down into the mud and slowly get up kelly drags marko to his feet and binds his wrists with thin plastic restraints you okay penn i think so he lifts his radio and tells logan how to find us marko groans and doubles over did you shoot marko i ask hell live says kelly i had time to pick my shot fear is draining out of me like bad water im glad you thought so shit kelly shines his flashlight on his own face the sight of his grin beneath the blond hair makes me almost giddy with relief oh my god mia cries oh no when i turn i see her face illuminated by the faint glow of a cell phone screen look at this penn she whispers dear lord i splash over to her and look down kate townsend is looking up at me from the screen but her eyes are no more alive than those of a dead fish her face is gray and the orbits of her eyes are dotted with burst blood vessels is she dead mia asks yes says kelly leaning over my shoulder mia fiddles with the phones buttons and another photo appears this one shows kate from the knees up shes lying naked on the sand spreadeagled to show her vagina as i stare my stomach almost comes up kates head is turned to the side in the photo and both her nose and mouth lie beneath the surface of the brown water her long blond hair trails downstream mia hands me the phone then falls to her knees and vomits into the bayou i reach down and hold her hair so that she doesnt soil it while she retches and heaves i hear a sound like a hammer hitting raw meat i turn in time to see marko crumple to the ground as i help mia to her feet marko curses kelly in his own language markos lying flat on his back as though pinned there by the beam of kellys flashlight kelly stands over him with the mp covering him with lazy grace as oblivious to the words as to the barking of a dog as i watch them the echo of excited voices comes down the hill and three flashlights appear in the distance can i go home mia asks i dont want to be part of this anymore i squeeze her arm and look toward kellys flashlight you mind if i take her out of here go on he says out of the darkness get her home take logans car then swallow one more of those magic pills and do what you set out to do in the beginning what get your buddy out of jail thanks kelly for everything glad to do it as i lead mia through the kudzu kellys voice floats after me hey penn yeah before those cops get here yeah this guy could make it or he could be a statistic i stop in my tracks the flashlights are getting closer you got an opinion kelly calls mia squeezes my wrist you saw what he did to kate she says will he even go to jail he will thanks to you finding that cell phone penn kelly asks again i turn back toward the bayou i guess he makes it at first i hear nothing then kelly says no problem just wanted to give you the option i appreciate it ill see you later yeah with that i take mias hand and climb carefully out of the darkness chapter eight hours after marko was admitted to the hospital i received the most surprising call of my life police chief don logan informed me that marko bakic wanted to hire me as his defense attorney i told logan that since i had witnessed some of markos illegal acts i couldnt act as his legal counsel logan said hed told marko this but that the boy wanted to talk to me anyway all i had to do was take the elevator up from the first floor where the icu was to the fourth where patients recovered from surgery two cops guarded the door of markos private room the boy lay in his bed with steel cuffs on his wrists and shackles on his legs another chain connected the leg irons to the hospital bed marko laughed when i shuffled into the room hello mr cage you all right i nodded i didnt know that was you in the stream i just found out this morning why am i here marko i want you to be my lawyer i cant do that thats what they told me so why am i here he smiled enthusiastically i think maybe after you hear my story you decide to be my lawyer after all its not a matter of want i cant legally do it but even if i could represent you i wouldnt a look of mock sadness you dont like me no you could have shot me in the stream but you didnt i wanted to make sure youd be convicted for kates murder i understand that but you shouldnt hate me man you never walked in my shoes you dont know how i got here i know you had a tough childhood so did a lot of other people they didnt do the things youve done this amused him greatly not many people had childhood like mine thats why im herei realized he wants me to understand him he wants me to hear his story and tell him hes not such a bad guy after all ive known a lot of criminals like that marko is one of those guys who no matter what he might do will never believe it was his fault it would serve no purpose to hear him out other than to gratify my curiosity about kates last minutes but that was reason enough say what you want to say i told him i need a cigarette i need a ferrari marko burst out laughing thats good i like that i looked at my watch youve got five minutes what do you think theyre going to do to me not what you deserve probably what do i deserve the big sleep what its a book i dont think theyre going to do anything he said like a gambler assessing the odds of a meaningless game not after they hear my story this is america man ive seen the talk shows theyre going to make me a cause hes already got it planned outi thought he sees himself on the interview circuit you going to do larry king or oprah first yeah he cried laughing even harder thats it larry king live cnn people see me even in croatia the meters running marko yeah i know okay i come from srebece yeah its a little village not far from dubrovnik when i was in srebece i was nine years old i had a family sister brother mama papa everybody happy then the serbs came it wasnt like cnn okay they came at night and beat down the doors all the houses everybodys doors smashed the soldiers did what they wanted took what they wanted everything money furniture cars girls marko sniffed and looked around the hospital room he wasnt laughing anymore when they came to our house we were eating supper purple cabbage i still remember it when papa got up from the table they hit him with the butt of a rifle five soldiers we had two older guys three kids all with kalashnikovs they beat my father to the floor after him my brother karol karol was sixteen then they took my mother and sister to the bedrooms three guys papa tried to stop them so the oldest guy shot him in the stomach papa lay on the floor holding his guts in while mama and katrina screamed from the back where were you one of the soldiers held me when he let go to light a cigarette i tried to run to mama thats when the old guy stuck his bayonet into my stomach i didnt even feel it it was like somebody knocked the wind out of me like a football hit me hard in the gut marko began jangling his handcuffs the raping went on for a long time mama and katrina never stopped screaming they fought the bastards finally the soldiers brought them back no clothes blood all over them then the old guy said he wants a show he tells my brother to screw my sister you believe that karol says no he wont do it the guy says do it or i kill your mother you stinking croat now i understand he meant to kill us all anyway but theni was a stupid kid the serbs did this all over the place man especially to the muslims like the chinese in tibet what when the chinese army invaded tibet they forced the buddhist monks to kill their fellow monks because theyre nonviolent the chinese made them break their most sacred vow marko nods soberly thats it same thing so this is happening yeah mama tells katrina to help karol do sex to her do anything they say and karol is trying hes crying and doing this thing to my sister my sister was a virgin man you understand this my brother is fucking my sister on the couch papa is sobbing and screaming that the serbs are animals so they shoot him again to shut him up did they kill him marko nods completely so mama goes crazy her life is over shes watching this obscenity and she sits down on the floor and stares at the wall like an insane person for a second i think maybe its going to be okay even though im bleeding all over the place right then i hear a commotion outside and about ten soldiers run through the door theyre drunk covered with blood they go crazy right there theyre screaming at the first guys to kill us that were dogs like the muslims then one of them takes out a knife kneels down and cuts off papas head marko made a slashing motion with the flat of his hand the cuffs rattled he holds out papas head to my mother and orders her to nurse it put her breast in its mouth yeah she ignores the guy so he shoots her it was a blessing believe me then they force katrina to take papas head shes crying but she does what they say they all laugh and then someone says its time to get back to the trucks the old guy looks at karol says goodbye dog and shoots him in the chest then they grab katrina and drag her outside thats the last time i ever saw her and you the last guy to leave stuck me again in the balls this time then he left me there to die i tell you man i dont know how i made it or why marko nodded vehemently thats right why you know theres no answer to that i guess not anyway they moved me to a hospital in sarajevo they thought they were helping me in some ways it was better there other ways worse but i learned to survive and i got some payback hows that me and some guys we found some serb girls later on one or two at a time you know when we finished wed say tell them its for srebece why did you do that marko looked confused because thats what they did to us to our women the girls you raped didnt do anything to you more confusion they were serbs man why didnt you target soldiers instead a sly smile we did that too we fucked some people up i walked to the window and looked out at the bypass cars were passing outside the people inside them oblivious to most of what had happened in their town last night unable even to imagine the horrors that marko bakic had endured in his hometown what about kate i asked markos face closed thats something else man that was an accident what do you mean i always liked kate more than that really she wasnt like the other girls she had something you had a thing for her yeah from the time i first got here but i was cool about it kate was that type you know if you let her know you wanted her she wouldnt look at you so i waited and you slept with mia burke another sly smile you know about that yeah mias hot too but kateshe had a dark side i liked but she was dating that stupid football player anyway i watched her for a long time i was starting to think id never get my chance but then she came to you for the pills yeah you thought you had her then marko nodded cyrus fucked that up so what did you do i kept waiting i know how to wait man you learn to wait for water you can wait for anything i followed her sometimes i even tracked her cell phone at the end like cyrus marko laughs cyrus never tracked her phone i just told the cop that to get him off my back so sonny cross never got the truth from marko not even with hisdirty harry tactics you were trying to cut cyrus out of the trade werent you you and the asians think so you shot those people at cyruss safe house you were trying to kill him marko cant conceal his pride thats why cyruss guys went to the wilsons to get payback the arrogance vanishes replaced by a terrible bitterness lets get back to kate i say quietly were you following her on the day she died marko raises his cuffed hands and scratches at the bandage on his shoulder yeah when the guys picked me up at coach anderss house i ran home and checked my computer i got a fix on her and got them to drop me down by the creek not too close though they left me in front of a friends house i didnt want them telling cyrus what i was doing i went in from sherwood estates not pinehaven how did you find her i asked remembering ellens version of the story i wasnt sure exactly where she was i figured she was jogging by the water but it had been raining so i wasnt sure i went down there to see what did you find kate man her legs were lying in the water and she was bleeding from the head was she wearing clothes sure tennis dress and a top yeah what did you do markos eyes were fixed on the foot of his bed he seemed to be reliving what had happened next in his mind i tried to wake her up i couldnt tell if she was breathing or not i didnt think so and then his eyes suddenly sought out mine imploring me for understanding i got to looking at her she was wearing that skirt and it started getting to me kate was hot man she reminded me a little of my sister more than a little really what did you do i decided to take a look i pushed up her shirt i squeezed her tits a little bit she didnt move but she was still warm you know i nodded as though i understood his logic it made me hard touching her so i pulled down her skirt and went inside her jesus it took some work man she was dry like sandpaper but after a while i got in there a wave of heat passes through my face marko shrugged what would you do man like i said she was warm it was just like the real thing only she wasnt moving some chicks are like that anyway you know i dont know what happened to kate i think she hit her head on something what happened next was she dead at that point thats the thing man i did her for a whileboth ways you know but when i was almost finished suddenly her eyes opened up boom she was looking at me it freaked me out because she started screamingloud i told her to be quiet but she wouldnt shut up she tried to throw me off her but i was so close man i just had to finish you know that feeling sure i said trying hard not to climb onto the bed and strangle him i put my hands on her neck just to shut her up right not to kill her or anything just to keep her quiet until i was done i understand she wouldnt shut up so what happened nothing really marko squinted as though to see the memory more clearly after i came her eyes were closed again i think she just died man i dont think i even killed her i think whatever happened before i got there killed her unbelievableand then i heard someone coming moving fast i thought maybe it was a deer but when it got close i could tell it was human i ran across the creek and got down behind some bamboo who was it the doctor elliott he ran up to kate and fell down on his knees he pounded on her chest then started pumping it like they do on tv but it was no use she was gone and then marko made a derogatory sound he was crying screaming at the sky i saw that all the time in the city sarajevo yeah after a sniper hit somebody people cursing god wailing screaming at heaven but you know what not one person ever got up and walked again god didnt save any of them whats your point no point man thats the point i realized id heard enough the rest of the story didnt interest me i knew without asking that marko had been the blackmailer on the motorcycle that first night exploiting what hed seen that afternoon to get more money and drugs i didnt know whod helped him but neither did i care enough to give him the satisfaction of asking marko would soon be convicted by a jury and his fate would be up to those twelve people it was time for me to put it all behind me i turned away from him and walked to the door hey he called you leaving yes wait up i turned back what is it did you fuck mia i stared at him in disbelief come on man did you no he laughed softly too bad shes good i wanted to break down the steel iv stand and shove it up his ass but i didnt i said im sure thats true and one day someone a hell of a lot luckier than you is going to spend his life with her somebody who earned her he seemed to consider this then he said maybe so but shell always remember me i walked back to him then fighting the urge to beat him into a puddle of wet bone and tissue you know what you should be asking yourself what what your mother and sister would think of you if theyd seen what you did to those serbian girls and what you did to kate markos eyes radiated more hatred than id seen in a long time and with that i left his room two days after i left that hospital room judge minor released drew from jail under a jnovjudgment notwithstanding the verdict the day after that a special grand jury indicted marko bakic for the murder of kate townsend just as in drews case this meant that marko had to be transferred into state custody deputy tommy burns and another deputy picked up the prisoner from the city jail and drove him downtown to the sheriffs department billy byrd himself stood on the steps waiting to greet his new charge the deputies dragged marko from the cruiser and jerked him erect in his irons whereupon marko flipped sheriff byrd the bird and gave him a glare both scornful and defiant the sheriff had opened his mouth to reply when a grain deer slug tore through markos heart showering the sheriff with bright red blood the rifle shot was heard all over town i was standing in my backyard on washington street playing with annie when i heard what i thought was an electrical transformer exploding from the direction of the mississippi river two minutes later my cell phone rang caitlin had witnessed the shooting from thirty yards away she said it looked like the bullet had come from one of the taller buildings near the sheriffs department both sheriff byrd and chief logan believe that the asians murdered marko to prevent him from ratting out the drug traders to save himself the joint task force issued a statement supporting this theory adding a postscript that if the asians hadnt done it then cyrus whites crew probably had that was the story that caitlin printed in theexaminer but when i asked drew where he was when marko died he told me he had taken the day off to stay home with ellen mending fences he said for tims sake tim of course was in school at st stephens a day later i managed to ask ellen the same question and she backed drews story to the hilt but as ellen spoke i saw a profound disconnect between her mouth and her eyes and i knew what that disconnect meant ellen elliott will do whatever she has to do to save her family after all she has her own guilt to carry but in her soul she knows what i know nowthat marko bakic the boy who brutally murdered kate townsend died by the hand of the man who loved her above all others and that is as it should be chapter three weeks later on a beautiful evening in may i mounted a stage set up at the center of the st stephens football field and took a seat beside jan chancellor much had happened in the three weeks following markos death and thanks to caitlin most of it happened in public view as a result of that publicity senator brent few the speaker scheduled to appear at st stephens graduation begged off pleading health problems the senior class asked if i would be willing to speak in his place i told them i would be proud to do so three hundred chairs have been set up before the stage and all but a few are filled this is impressive as the senior class numbers only twentyone souls when i graduated we had thirtytwo but natchez was larger then i know most of the faces in the crowd students and their families mainly two special chairs stand empty in the seniors section symbolic places for kate townsend and chris vogel theyve almost disappeared under the bouquets of flowers left there no chair was left empty for marko bakic for the senior class marko is like john lennons assassin he who must not be named of the bright faces shining between the royal blue caps and gowns one shines brighter than the rest for me mia burke just after my commencement address mia will give the valedictory speech she was scheduled to speak before me but i asked jan to give mia the last word tonight on the night we learned that kate had been murdered mia told me she had some things to say to her class and to the parents tonight i look forward to hearing them annie is sitting with my parents in the third row shes with my parents because caitlin is not here tonight last week she flew north again not to boston this time but to her fathers house in wilmington north carolina we decided that shes not ready for the obligations that would come with marrying me our parting was difficult but mostly because of annie caitlin wanted a private conversation with annie to break the news but i decided we should speak to her together i still love caitlin and i trust her motives but i would not take the slightest risk that something might be said which would leave annie blaming herself for caitlins disappearance from our lives as jan chancellor begins her welcome remarks i scan the football field and surrounding bowl it seems impossible that drew and i chased marko across this field on a fourwheeler just a few weeks ago but much of what happened after that night is hard for me to believe yet happen it did and the consequences of those events are still unfolding at two this afternoon a secret meeting was held in the district attorneys office present were shad johnson myself and quentin avery the atmosphere was tense for shad had not behaved gracefully after judge minor overturned drews conviction in fact shad made a personal crusade of trying to convict drew of sexual battery which could have resulted in a sentence of forty years for two weeks i sweated blood trying to think of a way to thwart shads mission i couldnt do it drews medical license had already been suspended by the state authorities but word had leaked down from the board chairman in jackson that drews future medical career would depend on the disposition of his legal case it was during this seemingly hopeless period that quentin avery earned his enormous fee through the tangled grapevine of the local black community quentin somehow learned exactly how shad had discovered ellen elliots drug addiction and also kates part in it shad had not done this by brilliant deductive reasoning or even by lucky accident three days after my kidnapping he had received an express mail package containing the leather portfolio stolen with my car on the night of the attack at the eola hotel the portfoliowhich still contained kates flash drives markos hair and kates diaryhad almost certainly been sent to shad by the leader of the asian gang in biloxi the gang leader had probably been prompted by marko to send the package in an attempt to cement drews conviction for kates murder regardless of who sent the portfolio the materials inside it gave shad enough leads to discover not only kates drug activities on ellens behalf but also cyrus whites obsession with kate yet shad never informed quentin that he had any of this in his possession just as quentin had predicted at the outset of the case shad had broken the rulesand the lawin his effort to ensure victory at trial to withhold such evidence constituted felony obstruction of justicegrounds for disbarmentand quentin was ready to go to war to accomplish that end with some considerable anxiety i sat quentin down and explained my view of the situation that shads greed had given us a magic bullet that could keep drew out of jail but quentin did not lightly abandon his persecution of shad johnson it took a campaign of attrition by me and my father to persuade quentin that serving drew elliott to the best of his ability was a higher moral duty than ridding the city of shadrach johnson in the end quentin relented when i left shads office this afternoon i was in a state close to shock quentin had stripped more than the proverbial pound of flesh from the district attorneys backside he had verbally flayed shad shaming him to a degree i thought impossible quentin also extracted from shad a written promise not to seek the office of mayor in the special election this seemed a little much and i wondered if quentin had done this because he was considering a run for mayor himself but when i asked about this after the meeting the civil rights legend just laughed this town needs an idealist he said not a cranky old pragmatist like me as i sit watching the graduation crowd jan chancellor introduces melissa andrews the salutatorian a tall girl with long red hair melissa reads from her text without once looking up but she speaks with genuine emotion about the pain of leaving the cocoon of her class and her anxiety about entering a world where friends and parents will not be there to prop her up my gaze roams over the attentive faces then wanders to the surrounding forest spring has truly arrived and with it a desperately needed air of renewal the evening breeze blows cool and steady and the trees encircling the stadium are alive with the pale green leaves of new growth if natchez were like this yearround people would move here by the thousands suddenly jan chancellors voice breaks into my reverie a distinguished attorney who switched careers in midlife to become a bestselling author but to the people in this town he will always be the tight end on st stephens championship football team ladies and gentlemen penn cage i stand and hug jan as i walk to the podium she showed some courage over the past month unlike some board members i could name lawyers are notorious for being addicted to the sound of their own voices but as i look out over the crowd i recall my basic mantra of public speaking be sincere be brief be seated using a few notes scrawled on a legal pad this afternoon i tell the seniors the things one usually tells graduates in a commencement speech that their time has come that the road out of this bowl no longer leads to natchez but to the wider world that the world is theirs for the taking if they but have the courage to reach out for it i also tell them some harsher truths that the world they will find beyond the borders of mississippi looks very different from the one that nurtured them to this point that the whites among them might soon find themselves the targets of prejudice for a change that in the real world it is often who rather than what they know that will gain them advancement im candid about the fact that their education has not been as thorough as it might have been but i also promise them that the emotional grounding provided by their multigenerational families will more than compensate for this though its not in my notes i also pass along one lesson that has served me well in both careers as a southerner you will constantly be underestimated by the people you deal with and this tendency can work to your advantage learn how to use it having departed from my notes i pause for a moment and look down at mia in the first row shes watching me as though she expects something profound to fall from my lips some inspiring conclusion to my thusfargeneric speech but i dont have any pearls of great wisdom what i do have is a sudden realization that leaves me profoundly shaken these kids are not coming back not the best of them anyway as i told caitlin over dinner at the castle the parents in this beautiful and unique city are raising their children to live elsewhere somehow we have let natchez slip into such a state that we cannot offer our brightest students jobs to return to even when they want them and that is unacceptable i will not raise my daughter in a town that offers her no future with this simple realization comes certainty im running for mayor i leave the podium after an unremarkable conclusion but as i walk to my seat a new energy is building inside me i know where im going now jan walks to the podium again and introduces a girl whom she refers to as one of the brightest individuals she has ever had the privilege to know mia burke mia rises from the first row and walks uncertainly up the steps to the stage she usually walks with such selfpossession that i wonder if shes been drinking if i recall correctly i had a bit to drink myself on my graduation night mia has to pull down the microphone to reach it with her mouth theres a shrill whistle of feedback then silence mia holds up a sheaf of paper and speaks in a conversational tone i wrote a whole speech for tonight ive been thinking about it all year long but now looking out at you guys i dont want to read it this class has been through a lot this year maybe too much we lostso much we lost two great people and we lost the last shreds of our innocence im not sure we gained anything other than experience but i guess its not up to us to choose when we learn what life is really about she looks down at the podium seeming to gather herself i know a lot of parents have been freaked out by what they learned about our class in the wake of kates and chriss deaths of course parents in every generation have been shocked when they somehow learned the truths of their childrens lives thats the way of the world but now in this time and this generation i think theyre right to be shocked im part of this generation and im shocked we seem to have reached a point in our society where every form of restraint has been broken down or stripped away there are no rules anymore in the nineteen sixties our parents fought to achieve political freedom and liberation of the self well now weve got it weve got about as much freedom and liberation as anybody can stand ive had a computer in my bedroom since i was five years old ive had access to basically all the information in the world since i was twelvenot in a library but right at my fingertips at the slightest whim i can view images of just about anything that piques my curiosity and i have but am i better for that i dont know dont get me wrong i like freedom but you can have too much of a good thing at some point you have to draw a line agree on some rules or all you have is chaos anarchy so i guess what im saying tonight is this thats our job guys our class i mean and our generation to figure out where freedom stops being a blessing and starts being a curse our parents cant do it they dont even understand the world we live in now maybe that job cant even be done for a society maybe its an individual decision in every case but it seems to me that humans given absolute freedom dont do a very good job of choosing limits mia sighs deeply then gifts the audience with one of her remarkable smiles natchez is a good place to be from but now its time for us to go i wish i could say something inspiring but i guess this isnt that kind of speech i am hopeful about the future i do believe i can change the world i just know that it wont be easy she waves to her class with one long swing of her hand then walks back down the steps to join them theres a smattering of applause but it soon dies no one knows what to make of mias honesty in a rather subdued conclusion to the ceremony holden smith passes out diplomas to the graduates after hes done the seniors toss their caps into the sky as one putting the stamp of conventionality on the proceeding at last i walk down the steps into the milling throng and make my way toward mia shes surrounded by classmates and parents so i stand a few yards away and wait a few moments later i see drew and ellen moving toward me through the crowd a few people gawk as they pass but most simply go about their business to my surpriseand my satisfactionnatchez remains the eccentric southern town in which people who have caught their spouses in bed with others still attend the same pilgrimage parties and graciously pour punch for mortal enemies ellen is wearing a designer dress but she looks pale and drawn shes currently participating in an outpatient rehab program overseen by a local physician drew is seeing a psychiatrist with her in jackson every three days hes been working out his grief by doing writing exercises which he says read more like an elegy to kate than anything else he told me that the hardest thing for ellen to deal with has been something i only recently recalled from the autopsy report kate died from strangulation but the bleed in her brain caused by hitting her head on the buried wheel would probably have killed her had she not been strangled before that could happen so while ellen did not in fact kill kate she did inflict what would have been a fatal injury she only escaped prosecution because no one in the world knew that she had been at the crime sceneno one that is but the unholy pentangle of drew me my father mia and quentin avery and none of us will ever speak of it after the last of mias wellwishers drifts away i signal drew to join me beside her great speech i say hugging her to my side she looks sheepish not so great better than mine anyway thats true were you on drugs or something i was a little preoccupied she suddenly realizes that drew and ellen are behind her she turns and gives them an awkward wave hey i enjoyed your speech ellen says very much to the point thanks an uncomfortable silence follows this exchange so i break it drew has something to tell you mia really he nods and smiles at her i want to thank you for everything you did for me you already thanked me that day i saw you in planet thailand ellen smiles as though bursting with a secret we wanted to thank you in a more tangible way buti already got your present the jewelry box mia nods ellen laughs and drew actually blushes mia he says today i went down to my brokers office and opened an account in your name mia nods but im not sure she understands what drew is saying the excitement of the day giving her speech thoughts of the party laterall this is more than a little distracting while drew tries to find the right words a girl runs up and hugs mia then squeals and races off to someone else in my name mia asks i dont understand its a college fund drew explains to help pay your expenses at brown mia reddens as understanding dawns i dont know what to say ask him how much money is in it i tell her oh no my god anythings fine im serious you shouldnt have done it really ellen takes mias hand and looks into her eyes theres a hundred thousand dollars in it mia and you deserve every penny mia blinks in disbelief then her free hand starts to shake and a tear escapes her eye ive got to tell my mom oh godoh my god she leans forward and hugs drew and ellen at the same time do you mind if i find my mom and tell her go ellen says happy graduation mia walks away dumbfounded as her petite form recedes into the crowd i follow her with my eyes just before she disappears she turns back and finds me her gaze is long and open her eyes speaking to me as though theres no space between us i raise my hand and open it in a motionless farewell very slowly she shakes her head and mouths the words thank you and then shes gone when i turn back to drew and ellen only drew is there hes watching me with an empathy that raises the hair on my neck you understand now he says dont you i look away but he takes my arm and squeezes hard maybe a little i say softly he shakes his head then puts his arm around me lets find the kids we stroll through the familiar crowd two former golden boys tarnished by the years a few people smile and shake our hands but more nod in silence as we pass thats all right i can live with my choices drew will have a harder time living with his but what do people want him to do kill himself look he says pointing thirty yards away two slim figures about four feet tall walk slowly along the track that runs around the football field one is annie the other tim you think maybe drew says i smile id be okay with it acknowledgments i would like to
